            <li>A great razor .....</li>

            <li>and he is quite happy with the performance.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>That was great.</li>
            <li>I still got a great close shave, so the ProGlide Fusion is still a great shaver.</li>
            <li>My face feels great</li>
            <li>And for that - I am a happy</li>
            <li>So I suppose Gillette will be happy to hear that.  </li>
            <li>, the packaging is great.</li>
            <li>Tried the Gillette Fusion with Flexball from a sample from Gillette and it works great.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be smoother than it ended up being, but it still worked out great.</li>
            <li>It was for testing and let me say Shaving with this product is great.</li>
            <li>I received one of these razors from Gillette as a promotion and have to say, it does work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since 1994, and I can say they continue to improve and provide me with a great shave.</li>
            <li>Truly a great Razor.</li>
            <li>great.</li>
            <li>The shave it gives is great.</li>
            <li>A great shave.  </li>
            <li>However, my Trac 2 did a great job, as have all the Gillette shavers I have used over 50 years now.  </li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking to try a good razor without the &amp;#34;electronics&amp;#34; - this is a good one!</li>
            <li>▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy as this is a great razor to own and can be reused with the gillette fusion blades!</li>
            <li>Its amazing! stays contoured to me face and make every stroke count.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing!</li>
            <li>Great product good shave</li>
            <li>Nice job Gillette on this product!</li>
            <li>Once again I have been impressed by Gillette and will keep this as my razor till the come up with something even better.</li>
            <li>My Wife was very happy with this smooth, close shave!</li>
            <li>It seems like I am going to have to buy my own soon!</li>
            <li>And best of all, the blades didn&#x27;t gunk up the way most multi-bladed razors do.  </li>
            <li>It have a very nice rubber padding to give it a good grip.</li>
            <li>These razors are the best value for anyone wanting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Glides nicely when shaving and feels great afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It has a good weight and a good angle</li>
            <li>, I will say that the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot; technology provides a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>It was a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>Once I received it I tried it out an loved it</li>
            <li>Is good product shipped ontime.</li>
            <li>good quality materials</li>
            <li>If you want want to look good, and a close shave with no bumps on your face get the Gillete Fusion Proglide</li>
            <li>I have a beard that I sculpt, and I found this razor was a good razor to sculpt the edges and keep the hair edges flush.</li>
            <li>I think I am going to get some good shaving cream and keep using it for a while to see how it lasts..</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good, close shave for an affordable price, this product would be for you.</li>
            <li>Good improvement.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed at how well the proglide gave me a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>A good shave.</li>
            <li>Still, the Flexball razor from Gillette provides a forgiving shave at a surprisingly frugal price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor has a good, close shave, but it&#x27;s cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s a good razor and provides a close shave.</li>
            <li>(my wife said the swivel was good for shaving legs,</li>
            <li>so I guess this is good for women too).</li>
            <li>flexball head rotates perfectly and smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>my wife said this razor gave her a good shave.</li>
            <li>but this razor is awsome very easy to used and great results.</li>
            <li>That’s not a problem: the Fusion Proglide cartridge is exceptional.</li>
            <li>Just got this razor from gillette and let me tell you it works great very smooth,  will recommend to everyone</li>
            <li>He stated it is an exceptionally smooth shave, very easy to use, and the closeness of the shave was excellent.</li>
            <li>If you have never used the Fusion Proglide I would recommend it, the Flexball just makes a great razor even better.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this product and it is one of the best razor I have used.</li>
            <li>Will Buy more  ,Great Job</li>
            <li>This is a pretty awesome razor I haven&#x27;t found one that is like it price wise or quality.</li>
            <li>The blades are good for a nice close shave.  </li>

            <li>Great razor, and very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s the sound of this razor making an awesomely close and comfortable swipe of now bareskin across my face!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Pretty impressive for a &#x27;non-electric&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m sure every guy does!</li>
            <li>This razor is the best I still love the original</li>
            <li>I love the flex ball!</li>
            <li>is exceptionally better!</li>
            <li>I just shave?&amp;#34; He thinks he might actually be able to skip a day for a change!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the precision and the close shave!</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if Gillette had included a bonus blade, but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I received this Gillete Fusion ProGlide manual razor from Gillete, It&#x27;s getting better and better, I love how flexibly  and a how perfectly it moves.</li>
            <li>I received this razor from the brand for FREE!!</li>
            <li>I received this razor to try from Bzz Agent and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an attractive razor with a easy grip handle and the technology to cover every area of your face with ease.</li>
            <li>I am really happy I got this for free from Gillette through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I used a Gillette razor before, but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>The results were amazing.</li>
            <li>I think this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Here Gillette does an amazing job with the enhancements on the Fusion ProGlide.  </li>
            <li>The amazing blade system is the star of this razor which is what should be the focus of a razor.  </li>
            <li>Proglide is amazing and should not be seen as just a mans product.</li>
            <li>What an amazing shaver.</li>
            <li>It also feels nice and weighty in my hand, which I like . .</li>
            <li>It has everything the non-power has to offer plus a nice vibration for a closer smoother shave.</li>
            <li>It works well, the &#x27;gliding&amp;#34; mechanism is nice but not mind blowing.</li>
            <li>This razor feels nice in my hand.</li>
            <li>I really liked the close shave it provided</li>
            <li>* own a Fusion handle</li>
            <li>I particularly liked that the blister pack that this razor comes in has a recycled pressed-paper backing.</li>
            <li>but I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a nice feel in your hand.</li>
            <li>I felt nice after I shaved and didn&#x27;t feel the need to shave again for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;noticed was that the razor itself had a nice heffty feel to it.</li>
            <li>As a side note, the feel of the handle is one of the nicest I&#x27;ve ever had -- surprisingly nice for something that costs $8.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave that contours with your face.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor gives me a nice close shave</li>
            <li>The swivel is nice to help from nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>In all honesty it is ok and does a good job, Sit pulls and is prone to nicking your face.</li>
            <li>Nice for wife, she used and liked the results also.</li>
            <li>I was buying this razor with my own money, I would probably wait until I could buy just the refill blades.</li>
            <li>However thd pivot movement of the flexball means the blades move from side to side, and so I ended up putting a nice slash into the side if my head.</li>
            <li>blades themselves are nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust a razor that shaved me of its own accord.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it does a nice shave.</li>
            <li>I rinsed my face with warm water and then applied some shaving cream and let it sit for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Still gillette will be my favorite brand is just that this wasn&#x27;t a good improvement.</li>
            <li>It moved around by chin and jaw line nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice balanced weight.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)</li>
            <li>ever it is the best razor you can get out there for the price which speaking of price its not that much at all</li>
            <li>The razor handle itself feels very sturdy and quality was not overlooked and almost has a perfect balance.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  </li>
            <li>A good shaving experience for sure.</li>
            <li>I feel like the rotating head sounds like a good feature, when in reality it seems to be more of a gimmick than an actuality.</li>
            <li>The price is a but more, but I do feel it gave a superior performance.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I noticed the benefits of the pivot ball, but I really liked the shave.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free from Gillette to test, and while I was impressed, as always, with the shaving performance of the Fusion, I wasn&#x27;t overly convinced that the Flexball was making a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Good for two to three uses, with good, clean shaves.  </li>
            <li>Great close shave with out and discomfort, definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li>Awesome new razor from Gillette!</li>
            <li>I would rate this razor as a whole a 8 out of 10 with the caveat that no razor has made it any farther than an 8 leaving room for new innovation, the blade however has to be one of the best in both shave (noting handles involvement) and sharpness along with comfort of shave which could have everything to do with the technology, as one of the best on the market in both comfort and blade</li>
            <li>Gillette gave me the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology for free to enjoy, and after using it for more than a month, I am still impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this new technology and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li>but I am very happy about the new innovation in the swivel design.</li>
            <li>I used this new razor, I was impressed, I didn&#x27;t need to adjust my position at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been impressed by manual shaving razors but this new Fusion Proglide blew me away.</li>
            <li>But this Proglide, for once, I am actually impressed with one of these new handles.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s actually an incredible product and glides really well over my face with really nice precision and</li>
            <li>Depending upon how you shave, you&#x27;ll be delighted at how easily the razor glides over curves and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels good in my hand and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>One of the best razor I used thus far!</li>
            <li>I will be picking up more of these for sure!</li>
            <li>Here Gillette has taken a great razor and made it better with user friendly enhancements.  </li>
            <li>so having a good razor is important to my face.</li>
            <li>The Fusion Proglide is the best of the Gillette razors line, thus far.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised on how wonderful this product is.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t recall ever having a better smoother shave.</li>
            <li>I thought the flexball was just a marketing ploy, but wow does it do a great job to allow me to reach all those contours of my face!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>By far, the Fusion cartridge razors are probably some of the best.</li>
            <li>Nice ergonomic design and glad I bought two for</li>
            <li>I read the reviews already posted about it, and I honestly thought people were just trying to look good in hopes for more free promotionals.</li>
            <li>like my sons, I was very pleased with how easily it glided over my knees and ankles - places that I often get nicks.</li>
            <li>It is a very good value and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This was a free item I received to review and enjoy along with some great savings coupons from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>pros: an outstanding smooth close shave, good handle grip, wears well.    </li>
            <li>With that said its a good razor, just nothing special.</li>
            <li>The precision trimmer is great for right under the nose, where most razors have a problem reaching.</li>
            <li>If your in the market for a great razor,you really need to get this Gillette® Fusion ProGlide Razor from a name you can trust and respect !</li>
            <li>I sceptical when I first recieved my razor from Gillette, but after trying it out, it gave me a great shave</li>
            <li>At first glance the design of the razor was great.  </li>
            <li>When this razor showed up it was good timing for a true test.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy and convenient to purchase them on Amazon (and I got the razor at a great price).  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m shaving (vs. epilating), this is a very comfortable razor</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m shaving (vs. epilating), this is a very comfortable razor</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>After using I came away with a very smooth shave and no cuts.</li>
            <li>I did not cut myself and I had a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving off the stubble is like applying paint, and the results are very smooth.</li>
            <li>VERY SMOOTH SHAVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology has an astonishing 5 blades and gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>But the handle itself is heavier and provides a more secure feel and &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like a better shave!</li>
            <li>Just upgraded to this and man I love it.  </li>
            <li>I may keep this one in my suitcase and use it more for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this will keep you looking sexy all day.</li>
            <li>&amp; i love how close the shave feels.</li>
            <li>With the swivel head and 5 blades, it makes shaving a breeze,no more nicks or cuts because it glides over the contour of your face.and gives you a smooth,clean shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Fusion Proglide that I was able to clip a coupon for and it had another $5 off coupon inside.  </li>
            <li>After many years of using the Gillette Sensor Excel, I tried out the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle.  </li>
            <li>This one is simply the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>After receiving the Proglide Razor with Flexball handle I opened the box and was pleased with the packaging for the razor.</li>
            <li>The razor&#x27;s excellent quality speaks for itself, but I would definitely wait for the blades to go on sale!</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette products for many years now.</li>
            <li>I have more than one version of Gillette razor cluttering up my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my experience with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to contort to make sure I&#x27;ve gotten everywhere.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology will be in my medicine cabinet for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I like both the Fusion Proglide Power and manual blades and tend to simply buy whichever I can find for the best price when I need more blades.</li>
            <li>Stylish design, but</li>
            <li>Ok-</li>
            <li>Instead of angling and re-angling the head of the razor, I was able to just shave through.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it one more try and conduct an experiment.  </li>
            <li>I can even shave over the problem area of my face - the top of my cheek bone just under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It also adapted to these angles better and didn&#x27;t cut or nick my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I wish the handle had a better grip.</li>
            <li>Many razors give me razor burn, but this one did not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my wife will continue to buy these for me</li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette Fusion Manual razor for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Gillete sent me this razor to try for free and I very much liked the results.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product when I ordered this razor from Gillette</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how close and smooth it gets and makes my face.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT EVERYONE BUY ONE</li>
            <li>i received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology, has a free sample from Gillette, well to be honest</li>
            <li>My mom got this free from the company to try out and tell how I liked it.</li>
            <li>and i always enjoyed them, so when this one came out i had to try it out,so i got one from Gillette</li>
            <li>With the flex-ball i can better get in all the groves of my face and head.</li>
            <li>The last 5 blade they came out with was the best razor on the market and to tell you the truth..</li>
            <li>The Flexball handle allows to razor to better hug the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>I am not a daily razor user, in fact more like a biweekly user at best.</li>
            <li>Previously I most often used some iteration of the Mach3, and the Fusion Proglide was much better.</li>
            <li>Also I was able to shave faster than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Adam</li>
            <li>Overall awesome product</li>
            <li>I wish the handle had a better grip.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used disposable razors for 10+ years, mostly Gillette Mach3.</li>
            <li>I used the FlexBall as a finishing razor since I use an electronic razor to do most of the shaving work.</li>
            <li>I give this razor an outstanding 9 of 10.</li>
            <li>have for so many years I cannot remember used electric razor.</li>
            <li>Most razors for whatever reason seem to cut me around my chin area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I had a chance to use this...</li>
            <li>The all-around feel of it is great.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I will stick with the regular Proglide or , even better, the mach 3, still the best gillette razor in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I personally love the five blade design, since it seems to get a better shave then</li>
            <li>The latest gimmick is the swiveling head of this Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more for him.</li>
            <li>I received a free razor from Gillette but the opinions are entirely my own.</li>
            <li>I always wondered how many blades will it take for them to be satisfied that we are receiving the best shape ever, Over time there is been multiple changes in the way we have to conquer our beard.</li>
            <li>But I do have to rinse the blade more to unclog the blades.  </li>
            <li>I went in to this thinking I have tried and tried more blades on a razor and</li>
            <li>I give the guys at Gillette a thumbs up for continuing to try to make our shaving lives a bit better and easier, but this one for me is a no go.</li>
            <li>▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>When I started feeling better, I had quite a bit of shag growing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure what the hype is about the flex ball.  </li>
            <li>As for the Flexball Handle Technology, to me it seems more like a gimmick.  </li>
            <li>I will need to use it more and see if the blade life is any greater than that of my 3 blade razor.</li>
            <li>It seems to make sense that the more ways the razor can flex and pivot, the better it will follow the contours of your face.  </li>
            <li>just use with care (since it IS A RAZOR after all), and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.be pleased.</li>
            <li>The blades are amazing - smooth and cut close.  </li>
            <li>Maybe there was a &#x27;break-in&#x27; period to loosen up the flexball, or maybe it was just me, but I love it now.</li>
            <li>much, MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I am one of those guys that thinks \\&quot;more is better\\&quot; when it comes to razor blades.  </li>
            <li>but I am okay with that.  </li>
            <li>Most guys I know shave there neck and face separate stopping at the jaw line.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I would pay more for the swivel head.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>It mostly worked out well for my face.  </li>
            <li>This razor did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>The ability for this razor to end the careers of many upward seeking hairs would make Donald Trump jealous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a great experience while shaving.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more out of this one.  </li>
            <li>I received a free gillette fusion proglide and I think its amazing compared to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly pleased at how close this head can get.</li>
            <li>But it gave a really smooth shave!</li>
            <li>I love how it gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li>I love the Fusion blade technology this razor features.  </li>
            <li>This allows the cartridge to stay in contact with the face better.</li>
            <li>however I think it would provide an even better shave if it had a battery and vibrated.</li>
            <li>I also like how the hairs dont stay caught in between the blades which also provides to a smooth shave!</li>
            <li>If you like the Gillette predecessors like me you are sure to dig this one as well.</li>
            <li>The one aspect that&#x27;s somewhat lacking is the detail blade on the top.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I love the way it pivots around the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>The swivel head glides easily and forms to my face for a nice clean shave!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I fully clean shaved, It&#x27;d be a nice touch with the pivoting head -</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for and found it at Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>I got a nice clean shave that day and each time I&#x27;ve used it since.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t remember exactly when) and said, &amp;#34;every man deserves a good razor for his birthday,&amp;#34; or something like that.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought hey this is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; handle was fine but more of a gimmick, IMO, than a really innovative technology.</li>
            <li>Stick with the original!</li>
            <li>I got this razor a few weeks ago im am very happy with the results you get the closest shave ever truely amazing</li>
            <li>so I may get a month out of 1 cartridge which would make the cost a lot more easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>What set it apart for me what the flex ball and how easy it was able to reach each hair on my face.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and makes shaving that much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice that the razor glides any better because of this ball, but I do love the closeness and smooth cut the blades provide.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor that gave a very close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Just a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>but overall a very good razor.</li>
            <li>only used one time but seems to be very good quality</li>
            <li>This leaves him smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin like most razors.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free to try &amp; so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It enables the razor to go over the contours of my face more smoothly and, therefore, I wind up with fewer nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>The flexball and the tilt of the blade makes it great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will say that it gave me the most comfortable and closest shaves</li>
            <li>Technnology takes shaving to another, more comfortable level.</li>
            <li>The flexball handle created a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It enables the razor to go over the contours of my face more smoothly then my razors before and, therefore, I wind up with fewer nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I haven&#x27;t used a manual razor in years, however I was highly satisfied with how comfortably this shaves.</li>
            <li>Worked great with even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And just to be sure you understand, I did try this for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it goes with everything</li>
            <li>This gave me the closest and most comfortable shaving experience ever.</li>
            <li>Both razors are good and give a close shave so the choice is really your&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Great new technology and gives your face a silky smooth feel that every woman will want to feel.</li>
            <li>A very smooth and clean shave at a somewhat hi cost.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other razors to keep a perfect groom style between visits to my barber.</li>
            <li>The comfort strip is excellent, as I expect from other Gillette products.</li>
            <li>I have tried manual, vibrating, and Mach3 razors and this razor was awesome in comparison to the other razors.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out!</li>
            <li>But I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with Gillette Fusion Proglide because even though I have sensitive skin I have received the perfect shave, and I have to say that the blades stay sharp much longer than any others I have used before.</li>
            <li>Because that razor was so much better than all the others I&#x27;ve used, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that a new version of the Proglide could be that much better.  </li>
            <li>shave once a week and this razor can easily handle the hair growth.</li>
            <li>easily it glided over my knees and</li>
            <li>It has a pivoting joint, which allows it to turn easily around curves.</li>
            <li>(Almost like cardboard, and easily recycled)</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you already have a Fusion, your just as well off with what you have, but I would easily recommend this to anyone using anything else to shave.</li>
            <li>This shaves close, easy to use; just the handle is bulky.</li>
            <li>no nicks, no scratches, and relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to control and extremely easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>The roller ball made this razor easily glide around the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>The Flexball Handle technology lets you get the closest shave and allows easy flexibility to shave from side to side.</li>
            <li>My husband reports that the handle is easy to use while shaving.</li>
            <li>The flexball handle was easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly metal, which gives it a good heft, but it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received unit from the brand for review, liked very much.</li>
            <li>(I admit it, I&#x27;m cheap), though after two weeks of shaving almost every day, I&#x27;ve not noticed the shave becoming rougher</li>
            <li>(I admit it, I&#x27;m cheap), though after two weeks of shaving almost every day, I&#x27;ve not noticed the shave becoming rougher</li>
            <li>I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I liked this razor better than some of the razors targeted toward women that are on the market, and will probably use this in the future when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li>I was excited by the commercials and even more when I showed up at my door; I was dumbstruck by how smoothly and efficiently the razor worked.</li>
            <li>I probably am being influenced by advertising and my own naivety, but if they made a razor with 20 blades I would be the first in line to buy</li>
            <li>This makes it even more comfortable to get a clean, close shave with no injuries or burn.</li>
            <li>My name is Anthony and I have used many razors over the years nothing quite compares to the smooth and clean feel I get when I use the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor anyway, you might as well give this one a shot as it does a good job.</li>
            <li>But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li>The shave from this new razor is really good.</li>
            <li>And it is just fine</li>
            <li>I must say, I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle.</li>
            <li>It shaves just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>The flex was OK without direction, but it was quite adequate when I directed it with my thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After getting used to the handle, I really enjoyed that razor, but the blades seemed to wear out fairly quickly considering the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new grip is amazing, and I Love it.</li>
            <li>The Mach3 is light and easy to use, even though the FlexBall flexes to fit the contours of my face.</li>
            <li>this is one of the best razors I have ever used, to go back to my old shaver which was pretty good seems like a step, backwards 10 years.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this to anybody out there who appreciates a good clean shave without cuts, nicks and pulling.</li>
            <li>That said, this razor does a fine job giving me a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Gillette, you really did a great job with razor and it only seems to get better with each one that comes out!</li>
            <li>That is quite fine, actually, because this blade has given me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a multi-blade system.</li>
            <li>at 5 am, I guess that isn&#x27;t a huge selling point for me.</li>
            <li>I got a close shave and the Flexball makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color.</li>
            <li>The flexball helps with the smooth ride.  </li>
            <li>Also, I got this product for free from Gilette to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wanted a cheap replacement.  </li>
            <li>This thing moves smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li>this razor has almost everything that I look for in a smooth shave, except for one thing.</li>
            <li>The razor is well made and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I started shaving and noticed that I was getting a really smooth shave all over my face.</li>
            <li>Yes, the additional hinge does help keep the blades parallel to the shaver’s skin – but it doesn’t make nearly as great a difference as the hinge on the cartridge (which was one of the Mach 3’s novel features).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or insubstantial.</li>
            <li>It provides a close shave, leaving my skin smooth and irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The handle is the same great handle you could expect from Gillette.</li>

            <li>The flex ball handle allowed me to navigate easily and smoothly to a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>The experience was with the razor was fantastic..</li>
            <li>The shaver glided smoothly, over my face, and for once, I did not cut myself.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice as much of an advantage with the advertised improved grip, but the grip on the Mach-3 is nice</li>
            <li>I have to say that it does give a smooth  shave</li>
            <li>I just received the free razor from bzzagent.com.</li>

            <li>I received this product for free from Gillette to try out and review...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, did the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; contribute to how comfortable the shave was?</li>
            <li>Now when I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with flexball handle for free from Gillette, I thought that the flex ball would make a difference, but truly there is no difference.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this was a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of more stokes than the fresh out of the pack razor but it has yet to snag or cut.</li>
            <li>Gillette gave me one of these to try for free.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory.</li>
            <li>Yes, I enjoy the discounts at Costco, so there may be some play in this review.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly enjoying the Gillette Fusion Proglide -- I received a complimentary trial version from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>It left it nice and smooth and really liked the FlexBall technology to get around the sides and creases.</li>
            <li>BzzAgent sent me a free sample</li>

            <li>or I&#x27;m just too light handed when shaving.</li>
            <li>I have used the same blade for a month and it is still working great.  </li>
            <li>I received the Fusion Proglide razor from Gilette for free to try and review.  </li>
            <li>My shave was exceptionally smooth.  </li>
            <li>I received this a free promo</li>
            <li>but hey, why not try a free razor?</li>
            <li>I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette in the mail.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic feat of engineering.</li>
            <li>Received the product free from Gillette as a promotional offer.</li>
            <li>Overall I think its a great razor.</li>
            <li>I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette in the mail, so of course I used it.</li>
            <li>My shave this morning was incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>So when I saw a free trial of this razor from Gillette, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do keep some Fusion cartridges and a handle around in case I don&#x27;t have the time to use my vintage razor, which is more fun.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball is an extraordinarily smooth razor.  </li>
            <li>Then I received a free trial of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor with the vibrating handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently, I received a free trial of the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free through BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Shave Gel + Skin Care in combination with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology that I got for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette and my husband&#x27;s face is wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>Good pivot/swivel action.</li>
            <li>For us guys that do shave our faces on a regular basis, the one thing we want to make sure we do is get a close shave that will leave us looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li>I did however notice that I got a much closer shave because it was able to form to my face better as I was shaving.</li>
            <li>You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting.</li>
            <li>Before receiving the Gillette razor, I wanted to know if my skin and face would be able to handle the movement of the FlexBall, and if this product was right for me.</li>
            <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t think the flexball really does anything special.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that this razor is worth changing out from the original Fusion Proglide!</li>
            <li>It has been all smooth, clean shaves with no stubble or irritations.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth, clean and close.</li>
            <li>All I need in a razor is a clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite razors!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this razor very much.</li>
            <li>Price seems a bit high for my budget but still a nice result.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised by the comfort and ease that came with such a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always try out the latest and greatest Gillette products, however, I&#x27;ve generally found that the new blades improve the shaving experience and not so much the razor.</li>
            <li>I received this razor to test from Gillette and it has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>But overall, I still love Gillette and love their products!</li>
            <li>Granted, I have a full, light beard but shave my neck/</li>
            <li>Given that experience, I was excited to try the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle</li>
            <li>unique thing about this Fusion Proglide razor is the Flexball handle.</li>
            <li>The unique feature to the Proglide is a ball that lets the blade swivel to the contours of  your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great razor, and by far my favorite multi-blade razor that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that this razor is worth it!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t shave more than about twice a week with these razors because my skin is pretty prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any significant change from shaving with a non Flexball handle.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure I just found my permanent replacement.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the flexball or the blade, but I am extremely impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>As someone who never looks forward to my morning shave, I am actually excited to bust this out again tomorrow morning.</li>
            <li>was something I was truly excited to have the opportunity to use,</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product as it is the best I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>A clean close shave with no irritation or nicks.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the upgraded version and a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I loved the smooth glide over my skin and the closeness of each shave; however, the adam&#x27;s apple and sub-jawline areas still took considerably extra strokes to eradicate all of the stubble.</li>
            <li>My face was super smooth all over, which is something that should happen... and did.</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean shave finish without razor burn.  </li>
            <li>As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>But I can also say that I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;Shower shaver.&amp;#34; Meaning I shave in the shower and honestly I see only a marginal difference (for the better)</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve found this have much closer and has greatly reduced razor burn and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was lucky to sample one of these for free from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The blades made for a quick, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>In one swipe I went from 4-5 days of growth to clean skin.</li>
            <li>To start, my eight year old son wanted to help me open the box as that the packing makes it look like a razor made for superheroes (that&#x27;s me) - impressive package and design.  </li>
            <li>I does a great job hugging the curves of my face and giving me a close clean shave with a single pass.  </li>
            <li>Overall, after my first straight razor shave in years, I was totally impressed.</li>
            <li>It had a very close shave and a very smooth feel to my face.</li>
            <li>This razor provided a very close and very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>While this new technology does help get a closer shave, I am most impressed with how much this new handle helps make my daily shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The razor itself stays very clean and I also liked the feel and look of the overall handle.</li>
            <li>This alone puts this razon in a special class in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most guys, I have problems with certain parts of my neck.</li>
            <li>The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>This single blade come in very handy for neatly edging the beard.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t she just take her pink razor and be happy?</li>
            <li>whatever they call it actually gives good head movement.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it would make that much of a difference and thought it might just be &amp;#34;gimmicky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say its a good razor, just not the one for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how much better a razor can get, but I applaud Gillette for continuing to try and upgrade their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think it really did that much better of a job then</li>
            <li>(The old fashioned kind).</li>
            <li>might be the full 5 stars.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: A good razor, especially considering it does flex.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology is a cool looking razor.  </li>
            <li>I have used the proglide for a month after I received it as a test sample from gillette and overall I feel it does a good job shaving</li>
            <li>overall a good razor</li>
            <li>, I will update the review with the service life for a razor as I continue to use the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using the same razor for over three weeks and still getting a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Looks cool.</li>
            <li>However, this razor is NOT as good as my regular Fusion.</li>
            <li>The flexball technology is innovative and definitely provides a closer, more precise shave.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor complimentary from BzzAgent for free  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t flex as much as it did on the commercials, I was able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that the FlexBall really made any difference...</li>
            <li>Regardless, I love the feel of the blades, and the handle is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for this awesome razor Gillette, I will never use any other brand besides Gillette!</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this razor its innovative and worth the money!</li>
            <li>It give a really close shave, and the handle is comfortable and easy to navigate.  </li>
            <li>Instead of the quick strokes in tough-to-reach areas of my face, I eventually learned to use even strokes over my entire face and chin and ended up with surprisingly good results.</li>
            <li>As I used it I noticed right away how comfortable it was.</li>
            <li>is great because it shaves along the contour of my face extremely well.</li>
            <li>The razor, like the non flexball version, is super sharp and will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li>Of course seeing “Free” just for reviewing or talking about it certainly helped!</li>
            <li>, I am a loyal Gilette fan.  </li>
            <li>And most important it glides over the face with, so far, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(*full disclosure: the item was provided to me free from Gillette*), which features a hinge on the handle, supplementing the range of motion offered by the hinge on the cartridge itself (the hinge on the handle swivels left-to-right, while the hinge on the cartridge swivels forward-and-back).</li>
            <li>I love the closeness and smooth shave that it offers.</li>
            <li>Good for several shaves and worth the money.</li>
            <li>It looks good (not a huge pro for me but the wife thought it was cute)    </li>
            <li>That said, it does give a decent shave, it&#x27;s quick, and it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>In particular it does a much better job on the curve of my chin.  </li>
            <li>A loyal Gillette user for years</li>
            <li>I tend to prefer razors marketed to and made for men over women because I find they are usually more solidly built and feel better in my hand.</li>
            <li>My husband related that this razor shaves his facial hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more blades for this one in the future (once I have saved up for them, that is.)  :-)</li>
            <li>I love the new Flexball, I have been using a Proglide Power for the last year and thought it gave a great shave, when I received a free trial of the new razor with the Flexball handle</li>
            <li>I get about two week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don&#x27;t do anything special to try to prolong their life.</li>
            <li>The FlexBall turned out to be a very nifty feature, as it makes shaving much easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>From the first shave to the 10th, my face is still as smooth as it was out of the box.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this I was very interested in how well the flexball worked.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with the razor.</li>
            <li>I found that the flexball allowed the razor to glide around and over my chin and jaw line nicely and clean better than the previous razors I have used.</li>
            <li>Another important thing to mention is that I received this particular model for free from Gillette in return for the review you are now reading...</li>
            <li>The flexball really does keep the blade close to the skin avoid cuts and ensuring a clean and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great razor that provides a close shave and cuts down on irritability.  </li>
            <li>Got my new Fusion Proglide with the Flexball Handle from Gillette and it was an interesting experience.  </li>
            <li>I got the Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette through the Buzz agent campaign and found that I had one more problem.</li>
            <li>Move over Gillette there is a new and better shhaver on the block</li>
            <li>very much enjoyed shaving with this new razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad razor by any means, but even the amazing Flexball will not get me to switch back from my Merkur.</li>
            <li>That said I think I&#x27;m willing to give it a try for awhile as it is providing a superior, longer lasting shave.</li>
            <li>It easy to handle and gives a very close shave along.</li>
            <li>The first day I used the razor I got the typical great shave I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette, however, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was any better than my current Fusion Proglide razor.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>See my earlier review of theis new Schick shaving systemthat will surely be favored over Gillette within a year or so.</li>
            <li>these are great while shaving do to lotion in shaving creams helping keep a tight grip</li>
            <li>The shave it gave me was very smooth and complete.</li>
            <li>and I do think it provides a pretty clean shave.  </li>
            <li>The blades are far enough apart to allow for easy rinsing and cleaning, and they provide a good, close shave for about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Very good for face and head shaving, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I got this razor for free and I haven&#x27;t researched the price, I can&#x27;t really speak to the cost of the handle, or the cost of replacement blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why receiving this product for free thanks to Gillette was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>I have mostly always been an electric shaver type guy and after receiving this from BZZAgent to try along with the sensitive proglide 2 in 1 gel,I have been hooked.</li>
            <li>Works better than the old one.  </li>
            <li>By the time I was done shaving, I wasn&#x27;t even able to use my old razors again.</li>
            <li>I have used several Gillette razors over the years and the ProGlide razor with flexball provides a nice close shave, just as i would expect from Gillette.</li>
            <li>DO use a razor to trim the surrounding area and to keep my &#x27;stache even on top and sides, and this razor is one of the smoothest I&#x27;ve used, and also offers me the closest shave I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>and he likes it, but the Flexball technology appeared to make this one worth a try.  </li>
            <li>so 3 people tried the razor, each using a fresh cartridge.</li>
            <li>Is it worth replacing whatever your using now?</li>
            <li>All I could think about beforehand was how a razor on a swivel simply doesn&#x27;t sound safe to use.  </li>
            <li>That said, I always use the most current version of the blades as soon as they are available.  </li>
            <li>I almost don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself when shaving in that area anymore which is perhaps the most impressive thing of all about this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The pivoting action made sure that all the angles of my face were covered.  </li>
            <li>but if I ever do I would definitely keep this one handy</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of facial hair, mustache, beard side burns, with the flexball, it glides nicely.</li>
            <li>Great razor, especially if you have sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Wow I never realized how much better my shave could be.  </li>
            <li>used the razor for the first time and from the first stroke it was a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>However, this gimmick is actually pretty cool and helpful.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that this razor is heavier so it felt more solid and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that allows for such a nice shave, but I have to wonder about their durability.</li>
            <li>Also, the pivot function wasn&#x27;t as useful as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am guessing that&#x27;s why myself, and many others, got to try this for free from Gillette - they can make a mint back on us from buying refills for this.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced.</li>
            <li>But is it worth it?</li>
            <li>So take it for what it&#x27;s worth, and check your wallet as well.</li>
            <li>It may not have offered as close of a shave, but the Flexball aspect did make shaving an easier and more rote action.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I still prefer my old razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be tossing out the old Fusion handle in favor of the FlexBall and will probably end up using it more.</li>
            <li>she said the flexball was nice, but wouldn&#x27;t go out of her way in the future to use it again.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s difficult to improve on perfection because both gave me an excellent, smooth shave</li>
            <li>I have always used Gillette Razors but this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am still using this with the same blade, at this point most blades would require a change yet this one is still good by both indicator and cut without nicks due to dulling of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Where this technology shines is around the Adams apples of the throat and the contours of the chin making the glide a smooth effortless journey and in my case allowing for additional pressure to be applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product, however, the only thing I miss from this is the pulse technology that came with other Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>However, it reduces the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; I have when shaving, and that leads to more nicks and cuts, not less.</li>
            <li>Since then I have been pretty loyal to the brand.  </li>
            <li>A super easy to open tab that allows the razor to freely be removed from the package.</li>
            <li>This razor gives me a smooth clean cut shave and my wife loves how soft my face is afterward.</li>
            <li>I cannot compare this to other good razors.</li>
            <li>, also loved the fact that this razor did not give me razor burn as for all the other razors do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The long and short - having more blades is good.</li>
            <li>$0.50 each or so, not bad well worth it as I’m actually getting more uses out of this product.</li>
            <li>this works as good as any other over priced fusion razor..</li>
            <li>The weight of the handle feels just right to me and it is ergonomically pleasing.</li>
            <li>The Lubrastrip helped the razor glide right across my face without any pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li>The Lubrastrip on the cartridge helps it glide right along, which seemed to help keep away the razor burn.</li>
            <li>you can re-position and get it to click right</li>
            <li>However, with the price of just one of these razors, and how often one is &#x27;recommended&#x27; to buy new ones, I would be broke very quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that is shaves better, since the blades are the same, but it is easy to use and glides around the face very well.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor gives a really close, clean shave, without nicking the skin.</li>
            <li>Sure the swivel ball sounds like a cool idea, but I didn&#x27;t think it was enough to change products permanently.</li>
            <li>The Flexiball handle really makes the razor work even better than a normal Gillette Fusion, and that is saying tons.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, that sixth blade was a good one to see ahead of time, since flipping the razor over is usually how I smooth my sideburns before squaring...</li>
            <li>The swivel was designed perfectly to bend to my face because the swivel moves not only side to side but also up and down.</li>
            <li>He highly recommends this razor because it provides a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It was very smooth and not a single knickknacks.</li>
            <li>A high quality razor that has held up and still feels as good now as when I first started using it weeks back, and</li>
            <li>(I have historically used Gillette Fusion Power), this is the first new release that has impressed me enough to consider upgrading.  </li>
            <li>The flexball gives the razor a unique look, but performance wise does very little</li>
            <li>new Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle is another in the fine line of razors.</li>
            <li>The first day he tried it, he had 5 days worth of growth</li>
            <li>No nicks as I experienced from razors of the past.</li>
            <li>From now on, the slick motion and function of the flexible handle is what I&#x27;m sticking with, unless they make another great improvement...</li>
            <li>(For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was super easy to access from beginning (always a +); the blade was very familiar to the other Gillette Fusion blades; the pivoting head on the razor seemed to work better than the regular Gillette Fusion razors...</li>
            <li>I got my razor free to test out from Gillette and see how their new technology works.</li>
            <li>I was elated to get a free sample of the new shaver in the mail.</li>
            <li>Gillette sent me their new razor free for review.  </li>
            <li>First, I was surprised at the quality of the shave -- very close, very smooth, with no bumps or razor burn at all.</li>
            <li>When Gillette sent me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology to try, I figured it would be just as good as the previous ProGlide Razors I have used.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and view a great shave as one of life&#x27;s simple pleasures I would definitely recommend upgrading to the Flexball razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I actually love the vibrating version and would recommend that for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Have used the regular Fusion for a few years, I tried this on a whim, I am very happy with the feel of an even cleaner shave.</li>
            <li>and they are of typical Gillette good quality.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how smooth the shave</li>
            <li>I also like the wide gaps between the razors so hair easily rinses out without much bother while offering that close, very smooth</li>
            <li>I use safety razors as I find them more economical and usually I feel like they give a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>all said, I DO very much like the heft of the ProGlide handle and ball.</li>
            <li>The shave is very smooth and effortless around the different contours of my face.</li>
            <li>In both versions, I get a nice clean shave with little effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the handle -- good rubber grip, little thicker handle.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle adds a new flair to the original design of the disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I must say that I was excited to test the new FlexBall technology.</li>
            <li>So smooth like the old model, but this Razor is very much like the Vacuums of today.</li>
            <li>Especially for special occasions where I want tobe really smooth.</li>
            <li>Most recently I had a fusion power</li>
            <li>I have now used the razor 4 times and it still shaves like the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor for anyone with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s so smooth..</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve always wished I had more facial hair to shave.</li>
            <li>He also got a close and comfortable shave without nicks on his chin or near his Adam&#x27;s apple, where he almost always gets a nick.</li>
            <li>biggest curiosity prior to receiving the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology was whether or not the added Flexball technology would safe to use.  </li>
            <li>The flex ball isn&#x27;t exactly a ball, but creates a pivot point that allows it to hug your face without causing any nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a pretty angular face</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this product as it has replaces my old non flexball handle.</li>
            <li>The first thing I</li>
            <li>I have recently received a Fusion Proglide straight razor from Gillette to try out and was totally amazed with the shave I experienced with it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this one for five weeks, and most razors last 3-4.  </li>
            <li>better than the razor iv&#x27;e been using for the past 10 years, i never thought i&#x27;d find a better one</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>Now I only need to make sure I hide it from wife.</li>
            <li>It feels funny shaving and not maneuvering around to get all your face</li>
            <li>The flexball technology does exactly what it says it does on the commercials</li>
            <li>Not enough to make me go out and buy the latest version.</li>
            <li>and i did drop it using it for the first time and this one shortcoming keeps me from giving this razor a five star review.</li>
            <li>However, with the free trial that was offered to me by Gillette, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4 stars for the mobility of the razor, (since its the first time I haven&#x27;t got cut on a razor on my chin after using it.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Kinda funny</li>
            <li>I was able to cross my jaw line both against and with the grain.</li>
            <li>First off, I received this from Gillette itself to test for them.</li>
            <li>I like this razor but not enough to pay more for replacement blades than I’m paying for Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li>In short I love it.</li>
            <li>It was a first job</li>
            <li>but initial impression is totally satisfied and he has one of those beard growths that has him often saying, &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>, was that it tends to take more than a simple rinse to get all of the shaving cream out.</li>
            <li>It gives me exactly what I would expect.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the razor and am about to order a refill pack of blades.</li>
            <li>the only difference is I have more nicks, 1 for every blade</li>
            <li>The first day I tried both</li>
            <li>It really does flex!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I tried the swivel head for the first time</li>
            <li>The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
            <li>I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li>Whether it actually makes a difference with the ball and adapting to my face, I cannot be sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first razor that has made shaving my head a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this razor.</li>
            <li>and I thought most Gillette razors were the same</li>
            <li>The occasional patch of razor burn has become increasingly more infrequent with prolonged use of the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall technology.</li>
            <li>After using it a couple more times though the FlexBall really is starting to shine.</li>
            <li>I use both manual and an electric razor and recently I found myself going to my electric more.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it until it mysteriously made its way from the sink into the shower after a week.  </li>
            <li>I am more than likely to purchase these to give them another shot.</li>
            <li>What I found interesting is that they seem to last longer on the Flexball razor than the Power razor.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bzz Agent and Gillette Fusion Proglide!</li>
            <li>and I found that I was having to reapplying shaving gel after the first pass.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, one aspect that does cause a fair amount of trouble is around my adam&#x27;s apple and on both sides of the neck, just below my jawline.</li>
            <li>Give me a few blades, some shaving cream, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>worked great for me and my wife, we both used the same cartridge for almost 3 week, me daily and her every other day and on the 3rd week it probably would have still been great</li>
            <li>The razor itself is kinda like that Dyson vacuum with the ball joint that can hug corners like Mario Andretti except for your face and it gets much better gas mileage.  </li>
            <li>The added range of motion provided by the ball became instantly evident when I was able to cleanly clear a sizable portion of my face in one clean cut without having to pick up the razor and adjust the blade to a different angle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a clean shave</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;ve been using the old Fusion Proglide for about a year and liked it better than several others that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and true to its words it does contour very well to you face very well.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and does its job as any other G-products.</li>
            <li>The Proglide aspect of the razor was not as effective as other brands that I have used</li>
            <li>It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li>It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>I have scar tissue in my shaving area and have a tough time getting a good smooth shave because of the &amp;#34;geography&amp;#34; of my skin in some areas - thus my skepticism.  </li>
            <li>It pivots up and down, like most razors with replaceable blade cartridges, but it also pivots from side to side!</li>
            <li>how many new razor models come out and find most of them gimmicky.</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide  Flexball razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>Basically, if you&#x27;re deciding between this razor and a more expensive one, then this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>and this razor has been great in not only getting to the hard to reach places but to give a smooth shave on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>I imagine if I regularly shaved areas that had more curves (e.g. arms, chest, legs, etc) - then pushing down and pivoting the blade might be more useful.</li>
            <li>I generally have thought that there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference between the easy disposable razors and the high-end ones, but this razor changed my mind.</li>
            <li>I received my Fusion Pro Glide from Gillette and My experience with the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide was largely a positive one.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the swivel was a bit of a gimmick at first, but the articulation was actually really helpful.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a reflection on the product, but a fact to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a very close, smooth, and cut free shave that appeared to stem partially from the flexball technology.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I vpbeen using this for a really long time.</li>
            <li>It really acted like a disposable but with a higher price tag.</li>
            <li>Really gets the job done for the first 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>After using the razor for several weeks, I found that a description / product name can sound better than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure if the vibration helped anything, but I can&#x27;t help the feeling that I am not doing as good a job shaving anymore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a full beard since 2009 and this razor by far gives the easiest mobility to shave my cheeks and neck with out worrying if I accidentally took a swipe out of my beard.</li>
            <li>my shaves are quick, easy, smooth and last long.</li>
            <li>One of the nice things about cartridge razors is they allow the blades to go up and down to keep contact with the face.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using the regular Fusion ProGlide and have been pretty happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Overall, Gillette is a great brand that I enjoying using, but this razor in particular is not right for my facial hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite feature, as Gillette addressed the main problem with these multi-blade razors by adding such a simple solution that&#x27;s so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>equates to more kisses due to smoothness and duration of smoothness, and as we all know the value in the is enormous, love knows no bounds except a scratchy face</li>
            <li>Thanks to the folks at Gillette, I was given the opportunity to try the new Fusion ProGlide with new FlexBall handle technology for FREE.</li>
            <li>I believe in being frugal, but the misery of razor burn, coupled with the added frustration of a new hobby, makes me think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you are in the market for a new razor.</li>
            <li>The Flexball Handle Technology allows the razor to easily follow ever contour of my face while maintaining constant contact with my skin.</li>
            <li>It was easy to open and get access to the product.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.</li>
            <li>This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!</li>
            <li>and I used the single blade on the top of the head to shape around this area.  </li>
            <li>I am still trying to get used to the large handle</li>
            <li>It certainly did it&#x27;s job of reducing friction</li>
            <li>The razor moves with your face, which is certainly something that my Mach 3 doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the new look until my girlfriend made it known she wanted &amp;#34;her&amp;#34; &#x27;stache back.</li>
            <li>The five blades do an excellent job of shaving with fewer passes and have remained sharp over the past week.  </li>
            <li>It was fine, but no big shakes for him.</li>
            <li>Also, packaged with the razor is a nice little plastic tray to set the razor on after your shave, keeping the head of the razor off the counter.</li>
            <li>pro glide gives a very clean clean and easy shave that last all day … no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>just like it says it is and also love the fact that it has 5 blades but not only that all the fusion razors take the same blades so there for you don&#x27;t have to buy special blades for the particular one</li>
            <li>I am certainly inclined to stick with the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology simply for the smooth comfort of the shave alone.</li>
            <li>The best part is that the two motions can happen at the same time, which works fantastically for reaching those tough to shave angles on the side of the chin and jaw.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for over 20 years, all the way back to the Sensor, and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the closeness of the shave, and the powered Fusion shaves particularly smooth.</li>
            <li>My wife is unapologetic about her thievery and says it is the best razor she has ever used and loves how it hugs her curves without getting rough with her delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>I like just changing the razor head and replacing the whole razor.</li>
            <li>Really follows the contoursof my face.</li>
            <li>the Fusion Proglide really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>It may very well have given the closest shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I got a very close shave on fewer passes.</li>
            <li>It was quite gentle on my skin as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Thanks</li>
            <li>It really glides along with your skin.</li>
            <li>The flexball really helps on those tricky spots.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for sending me this one.</li>
            <li>normal downstroke first and then an upward cut to get the leftovers.  </li>
            <li>Even after about 20 shaves with one cartridge they give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and the blades rinse out much easier than others.  </li>
            <li>it was very flexiable</li>
            <li>This razor is absolutely the exception because of one feature, a trimming razor on the reverse side.</li>
            <li>My package just arrived it works really well</li>
            <li>it really does a grat job i would recomend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>The flexball doesnt really move all that much.</li>
            <li>and my face thanks them for it.</li>
            <li>it was a smooth transition to the different contours on my face.  </li>
            <li>While it would increase the number of strokes necessary for shaving the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, flatter surfaces, I wonder if a more narrow head might better serve the Flexball&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, versatile.</li>
            <li>The flexball really doesn&#x27;t add anything to my shave.</li>
            <li>In fact, the whole time I have shaved with Gillette cartridge razors I have never once cut myself.    </li>
            <li>This razor gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The flexball technology is really neat.</li>
            <li>The question will be how much are replacement blades?</li>
            <li>That really does matter if you&#x27;re prone to get razor-burn.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this razor to a friend.</li>
            <li>but I find myself always more careful with this handle.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a manual razor, so I can&#x27;t really judge that.</li>
            <li>If I switch to anything, it&#x27;ll be a safety razor or straight blade.</li>
            <li>The flexball really does help with the curves of the neck.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the floating head.</li>
            <li>but really, why?</li>
            <li>The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale.</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it.</li>
            <li>This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to shave in straight lines, so I didn’t really see how the FlexBall added to my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Even when I tried to ‘use’ the FlexBall while shaving, I didn’t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>He said he will be sticking with those since he didn&#x27;t see much, if any, improvement for him in shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waited about 2 weeks to write this review, as i wanted to really get a feel for it before</li>
            <li>The blades still stay in a straight line, so</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li>With just a bit of pivoting, the FlexBall can maneuver the blade just enough to comfortably shave my chin and neck with one or two passes.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to go over my face as often because the flexball really does follow the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>This thing is legit, and that&#x27;s just the whole story.  </li>
            <li>I DEFINITELY think you&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s a darn smooth shave in just one pass.  </li>
            <li>It seems to me a lot of the razors for women invariably end up being too much plastic and too much &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I really am a fan of the results of my shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for sending me a razor to try.  </li>
            <li>Since I have a light beard (and don&#x27;t shave my upper lip)</li>
            <li>I really did not feel the flexball working</li>
            <li>Flexball didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, but had some irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Gillette for letting me test out this razor.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and the flexball handle technology works</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is a solid razor, silky smooth as it glides around your face neck.</li>
            <li>It gave a very close shave</li>
            <li>I recently received this razor free from Gillette in order to try out and review.  </li>
            <li>the name and technology behind the razor sounded great.  </li>
            <li>Also, the FlexBall handle did not seem to move smoothly across my face and I had difficulty using it especially when going from a side to side motion.  </li>
            <li>No muss, no fuss and very close to a blade shave.  </li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;ve gone back and used a Mach 3, in fact, I&#x27;ve been struck by just how big a difference there is between that product and the far superior 5-blade Fusion (or its slightly-improved successor the Fusion Proglide).</li>
            <li>Quality feel, nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>recieving the fusion proglide from gillette it go to show the professional quality you use in building your razors from the close shave to following the contours of your face its top quality,id recomend gillette fusion and gillette products to anybody.....</li>
            <li>I keep a low cut beard, but like to keep it clean by cleaning up extra growth around my cheek bones and neck - all razors get this done just fine, since it&#x27;s not much to shave, but the razor was very nice as far as keeping contact and only taking a couple of swipes to get everything done.</li>
            <li>With a truly awe-inspiring beard, I use a razor to clean up my neck and ensure straight and clean lines down my cheek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for the latest gadgets, bells and whistles, and other so-called improvements that more often as not are changes for the sake of increased sales and offer no improvement in the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The purported benefits of the new FlexBall Handle Technology, is that it responds to every contour of your face as if it&#x27;s been aware of them for years.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a bit scheptical but always like new adventures.</li>
            <li>While I got this particular sample through the Amazon Vine program, I had already switched to using Fusion and purchased several on my own last month.</li>
            <li>This razor is much better than any of the other razors I have tried.</li>
            <li>I know most guys with a lot of facial hair would want the exact opposite</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use sang more force than I did on other spots of face.</li>
            <li>This razor is exceptionally sharp, probably more so than my wit.</li>
            <li>It is smooth on the skin and contours to the face nicely, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a big step forward for Gillette.</li>
            <li>,  I also normally have to make multiple passes with a disposable razor which naturally causes more irritation.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is better than some other automatic razors in consideration of price, quality and function.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that I was DRY SHAVING, I found that the Gillette razor easily glided on my face and eliminated all of my hair.</li>
            <li>My main gripes with this, or really any disposable razor these days, are 1)</li>
            <li>A very close and comfortable shave, probably the closest shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first that this razor would really be worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>The single blade on the back is a great idea for what I see as the only multi-blade system weakness ...</li>
            <li>I have used every razor to mankind and find that the Schick hydro wins with hands down giving you a comfortable shave with built in gel that outlasts Gillette.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I would prefer, a little lighter would be better, but overall a very high quality product that delivers a very close and clean shave.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this razor for anyone who wants a shave that&#x27;s easier on their skin.</li>
            <li>in all, it is definitely worth the cost to update your old razor to one with the new Flexball.</li>
            <li>It has a single-blade opposite the five main blades for edging and clean up.</li>
            <li>Very clean shave and sharp blades that minimize pulling.</li>
            <li>Not only was it the most thorough, quickest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, but the product is at such a top quality that is blows every other razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frugal guy and don&#x27;t normally buy razors that cost this much.  </li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s closer than I thought it would get for such a sensitive blade, but I prefer a bit more control when shaving since I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure how cost effective it is yet,</li>
            <li>I tried to shave the tight area between the very bottom of my nose (under my nostrils) and the top of my mustache with the 5-bladed razor head.</li>
            <li>I even had to put it down and pick up my Mach 3 just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have some type of hand muscle thing going on....</li>
            <li>As for the new flex ball handle, I like it although it feels like I have to be more careful than normal because I feel like it&#x27;s going to slip and cut my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice the razor doing any pivoting or flexing or whatever they say it does, so it seems to be mostly marketing hype like all their other \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li>Until this new Schick came out i was Inlove with the Fusion, but no longer!</li>
            <li>I really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide line of razors and this new one with the Flexball</li>
            <li>The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the new flex ball technology and see if it really lived up to the claims made.  </li>
            <li>So that is why I really took interest in the new FlexBall handle when I read about it.</li>
            <li>the lube strip works great for the 1st shave, just OK for the 2nd, and even if the blades are sharp enough for more shaves than that, the lube strips are useless; and 2)</li>
            <li>The new combination lubricating strip was also a welcome surprise, as it left my face feeling smooth, without the embarassing nicks and patches others leave behind!</li>
            <li>that allows you to cover more area with less strokes.</li>
            <li>Although it does slightly swivel, it felt like more of a gimmick to me than a must-have.  </li>
            <li>Many fewer repeat strokes to get the odd missed hair around chin and jaw line without any razor burn or nicks to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was super stoked about getting another Gillette product, especially another ProGlide.</li>
            <li>(More refill sales!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the smoothness of the shave itself, I noticed the following bullet-points in some of the promotional material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice feel in the hand, was surprised at how heavy it was.</li>
            <li>Negatives on this razor mainly come with the price of the blades.</li>
            <li>Love the flexibility, and the fact that it use the same blades as earlier Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - I&#x27;ll be sticking with my electric razor and older ProGlide for closer shaving if needed.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Well, this is a decent cart razor,no doubt.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty and solid razor, good grip, swivel action not much of use for me but am sure over time I would get use to it</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t be switching from that, mainly for cost reasons.</li>
            <li>I would like to mention that my facial hair is very coarse and this might have been one of the reasons that I did not have a better experience than others.  </li>
            <li>I noticed no issues going around knees, under arms, and certain other spots (which will remain unmentioned in light of not providing TMI).</li>
            <li>I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves how soft my face is after using this razor from heaven!</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal fan of Gillette for a long time and will probably never switch from the brand, unless it is to a straight razor.</li>
            <li>They razor wasn&#x27;t rotating to the extreme they show in the commercials, but it was able to hit those subtle curves so nicely.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this razor.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to a peer.</li>
            <li>Then I’m thinking the price of the replacement cartridges are going to be sky high over the Mach 3, but to my amazement the cost difference is negligible.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The shave was really smooth and much faster than any other razor on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the 1st time ive used this razor i have NEVER went back to a womens or used any other kind.</li>
            <li>I held off on any review to be sure if what I was experiencing wasn&#x27;t just the typical new blade honeymoon.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>nick easy (though it is wicked sharp)</li>
            <li>and I feel like I would have had to push to hard to make it work effectively on my face.  </li>
            <li>(My sons clean and dry their razors every day</li>
            <li>Shaving in the morning is soft and fast with this razor.</li>
            <li>But ball does not really make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the razor for a few weeks now, I can say that I am truly pleased with</li>
            <li>I normally use a safety razor.</li>
            <li>The handle is the same as a regular Fusion handle but at the top it splits apart and there is a hinged ball and sprig to allow for some pivoting action.  </li>
            <li>normally get things through Buzz Agent, but this one came from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as it says by actually hitting every hair and giving a much closer shave than I am used to.  </li>
            <li>No complaint so for…….</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard.</li>
            <li>I must admit that the first few shaves with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle have been amazingly comfortable and quite close.  </li>
            <li>normal blades can miss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally an electric razor user, but I figured I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li>My wife had asked me did I change razors or put a new bladed on my old straight razor that I had been using</li>
            <li>Not being able to press very hard makes it very gentle on your skin while still being a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i am always looking for a new razor to keep down the burn and let me shave comfortably more frequently than every 3 days,</li>
            <li>The Gillette fusion proglide contours to the curves in my face and easily cuts coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li>first experience with the razor was that it seemed pretty much the same as my older, regular ProGlide.</li>
            <li>On top of the regular multi-blade shaving surface, there&#x27;s an additional single blade on the edge.  </li>
            <li>Always used a single blade or at most a double blade.</li>
            <li>I will most likely pick up a refill pack though there are times that the Mach-3&#x27;s lower price point (the Proglide is roughly 50% more expensive for refills) will sway me that way.or such a nice shave, but I have to wonder about their durability.</li>
            <li>As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction.</li>
            <li>It just gives a remarkably close shave and does cut down on skin irritation because you have to use less strokes.  </li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp and they last a good while, but only as long as you clean them after you us them.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as cheap as Gilette&#x27;s other Fusion ProGlide blade refills.</li>
            <li>The cut is as smooth and close as Gillette&#x27;s other five blade razors</li>
            <li>The new blades, or what I think are new blades, are giving me the closest shaves ever.</li>
            <li>If you already have a Fusion / Fusion Proglide handle without the Flexball swivel, don’t bother buying this new product.</li>
            <li>With the new flex ball handle i find I can do a one stroke</li>
            <li>but I had a new package of Fusion cartridges in my house</li>
            <li>The Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall is my new razor.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it worked and so did the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems like razor manufacturers are always coming out with new gimmicks</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide&#x27;s new razoe with teh flexball handle does that in a way that I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why when I bought the new razor with the new handle</li>
            <li>When I received the new Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology</li>
            <li>Well, I received an email to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>When blade is new this thing glides.....</li>
            <li>Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new razor</li>
            <li>when using this new 4 blade razor as opposed to the 3 blade Mach 3.</li>
            <li>However since receiving this new handle I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively and have put my electric razor away at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new swivel feature wasn&#x27;t as impessive as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>My husband has been going through a new appreciation go the shaving ritual.</li>
            <li>I was given a new gillette proglide flexball as part of the flexball promotion.</li>
            <li>I just received my new Gillette Fusion Pro-glide razor.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, that did not turn out to be the case, but I&#x27;m still VERY careful when it comes to shaving and trimming it and the surrounding</li>
            <li>Just as important, the thin blades do not clog as easily and are easier to clean than other multi-bladed razors I have used.</li>
            <li>However after trying the new Proglide razor from Gillette not only am I mainly using this razor now, but I am making sure I have enough time in the morning for a proper shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with previous fusion blades, the head will clog easily with stubble if not rinsed often.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a few more micro cuts while shaving when I used this razor as opposed to my old one.  </li>
            <li>I really did not notice much difference in the quality of shave from this razor compared to earlier versions of the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by how much smoother the shave was than my old razor.</li>
            <li>The movement of the blade is subtle but effective, no nicks, cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li>The flexball really doesn&#x27;t do anything major for me.</li>
            <li>however I have very sensitive skin around my neck and</li>
            <li>She was very surprised of the close shave that it gave and the smoothness of my face.</li>
            <li>I had given up on manual razors because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The flexball feature definitely adjusts to the natural contours of my face, certainly makes shaving over my cheekbones and neck much easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one negative is at some point I will have to buy new razor blades, but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>so they get much more use out of a single cartridge after the lubricating strip has long been used up.</li>
            <li>: the swivel head does not appear to do much good    cons: I find the head is too big in some places, the top single blade is slightly difficult to use.    </li>
            <li>son with an average to light beard but</li>
            <li>The first thing I notice was the solid feel in my hand.</li>
            <li>When I used my old razors, I used to feel some irritation around the corners of my chin that I thought was normal.  </li>
            <li>first the double blades, then triple, then quadruple and now the five blade with pivot head.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth it and one that I will keep using for a long time.</li>
            <li>So for the past couple of weeks I have been enjoying my morning shave with both the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I generally shave in straight lines</li>
            <li>I usually use a Mach 3, but I found this one held to the contour of my face better and the blade lasted one shave longer than Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Next year, maybe there will be a real neutron beam atomic phaser shaver!  </li>
            <li>That is the less fortunate who never had a chance to try the new ProGlide line.</li>
            <li>The only place it still can&#x27;t reach is right under my nose, which is ironic given the TV ads Gillette is running show various men scrunching up their faces to reach that spot.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I thought of when I saw the razor with the ball thing is the vacuum with the ball thing.</li>
            <li>But it offers at least the same good shave as other Fusion handles and it does look cool.</li>
            <li>First of all, this razor is light to the feel and when shaving I can hardly tell I have anything against my skin.</li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth clean shave and does it in half the time of my other disposables.</li>
            <li>To achieve a particularly smooth shave, my straight edge needs to be sharp enough to shave granite.</li>
            <li>also like that the old Fusion blades are compatible with this new handle.</li>
            <li>gave a GREAT shave , I have a few scares and usually they get cut -up, not  with this Razor .</li>
            <li>I get less nicks and cuts or none at all because of the smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to make jokes about Gillette&#x27;s evolving product line: every few years the company adds another blade (or two) to their cartridge and changes the color of their razor handle.</li>
            <li>As someone with a wide, curvy face, I was quickly taught that the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology is the razor that I&#x27;ve been waiting for since I was a teenager.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The refill blades are a substantial step up in price from the average Mach 3 blades - costing about 2/3 more even in the larger multipacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He usually uses an electric razor but uses a blade razor before important meetings or photo ops or other special occasions when a very close shave matters.</li>
            <li>When I asked him how it worked out for him, he told me the same thing, except he uses the cheap disposable single blade razors.</li>
            <li>my case, it is about the same, however I have noticed that I have not cut myself as much with the new handle vs. the old one.</li>
            <li>Ultimately it helped to get around my entire face and flexed easily to the different angles on my face.</li>
            <li>,  you wouldn&#x27;t think that razors could really do anything special, but this did push that notch a bit further compared to other razor companies.</li>
            <li>.. shaving blades are very sharp, shaving is very fast and leaves skin soft, I&#x27;m really loyal consumer of gillette fusion for several years</li>
            <li>So I finally got to try this new razor; my beard is strong and I use the razors to trim or shape my beard, but I always had a hard time to get rid of hair or skin cells left in between the blades; the new swivel head helps me tremendously getting the space clear of muck from shaving.</li>
            <li>I just started shaving regularly (daily, or every other day) and this razor was amazing for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li>It handled all the curves pretty well - but not really any different than most other mens razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The 3 star rating is because while the razor itself is good, I think the Flexball is a little gimmicky.</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;ve been able to shave my whole face with less effort; and, at the end of my shave, I find I consistently have less unshaved foam left on my face, which indicates to me that I got a close shave.</li>
            <li>Did have an issue with cartridge not locking securely onto unit - took 3 tries to engage properly.</li>
            <li>If you clean and dry the blades after each use they will last a lot longer before they need replacing.</li>
            <li>I used it with the sensitive shave gel.</li>
            <li>Follows facial contours really well.  </li>
            <li>This razor far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>and you’re looking to buy one, the Flexball Handle does represent a marginal improvement on the old product.</li>
            <li>It naturally curves with my face</li>
            <li>Something as simple as a straight razor has evolved over years, adding gripped handles, thinner blades, and comfort strips.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I think this will replace my old Gillette Mach 3 which I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>The five blades give me a cliose shave without nicks and without irritation of my sensitive skin;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>have used this razor a few times and am still getting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely say that that these components really do make a difference.</li>
            <li>Well, the Gillette Fusion Proglide amazed me, it really was different from others.</li>
            <li>It really did glide along my face, especially under my nose.</li>
            <li>I found myself using my thumb to direct the ball (and therefore the head).</li>
            <li>FlexBall did work reasonably well overall;</li>
            <li>MY FACE FEELS YOUNG</li>
            <li>It just glides over face and really gets the facial hair thoroughly off.</li>
            <li>One pass over your face is a real time saver to a daunting task that has to be done daily.</li>
            <li>and I treat them more delicately.</li>
            <li>I tend to use my blades far longer than recommended</li>
            <li>I tend to use my blades far longer than recommended</li>
            <li>I also shave everyday to keep the skin smooth and silky for the lady.</li>
            <li>I have been using gillette since I started to shave when I was young.</li>
            <li>I did like it, but its not like I would replace my old one for this one.</li>
            <li>Everyone do yourselves a favor and throw away your old razors and buy this one</li>
            <li>It might, but I don&#x27;t believe it matters as much for the overall shave.</li>
            <li>had no trouble hanging on to that one.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.</li>
            <li>In fact, when checking the next morning, the shave is really close (</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the smoothness of the shave from my regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Well I was pleasantly surprised to use this razor.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I have to say that compared to my old razor, I got a closer smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this razor cut my beard without pulling.</li>
            <li>I have used this razor 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>I gave it a once-over before lathering up, and was surprised to see 5 blades in tandem on the one side,</li>
            <li>Overall, the razor feels very well made.  </li>
            <li>Old Trusty, if you will.  </li>
            <li>I got the Gillette Fusion free from Gillette to review a few weeks ago and let me just say...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards.</li>
            <li>The title to this review completely sums up my opinion of the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor.</li>
            <li>I honestly have never gotten such a close shave that I didn&#x27;t have to go back in a few places.</li>
            <li>I find it weird more than useful</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that this would provide a good shave, as I tend to prefer an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I was skeptical at first that a design such as the new ProGlide would make any kind of difference.</li>
            <li>The next two days I used the Flexball to shave one side of my face and the current fusion to shave the other and I can tell you that the blade definitely tracks the contours of the face much better with the Flexball and results in a more efficient shave (few strokes).  </li>
            <li>I also very much like the single blade on the reverse side for trimming purposes, it does help reach places that I otherwise couldn&#x27;t with my harrys razor.</li>
            <li>I mean how many razors are they going to make and</li>
            <li>But if you think about how long the blades on the refills last, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the new Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology to everyone who wants to get a closer shave than they have had in a long time!</li>
            <li>I am not much for spending extra money on higher end products unless I have been shown proof it really is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I needed a new razor as I really liked my previous one, but I sure was wrong!</li>
            <li>I once dropped my straight razor and the sheer edge of it caused it to go through the floor tile, concrete, clay, mantle, and subsequent molten core of this earth like butter.</li>
            <li>When I was asked if i would like to try this product by Gillette, I was skeptical that the new flexball handel would really help me get a better shave.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really surprise me, but this razor isn&#x27;t much different than the last &#x27;new thing&#x27; to come out.</li>
            <li>doubt I will switch back to using a cartridge razor (mainly because of cost),</li>
            <li>As with all manual, multiple blade shavers, I found I got a decent shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>Though I still prefer the older three blade Mach 3 system from Gillette, as the blades were further apart.</li>
            <li>Thought it did very well going down the contours of my neck, and didn&#x27;t pull the hairs but instead gave me a really close shave.</li>
            <li>- many of these reviewers are clearly sissy-men with weak beards and the hair growth of a 12 year old girl.</li>
            <li>The blades are high quality and last for weeks.</li>
            <li>I will most likely pick up a refill pack though there are times that the Mach-3&#x27;s lower price point (the Proglide is roughly 50% more expensive for refills) will sway me that way.</li>
            <li>The truth is, I&#x27;m a simple guy and while I appreciate a close shave, and do think that multiple blades have improved shaving, the gimmicks (roller ball, vibration, lube strips, etc.) are really just ways to boost the cost of the refills without really changing the overall experience.  </li>
            <li>I had Gillete&#x27;s Fusions old model back in the day, but this new model they created takes the cake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a razor like no other!</li>
            <li>(Actually, I gave all the unused ones to the less fortunate.</li>
            <li>, it was a closer shave than my previous razor and left my face feeling smooth..</li>
            <li>I like a less wide head that is more compact and a razor that has substantial feel in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use an electric razor, but Gillette sent me the ProGlide for free to try.  </li>
            <li>I received this razor complimentary from BzzAgent and while I thought most razors are the same the Gillette Fusion Proglide has proven me wrong.</li>
            <li>This one has five blades, and normally my hubby doesn&#x27;t like them because they seem to tug and pull at his beard, but the blades have enough space between them that he can fully rinse them out after each stroke.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaving since before the Mach3 came out and have used Gillette cartridge razors exclusively for shaving until the last year when I switched to a double sided safety razor (Merkur Heavy Duty #34c w/ Derby blades, which I love btw).  </li>
            <li>It has the normal Gillette colors of silver, blue and orange.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a disposable razor guy, but this Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about the size of the cartridge but that concern was laid to rest quickly.</li>
            <li>I normally have some difficulty shaving two areas of my jaw line, one on the side of the chin and the other back towards the neck but thanks to the new swivel technology those two spots are about 5 times easier to shave.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this razor and the shave was so smooth and easy…it left my face feeling smoother than any other previous razors I have used.  </li>
            <li>If you are at all familiar with previous Gillette Razors featuring the multi-blade head, this will not seem much different to you.</li>
            <li>Gillette recently sent me the new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 razor for well over 10-15 years and every time I have switched and tried something new, or different, no luck.</li>
            <li>It seems that razor manufacturers are constantly looking for new gimmicks to sell their product.  </li>
            <li>The second day I did have a small cut, but I the razor still gave me a very smooth shave as it actually traced my face and chin.</li>
            <li>To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did like the feel of the razor, and the close shave that the five blades provided, but I didn&#x27;t really find that the FlexBall handle provided any different shave than the regular Fusion ProGlide.</li>
            <li>But the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Handle Technology totally eliminated the second step with a REALLY close shave.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the pivoting head would be a bit gimmicky as really how much would that help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them on various handles and it really all seemed the same.</li>
            <li>The blade was super sharp the first few uses</li>
            <li>other one feels a little more plasticky.  </li>
            <li>I should have used the single-blade edging feature, but since I didn&#x27;t, I had to shave the entire mustache off and rock the hairless upper lip for the first time since middle school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noticeably heavier than any other &#x27;swap-a-cartridge&#x27; razors I&#x27;ve held, so it feels substantial when you first pick it up.  </li>
            <li>When I got an opportunity from Gillette to try out their new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology for free, I didn&#x27;t really think there would be much difference between it and the standard Fusion razor I currently use, but boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li>I did receive this razor free as a promotion to try it out, but I will never go back to a plain razor ever.</li>
            <li>first blade did not last very long however</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gillette,  top brand and expensive shaving but decent price add on to avoid cost of shipping.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it cuts the hairs smoothly, just that in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t do any better job than any of the other Fusion ProGlide or similar multi-blade razors in its class.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the flexball and it can reach all the hard to reach places</li>
            <li>The problem is that for too long they have really just moderately changed the cartridges and considered it a major upgrade.</li>
            <li>The other downside is that despite all the fancy technology that make for a quick and close shave, having the multiple blades actually gets too close for me.</li>
            <li>I used the Flexball to clear off my neck and upper cheeks.</li>
            <li>though I like the razor, I think I am going to go back to using my old non-proglide one that vibrates (fusion power).  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, especially under the jaw</li>
            <li>Gillette has developed a razor that, because of the Flexball, has blades that stay on the skin surface longer than traditional blades.</li>
            <li>I used a foam cream for this initial shave and was surprised at how close of a shave resulted.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My old razor now resides in the drawer next to the sink.</li>
            <li>It definitely lasted longer than the old one that I had</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t see a big difference between this and the old gillette profusion,</li>
            <li>What ever happened to the old blue blade/</li>
            <li>When you finish shaving you don&#x27;t have that irritating burn that happens most times after shaving.</li>
            <li>However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this product next time I need a new razor.</li>
            <li>I usually shave early in the morning right before work</li>
            <li>As you shave, the razor&#x27;s head swivels left and right, as well as up and down.</li>
            <li>I have used Gillette fusion for a long time and live the precision of their razors and how close the shave is.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be different from any other razor that I have used.</li>
            <li>and it seemingly isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; out as quickly as I remember from the past (again... it&#x27;s been a while...</li>
            <li>To test it further  I went back to my old disposable razor for my next shave and did not get even near as close a shave.</li>
            <li>I can go almost a whole month shaving with this blade compared to a week with other name brands.</li>
            <li>The Fusion cartridges feature 5 blades which are placed very closely together to reduce the chance of nicks and cuts and to provide and extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>This razor does give you a much closer shave then the other Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>I also found the shave itself was much closer than what I would get with other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is a neat idea, but I found it a little difficult to get precise control over the razor because of the head&#x27;s ability to swivel so easily.</li>
            <li>And even after two weeks - the normal lifespan of a disposable razor - the blades seemed just as sharp and I was razor-burn free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from disposable razors, I may have been a bit foolish to think the Flexball razor from Gillette would really be that different - press event or not, it&#x27;s hard to believe that Gillette could have &amp;#34;disrupted&amp;#34; the market by adding a few degrees of movement to their latest 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li>; usually I have to make a second pass on some areas that grow thicker but the razor left it very smooth with only a single pass.</li>
            <li>There is no other Razor which is comparable to Gillette performance at the same time</li>
            <li>I expected the motion that was shown in the commercials, but found that it was quite limited to just either moving left or right.</li>
            <li>handle is a bit on the heavy size, but that is actually a benefit as it seems to impart a little more control.  </li>
            <li>I was quickly proved wrong within the first 30 seconds of using it.  </li>
            <li>Once you try wet shaving with a single, double, or straight razor, you&#x27;ll never go back to cartridge shaving, no matter what the new technology comes up with, as I found after giving this razor a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only shave 2-4 times a week, which means that I generally have quite a bit of stubble.  </li>
            <li>Other multi-blade products I have used tend to get clogged up with hair between the blades after just a few uses, but this razor is still clog free.  </li>
            <li>I was terrified of even trimming it incorrectly (leaving a bare spot, etc.), as it might take another 20 years or so to grow back!  </li>
            <li>It offers a close shave without tugging on my skin with minor irritations, if any.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I just have sensitive skin - but I have always perceived of the 5 blade razors as \\&quot;dragging\\&quot; a bit too long on my face - leaving noticeable bumps and irritation.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, if Gillette would only make these blades more affordable, but if you believe (like I do), that you get what you pay for is true, you won&#x27;t be the slightest bit disappointed, even with the blades.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the razor seemed heavy in my hand.</li>
            <li>Close, comfortable and clean shave with this bad boy.</li>
            <li>But the value-add for the new handle is minimal.</li>
            <li>The body is actually much stronger then I had previously assumed and has some heft to it.</li>
            <li>The additional lubrication on the strip is an added bonus as I have found the previous Gillette strips have lost lubrication too fast.</li>
            <li>Having tried the previous ProGlide Fusion and now the FlexBall technology, I don’t really see the added benefit of the FlexBall.</li>
            <li>However the largest drawback to this product is that the blades do not last much longer than the average multi-blade razor and after 5 shaves I started feeling the blades pull on the hairs rather than cut.  </li>
            <li>No toilet paper face...</li>
            <li>First off, let me get a few things out in the open.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the extra cost of the blades.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at what the flexball did, it made a smoother shave and the blade lasted for roughly a month at 3-4 shaves per week.</li>
            <li>It curved around the tough spots easily where I used to take a bunch of short strokes to get all the angles.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different razors over the past few months.</li>
            <li>and I see no difference in the closeness of the shave from the other type of Gillette I normally use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit this razor really does seem to live up to the hype, at least for me.</li>
            <li>Smooth, very hard to nick yourself.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with blades since I was 8 years old; started with the Wilkinson and later the Gillette single blade razor.</li>
            <li>At almost 50 years old I finally started shaving everyday for a new job and with this razor</li>
            <li>it gives an extremely close  shave the first time with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a skeptic about &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;improved&#x27;, but I&#x27;m all in with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology.</li>
            <li>The blades have retained their sharpness over quite a few shaves, something that certain razors can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>But it seemed like there was a little bit too much resistance with the flexball.  </li>
            <li>Because the FlexBall end allows the head of the razor to rock side to side, the new cartridge may not line up and click in as easily as other handles in the Fusion line.</li>
            <li>The curving of the head of the razor was a little different than what I was use to,but worked very well.</li>
            <li>I have used it multiple times now and the blades are still as sharp as new</li>
            <li>With my next shave, I used the regular Fusion ProGlide on one side of my face, and the Fusion ProGlide with new FlexBall handle technology on the other side.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; razor always seems to add another blade or some other gimmick that doesn&#x27;t amount to much (if it did it would put the single blade disposables out of business).</li>

            <li> A great razor .....</li>
            <li> I think the Mach-3 is a great balance of comfort and cost, and that&#x27;s my point of comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As described works great</li>
            <li> and he is quite happy with the performance.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> That was great.</li>
            <li> I still got a great close shave, so the ProGlide Fusion is still a great shaver.</li>
            <li> My face feels great</li>
            <li> And for that - I am a happy</li>
            <li> So I suppose Gillette will be happy to hear that.  </li>
            <li> , the packaging is great.</li>
            <li> Tried the Gillette Fusion with Flexball from a sample from Gillette and it works great.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be smoother than it ended up being, but it still worked out great.</li>
            <li> It was for testing and let me say Shaving with this product is great.</li>
            <li> I received one of these razors from Gillette as a promotion and have to say, it does work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since 1994, and I can say they continue to improve and provide me with a great shave.</li>
            <li> Truly a great Razor.</li>
            <li> great.</li>
            <li> The shave it gives is great.</li>
            <li> A great shave.  </li>
            <li> However, my Trac 2 did a great job, as have all the Gillette shavers I have used over 50 years now.  </li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re looking to try a good razor without the &amp;#34;electronics&amp;#34; - this is a good one!</li>
            <li> ▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy as this is a great razor to own and can be reused with the gillette fusion blades!</li>
            <li> Its amazing! stays contoured to me face and make every stroke count.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product good shave</li>
            <li> Nice job Gillette on this product!</li>
            <li> Once again I have been impressed by Gillette and will keep this as my razor till the come up with something even better.</li>
            <li> My Wife was very happy with this smooth, close shave!</li>
            <li> It seems like I am going to have to buy my own soon!</li>
            <li> And best of all, the blades didn&#x27;t gunk up the way most multi-bladed razors do.  </li>
            <li> It have a very nice rubber padding to give it a good grip.</li>
            <li> These razors are the best value for anyone wanting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Glides nicely when shaving and feels great afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It has a good weight and a good angle</li>
            <li> , I will say that the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot; technology provides a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> It was a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> Once I received it I tried it out an loved it</li>
            <li> Is good product shipped ontime.</li>
            <li> good quality materials</li>
            <li> If you want want to look good, and a close shave with no bumps on your face get the Gillete Fusion Proglide</li>
            <li> I have a beard that I sculpt, and I found this razor was a good razor to sculpt the edges and keep the hair edges flush.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to get some good shaving cream and keep using it for a while to see how it lasts..</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good, close shave for an affordable price, this product would be for you.</li>
            <li> Good improvement.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed at how well the proglide gave me a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> A good shave.</li>
            <li> Still, the Flexball razor from Gillette provides a forgiving shave at a surprisingly frugal price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a good, close shave, but it&#x27;s cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s a good razor and provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> (my wife said the swivel was good for shaving legs,</li>
            <li> so I guess this is good for women too).</li>
            <li> flexball head rotates perfectly and smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price for a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> my wife said this razor gave her a good shave.</li>
            <li> but this razor is awsome very easy to used and great results.</li>
            <li> That’s not a problem: the Fusion Proglide cartridge is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Just got this razor from gillette and let me tell you it works great very smooth,  will recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> He stated it is an exceptionally smooth shave, very easy to use, and the closeness of the shave was excellent.</li>
            <li> If you have never used the Fusion Proglide I would recommend it, the Flexball just makes a great razor even better.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this product and it is one of the best razor I have used.</li>
            <li> Will Buy more  ,Great Job</li>
            <li> This is a pretty awesome razor I haven&#x27;t found one that is like it price wise or quality.</li>
            <li> The blades are good for a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> All in a ll, a very good razor that leaves me feeling clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Great razor, and very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s the sound of this razor making an awesomely close and comfortable swipe of now bareskin across my face!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Pretty impressive for a &#x27;non-electric&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m sure every guy does!</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I still love the original</li>
            <li> I love the flex ball!</li>
            <li> is exceptionally better!</li>
            <li> I just shave?&amp;#34; He thinks he might actually be able to skip a day for a change!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the precision and the close shave!</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if Gillette had included a bonus blade, but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I received this Gillete Fusion ProGlide manual razor from Gillete, It&#x27;s getting better and better, I love how flexibly  and a how perfectly it moves.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from the brand for FREE!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor to try from Bzz Agent and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an attractive razor with a easy grip handle and the technology to cover every area of your face with ease.</li>
            <li> I am really happy I got this for free from Gillette through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I used a Gillette razor before, but this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing.</li>
            <li> I think this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Here Gillette does an amazing job with the enhancements on the Fusion ProGlide.  </li>
            <li> The amazing blade system is the star of this razor which is what should be the focus of a razor.  </li>
            <li> Proglide is amazing and should not be seen as just a mans product.</li>
            <li> What an amazing shaver.</li>
            <li> It also feels nice and weighty in my hand, which I like . .</li>
            <li> It has everything the non-power has to offer plus a nice vibration for a closer smoother shave.</li>
            <li> It works well, the &#x27;gliding&amp;#34; mechanism is nice but not mind blowing.</li>
            <li> This razor feels nice in my hand.</li>
            <li> I really liked the close shave it provided</li>
            <li> * own a Fusion handle</li>
            <li> I particularly liked that the blister pack that this razor comes in has a recycled pressed-paper backing.</li>
            <li> but I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a nice feel in your hand.</li>
            <li> I felt nice after I shaved and didn&#x27;t feel the need to shave again for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;noticed was that the razor itself had a nice heffty feel to it.</li>
            <li> As a side note, the feel of the handle is one of the nicest I&#x27;ve ever had -- surprisingly nice for something that costs $8.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave that contours with your face.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor gives me a nice close shave</li>
            <li> The swivel is nice to help from nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> In all honesty it is ok and does a good job, Sit pulls and is prone to nicking your face.</li>
            <li> Nice for wife, she used and liked the results also.</li>
            <li> I was buying this razor with my own money, I would probably wait until I could buy just the refill blades.</li>
            <li> However thd pivot movement of the flexball means the blades move from side to side, and so I ended up putting a nice slash into the side if my head.</li>
            <li> blades themselves are nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust a razor that shaved me of its own accord.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it does a nice shave.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my face with warm water and then applied some shaving cream and let it sit for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Still gillette will be my favorite brand is just that this wasn&#x27;t a good improvement.</li>
            <li> It moved around by chin and jaw line nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice balanced weight.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)</li>
            <li> ever it is the best razor you can get out there for the price which speaking of price its not that much at all</li>
            <li> The razor handle itself feels very sturdy and quality was not overlooked and almost has a perfect balance.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  </li>
            <li> A good shaving experience for sure.</li>
            <li> I feel like the rotating head sounds like a good feature, when in reality it seems to be more of a gimmick than an actuality.</li>
            <li> The price is a but more, but I do feel it gave a superior performance.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I noticed the benefits of the pivot ball, but I really liked the shave.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette to test, and while I was impressed, as always, with the shaving performance of the Fusion, I wasn&#x27;t overly convinced that the Flexball was making a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Good for two to three uses, with good, clean shaves.  </li>
            <li> Great close shave with out and discomfort, definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li> Awesome new razor from Gillette!</li>
            <li> I would rate this razor as a whole a 8 out of 10 with the caveat that no razor has made it any farther than an 8 leaving room for new innovation, the blade however has to be one of the best in both shave (noting handles involvement) and sharpness along with comfort of shave which could have everything to do with the technology, as one of the best on the market in both comfort and blade</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology for free to enjoy, and after using it for more than a month, I am still impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this new technology and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> but I am very happy about the new innovation in the swivel design.</li>
            <li> I used this new razor, I was impressed, I didn&#x27;t need to adjust my position at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been impressed by manual shaving razors but this new Fusion Proglide blew me away.</li>
            <li> But this Proglide, for once, I am actually impressed with one of these new handles.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s actually an incredible product and glides really well over my face with really nice precision and</li>
            <li> Depending upon how you shave, you&#x27;ll be delighted at how easily the razor glides over curves and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hand and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> One of the best razor I used thus far!</li>
            <li> I will be picking up more of these for sure!</li>
            <li> Here Gillette has taken a great razor and made it better with user friendly enhancements.  </li>
            <li> so having a good razor is important to my face.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide is the best of the Gillette razors line, thus far.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised on how wonderful this product is.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t recall ever having a better smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I thought the flexball was just a marketing ploy, but wow does it do a great job to allow me to reach all those contours of my face!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> By far, the Fusion cartridge razors are probably some of the best.</li>
            <li> Nice ergonomic design and glad I bought two for</li>
            <li> I read the reviews already posted about it, and I honestly thought people were just trying to look good in hopes for more free promotionals.</li>
            <li> like my sons, I was very pleased with how easily it glided over my knees and ankles - places that I often get nicks.</li>
            <li> It is a very good value and I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> pros: an outstanding smooth close shave, good handle grip, wears well.    </li>
            <li> With that said its a good razor, just nothing special.</li>

            <li> After using I came away with a very smooth shave and no cuts.</li>
            <li> I did not cut myself and I had a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving off the stubble is like applying paint, and the results are very smooth.</li>
            <li> VERY SMOOTH SHAVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology has an astonishing 5 blades and gives a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> But the handle itself is heavier and provides a more secure feel and &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like a better shave!</li>
            <li> Just upgraded to this and man I love it.  </li>
            <li> I may keep this one in my suitcase and use it more for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this will keep you looking sexy all day.</li>
            <li> &amp; i love how close the shave feels.</li>
            <li> With the swivel head and 5 blades, it makes shaving a breeze,no more nicks or cuts because it glides over the contour of your face.and gives you a smooth,clean shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Fusion Proglide that I was able to clip a coupon for and it had another $5 off coupon inside.  </li>
            <li> After many years of using the Gillette Sensor Excel, I tried out the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle.  </li>
            <li> This one is simply the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Proglide Razor with Flexball handle I opened the box and was pleased with the packaging for the razor.</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s excellent quality speaks for itself, but I would definitely wait for the blades to go on sale!</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette products for many years now.</li>
            <li> I have more than one version of Gillette razor cluttering up my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my experience with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to contort to make sure I&#x27;ve gotten everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology will be in my medicine cabinet for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I like both the Fusion Proglide Power and manual blades and tend to simply buy whichever I can find for the best price when I need more blades.</li>
            <li> Stylish design, but</li>
            <li> Ok-</li>
            <li> Instead of angling and re-angling the head of the razor, I was able to just shave through.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it one more try and conduct an experiment.  </li>
            <li> I can even shave over the problem area of my face - the top of my cheek bone just under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It also adapted to these angles better and didn&#x27;t cut or nick my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I wish the handle had a better grip.</li>
            <li> Many razors give me razor burn, but this one did not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my wife will continue to buy these for me</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Manual razor for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Gillete sent me this razor to try for free and I very much liked the results.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product when I ordered this razor from Gillette</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how close and smooth it gets and makes my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT EVERYONE BUY ONE</li>
            <li> i received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology, has a free sample from Gillette, well to be honest</li>
            <li> My mom got this free from the company to try out and tell how I liked it.</li>
            <li> and i always enjoyed them, so when this one came out i had to try it out,so i got one from Gillette</li>
            <li> With the flex-ball i can better get in all the groves of my face and head.</li>
            <li> The last 5 blade they came out with was the best razor on the market and to tell you the truth..</li>
            <li> The Flexball handle allows to razor to better hug the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> I am not a daily razor user, in fact more like a biweekly user at best.</li>
            <li> Previously I most often used some iteration of the Mach3, and the Fusion Proglide was much better.</li>
            <li> Also I was able to shave faster than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Adam</li>
            <li> Overall awesome product</li>
            <li> I wish the handle had a better grip.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used disposable razors for 10+ years, mostly Gillette Mach3.</li>
            <li> I used the FlexBall as a finishing razor since I use an electronic razor to do most of the shaving work.</li>
            <li> I give this razor an outstanding 9 of 10.</li>
            <li> have for so many years I cannot remember used electric razor.</li>
            <li> Most razors for whatever reason seem to cut me around my chin area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I had a chance to use this...</li>
            <li> The all-around feel of it is great.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the regular Proglide or , even better, the mach 3, still the best gillette razor in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I personally love the five blade design, since it seems to get a better shave then</li>
            <li> The latest gimmick is the swiveling head of this Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing more for him.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from Gillette but the opinions are entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I always wondered how many blades will it take for them to be satisfied that we are receiving the best shape ever, Over time there is been multiple changes in the way we have to conquer our beard.</li>
            <li> But I do have to rinse the blade more to unclog the blades.  </li>
            <li> I went in to this thinking I have tried and tried more blades on a razor and</li>
            <li> I give the guys at Gillette a thumbs up for continuing to try to make our shaving lives a bit better and easier, but this one for me is a no go.</li>
            <li> ▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> When I started feeling better, I had quite a bit of shag growing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure what the hype is about the flex ball.  </li>
            <li> As for the Flexball Handle Technology, to me it seems more like a gimmick.  </li>
            <li> I will need to use it more and see if the blade life is any greater than that of my 3 blade razor.</li>
            <li> It seems to make sense that the more ways the razor can flex and pivot, the better it will follow the contours of your face.  </li>
            <li> just use with care (since it IS A RAZOR after all), and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.be pleased.</li>
            <li> The blades are amazing - smooth and cut close.  </li>
            <li> Maybe there was a &#x27;break-in&#x27; period to loosen up the flexball, or maybe it was just me, but I love it now.</li>
            <li> much, MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I am one of those guys that thinks \\&quot;more is better\\&quot; when it comes to razor blades.  </li>
            <li> but I am okay with that.  </li>
            <li> Most guys I know shave there neck and face separate stopping at the jaw line.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I would pay more for the swivel head.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding.</li>
            <li> It mostly worked out well for my face.  </li>
            <li> This razor did a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> The ability for this razor to end the careers of many upward seeking hairs would make Donald Trump jealous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a great experience while shaving.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more out of this one.  </li>
            <li> I received a free gillette fusion proglide and I think its amazing compared to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly pleased at how close this head can get.</li>
            <li> But it gave a really smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I love how it gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> I love the Fusion blade technology this razor features.  </li>
            <li> This allows the cartridge to stay in contact with the face better.</li>
            <li> however I think it would provide an even better shave if it had a battery and vibrated.</li>
            <li> I also like how the hairs dont stay caught in between the blades which also provides to a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> If you like the Gillette predecessors like me you are sure to dig this one as well.</li>
            <li> The one aspect that&#x27;s somewhat lacking is the detail blade on the top.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I love the way it pivots around the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> The swivel head glides easily and forms to my face for a nice clean shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I fully clean shaved, It&#x27;d be a nice touch with the pivoting head -</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for and found it at Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I got a nice clean shave that day and each time I&#x27;ve used it since.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t remember exactly when) and said, &amp;#34;every man deserves a good razor for his birthday,&amp;#34; or something like that.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought hey this is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; handle was fine but more of a gimmick, IMO, than a really innovative technology.</li>
            <li> Stick with the original!</li>
            <li> I got this razor a few weeks ago im am very happy with the results you get the closest shave ever truely amazing</li>
            <li> so I may get a month out of 1 cartridge which would make the cost a lot more easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> What set it apart for me what the flex ball and how easy it was able to reach each hair on my face.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and makes shaving that much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that the razor glides any better because of this ball, but I do love the closeness and smooth cut the blades provide.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor that gave a very close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Just a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> but overall a very good razor.</li>
            <li> only used one time but seems to be very good quality</li>
            <li> This leaves him smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin like most razors.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free to try &amp; so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It enables the razor to go over the contours of my face more smoothly and, therefore, I wind up with fewer nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> The flexball and the tilt of the blade makes it great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will say that it gave me the most comfortable and closest shaves</li>
            <li> Technnology takes shaving to another, more comfortable level.</li>
            <li> The flexball handle created a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It enables the razor to go over the contours of my face more smoothly then my razors before and, therefore, I wind up with fewer nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I haven&#x27;t used a manual razor in years, however I was highly satisfied with how comfortably this shaves.</li>
            <li> Worked great with even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And just to be sure you understand, I did try this for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it goes with everything</li>
            <li> This gave me the closest and most comfortable shaving experience ever.</li>
            <li> Both razors are good and give a close shave so the choice is really your&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great new technology and gives your face a silky smooth feel that every woman will want to feel.</li>
            <li> A very smooth and clean shave at a somewhat hi cost.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other razors to keep a perfect groom style between visits to my barber.</li>
            <li> The comfort strip is excellent, as I expect from other Gillette products.</li>
            <li> I have tried manual, vibrating, and Mach3 razors and this razor was awesome in comparison to the other razors.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out!</li>
            <li> But I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with Gillette Fusion Proglide because even though I have sensitive skin I have received the perfect shave, and I have to say that the blades stay sharp much longer than any others I have used before.</li>
            <li> Because that razor was so much better than all the others I&#x27;ve used, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that a new version of the Proglide could be that much better.  </li>
            <li> shave once a week and this razor can easily handle the hair growth.</li>
            <li> easily it glided over my knees and</li>
            <li> It has a pivoting joint, which allows it to turn easily around curves.</li>
            <li> (Almost like cardboard, and easily recycled)</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you already have a Fusion, your just as well off with what you have, but I would easily recommend this to anyone using anything else to shave.</li>
            <li> This shaves close, easy to use; just the handle is bulky.</li>
            <li> no nicks, no scratches, and relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to control and extremely easy to rinse.</li>
            <li> The roller ball made this razor easily glide around the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> The Flexball Handle technology lets you get the closest shave and allows easy flexibility to shave from side to side.</li>
            <li> My husband reports that the handle is easy to use while shaving.</li>
            <li> The flexball handle was easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly metal, which gives it a good heft, but it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received unit from the brand for review, liked very much.</li>
            <li> (I admit it, I&#x27;m cheap), though after two weeks of shaving almost every day, I&#x27;ve not noticed the shave becoming rougher</li>
            <li> (I admit it, I&#x27;m cheap), though after two weeks of shaving almost every day, I&#x27;ve not noticed the shave becoming rougher</li>
            <li> I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I liked this razor better than some of the razors targeted toward women that are on the market, and will probably use this in the future when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> I was excited by the commercials and even more when I showed up at my door; I was dumbstruck by how smoothly and efficiently the razor worked.</li>
            <li> I probably am being influenced by advertising and my own naivety, but if they made a razor with 20 blades I would be the first in line to buy</li>
            <li> This makes it even more comfortable to get a clean, close shave with no injuries or burn.</li>
            <li> My name is Anthony and I have used many razors over the years nothing quite compares to the smooth and clean feel I get when I use the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor anyway, you might as well give this one a shot as it does a good job.</li>
            <li> But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li> The shave from this new razor is really good.</li>
            <li> And it is just fine</li>
            <li> I must say, I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> It shaves just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me.  </li>
            <li> The flex was OK without direction, but it was quite adequate when I directed it with my thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After getting used to the handle, I really enjoyed that razor, but the blades seemed to wear out fairly quickly considering the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new grip is amazing, and I Love it.</li>
            <li> The Mach3 is light and easy to use, even though the FlexBall flexes to fit the contours of my face.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best razors I have ever used, to go back to my old shaver which was pretty good seems like a step, backwards 10 years.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this to anybody out there who appreciates a good clean shave without cuts, nicks and pulling.</li>
            <li> That said, this razor does a fine job giving me a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Gillette, you really did a great job with razor and it only seems to get better with each one that comes out!</li>
            <li> That is quite fine, actually, because this blade has given me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a multi-blade system.</li>
            <li> at 5 am, I guess that isn&#x27;t a huge selling point for me.</li>
            <li> I got a close shave and the Flexball makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color.</li>
            <li> The flexball helps with the smooth ride.  </li>
            <li> Also, I got this product for free from Gilette to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wanted a cheap replacement.  </li>
            <li> This thing moves smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li> this razor has almost everything that I look for in a smooth shave, except for one thing.</li>
            <li> The razor is well made and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I started shaving and noticed that I was getting a really smooth shave all over my face.</li>
            <li> Yes, the additional hinge does help keep the blades parallel to the shaver’s skin – but it doesn’t make nearly as great a difference as the hinge on the cartridge (which was one of the Mach 3’s novel features).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or insubstantial.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave, leaving my skin smooth and irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is the same great handle you could expect from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver for as a promotional for free in the mail.</li>
            <li> It was indeed a smooth shave</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent with bzzagent.com, I received one free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall</li>

            <li> Thank you Gillete for creating one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used to shave after I cut my hair every few weeks or so.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a smooth comfortable shave with no pulling or irritation.</li>
            <li> I like this razor which  i got from Gillette to review the Gillette Fusion for free .</li>
            <li> Enhanced Lubrastrip® is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that allow the razor to move smoothly over your skin</li>
            <li> Big Win.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion free from Gillette to review............</li>
            <li> The flex ball handle allowed me to navigate easily and smoothly to a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> The experience was with the razor was fantastic..</li>
            <li> The shaver glided smoothly, over my face, and for once, I did not cut myself.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice as much of an advantage with the advertised improved grip, but the grip on the Mach-3 is nice</li>
            <li> I have to say that it does give a smooth  shave</li>
            <li> I just received the free razor from bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> Overall great razor.</li>
            <li> The razor I received for free from Gillette moves smoothly over my skin, even on repeat strokes.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Gillette to try out and review...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, did the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; contribute to how comfortable the shave was?</li>
            <li> Now when I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with flexball handle for free from Gillette, I thought that the flex ball would make a difference, but truly there is no difference.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this was a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of more stokes than the fresh out of the pack razor but it has yet to snag or cut.</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me one of these to try for free.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory.</li>
            <li> Yes, I enjoy the discounts at Costco, so there may be some play in this review.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly enjoying the Gillette Fusion Proglide -- I received a complimentary trial version from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> It left it nice and smooth and really liked the FlexBall technology to get around the sides and creases.</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me a free sample</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide razor with the Flexball from Gillette to try out.  </li>
            <li> I got a free Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology to try out.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just too light handed when shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used the same blade for a month and it is still working great.  </li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide razor from Gilette for free to try and review.  </li>
            <li> My shave was exceptionally smooth.  </li>
            <li> I received this a free promo</li>
            <li> but hey, why not try a free razor?</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette in the mail.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic feat of engineering.</li>
            <li> Received the product free from Gillette as a promotional offer.</li>
            <li> Overall I think its a great razor.</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette in the mail, so of course I used it.</li>
            <li> My shave this morning was incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> So when I saw a free trial of this razor from Gillette, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do keep some Fusion cartridges and a handle around in case I don&#x27;t have the time to use my vintage razor, which is more fun.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball is an extraordinarily smooth razor.  </li>
            <li> Then I received a free trial of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor with the vibrating handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I received a free trial of the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Shave Gel + Skin Care in combination with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology that I got for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette and my husband&#x27;s face is wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li> Good pivot/swivel action.</li>
            <li> For us guys that do shave our faces on a regular basis, the one thing we want to make sure we do is get a close shave that will leave us looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li> I did however notice that I got a much closer shave because it was able to form to my face better as I was shaving.</li>
            <li> You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting.</li>
            <li> Before receiving the Gillette razor, I wanted to know if my skin and face would be able to handle the movement of the FlexBall, and if this product was right for me.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t think the flexball really does anything special.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that this razor is worth changing out from the original Fusion Proglide!</li>
            <li> It has been all smooth, clean shaves with no stubble or irritations.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth, clean and close.</li>
            <li> All I need in a razor is a clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite razors!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this razor very much.</li>
            <li> Price seems a bit high for my budget but still a nice result.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised by the comfort and ease that came with such a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always try out the latest and greatest Gillette products, however, I&#x27;ve generally found that the new blades improve the shaving experience and not so much the razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor to test from Gillette and it has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I still love Gillette and love their products!</li>
            <li> Granted, I have a full, light beard but shave my neck/</li>
            <li> Given that experience, I was excited to try the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle</li>
            <li> unique thing about this Fusion Proglide razor is the Flexball handle.</li>
            <li> The unique feature to the Proglide is a ball that lets the blade swivel to the contours of  your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great razor, and by far my favorite multi-blade razor that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that this razor is worth it!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shave more than about twice a week with these razors because my skin is pretty prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any significant change from shaving with a non Flexball handle.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure I just found my permanent replacement.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the flexball or the blade, but I am extremely impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> As someone who never looks forward to my morning shave, I am actually excited to bust this out again tomorrow morning.</li>
            <li> was something I was truly excited to have the opportunity to use,</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product as it is the best I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> A clean close shave with no irritation or nicks.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the upgraded version and a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I loved the smooth glide over my skin and the closeness of each shave; however, the adam&#x27;s apple and sub-jawline areas still took considerably extra strokes to eradicate all of the stubble.</li>
            <li> My face was super smooth all over, which is something that should happen... and did.</li>
            <li> It leaves a clean shave finish without razor burn.  </li>
            <li> As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> But I can also say that I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;Shower shaver.&amp;#34; Meaning I shave in the shower and honestly I see only a marginal difference (for the better)</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve found this have much closer and has greatly reduced razor burn and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was lucky to sample one of these for free from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> The blades made for a quick, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> In one swipe I went from 4-5 days of growth to clean skin.</li>
            <li> To start, my eight year old son wanted to help me open the box as that the packing makes it look like a razor made for superheroes (that&#x27;s me) - impressive package and design.  </li>
            <li> I does a great job hugging the curves of my face and giving me a close clean shave with a single pass.  </li>
            <li> Overall, after my first straight razor shave in years, I was totally impressed.</li>
            <li> It had a very close shave and a very smooth feel to my face.</li>
            <li> This razor provided a very close and very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li> My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li> While this new technology does help get a closer shave, I am most impressed with how much this new handle helps make my daily shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The razor itself stays very clean and I also liked the feel and look of the overall handle.</li>
            <li> This alone puts this razon in a special class in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most guys, I have problems with certain parts of my neck.</li>
            <li> The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> This single blade come in very handy for neatly edging the beard.  </li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t she just take her pink razor and be happy?</li>
            <li> whatever they call it actually gives good head movement.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it would make that much of a difference and thought it might just be &amp;#34;gimmicky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say its a good razor, just not the one for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how much better a razor can get, but I applaud Gillette for continuing to try and upgrade their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think it really did that much better of a job then</li>
            <li> (The old fashioned kind).</li>
            <li> might be the full 5 stars.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: A good razor, especially considering it does flex.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology is a cool looking razor.  </li>
            <li> I have used the proglide for a month after I received it as a test sample from gillette and overall I feel it does a good job shaving</li>
            <li> overall a good razor</li>
            <li> , I will update the review with the service life for a razor as I continue to use the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using the same razor for over three weeks and still getting a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Looks cool.</li>
            <li> However, this razor is NOT as good as my regular Fusion.</li>
            <li> The flexball technology is innovative and definitely provides a closer, more precise shave.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary from BzzAgent for free  </li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t flex as much as it did on the commercials, I was able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that the FlexBall really made any difference...</li>
            <li> Regardless, I love the feel of the blades, and the handle is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for this awesome razor Gillette, I will never use any other brand besides Gillette!</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this razor its innovative and worth the money!</li>
            <li> It give a really close shave, and the handle is comfortable and easy to navigate.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the quick strokes in tough-to-reach areas of my face, I eventually learned to use even strokes over my entire face and chin and ended up with surprisingly good results.</li>
            <li> As I used it I noticed right away how comfortable it was.</li>
            <li> is great because it shaves along the contour of my face extremely well.</li>
            <li> The razor, like the non flexball version, is super sharp and will give you a great shave.</li>
            <li> Of course seeing “Free” just for reviewing or talking about it certainly helped!</li>
            <li> , I am a loyal Gilette fan.  </li>
            <li> And most important it glides over the face with, so far, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (*full disclosure: the item was provided to me free from Gillette*), which features a hinge on the handle, supplementing the range of motion offered by the hinge on the cartridge itself (the hinge on the handle swivels left-to-right, while the hinge on the cartridge swivels forward-and-back).</li>
            <li> I love the closeness and smooth shave that it offers.</li>
            <li> Good for several shaves and worth the money.</li>
            <li> It looks good (not a huge pro for me but the wife thought it was cute)    </li>
            <li> That said, it does give a decent shave, it&#x27;s quick, and it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> In particular it does a much better job on the curve of my chin.  </li>
            <li> A loyal Gillette user for years</li>
            <li> I tend to prefer razors marketed to and made for men over women because I find they are usually more solidly built and feel better in my hand.</li>
            <li> My husband related that this razor shaves his facial hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more blades for this one in the future (once I have saved up for them, that is.)  :-)</li>
            <li> I love the new Flexball, I have been using a Proglide Power for the last year and thought it gave a great shave, when I received a free trial of the new razor with the Flexball handle</li>
            <li> I get about two week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don&#x27;t do anything special to try to prolong their life.</li>
            <li> The FlexBall turned out to be a very nifty feature, as it makes shaving much easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> From the first shave to the 10th, my face is still as smooth as it was out of the box.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this I was very interested in how well the flexball worked.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with the razor.</li>
            <li> I found that the flexball allowed the razor to glide around and over my chin and jaw line nicely and clean better than the previous razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Another important thing to mention is that I received this particular model for free from Gillette in return for the review you are now reading...</li>
            <li> The flexball really does keep the blade close to the skin avoid cuts and ensuring a clean and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great razor that provides a close shave and cuts down on irritability.  </li>
            <li> Got my new Fusion Proglide with the Flexball Handle from Gillette and it was an interesting experience.  </li>
            <li> I got the Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette through the Buzz agent campaign and found that I had one more problem.</li>
            <li> Move over Gillette there is a new and better shhaver on the block</li>
            <li> very much enjoyed shaving with this new razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad razor by any means, but even the amazing Flexball will not get me to switch back from my Merkur.</li>
            <li> That said I think I&#x27;m willing to give it a try for awhile as it is providing a superior, longer lasting shave.</li>
            <li> It easy to handle and gives a very close shave along.</li>
            <li> The first day I used the razor I got the typical great shave I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette, however, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was any better than my current Fusion Proglide razor.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li> See my earlier review of theis new Schick shaving systemthat will surely be favored over Gillette within a year or so.</li>
            <li> these are great while shaving do to lotion in shaving creams helping keep a tight grip</li>
            <li> The shave it gave me was very smooth and complete.</li>
            <li> and I do think it provides a pretty clean shave.  </li>
            <li> The blades are far enough apart to allow for easy rinsing and cleaning, and they provide a good, close shave for about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Very good for face and head shaving, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I got this razor for free and I haven&#x27;t researched the price, I can&#x27;t really speak to the cost of the handle, or the cost of replacement blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why receiving this product for free thanks to Gillette was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I have mostly always been an electric shaver type guy and after receiving this from BZZAgent to try along with the sensitive proglide 2 in 1 gel,I have been hooked.</li>
            <li> Works better than the old one.  </li>
            <li> By the time I was done shaving, I wasn&#x27;t even able to use my old razors again.</li>
            <li> I have used several Gillette razors over the years and the ProGlide razor with flexball provides a nice close shave, just as i would expect from Gillette.</li>
            <li> DO use a razor to trim the surrounding area and to keep my &#x27;stache even on top and sides, and this razor is one of the smoothest I&#x27;ve used, and also offers me the closest shave I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> and he likes it, but the Flexball technology appeared to make this one worth a try.  </li>
            <li> so 3 people tried the razor, each using a fresh cartridge.</li>
            <li> Is it worth replacing whatever your using now?</li>
            <li> All I could think about beforehand was how a razor on a swivel simply doesn&#x27;t sound safe to use.  </li>
            <li> That said, I always use the most current version of the blades as soon as they are available.  </li>
            <li> I almost don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself when shaving in that area anymore which is perhaps the most impressive thing of all about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The pivoting action made sure that all the angles of my face were covered.  </li>
            <li> but if I ever do I would definitely keep this one handy</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of facial hair, mustache, beard side burns, with the flexball, it glides nicely.</li>
            <li> Great razor, especially if you have sensitive skin like myself.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Wow I never realized how much better my shave could be.  </li>
            <li> used the razor for the first time and from the first stroke it was a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> However, this gimmick is actually pretty cool and helpful.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that this razor is heavier so it felt more solid and comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that allows for such a nice shave, but I have to wonder about their durability.</li>
            <li> Also, the pivot function wasn&#x27;t as useful as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am guessing that&#x27;s why myself, and many others, got to try this for free from Gillette - they can make a mint back on us from buying refills for this.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced.</li>
            <li> But is it worth it?</li>
            <li> So take it for what it&#x27;s worth, and check your wallet as well.</li>
            <li> It may not have offered as close of a shave, but the Flexball aspect did make shaving an easier and more rote action.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I still prefer my old razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be tossing out the old Fusion handle in favor of the FlexBall and will probably end up using it more.</li>
            <li> she said the flexball was nice, but wouldn&#x27;t go out of her way in the future to use it again.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s difficult to improve on perfection because both gave me an excellent, smooth shave</li>
            <li> I have always used Gillette Razors but this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am still using this with the same blade, at this point most blades would require a change yet this one is still good by both indicator and cut without nicks due to dulling of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Where this technology shines is around the Adams apples of the throat and the contours of the chin making the glide a smooth effortless journey and in my case allowing for additional pressure to be applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product, however, the only thing I miss from this is the pulse technology that came with other Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> However, it reduces the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; I have when shaving, and that leads to more nicks and cuts, not less.</li>
            <li> Since then I have been pretty loyal to the brand.  </li>
            <li> A super easy to open tab that allows the razor to freely be removed from the package.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a smooth clean cut shave and my wife loves how soft my face is afterward.</li>
            <li> I cannot compare this to other good razors.</li>
            <li> , also loved the fact that this razor did not give me razor burn as for all the other razors do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The long and short - having more blades is good.</li>
            <li> $0.50 each or so, not bad well worth it as I’m actually getting more uses out of this product.</li>
            <li> this works as good as any other over priced fusion razor..</li>
            <li> The weight of the handle feels just right to me and it is ergonomically pleasing.</li>
            <li> The Lubrastrip helped the razor glide right across my face without any pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li> The Lubrastrip on the cartridge helps it glide right along, which seemed to help keep away the razor burn.</li>
            <li> you can re-position and get it to click right</li>
            <li> However, with the price of just one of these razors, and how often one is &#x27;recommended&#x27; to buy new ones, I would be broke very quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that is shaves better, since the blades are the same, but it is easy to use and glides around the face very well.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor gives a really close, clean shave, without nicking the skin.</li>
            <li> Sure the swivel ball sounds like a cool idea, but I didn&#x27;t think it was enough to change products permanently.</li>
            <li> The Flexiball handle really makes the razor work even better than a normal Gillette Fusion, and that is saying tons.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, that sixth blade was a good one to see ahead of time, since flipping the razor over is usually how I smooth my sideburns before squaring...</li>
            <li> The swivel was designed perfectly to bend to my face because the swivel moves not only side to side but also up and down.</li>
            <li> He highly recommends this razor because it provides a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It was very smooth and not a single knickknacks.</li>
            <li> A high quality razor that has held up and still feels as good now as when I first started using it weeks back, and</li>
            <li> (I have historically used Gillette Fusion Power), this is the first new release that has impressed me enough to consider upgrading.  </li>
            <li> The flexball gives the razor a unique look, but performance wise does very little</li>
            <li> new Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle is another in the fine line of razors.</li>
            <li> The first day he tried it, he had 5 days worth of growth</li>
            <li> No nicks as I experienced from razors of the past.</li>
            <li> From now on, the slick motion and function of the flexible handle is what I&#x27;m sticking with, unless they make another great improvement...</li>
            <li> (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was super easy to access from beginning (always a +); the blade was very familiar to the other Gillette Fusion blades; the pivoting head on the razor seemed to work better than the regular Gillette Fusion razors...</li>
            <li> I got my razor free to test out from Gillette and see how their new technology works.</li>
            <li> I was elated to get a free sample of the new shaver in the mail.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me their new razor free for review.  </li>
            <li> First, I was surprised at the quality of the shave -- very close, very smooth, with no bumps or razor burn at all.</li>
            <li> When Gillette sent me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology to try, I figured it would be just as good as the previous ProGlide Razors I have used.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and view a great shave as one of life&#x27;s simple pleasures I would definitely recommend upgrading to the Flexball razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I actually love the vibrating version and would recommend that for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Have used the regular Fusion for a few years, I tried this on a whim, I am very happy with the feel of an even cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> and they are of typical Gillette good quality.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how smooth the shave</li>
            <li> I also like the wide gaps between the razors so hair easily rinses out without much bother while offering that close, very smooth</li>
            <li> I use safety razors as I find them more economical and usually I feel like they give a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> all said, I DO very much like the heft of the ProGlide handle and ball.</li>
            <li> The shave is very smooth and effortless around the different contours of my face.</li>
            <li> In both versions, I get a nice clean shave with little effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the handle -- good rubber grip, little thicker handle.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle adds a new flair to the original design of the disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was excited to test the new FlexBall technology.</li>
            <li> So smooth like the old model, but this Razor is very much like the Vacuums of today.</li>
            <li> Especially for special occasions where I want tobe really smooth.</li>
            <li> Most recently I had a fusion power</li>
            <li> I have now used the razor 4 times and it still shaves like the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor for anyone with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s so smooth..</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve always wished I had more facial hair to shave.</li>
            <li> He also got a close and comfortable shave without nicks on his chin or near his Adam&#x27;s apple, where he almost always gets a nick.</li>
            <li> biggest curiosity prior to receiving the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology was whether or not the added Flexball technology would safe to use.  </li>
            <li> The flex ball isn&#x27;t exactly a ball, but creates a pivot point that allows it to hug your face without causing any nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a pretty angular face</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this product as it has replaces my old non flexball handle.</li>
            <li> The first thing I</li>
            <li> I have recently received a Fusion Proglide straight razor from Gillette to try out and was totally amazed with the shave I experienced with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for five weeks, and most razors last 3-4.  </li>
            <li> better than the razor iv&#x27;e been using for the past 10 years, i never thought i&#x27;d find a better one</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> Now I only need to make sure I hide it from wife.</li>
            <li> It feels funny shaving and not maneuvering around to get all your face</li>
            <li> The flexball technology does exactly what it says it does on the commercials</li>
            <li> Not enough to make me go out and buy the latest version.</li>
            <li> and i did drop it using it for the first time and this one shortcoming keeps me from giving this razor a five star review.</li>
            <li> However, with the free trial that was offered to me by Gillette, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 stars for the mobility of the razor, (since its the first time I haven&#x27;t got cut on a razor on my chin after using it.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Kinda funny</li>
            <li> I was able to cross my jaw line both against and with the grain.</li>
            <li> First off, I received this from Gillette itself to test for them.</li>
            <li> I like this razor but not enough to pay more for replacement blades than I’m paying for Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> In short I love it.</li>
            <li> It was a first job</li>
            <li> but initial impression is totally satisfied and he has one of those beard growths that has him often saying, &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> , was that it tends to take more than a simple rinse to get all of the shaving cream out.</li>
            <li> It gives me exactly what I would expect.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the razor and am about to order a refill pack of blades.</li>
            <li> the only difference is I have more nicks, 1 for every blade</li>
            <li> The first day I tried both</li>
            <li> It really does flex!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I tried the swivel head for the first time</li>
            <li> The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
            <li> I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li> Whether it actually makes a difference with the ball and adapting to my face, I cannot be sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first razor that has made shaving my head a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this razor.</li>
            <li> and I thought most Gillette razors were the same</li>
            <li> The occasional patch of razor burn has become increasingly more infrequent with prolonged use of the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall technology.</li>
            <li> After using it a couple more times though the FlexBall really is starting to shine.</li>
            <li> I use both manual and an electric razor and recently I found myself going to my electric more.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it until it mysteriously made its way from the sink into the shower after a week.  </li>
            <li> I am more than likely to purchase these to give them another shot.</li>
            <li> What I found interesting is that they seem to last longer on the Flexball razor than the Power razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bzz Agent and Gillette Fusion Proglide!</li>
            <li> and I found that I was having to reapplying shaving gel after the first pass.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, one aspect that does cause a fair amount of trouble is around my adam&#x27;s apple and on both sides of the neck, just below my jawline.</li>
            <li> Give me a few blades, some shaving cream, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> worked great for me and my wife, we both used the same cartridge for almost 3 week, me daily and her every other day and on the 3rd week it probably would have still been great</li>
            <li> The razor itself is kinda like that Dyson vacuum with the ball joint that can hug corners like Mario Andretti except for your face and it gets much better gas mileage.  </li>
            <li> The added range of motion provided by the ball became instantly evident when I was able to cleanly clear a sizable portion of my face in one clean cut without having to pick up the razor and adjust the blade to a different angle.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a clean shave</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve been using the old Fusion Proglide for about a year and liked it better than several others that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and true to its words it does contour very well to you face very well.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and does its job as any other G-products.</li>
            <li> The Proglide aspect of the razor was not as effective as other brands that I have used</li>
            <li> It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li> It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> I have scar tissue in my shaving area and have a tough time getting a good smooth shave because of the &amp;#34;geography&amp;#34; of my skin in some areas - thus my skepticism.  </li>
            <li> It pivots up and down, like most razors with replaceable blade cartridges, but it also pivots from side to side!</li>
            <li> how many new razor models come out and find most of them gimmicky.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide  Flexball razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> Basically, if you&#x27;re deciding between this razor and a more expensive one, then this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> and this razor has been great in not only getting to the hard to reach places but to give a smooth shave on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> I imagine if I regularly shaved areas that had more curves (e.g. arms, chest, legs, etc) - then pushing down and pivoting the blade might be more useful.</li>
            <li> I generally have thought that there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference between the easy disposable razors and the high-end ones, but this razor changed my mind.</li>
            <li> I received my Fusion Pro Glide from Gillette and My experience with the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide was largely a positive one.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the swivel was a bit of a gimmick at first, but the articulation was actually really helpful.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a reflection on the product, but a fact to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a very close, smooth, and cut free shave that appeared to stem partially from the flexball technology.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I vpbeen using this for a really long time.</li>
            <li> It really acted like a disposable but with a higher price tag.</li>
            <li> Really gets the job done for the first 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> After using the razor for several weeks, I found that a description / product name can sound better than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if the vibration helped anything, but I can&#x27;t help the feeling that I am not doing as good a job shaving anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a full beard since 2009 and this razor by far gives the easiest mobility to shave my cheeks and neck with out worrying if I accidentally took a swipe out of my beard.</li>
            <li> my shaves are quick, easy, smooth and last long.</li>
            <li> One of the nice things about cartridge razors is they allow the blades to go up and down to keep contact with the face.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the regular Fusion ProGlide and have been pretty happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li> Overall, Gillette is a great brand that I enjoying using, but this razor in particular is not right for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite feature, as Gillette addressed the main problem with these multi-blade razors by adding such a simple solution that&#x27;s so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> equates to more kisses due to smoothness and duration of smoothness, and as we all know the value in the is enormous, love knows no bounds except a scratchy face</li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at Gillette, I was given the opportunity to try the new Fusion ProGlide with new FlexBall handle technology for FREE.</li>
            <li> I believe in being frugal, but the misery of razor burn, coupled with the added frustration of a new hobby, makes me think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you are in the market for a new razor.</li>
            <li> The Flexball Handle Technology allows the razor to easily follow ever contour of my face while maintaining constant contact with my skin.</li>
            <li> It was easy to open and get access to the product.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.</li>
            <li> This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!</li>
            <li> and I used the single blade on the top of the head to shape around this area.  </li>
            <li> I am still trying to get used to the large handle</li>
            <li> It certainly did it&#x27;s job of reducing friction</li>
            <li> The razor moves with your face, which is certainly something that my Mach 3 doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the new look until my girlfriend made it known she wanted &amp;#34;her&amp;#34; &#x27;stache back.</li>
            <li> The five blades do an excellent job of shaving with fewer passes and have remained sharp over the past week.  </li>
            <li> It was fine, but no big shakes for him.</li>
            <li> Also, packaged with the razor is a nice little plastic tray to set the razor on after your shave, keeping the head of the razor off the counter.</li>
            <li> pro glide gives a very clean clean and easy shave that last all day … no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> just like it says it is and also love the fact that it has 5 blades but not only that all the fusion razors take the same blades so there for you don&#x27;t have to buy special blades for the particular one</li>
            <li> I am certainly inclined to stick with the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology simply for the smooth comfort of the shave alone.</li>
            <li> The best part is that the two motions can happen at the same time, which works fantastically for reaching those tough to shave angles on the side of the chin and jaw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for over 20 years, all the way back to the Sensor, and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the closeness of the shave, and the powered Fusion shaves particularly smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife is unapologetic about her thievery and says it is the best razor she has ever used and loves how it hugs her curves without getting rough with her delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I like just changing the razor head and replacing the whole razor.</li>
            <li> Really follows the contoursof my face.</li>
            <li> the Fusion Proglide really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> It may very well have given the closest shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> I got a very close shave on fewer passes.</li>
            <li> It was quite gentle on my skin as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Thanks</li>
            <li> It really glides along with your skin.</li>
            <li> The flexball really helps on those tricky spots.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for sending me this one.</li>
            <li> normal downstroke first and then an upward cut to get the leftovers.  </li>
            <li> Even after about 20 shaves with one cartridge they give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and the blades rinse out much easier than others.  </li>
            <li> it was very flexiable</li>
            <li> This razor is absolutely the exception because of one feature, a trimming razor on the reverse side.</li>
            <li> My package just arrived it works really well</li>
            <li> it really does a grat job i would recomend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> The flexball doesnt really move all that much.</li>
            <li> and my face thanks them for it.</li>
            <li> it was a smooth transition to the different contours on my face.  </li>
            <li> While it would increase the number of strokes necessary for shaving the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, flatter surfaces, I wonder if a more narrow head might better serve the Flexball&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin, versatile.</li>
            <li> The flexball really doesn&#x27;t add anything to my shave.</li>
            <li> In fact, the whole time I have shaved with Gillette cartridge razors I have never once cut myself.    </li>
            <li> This razor gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The flexball technology is really neat.</li>
            <li> The question will be how much are replacement blades?</li>
            <li> That really does matter if you&#x27;re prone to get razor-burn.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this razor to a friend.</li>
            <li> but I find myself always more careful with this handle.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a manual razor, so I can&#x27;t really judge that.</li>
            <li> If I switch to anything, it&#x27;ll be a safety razor or straight blade.</li>
            <li> The flexball really does help with the curves of the neck.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the floating head.</li>
            <li> but really, why?</li>
            <li> The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale.</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it.</li>
            <li> This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to shave in straight lines, so I didn’t really see how the FlexBall added to my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Even when I tried to ‘use’ the FlexBall while shaving, I didn’t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> He said he will be sticking with those since he didn&#x27;t see much, if any, improvement for him in shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waited about 2 weeks to write this review, as i wanted to really get a feel for it before</li>
            <li> The blades still stay in a straight line, so</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette</li>
            <li> With just a bit of pivoting, the FlexBall can maneuver the blade just enough to comfortably shave my chin and neck with one or two passes.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to go over my face as often because the flexball really does follow the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> This thing is legit, and that&#x27;s just the whole story.  </li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY think you&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s a darn smooth shave in just one pass.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me a lot of the razors for women invariably end up being too much plastic and too much &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really am a fan of the results of my shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for sending me a razor to try.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a light beard (and don&#x27;t shave my upper lip)</li>
            <li> I really did not feel the flexball working</li>
            <li> Flexball didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, but had some irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for letting me test out this razor.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and the flexball handle technology works</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a solid razor, silky smooth as it glides around your face neck.</li>
            <li> It gave a very close shave</li>
            <li> I recently received this razor free from Gillette in order to try out and review.  </li>
            <li> the name and technology behind the razor sounded great.  </li>
            <li> Also, the FlexBall handle did not seem to move smoothly across my face and I had difficulty using it especially when going from a side to side motion.  </li>
            <li> No muss, no fuss and very close to a blade shave.  </li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve gone back and used a Mach 3, in fact, I&#x27;ve been struck by just how big a difference there is between that product and the far superior 5-blade Fusion (or its slightly-improved successor the Fusion Proglide).</li>
            <li> Quality feel, nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> recieving the fusion proglide from gillette it go to show the professional quality you use in building your razors from the close shave to following the contours of your face its top quality,id recomend gillette fusion and gillette products to anybody.....</li>
            <li> I keep a low cut beard, but like to keep it clean by cleaning up extra growth around my cheek bones and neck - all razors get this done just fine, since it&#x27;s not much to shave, but the razor was very nice as far as keeping contact and only taking a couple of swipes to get everything done.</li>
            <li> With a truly awe-inspiring beard, I use a razor to clean up my neck and ensure straight and clean lines down my cheek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for the latest gadgets, bells and whistles, and other so-called improvements that more often as not are changes for the sake of increased sales and offer no improvement in the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The purported benefits of the new FlexBall Handle Technology, is that it responds to every contour of your face as if it&#x27;s been aware of them for years.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a bit scheptical but always like new adventures.</li>
            <li> While I got this particular sample through the Amazon Vine program, I had already switched to using Fusion and purchased several on my own last month.</li>
            <li> This razor is much better than any of the other razors I have tried.</li>
            <li> I know most guys with a lot of facial hair would want the exact opposite</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use sang more force than I did on other spots of face.</li>
            <li> This razor is exceptionally sharp, probably more so than my wit.</li>
            <li> It is smooth on the skin and contours to the face nicely, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a big step forward for Gillette.</li>
            <li> ,  I also normally have to make multiple passes with a disposable razor which naturally causes more irritation.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is better than some other automatic razors in consideration of price, quality and function.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I was DRY SHAVING, I found that the Gillette razor easily glided on my face and eliminated all of my hair.</li>
            <li> My main gripes with this, or really any disposable razor these days, are 1)</li>
            <li> A very close and comfortable shave, probably the closest shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first that this razor would really be worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> The single blade on the back is a great idea for what I see as the only multi-blade system weakness ...</li>
            <li> I have used every razor to mankind and find that the Schick hydro wins with hands down giving you a comfortable shave with built in gel that outlasts Gillette.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I would prefer, a little lighter would be better, but overall a very high quality product that delivers a very close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this razor for anyone who wants a shave that&#x27;s easier on their skin.</li>
            <li> in all, it is definitely worth the cost to update your old razor to one with the new Flexball.</li>
            <li> It has a single-blade opposite the five main blades for edging and clean up.</li>
            <li> Very clean shave and sharp blades that minimize pulling.</li>
            <li> Not only was it the most thorough, quickest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, but the product is at such a top quality that is blows every other razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frugal guy and don&#x27;t normally buy razors that cost this much.  </li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s closer than I thought it would get for such a sensitive blade, but I prefer a bit more control when shaving since I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how cost effective it is yet,</li>
            <li> I tried to shave the tight area between the very bottom of my nose (under my nostrils) and the top of my mustache with the 5-bladed razor head.</li>
            <li> I even had to put it down and pick up my Mach 3 just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have some type of hand muscle thing going on....</li>
            <li> As for the new flex ball handle, I like it although it feels like I have to be more careful than normal because I feel like it&#x27;s going to slip and cut my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the razor doing any pivoting or flexing or whatever they say it does, so it seems to be mostly marketing hype like all their other \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; razors.</li>
            <li> Until this new Schick came out i was Inlove with the Fusion, but no longer!</li>
            <li> I really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide line of razors and this new one with the Flexball</li>
            <li> The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the new flex ball technology and see if it really lived up to the claims made.  </li>
            <li> So that is why I really took interest in the new FlexBall handle when I read about it.</li>
            <li> the lube strip works great for the 1st shave, just OK for the 2nd, and even if the blades are sharp enough for more shaves than that, the lube strips are useless; and 2)</li>
            <li> The new combination lubricating strip was also a welcome surprise, as it left my face feeling smooth, without the embarassing nicks and patches others leave behind!</li>
            <li> that allows you to cover more area with less strokes.</li>
            <li> Although it does slightly swivel, it felt like more of a gimmick to me than a must-have.  </li>
            <li> Many fewer repeat strokes to get the odd missed hair around chin and jaw line without any razor burn or nicks to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was super stoked about getting another Gillette product, especially another ProGlide.</li>
            <li> (More refill sales!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the smoothness of the shave itself, I noticed the following bullet-points in some of the promotional material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice feel in the hand, was surprised at how heavy it was.</li>
            <li> Negatives on this razor mainly come with the price of the blades.</li>
            <li> Love the flexibility, and the fact that it use the same blades as earlier Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - I&#x27;ll be sticking with my electric razor and older ProGlide for closer shaving if needed.</li>
            <li> It left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Well, this is a decent cart razor,no doubt.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and solid razor, good grip, swivel action not much of use for me but am sure over time I would get use to it</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be switching from that, mainly for cost reasons.</li>
            <li> I would like to mention that my facial hair is very coarse and this might have been one of the reasons that I did not have a better experience than others.  </li>
            <li> I noticed no issues going around knees, under arms, and certain other spots (which will remain unmentioned in light of not providing TMI).</li>
            <li> I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves how soft my face is after using this razor from heaven!</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal fan of Gillette for a long time and will probably never switch from the brand, unless it is to a straight razor.</li>
            <li> They razor wasn&#x27;t rotating to the extreme they show in the commercials, but it was able to hit those subtle curves so nicely.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this razor.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to a peer.</li>
            <li> Then I’m thinking the price of the replacement cartridges are going to be sky high over the Mach 3, but to my amazement the cost difference is negligible.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The shave was really smooth and much faster than any other razor on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the 1st time ive used this razor i have NEVER went back to a womens or used any other kind.</li>
            <li> I held off on any review to be sure if what I was experiencing wasn&#x27;t just the typical new blade honeymoon.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> nick easy (though it is wicked sharp)</li>
            <li> and I feel like I would have had to push to hard to make it work effectively on my face.  </li>
            <li> (My sons clean and dry their razors every day</li>
            <li> Shaving in the morning is soft and fast with this razor.</li>
            <li> But ball does not really make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the razor for a few weeks now, I can say that I am truly pleased with</li>
            <li> I normally use a safety razor.</li>
            <li> The handle is the same as a regular Fusion handle but at the top it splits apart and there is a hinged ball and sprig to allow for some pivoting action.  </li>
            <li> normally get things through Buzz Agent, but this one came from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as it says by actually hitting every hair and giving a much closer shave than I am used to.  </li>
            <li> No complaint so for…….</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard.</li>
            <li> I must admit that the first few shaves with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle have been amazingly comfortable and quite close.  </li>
            <li> normal blades can miss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally an electric razor user, but I figured I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> My wife had asked me did I change razors or put a new bladed on my old straight razor that I had been using</li>
            <li> Not being able to press very hard makes it very gentle on your skin while still being a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i am always looking for a new razor to keep down the burn and let me shave comfortably more frequently than every 3 days,</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion proglide contours to the curves in my face and easily cuts coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li> first experience with the razor was that it seemed pretty much the same as my older, regular ProGlide.</li>
            <li> On top of the regular multi-blade shaving surface, there&#x27;s an additional single blade on the edge.  </li>
            <li> Always used a single blade or at most a double blade.</li>
            <li> I will most likely pick up a refill pack though there are times that the Mach-3&#x27;s lower price point (the Proglide is roughly 50% more expensive for refills) will sway me that way.or such a nice shave, but I have to wonder about their durability.</li>
            <li> As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction.</li>
            <li> It just gives a remarkably close shave and does cut down on skin irritation because you have to use less strokes.  </li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp and they last a good while, but only as long as you clean them after you us them.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as cheap as Gilette&#x27;s other Fusion ProGlide blade refills.</li>
            <li> The cut is as smooth and close as Gillette&#x27;s other five blade razors</li>
            <li> The new blades, or what I think are new blades, are giving me the closest shaves ever.</li>
            <li> If you already have a Fusion / Fusion Proglide handle without the Flexball swivel, don’t bother buying this new product.</li>
            <li> With the new flex ball handle i find I can do a one stroke</li>
            <li> but I had a new package of Fusion cartridges in my house</li>
            <li> The Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall is my new razor.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it worked and so did the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems like razor manufacturers are always coming out with new gimmicks</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide&#x27;s new razoe with teh flexball handle does that in a way that I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why when I bought the new razor with the new handle</li>
            <li> When I received the new Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology</li>
            <li> Well, I received an email to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> When blade is new this thing glides.....</li>
            <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new razor</li>
            <li> when using this new 4 blade razor as opposed to the 3 blade Mach 3.</li>
            <li> However since receiving this new handle I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively and have put my electric razor away at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new swivel feature wasn&#x27;t as impessive as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> My husband has been going through a new appreciation go the shaving ritual.</li>
            <li> I was given a new gillette proglide flexball as part of the flexball promotion.</li>
            <li> I just received my new Gillette Fusion Pro-glide razor.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, that did not turn out to be the case, but I&#x27;m still VERY careful when it comes to shaving and trimming it and the surrounding</li>
            <li> Just as important, the thin blades do not clog as easily and are easier to clean than other multi-bladed razors I have used.</li>
            <li> However after trying the new Proglide razor from Gillette not only am I mainly using this razor now, but I am making sure I have enough time in the morning for a proper shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with previous fusion blades, the head will clog easily with stubble if not rinsed often.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few more micro cuts while shaving when I used this razor as opposed to my old one.  </li>
            <li> I really did not notice much difference in the quality of shave from this razor compared to earlier versions of the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by how much smoother the shave was than my old razor.</li>
            <li> The movement of the blade is subtle but effective, no nicks, cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> The flexball really doesn&#x27;t do anything major for me.</li>
            <li> however I have very sensitive skin around my neck and</li>
            <li> She was very surprised of the close shave that it gave and the smoothness of my face.</li>
            <li> I had given up on manual razors because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The flexball feature definitely adjusts to the natural contours of my face, certainly makes shaving over my cheekbones and neck much easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one negative is at some point I will have to buy new razor blades, but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> so they get much more use out of a single cartridge after the lubricating strip has long been used up.</li>
            <li> : the swivel head does not appear to do much good    cons: I find the head is too big in some places, the top single blade is slightly difficult to use.    </li>
            <li> son with an average to light beard but</li>
            <li> The first thing I notice was the solid feel in my hand.</li>
            <li> When I used my old razors, I used to feel some irritation around the corners of my chin that I thought was normal.  </li>
            <li> first the double blades, then triple, then quadruple and now the five blade with pivot head.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth it and one that I will keep using for a long time.</li>
            <li> So for the past couple of weeks I have been enjoying my morning shave with both the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I generally shave in straight lines</li>
            <li> I usually use a Mach 3, but I found this one held to the contour of my face better and the blade lasted one shave longer than Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Next year, maybe there will be a real neutron beam atomic phaser shaver!  </li>
            <li> That is the less fortunate who never had a chance to try the new ProGlide line.</li>
            <li> The only place it still can&#x27;t reach is right under my nose, which is ironic given the TV ads Gillette is running show various men scrunching up their faces to reach that spot.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I thought of when I saw the razor with the ball thing is the vacuum with the ball thing.</li>
            <li> But it offers at least the same good shave as other Fusion handles and it does look cool.</li>
            <li> First of all, this razor is light to the feel and when shaving I can hardly tell I have anything against my skin.</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth clean shave and does it in half the time of my other disposables.</li>
            <li> To achieve a particularly smooth shave, my straight edge needs to be sharp enough to shave granite.</li>
            <li> also like that the old Fusion blades are compatible with this new handle.</li>
            <li> gave a GREAT shave , I have a few scares and usually they get cut -up, not  with this Razor .</li>
            <li> I get less nicks and cuts or none at all because of the smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to make jokes about Gillette&#x27;s evolving product line: every few years the company adds another blade (or two) to their cartridge and changes the color of their razor handle.</li>
            <li> As someone with a wide, curvy face, I was quickly taught that the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology is the razor that I&#x27;ve been waiting for since I was a teenager.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The refill blades are a substantial step up in price from the average Mach 3 blades - costing about 2/3 more even in the larger multipacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He usually uses an electric razor but uses a blade razor before important meetings or photo ops or other special occasions when a very close shave matters.</li>
            <li> When I asked him how it worked out for him, he told me the same thing, except he uses the cheap disposable single blade razors.</li>
            <li> my case, it is about the same, however I have noticed that I have not cut myself as much with the new handle vs. the old one.</li>
            <li> Ultimately it helped to get around my entire face and flexed easily to the different angles on my face.</li>
            <li> ,  you wouldn&#x27;t think that razors could really do anything special, but this did push that notch a bit further compared to other razor companies.</li>
            <li> .. shaving blades are very sharp, shaving is very fast and leaves skin soft, I&#x27;m really loyal consumer of gillette fusion for several years</li>
            <li> So I finally got to try this new razor; my beard is strong and I use the razors to trim or shape my beard, but I always had a hard time to get rid of hair or skin cells left in between the blades; the new swivel head helps me tremendously getting the space clear of muck from shaving.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving regularly (daily, or every other day) and this razor was amazing for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> It handled all the curves pretty well - but not really any different than most other mens razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The 3 star rating is because while the razor itself is good, I think the Flexball is a little gimmicky.</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;ve been able to shave my whole face with less effort; and, at the end of my shave, I find I consistently have less unshaved foam left on my face, which indicates to me that I got a close shave.</li>
            <li> Did have an issue with cartridge not locking securely onto unit - took 3 tries to engage properly.</li>
            <li> If you clean and dry the blades after each use they will last a lot longer before they need replacing.</li>
            <li> I used it with the sensitive shave gel.</li>
            <li> Follows facial contours really well.  </li>
            <li> This razor far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> and you’re looking to buy one, the Flexball Handle does represent a marginal improvement on the old product.</li>
            <li> It naturally curves with my face</li>
            <li> Something as simple as a straight razor has evolved over years, adding gripped handles, thinner blades, and comfort strips.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I think this will replace my old Gillette Mach 3 which I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> The five blades give me a cliose shave without nicks and without irritation of my sensitive skin;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> have used this razor a few times and am still getting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely say that that these components really do make a difference.</li>
            <li> Well, the Gillette Fusion Proglide amazed me, it really was different from others.</li>
            <li> It really did glide along my face, especially under my nose.</li>
            <li> I found myself using my thumb to direct the ball (and therefore the head).</li>
            <li> FlexBall did work reasonably well overall;</li>
            <li> MY FACE FEELS YOUNG</li>
            <li> It just glides over face and really gets the facial hair thoroughly off.</li>
            <li> One pass over your face is a real time saver to a daunting task that has to be done daily.</li>
            <li> and I treat them more delicately.</li>
            <li> I tend to use my blades far longer than recommended</li>
            <li> I tend to use my blades far longer than recommended</li>
            <li> I also shave everyday to keep the skin smooth and silky for the lady.</li>
            <li> I have been using gillette since I started to shave when I was young.</li>
            <li> I did like it, but its not like I would replace my old one for this one.</li>
            <li> Everyone do yourselves a favor and throw away your old razors and buy this one</li>
            <li> It might, but I don&#x27;t believe it matters as much for the overall shave.</li>
            <li> had no trouble hanging on to that one.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.</li>
            <li> In fact, when checking the next morning, the shave is really close (</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the smoothness of the shave from my regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Well I was pleasantly surprised to use this razor.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I have to say that compared to my old razor, I got a closer smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this razor cut my beard without pulling.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> I gave it a once-over before lathering up, and was surprised to see 5 blades in tandem on the one side,</li>
            <li> Overall, the razor feels very well made.  </li>
            <li> Old Trusty, if you will.  </li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion free from Gillette to review a few weeks ago and let me just say...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards.</li>
            <li> The title to this review completely sums up my opinion of the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor.</li>
            <li> I honestly have never gotten such a close shave that I didn&#x27;t have to go back in a few places.</li>
            <li> I find it weird more than useful</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would provide a good shave, as I tend to prefer an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first that a design such as the new ProGlide would make any kind of difference.</li>
            <li> The next two days I used the Flexball to shave one side of my face and the current fusion to shave the other and I can tell you that the blade definitely tracks the contours of the face much better with the Flexball and results in a more efficient shave (few strokes).  </li>
            <li> I also very much like the single blade on the reverse side for trimming purposes, it does help reach places that I otherwise couldn&#x27;t with my harrys razor.</li>
            <li> I mean how many razors are they going to make and</li>
            <li> But if you think about how long the blades on the refills last, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the new Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology to everyone who wants to get a closer shave than they have had in a long time!</li>
            <li> I am not much for spending extra money on higher end products unless I have been shown proof it really is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I needed a new razor as I really liked my previous one, but I sure was wrong!</li>
            <li> I once dropped my straight razor and the sheer edge of it caused it to go through the floor tile, concrete, clay, mantle, and subsequent molten core of this earth like butter.</li>
            <li> When I was asked if i would like to try this product by Gillette, I was skeptical that the new flexball handel would really help me get a better shave.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really surprise me, but this razor isn&#x27;t much different than the last &#x27;new thing&#x27; to come out.</li>
            <li> doubt I will switch back to using a cartridge razor (mainly because of cost),</li>
            <li> As with all manual, multiple blade shavers, I found I got a decent shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> Though I still prefer the older three blade Mach 3 system from Gillette, as the blades were further apart.</li>
            <li> Thought it did very well going down the contours of my neck, and didn&#x27;t pull the hairs but instead gave me a really close shave.</li>
            <li> - many of these reviewers are clearly sissy-men with weak beards and the hair growth of a 12 year old girl.</li>
            <li> The blades are high quality and last for weeks.</li>
            <li> I will most likely pick up a refill pack though there are times that the Mach-3&#x27;s lower price point (the Proglide is roughly 50% more expensive for refills) will sway me that way.</li>
            <li> The truth is, I&#x27;m a simple guy and while I appreciate a close shave, and do think that multiple blades have improved shaving, the gimmicks (roller ball, vibration, lube strips, etc.) are really just ways to boost the cost of the refills without really changing the overall experience.  </li>
            <li> I had Gillete&#x27;s Fusions old model back in the day, but this new model they created takes the cake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor like no other!</li>
            <li> (Actually, I gave all the unused ones to the less fortunate.</li>
            <li> , it was a closer shave than my previous razor and left my face feeling smooth..</li>
            <li> I like a less wide head that is more compact and a razor that has substantial feel in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use an electric razor, but Gillette sent me the ProGlide for free to try.  </li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary from BzzAgent and while I thought most razors are the same the Gillette Fusion Proglide has proven me wrong.</li>
            <li> This one has five blades, and normally my hubby doesn&#x27;t like them because they seem to tug and pull at his beard, but the blades have enough space between them that he can fully rinse them out after each stroke.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving since before the Mach3 came out and have used Gillette cartridge razors exclusively for shaving until the last year when I switched to a double sided safety razor (Merkur Heavy Duty #34c w/ Derby blades, which I love btw).  </li>
            <li> It has the normal Gillette colors of silver, blue and orange.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a disposable razor guy, but this Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the size of the cartridge but that concern was laid to rest quickly.</li>
            <li> I normally have some difficulty shaving two areas of my jaw line, one on the side of the chin and the other back towards the neck but thanks to the new swivel technology those two spots are about 5 times easier to shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this razor and the shave was so smooth and easy…it left my face feeling smoother than any other previous razors I have used.  </li>
            <li> If you are at all familiar with previous Gillette Razors featuring the multi-blade head, this will not seem much different to you.</li>
            <li> Gillette recently sent me the new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 razor for well over 10-15 years and every time I have switched and tried something new, or different, no luck.</li>
            <li> It seems that razor manufacturers are constantly looking for new gimmicks to sell their product.  </li>
            <li> The second day I did have a small cut, but I the razor still gave me a very smooth shave as it actually traced my face and chin.</li>
            <li> To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did like the feel of the razor, and the close shave that the five blades provided, but I didn&#x27;t really find that the FlexBall handle provided any different shave than the regular Fusion ProGlide.</li>
            <li> But the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Handle Technology totally eliminated the second step with a REALLY close shave.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the pivoting head would be a bit gimmicky as really how much would that help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them on various handles and it really all seemed the same.</li>
            <li> The blade was super sharp the first few uses</li>
            <li> other one feels a little more plasticky.  </li>
            <li> I should have used the single-blade edging feature, but since I didn&#x27;t, I had to shave the entire mustache off and rock the hairless upper lip for the first time since middle school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noticeably heavier than any other &#x27;swap-a-cartridge&#x27; razors I&#x27;ve held, so it feels substantial when you first pick it up.  </li>
            <li> When I got an opportunity from Gillette to try out their new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology for free, I didn&#x27;t really think there would be much difference between it and the standard Fusion razor I currently use, but boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I did receive this razor free as a promotion to try it out, but I will never go back to a plain razor ever.</li>
            <li> first blade did not last very long however</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gillette,  top brand and expensive shaving but decent price add on to avoid cost of shipping.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it cuts the hairs smoothly, just that in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t do any better job than any of the other Fusion ProGlide or similar multi-blade razors in its class.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the flexball and it can reach all the hard to reach places</li>
            <li> The problem is that for too long they have really just moderately changed the cartridges and considered it a major upgrade.</li>
            <li> The other downside is that despite all the fancy technology that make for a quick and close shave, having the multiple blades actually gets too close for me.</li>
            <li> I used the Flexball to clear off my neck and upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> though I like the razor, I think I am going to go back to using my old non-proglide one that vibrates (fusion power).  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, especially under the jaw</li>
            <li> Gillette has developed a razor that, because of the Flexball, has blades that stay on the skin surface longer than traditional blades.</li>
            <li> I used a foam cream for this initial shave and was surprised at how close of a shave resulted.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My old razor now resides in the drawer next to the sink.</li>
            <li> It definitely lasted longer than the old one that I had</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see a big difference between this and the old gillette profusion,</li>
            <li> What ever happened to the old blue blade/</li>
            <li> When you finish shaving you don&#x27;t have that irritating burn that happens most times after shaving.</li>
            <li> However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this product next time I need a new razor.</li>
            <li> I usually shave early in the morning right before work</li>
            <li> As you shave, the razor&#x27;s head swivels left and right, as well as up and down.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette fusion for a long time and live the precision of their razors and how close the shave is.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be different from any other razor that I have used.</li>
            <li> and it seemingly isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; out as quickly as I remember from the past (again... it&#x27;s been a while...</li>
            <li> To test it further  I went back to my old disposable razor for my next shave and did not get even near as close a shave.</li>
            <li> I can go almost a whole month shaving with this blade compared to a week with other name brands.</li>
            <li> The Fusion cartridges feature 5 blades which are placed very closely together to reduce the chance of nicks and cuts and to provide and extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor does give you a much closer shave then the other Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> I also found the shave itself was much closer than what I would get with other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is a neat idea, but I found it a little difficult to get precise control over the razor because of the head&#x27;s ability to swivel so easily.</li>
            <li> And even after two weeks - the normal lifespan of a disposable razor - the blades seemed just as sharp and I was razor-burn free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from disposable razors, I may have been a bit foolish to think the Flexball razor from Gillette would really be that different - press event or not, it&#x27;s hard to believe that Gillette could have &amp;#34;disrupted&amp;#34; the market by adding a few degrees of movement to their latest 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li> ; usually I have to make a second pass on some areas that grow thicker but the razor left it very smooth with only a single pass.</li>
            <li> There is no other Razor which is comparable to Gillette performance at the same time</li>
            <li> I expected the motion that was shown in the commercials, but found that it was quite limited to just either moving left or right.</li>
            <li> handle is a bit on the heavy size, but that is actually a benefit as it seems to impart a little more control.  </li>
            <li> I was quickly proved wrong within the first 30 seconds of using it.  </li>
            <li> Once you try wet shaving with a single, double, or straight razor, you&#x27;ll never go back to cartridge shaving, no matter what the new technology comes up with, as I found after giving this razor a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only shave 2-4 times a week, which means that I generally have quite a bit of stubble.  </li>
            <li> Other multi-blade products I have used tend to get clogged up with hair between the blades after just a few uses, but this razor is still clog free.  </li>
            <li> I was terrified of even trimming it incorrectly (leaving a bare spot, etc.), as it might take another 20 years or so to grow back!  </li>
            <li> It offers a close shave without tugging on my skin with minor irritations, if any.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just have sensitive skin - but I have always perceived of the 5 blade razors as \\&quot;dragging\\&quot; a bit too long on my face - leaving noticeable bumps and irritation.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, if Gillette would only make these blades more affordable, but if you believe (like I do), that you get what you pay for is true, you won&#x27;t be the slightest bit disappointed, even with the blades.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the razor seemed heavy in my hand.</li>
            <li> Close, comfortable and clean shave with this bad boy.</li>
            <li> But the value-add for the new handle is minimal.</li>
            <li> The body is actually much stronger then I had previously assumed and has some heft to it.</li>
            <li> The additional lubrication on the strip is an added bonus as I have found the previous Gillette strips have lost lubrication too fast.</li>
            <li> Having tried the previous ProGlide Fusion and now the FlexBall technology, I don’t really see the added benefit of the FlexBall.</li>
            <li> However the largest drawback to this product is that the blades do not last much longer than the average multi-blade razor and after 5 shaves I started feeling the blades pull on the hairs rather than cut.  </li>
            <li> No toilet paper face...</li>
            <li> First off, let me get a few things out in the open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the extra cost of the blades.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at what the flexball did, it made a smoother shave and the blade lasted for roughly a month at 3-4 shaves per week.</li>
            <li> It curved around the tough spots easily where I used to take a bunch of short strokes to get all the angles.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different razors over the past few months.</li>
            <li> and I see no difference in the closeness of the shave from the other type of Gillette I normally use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit this razor really does seem to live up to the hype, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Smooth, very hard to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with blades since I was 8 years old; started with the Wilkinson and later the Gillette single blade razor.</li>
            <li> At almost 50 years old I finally started shaving everyday for a new job and with this razor</li>
            <li> it gives an extremely close  shave the first time with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a skeptic about &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;improved&#x27;, but I&#x27;m all in with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology.</li>
            <li> The blades have retained their sharpness over quite a few shaves, something that certain razors can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> But it seemed like there was a little bit too much resistance with the flexball.  </li>
            <li> Because the FlexBall end allows the head of the razor to rock side to side, the new cartridge may not line up and click in as easily as other handles in the Fusion line.</li>
            <li> The curving of the head of the razor was a little different than what I was use to,but worked very well.</li>
            <li> I have used it multiple times now and the blades are still as sharp as new</li>
            <li> With my next shave, I used the regular Fusion ProGlide on one side of my face, and the Fusion ProGlide with new FlexBall handle technology on the other side.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; razor always seems to add another blade or some other gimmick that doesn&#x27;t amount to much (if it did it would put the single blade disposables out of business).</li>
            <li> This also takes some getting used to as you are basically using a single straight razor and have to be very careful.  </li>
            <li> Jokes aside, however, each previous product (the Sensor Excel, the Mach 3, and the Fusion / Fusion Proglide) has marked a major leap forward in the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Whenever a product comes up with a version new and improved I am wary if the claims are true and if changing to it is necessary.  </li>
            <li> First off, I have a very heavy stubble</li>
            <li> I honestly thought that it would have been the same as the other fusion razors but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Upfront cost for DE shaving is where the cost is, but you can buy 100 blades for less than 4 of these cartridges, and you put less plastic in our landfills so you can claim you&#x27;re living green. :-)</li>
            <li> In fact, the first time I used it, I gave myself razor burn from using my typical multiple rapid strokes over the same areas of my face that I was used to doing with other razors.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of a Dyson Rollerball Vacuum in its design.  </li>
            <li> Almost feels like a Dyson vacuum for your face the way the ball rotates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the pulse technology actually does anything (to me, it does), but the sensation lessen the pulls and tugs of the razor making the shaving experience a more enjoyable one especially when the blades get a little bit too dull but not dull enough to toss (since replacement blades are SOOOO expensive these days).</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first - was it really any different from the last model?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think it would be that much different from the Gillette razor that I regularly use.</li>
            <li> My experience over the past month have been all positive and I would recommend purchasing this razor based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I could tell that the flexball helps, but only by a bit (and for the extra money...probably not worth it), but the real problem with this razor is that as soon as it gets wet, it slips out of your hands!</li>
            <li> Then I tried the new Fusion along with my typical gel, Edge with Aloe.</li>
            <li> I had to pass over a few areas a few times; again, really nothing new.</li>
            <li> [As a note, I received the Flexball razor for free from Gillette as part of a promotion.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked forward to trying something new with the Gillette Flexball razor, but my first few shaves left me only frustrated as I seemed to lack the dexterity I was used to with disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I am long time electric shaver user and never thought I would go back to regular razors again.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the blade don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricier than what I&#x27;d normally go for</li>
            <li> Small cuts that didn&#x27;t really bleed at all, but were noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why she wants it.</li>
            <li> I have used straight razors in the past but have been an electric shaver user for years.</li>
            <li> (I think it was a Schick), and much longer and durable than any of the disposables that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> gave the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology 4 stars because I really do like it, though I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll forever switch from the Mach-3.</li>
            <li> gave the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology 4 stars because I really do like it, though I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll forever switch from the Mach-3.</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;m a daily shaver and my hair isn&#x27;t so long after one day that it needs to be &amp;#34;guided&amp;#34; into the razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping the blade would last longer than normal but it lasts about the same as usual.</li>
            <li> Had used cartridge razors for years, then went back to traditional wet shaving with double edge safety razors.</li>
            <li> The only, extremely minor, problem I had with</li>
            <li> They will be a little on the spendy side ( I am a cheapskate, so we&#x27;re talking in the neighborhood of ten to fifteen dollars for the razor itself, and nearly twenty bucks for a 4 count razor cartridge refill.)</li>
            <li> The clear plastic front is still a wasteful land-filler, but at the very least, the packaging makes an attempt at being environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li> A very close shave with very few nicks.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be a little slow to clean up my facial hair with this razor compared with the Mach3.</li>
            <li> I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I&#x27;ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted.</li>
            <li> The flexball  technology is very precise and allows the razor to move seamlessly into areas that may have been difficult in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not that it was a bad shave, just didn&#x27;t seem much better than my old handle.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is with the pivot ball, it didn&#x27;t really help or hurt in any way with the way that I shave.</li>
            <li> : no clog blades, edging blade, solid feel in hand, virutally no nicks - even when dry shaving&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> but the blades are the same old ones that are done in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I am not too keen on having to stand around with toilet paper on my face waiting for the blood to quit pouring</li>
            <li> and then a single blade facing the opposite way (for squaring sideburns and touch-ups around margins, I presume).  </li>
            <li> Forgive me if I was expecting just a regular shave, I mean how much can one razor differ from another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it another few weeks before I make a long term commitment to it, but at that point its quite possible that Old Trusty will just become Old.</li>
            <li> I like the new handle, just not sure how necessary it was.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray back into manual razors in over two years - and it was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s very important as I have sensitive skin and with other razors would suffer the ugly razor bumps the following days.</li>
            <li> The multiple blades stayed sharp for several uses.  </li>
            <li> I had use other Gillette Razors, prior to recently, getting the Fusion Proglide Razor.  </li>
            <li> Always had little issues when shaving the neck area because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a &#x27;stache since my late teens, but it actually took over 40 years for a somewhat decent beard (goatee), to appear.  </li>
            <li> Very Close shave, didn&#x27;t miss a hair, didn&#x27;t get stuck on hard stubble.  </li>
            <li> I tried other razors such as big or shick but like the single blades they gave me razor burn.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I didn&#x27;t get even a small cut from my old Fusion.  </li>
            <li> so keep that in mind and weigh it accordingly when considering my statement that a razor cartridge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on using the Gillette Fusion Proglide, for a long time.</li>
            <li> It held up to hair too long to be considered stuble.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am long time</li>
            <li> Surprising, the flex ball did wonders for my annoying angular chin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this one blade daily for over two weeks now after the initial mow down</li>
            <li> I mean enjoyable in the way that it&#x27;s still a chore, but it doesn&#x27;t nick my skin or how I used to contort in weird positions that weren&#x27;t natural.  </li>
            <li> and he got a close shave in a surprisingly short period of time with only a slight bit of irritation under his jawline.</li>
            <li> I mean, my face isn&#x27;t that jagged or rugged that the head needs to rotate that much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and usually wind up with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Your choice in cream, gel, or other facial lubricant may have an impact on the razor&#x27;s performance as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why would Gillette go to market with something that was really no different than their other products?  </li>
            <li> With other razors, you have to turn and rotate and move the blade to get the different angles of the face.  </li>
            <li> Has Gillette considered a two-headed shaver with a standard width on one end and a half-width on the other?</li>
            <li> The only thing the should have added to it was that vibrating function, as they had on other Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to the 3/8&amp;#34; of plastic surface below the blades which keep the blades from reaching that last spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this, but it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same blade you would get in any other Gillette Fusion package.</li>
            <li> Compared to other cartridge razors and disposable razors of different brands, this one comes out ahead.</li>
            <li> It does not last longer than any other blade.</li>
            <li> Just when you thought there was no more innovations possible in manual shaving devices, along comes Gillette with a swiveling ball handle (perhaps taking a hint from British vacuum manufacturer Dyson?)</li>
            <li> and I can dry shave and never have any irritation.</li>
            <li> I shave dry, and I had no comfort</li>
            <li> When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I do tend to get a few ingrown hairs, which I can&#x27;t necessarily fault the razor for, but this one was certainly no different in that respect.</li>
            <li> the cool new look, the breakthrough technology of running across your face, but it all boils down to the blades doing the cutting of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Give the limited area I shave, the current cartridge I have been using for 4 weeks seems to be still be cutting as close and comfortably as day 1 -</li>
            <li> I seriously thought how much different can this be WOW!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this product at least once</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this product at least once</li>
            <li> Upon receiving my Gillette Razor, I was actually a bit skeptical about whether or not this product would be right for me.</li>
            <li> It is a very slight improvement over the old stationary handle, but not very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and  i do not change it for any other brand since their last long sharp knives.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like these 5+ blade razors for one main reason, they don&#x27;t get under your nose very well, so your mustache is always sloppily shaved.</li>
            <li> But again it&#x27;s extremely minor and with no real effort</li>
            <li> so I went back down a blade to the Mach-3.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other brand!</li>
            <li> I typically had preferred their earlier generation Mach3 product, as I found the larger razor head tough to maneuver around the smaller parts of my face (especially under my nose and above my lips).</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is due to the new design, but that is a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty shocked by how much smoother the shave was with this handle.</li>
            <li> The way this razor contours, I can easily shave all my hairs without risk of razor burn or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the extra axis of pivot to see if it would allow me to shave faster with less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, it seemed that it only moved slightly and didn&#x27;t give me any closer shave than razors without this feature.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of difference I noticed between this and the previous, non-Flexball model.</li>
            <li> The blades offer enough comfort that you almost don&#x27;t need shaving cream, I usually just use water, unless I grow my facial hair out for a week.</li>
            <li> can they function any differently than the previous one?  </li>
            <li> Got this razor, not expecting anything different from previous Gillette prducts.</li>
            <li> I over slept and was in a hurry and even dry shaved with this razor and had absolutely no issues - no cuts, pulls or razor burns.  </li>
            <li> and I only had 1 nick in a tight spot under my lip.  </li>
            <li> First let me say I am a woman...and about 10 years ago, i got tired of the same ole less than average &amp;#34;womens&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I find the head is a little big when shaving under the nose.    </li>
            <li> so I thought this would really get into my tough areas well.</li>
            <li> No reason to get in a hurry, no reason to press hard, no reason to do anything but use this thing to clear shaving cream off your face.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday, and my skin is dry and somewhat sensitive, so I use to get little itchy bumps with other gels, but not at all with this one.</li>
            <li> Areas where other razors would have cut me into pieces, this does it without a single drop of blood.</li>
            <li> In fact, I usually wait for two to four days between shaves just to get the hairs out long enough for the shaver to something to grab.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and shave at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> The blade literally glided across my skin effortlessly and the swivel ball kept the blade close against my skin at all times with minimal pressure.</li>
            <li> No, not really.</li>
            <li> The difference between the two -- the &amp;#34;microcomb&amp;#34; at the edge of the Power&#x27;s cartridge, which allegedly exists to &amp;</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s nothing worse than getting ready for a date, and showing up as if you&#x27;ve slaughtered your neck with a butcher knife.</li>
            <li> I will be buying cartridges from now on, once this one dulls out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat slippery when wet and this one shortcoming keeps me from giving this razor a five star review.</li>
            <li> I can only force myself to do it by skipping days, and I have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> not much pull at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat slippery when wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy.</li>
            <li> As for the face areas, the pivot made absolutely no difference.    </li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;d go with the cheaper one as I could not really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who could polish diamonds with his stubble, this concept helps reduce the amount of time the razor is not on your skin, preventing nicks, drag, and pulls.</li>
            <li> It does cause some drag and irritation, but I am going to assume I&#x27;m the exception to the rule in this case scenario.</li>
            <li> It flexes so that you never have a rough shave again</li>
            <li> but I thought dulled a bit faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Maybe the vibrating from the handle on the Power razor dulls the blades faster?</li>
            <li> The edging blade I would say is mostly gimmicky and not really of use to me as I use a powered trimmer for edging in my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> technology helps with shaving down and under the chin, especially when the hair on my face/neck grows diagonally not straight down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping Gillette will eventually spread their sharp blades a little further apart for</li>
            <li> At the average price of the replacement blades I do not see replacing my current razor as the blades are half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> he loves these razors,  He always breaks out from other razors and has to be really careful about the shaving products that he uses.  </li>
            <li> Both times, I&#x27;ve had numerous knicks and raw spots on both my neck and cheeks.</li>
            <li> It makes it only a little less desirable as a travel razor if you are trying to save weight.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away a lot of the other shaving creams and lotions that were stockpiling up in the house.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every other day</li>
            <li> I did not like to shave often in the past because my face would get sores from shaving daily, now I can even shave twice a day with zero problems</li>
            <li> under my chin and my cheek bone line about every other day.</li>
            <li> These are quality blades and with care, they remain sharp and won&#x27;t rust like cheaper blades.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology, I&#x27;ve tossed out every other razor that I owned.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using the safety razor due to the irritation this razor causes me.</li>
            <li> Of course, I also have to skip days with other razors.  </li>
            <li> the other features of the razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an improvement over my other razor.  </li>
            <li> I have used other premium disposable razors, and they are lighter and easier to use, even when you consider the flexing of the FlexBall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they usually leave me red and in pain.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, its sharper than any other razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> No ingrown hairs or other issues.  </li>
            <li> Rather, I think that&#x27;s to contrast the other Fusion products which have a battery in them and vibrate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would never buy any other razor other than Gillette.</li>
            <li> and it is still sharp as ever.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it helps improve my shaving experience over other handle types, but YMMV.  </li>
            <li> The flex ball makes the blade glide over your skin for an extremely close shave all in one motion.  </li>
            <li> I received a fusion proglide in the mail the other day and as soon as I started my morning shave all I can saw is</li>
            <li> in other words, I almost lopped off my sideburns by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Flexball technology seems to work for me, especially around the chin area which is where I usually cut myself.</li>
            <li> No thanks!  </li>
            <li> The shave was extremely close and effortless.  </li>
            <li> I have, in the past, made lesser razors cried.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and was disappointed that the flexball didn&#x27;t give me any better a shave.</li>
            <li> With other razoers, I have to be very careful to avoid nicks there.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are a little expensive but seem to be worth the price</li>
            <li> My son with a very heavy beard gives it a big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology adds a new element to shaving that I have never experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were a few scruffy parts on my chin that I went over a few times with the blade, but just couldn&#x27;t get close enough because of the lack of pressure control.</li>
            <li> Also, the sideburn trimmer is pretty much worthless - use the normal blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually needing to stop my shave and adjust position in order to get a proper shave in those odd angle areas of my face</li>
            <li> The handle was maybe a little bit easier to hold onto, but not much difference.  </li>
            <li> The blade could curve around the chin/jaw while bending to stay firmly against my skin with one single up stroke!</li>
            <li> It takes pressure and control out of your hand to make it swivel to the contours of your face so that you aren&#x27;t pressing hard enough to cause damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars because I thought it got dull faster than it should have.  </li>
            <li> This is at first, a frightening little implement.  </li>
            <li> For me, a razor cartridge lasts a long time (6 to 9 months usually)</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I could think to say is</li>
            <li> It is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the blades seem to last longer on the Flexball razor than the Power razor, I still use at least two per month.</li>
            <li> Although I still had minimal pulling and nicks, it is definitely not as smooth as the Fusion ProGlide</li>
            <li> Let me start off by stating I have a thick, coarse beard.</li>
            <li> I have what you may consider moderately thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;flexball technology&amp;#34;, but the fact that the blades move on two axes (up and down, side to side) really does allow the razor to navigate the contours of your face effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Gillette I shaved half of my face with the Gillette Fusion Proglide and the other half with just the Gillette Fusion and the gliding power of the Proglide</li>
            <li> flex head won&#x27;t let you press hard, so the upper lip was a little hard to get used to, but that was the only part that was a challenge.  </li>
            <li> shave down the side of my face and not miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to be a Gillette guy, but when the prices of their razors went up and the availability of the Moch 3 went down</li>
            <li> This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical of the four and five blade razor, but I may have just found my new razor!</li>
            <li> I typically shave every weekday.  </li>
            <li> So when I tried the Fusion ProGlide, I thought this would just be another typical razor.</li>
            <li> It takes less strokes to shave your face so less irritation and cuts.</li>
            <li> one thing that I miss, however, is the Power handle of my previous ProGlide Razor.</li>
            <li> Typically I go four or five days between shaves, and I don&#x27;t shave at all through the winter months,</li>
            <li> I am prone to ingrown hairs and this razor causes less irritation than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Less nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades allowed me to cut my shaving time almost in half.</li>
            <li> Comparing it to the Mach 3 Power Razor, which I have been using for some time, I feel the Power Razor created less skin irritation, but the Flexball had a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The razor is called (oddly) manual</li>
            <li> I had settled on a less than close shave because of this.</li>
            <li> The subtle shift of the head helps the razor to hug my face when transitioning from the check to under the chin in the same stroke.</li>
            <li> By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz.</li>
            <li> The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have the previous multi-blade exchange cartridge razor, I don&#x27;t see the need to rush out and grab this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> get less cuts on my head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It had 5 blades which made shaving take half the time.  </li>
            <li> Plus it uses less plastic than I typically see with products like this.</li>
            <li> And the shave took probably half the time as normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave in less time with the FlexBall technology</li>
            <li> I was previously using the proglide battery operated razor</li>
            <li> The only down side I see is that these razors are getting a little too big to get those hairs under your nose area, and the price of the refills are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> That is not true.</li>
            <li> The pivoting of the head allows me to get those tight spots without giving myself razor burn or cuts.</li>
            <li> When a new razor comes out I am always skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a new razor.  </li>
            <li> , they are a lot less gimmicky as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> and I am missing less hairs&lt;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the new handle did little to improve the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> A little tingly from the 2-in-1 gel</li>
            <li> But before I get into that, let me say a little something about the razor&#x27;s capabilities.</li>
            <li> O usually get irritated with other types of razors but not this one.</li>
            <li> This handle fits the same cartridges but has this awful pivoting head addition that I strongly dislike.</li>
            <li> In both cases, I have hairs that grow out in a number of different directions, making them very hard to grab without scraping a couple of times from every direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried going every other day like I do now with my Merkur, for science, and it chewed up my face pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The five blades are extremely sharp, with virtually no tugging, even after missing shave day for the past week.</li>
            <li> I did all the prep work and was very careful, but by the end of the first week my skin was in bad shape</li>
            <li> Reengineered Low Cutting Force Blades have thinner, finer edges and advanced low-resistance coating for effortless cutting with less tug and pull</li>
            <li> The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting.</li>
            <li> with an extremely thin and angular face also gives it a big thumbs up because of the Flexball.</li>
            <li> I started using Gillette razors a few years ago, but ran out of cartridges</li>
            <li> It made me wonder if I was missing something.</li>
            <li> It seemed a bit gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as an everyday razor, it tears your face up.</li>
            <li> have waited a few days to write this as I wanted to see if it continued to work.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to try out a few weeks ago.    </li>
            <li> After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say (it got an extra star for this) that it was easier to maneuver in places like behind and around the knee - and (for once)</li>
            <li> I received a trial from Gillette and have been using the product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> With a couple of passes, those trouble areas are smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> &gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green.</li>
            <li> In other words, the difficult to get close areas such as under the chin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and usually turn red after a bad shave.</li>
            <li> I generally have trouble with disposable razors cutting me on my rough angles during a shave.  </li>
            <li> The Flexball Handle feels very gimmicky and less than functional, except for maybe the slightest difference</li>
            <li> the flexball part is just a gimmick and worked no better or worse than the regular fusion.</li>
            <li> I then noticed I&#x27;d completed the whole shave without any awkward corners -- the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; which I thought was a silly gimmick actually helped make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> So when I was asked to use a regular blade razor I was lets say a little CUT shy.</li>
            <li> only quibble I have is that for my arthritic hand the razor is just a little uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> However it is hard to say what a slightly pivoting head does for its efficiency.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sick for close to 2 weeks and personal grooming was the last thing on my mind.  </li>
            <li> turns around the contours of my face with very little effort and no irritation.</li>
            <li> No more cuts on the face.</li>
            <li> The razor itself isn&#x27;t expensive, but the refill cartridges will cost you an arm, leg, and several small goats.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not really sure what the Flexball does, or that it has any benefit.</li>
            <li> but with fewer strokes than I usually take.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m usually a two-step shaver...</li>
            <li> Sorry Gillette, but I’m not a big fan of this item.</li>
            <li> usually can&#x27;t get the area on my neck around my Adam&#x27;s apple.  </li>
            <li> SO not sure how well this would work because it has to be years</li>
            <li> I usually use Gillette razors, so I know they stand up for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try out the pivoting head to see if I could get a closer shave without the agony of past attempts.</li>
            <li> I used the razor 5 times in the past seven days and have yet to have a problem with the blade.  </li>
            <li> Gillette is usually the brand I used.</li>
            <li> and I usually shave in a hurry...</li>
            <li> There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I would have bought this razor myself</li>
            <li> I usually use an electric razor from Norelco</li>
            <li> I usually use the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo, so that is what I am basing my review on.  </li>
            <li> I usually get my razors from the dollar store.  </li>
            <li> a side note, and I&#x27;m not sure anyone cares</li>
            <li> while shaving around jaw line or chin you can actually see the head of the razor shifting without having to pick up and move or arrange your hand in a weird way to get those angles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am never able to get a truly close shave unless I go to the barber</li>
            <li> As such, I was skeptical when my Gillette Fusion Proglide arrived.  </li>
            <li> I have used Fusion Proglide without the Flexball in the past but prefer the Mach 3 Turbo because the blades are spaced farther apart and therefore, make cleaning easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more bumps.</li>
            <li> no more bumps</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I saw little difference in shaving between this razor and the previous ProGlide manual razors, which I have tried out two previous ones.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that it makes shaving a little easier and a little less awkward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something that can take some getting used to for people like me who like to press hard to get the closest shave.</li>
            <li> Then I grew my beard and until I was in the ARMY HARDLY SHAVED.</li>
            <li> Do these blades ever dull?</li>
            <li> At least, I think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
            <li> The razor head is just too big to shave that area, and i ended up cutting into my mustache.</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone at least give this razor a try and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> and I was running late</li>
            <li> flexball allows side-to-side adjustment, at least the way my face is contoured.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this razor to be the smoothest cutting, longest lasting blade that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> If I did not apply a second layer of gel, the razor what actually cutting my face.  </li>
            <li> I mean I am the one with the scruffy face.</li>
            <li> Gillette is mad in Mexico and is not the same company that it once was</li>
            <li> not because you use it with your hands - I mean, you do.</li>
            <li> only negative comment is that he blades are very expensive.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this razor to anyone who is serious about shaving.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve heard of my beard and subtly stated: &amp;#34;Challenge Accepted&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was still a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I actually had thought that the FlexBall would be a bad feature, but the minute I started to use it, I felt like I was shaving in heaven.</li>
            <li> The only &#x27;bad&#x27; thing I would say about this is that because of the swivel head, it takes a shave or to to get used to the way it moves.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.  </li>
            <li> Dead wrong.</li>
            <li> know this may seem ridiculous, but switching from a razor that vibrates to one that doesn&#x27;t is a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> so I’m usually skeptical when I hear about something like a flexball handle because usually  the gimmick does nothing for me</li>
            <li> Overall, I was disappointed with this product - I still did get a shave, but irritation to follow.</li>
            <li> I either ended up with a raw neck or worse - ingrown hairs from shaving the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> One (maybe 2 in really tough spots) pass with this thing does the trick.  </li>
            <li> and I felt it was an unnecessary feature.</li>
            <li> Not great .</li>
            <li> I guess if I was shaving with a broken wrist it might be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to reach places like under the nose were impossible to get to with this behemoth.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to test and was skeptical going in with their claim that it would get every hair.  </li>
            <li> ; seems like a silly concept to me.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was never impressed with the qaulity of the shave.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry for the purchase.</li>
            <li> When receiving this product from Gillette i was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point of the swivel unless you shave at a weird angle.</li>
            <li> in fact, (sorry electric shaver guys) it has given me one of the closest shaves</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since forever shunned single-blades, and I eventually walked my way up to the 4-bladed Shick Quattro, but the blades got to be expensive</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the utility of the flexball, but its performance has won me over.  </li>
            <li> The refills are outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> BUT the Gillette Fusion Proglide has proven me wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Quite expensive for the year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> While nothing earth-shattering, it did legitimately solve the awkward pain point of flexing and contorting your face to get at hairs.</li>
            <li> I miss the trimmer side of the blade for easier cutting of sideburns.  </li>
            <li> I found the cost of the replacement razors very expensive.</li>
            <li> My bad...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I just knew it was going to be a bad shave.</li>
            <li> have yet to have a bad shave.</li>
            <li> :  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> For example, I purchased the Power version of the razors but didn&#x27;t stick with it as the vibrations were rather annoying and didn&#x27;t seem to improve my shave.  </li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t hate this razor but you won&#x27;t be blown away</li>
            <li> (1 to 10 - 1 being worst 10 being best)&lt;br /&gt;Closeness  </li>
            <li> I HATE that!</li>
            <li> I remember the worst shave I ever had (this isn&#x27;t it - I&#x27;m just offering a comparison).</li>
            <li> The cost of refill cartridges is OUTRAGEOUS!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These razors are the best value for anyone wanting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Just upgraded to this and man I love it.  Glides nicely when shaving and feels great afterwards.  The flexball helps with the smooth ride.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a razor.</li>
            <li> First let me say I am a woman...and about 10 years ago, i got tired of the same ole less than average &amp;#34;womens&amp;#34; razors. I decided to give this a try and OMG!  Since the 1st time ive used this razor i have NEVER went back to a womens or used any other kind. Smoothest shave ever...leaves your legs and under arms like silk and all without shaving cream or gel too. All of my 4 brothers along with my women friends now only use this as well. A+ if in doubt....just try it yourself and you will never use anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> as decribed ....first blade did not last very long however</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference in the closeness of the shave</li>
            <li> A note about me. I typically shave every weekday.  Also, I do not use aftershave.  Also, I got this product for free from Gilette to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am a loyal Gilette fan.  They totally hooked me when the sent me a razor on my 12th or 13th birthday (I don&#x27;t remember exactly when) and said, &amp;#34;every man deserves a good razor for his birthday,&amp;#34; or something like that.  I was hooked.  Since then I have been pretty loyal to the brand.  Most recently I had a fusion power razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this may seem ridiculous, but switching from a razor that vibrates to one that doesn&#x27;t is a little disappointing.  I&#x27;m not really sure if the vibration helped anything, but I can&#x27;t help the feeling that I am not doing as good a job shaving anymore.  Note: I do know that men have shaved without battery powered razors for years and everything has been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do like the flexible head on this razor and I do think it provides a pretty clean shave.  It also feels nice and weighty in my hand, which I like . . .My other one feels a little more plasticky.  I have gotten a few more micro cuts while shaving when I used this razor as opposed to my old one.  Small cuts that didn&#x27;t really bleed at all, but were noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I like the razor, I think I am going to go back to using my old non-proglide one that vibrates (fusion power).  Whether it is actual or psychological, I do like that vibration feature.  I may keep this one in my suitcase and use it more for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product if you are upgrading from a non power razor, but if you have a power one, I&#x27;d say stick with it.  At least, I think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
            <li> works great help me just a job. this will keep you looking sexy all day.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband- he loves these razors,  He always breaks out from other razors and has to be really careful about the shaving products that he uses.  This leaves him smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin like most razors.</li>
            <li> I was super stoked about getting another Gillette product, especially another ProGlide. This was a free item I received to review and enjoy along with some great savings coupons from BzzAgent.  The blades on the ProGlide lasts forever. I can go almost a whole month shaving with this blade compared to a week with other name brands. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I took the blade off of the razer and put it on my Fusion ProGlide  Power. It has everything the non-power has to offer plus a nice vibration for a closer smoother shave. I am also digging the 2 in 1 skin care shaving lotion. I ended up throwing away a lot of the other shaving creams and lotions that were stockpiling up in the house. (Actually, I gave all the unused ones to the less fortunate. That is the less fortunate who never had a chance to try the new ProGlide line.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a sample &amp; i love how close the shave feels. No more cuts on the face. The cartridges are a little expensive but seem to be worth the price</li>
            <li> It works well, the &#x27;gliding&amp;#34; mechanism is nice but not mind blowing.</li>
            <li> A very smooth and clean shave at a somewhat hi cost.</li>
            <li> My flatmate stole my Gillette Fusion handle so I wanted a cheap replacement.  This handle fits the same cartridges but has this awful pivoting head addition that I strongly dislike.</li>
            <li> The Gillette® Fusion ProGlide Razor is the best thing on the market! With the swivel head and 5 blades, it makes shaving a breeze,no more nicks or cuts because it glides over the contour of your face.and gives you a smooth,clean shave.I have mostly always been an electric shaver type guy and after receiving this from BZZAgent to try along with the sensitive proglide 2 in 1 gel,I have been hooked.If your in the market for a great razor,you really need to get this Gillette® Fusion ProGlide Razor from a name you can trust and respect ! You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t let the woman in your house steal this one. I&#x27;m not sure why she wants it. I mean I am the one with the scruffy face. Why can&#x27;t she just take her pink razor and be happy? The Flex ball technology or whatever they call it actually gives good head movement. This thing moves smoothly over my face. I am really happy I got this for free from Gillette through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Fusion Proglide that I was able to clip a coupon for and it had another $5 off coupon inside.  It was like they paid me to buy it!!</li>
            <li> Got this razor as promotional freebie from Gillette. The first thing I thought of when I saw the razor with the ball thing is the vacuum with the ball thing. Wasn&#x27;t sure it would make that much of a difference and thought it might just be &amp;#34;gimmicky&amp;#34;. My bad... The flexball makes a difference. Good pivot/swivel action. The razor gave me a close shave but not too close so it didn&#x27;t feel like my face was peeling off. I used it with the sensitive shave gel. A little tingly from the 2-in-1 gel but that was to be expected. I have to shave every other day so having a good razor is important to my face.</li>
            <li> My guys are so happy with this razor.  Works better than the old one.  Follows facial contours really well.  I like just changing the razor head and replacing the whole razor. Great deal!</li>
            <li> This one has five blades, and normally my hubby doesn&#x27;t like them because they seem to tug and pull at his beard, but the blades have enough space between them that he can fully rinse them out after each stroke.  The razor itself isn&#x27;t expensive, but the refill cartridges will cost you an arm, leg, and several small goats. And that is if the store takes Liliputians in currency.</li>
            <li> I received this razor to test from Gillette and it has not disappointed.  I have sensitive skin, especially under the jaw and this razor has been great in not only getting to the hard to reach places but to give a smooth shave on the first pass.  I have been a hardcore mach 3 user and never had a reason to change.  I&#x27;ve been skeptical of the four and five blade razor, but I may have just found my new razor!</li>
            <li> After many years of using the Gillette Sensor Excel, I tried out the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle.  I was pleasantly suprised by the comfort and ease that came with such a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the razor head is slightly larger than the Excel, and I have to get used to it.  Also, I&#x27;m not really sure what the Flexball does, or that it has any benefit.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different razors over the past few months. So when I tried the Fusion ProGlide, I thought this would just be another typical razor. I was wrong. This razor is much better than any of the other razors I have tried. The shave was really smooth and much faster than any other razor on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave once a week and this razor can easily handle the hair growth. In just one pass, it can almost get every hair without any burning sensation. I have now used the razor 4 times and it still shaves like the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product as it is the best I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. Really follows the contoursof my face. The blades are high quality and last for weeks.</li>
            <li> GREAT RAZOR AND NO IRRITATION!!! This razor is the nicest razor I have used. It moves with the contour of your face. It takes less strokes to shave your face so less irritation and cuts. At almost 50 years old I finally started shaving everyday for a new job and with this razor I look forward to shaving. I did not like to shave often in the past because my face would get sores from shaving daily, now I can even shave twice a day with zero problems and I can dry shave and never have any irritation. I did receive this razor free as a promotion to try it out, but I will never go back to a plain razor ever. This one is simply the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I judge razors on a number of factors including ease of use, closeness of shave, lasting of shave and cost.&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use - This razor feels nice in my hand. It has a good weight and a good angle And most important it glides over the face with, so far, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness / lasting of shave - For me Monday is the best day to judge this.  I do not shave over the weekend.  And Monday is the best day to judge growth.  And you would guess that I had shaved over the weekend based on the length of my stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Cost - as the cost is not disclosed and the replacement blades is not listed.  I cannot compare this to other good razors.</li>
            <li> Before receiving the Gillette razor, I wanted to know if my skin and face would be able to handle the movement of the FlexBall, and if this product was right for me. Upon receiving my Gillette Razor, I was actually a bit skeptical about whether or not this product would be right for me. I actually had thought that the FlexBall would be a bad feature, but the minute I started to use it, I felt like I was shaving in heaven. Despite the fact that I was DRY SHAVING, I found that the Gillette razor easily glided on my face and eliminated all of my hair. The FlexBall turned out to be a very nifty feature, as it makes shaving much easier and more comfortable. By the time I was done shaving, I wasn&#x27;t even able to use my old razors again. This one&#x27;s a keeper, ladies and gentlemen.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago, Gillette sent me this razor to test drive and after a couple of weeks, my verdict is in...this razor has almost everything that I look for in a smooth shave, except for one thing. But before I get into that, let me say a little something about the razor&#x27;s capabilities. The FlexBall handle technology is great because it shaves along the contour of my face extremely well. Areas where other razors would have cut me into pieces, this does it without a single drop of blood. The new blades, or what I think are new blades, are giving me the closest shaves ever. I have been a loyal fan of Gillette for a long time and will probably never switch from the brand, unless it is to a straight razor. I&#x27;m very happy with the product, however, the only thing I miss from this is the pulse technology that came with other Gillette razors. I&#x27;m not sure if the pulse technology actually does anything (to me, it does), but the sensation lessen the pulls and tugs of the razor making the shaving experience a more enjoyable one especially when the blades get a little bit too dull but not dull enough to toss (since replacement blades are SOOOO expensive these days). But overall, I still love Gillette and love their products!</li>
            <li> I have been using the ProGlide for about 4 weeks now. Granted, I have a full, light beard but shave my neck/under my chin and my cheek bone line about every other day. I was a little concerned about the size of the cartridge but that concern was laid to rest quickly. The blade literally glided across my skin effortlessly and the swivel ball kept the blade close against my skin at all times with minimal pressure. This razor far exceeded my expectations. That being said, I am a bit apprehensive about the cost of the replacement cartridges. Give the limited area I shave, the current cartridge I have been using for 4 weeks seems to be still be cutting as close and comfortably as day 1 - so I may get a month out of 1 cartridge which would make the cost a lot more easy to swallow. I would recommend this razor for anyone with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s so smooth.. I have not nicked my skin, no irritation, 5 star performance.</li>
            <li> I recently received the Fusion ProGlide razor from Gillette to try and evaluate. I have used several Gillette razors over the years and the ProGlide razor with flexball provides a nice close shave, just as i would expect from Gillette. The razor is well made and comfortable to hold. The flexball gives the razor a unique look, but performance wise does very little and I felt it was an unnecessary feature. I really liked the close shave it provided however I have very sensitive skin around my neck and the Fusion Proglide really irritated my skin. Overall I would say its a good razor, just not the one for me.</li>
            <li> When Gillette sent me a Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology to try, I figured it would be just as good as the previous ProGlide Razors I have used. I wanted to try the extra axis of pivot to see if it would allow me to shave faster with less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, it is about the same, however I have noticed that I have not cut myself as much with the new handle vs. the old one. I am not sure if that is due to the new design, but that is a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I miss, however, is the Power handle of my previous ProGlide Razor. I like the feeling as it massages my skin while I shave. I guess I will have to find it in the store to see it works the same, but since the concepts are similar, I suspect it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Gillette, for sending me a sample unit to review.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette to test and was skeptical going in with their claim that it would get every hair.  I have scar tissue in my shaving area and have a tough time getting a good smooth shave because of the &amp;#34;geography&amp;#34; of my skin in some areas - thus my skepticism.  I started shaving and noticed that I was getting a really smooth shave all over my face. Gillette has developed a razor that, because of the Flexball, has blades that stay on the skin surface longer than traditional blades. I got a nice clean shave that day and each time I&#x27;ve used it since. I&#x27;m very impressed with this new technology and would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to make jokes about Gillette&#x27;s evolving product line: every few years the company adds another blade (or two) to their cartridge and changes the color of their razor handle. Jokes aside, however, each previous product (the Sensor Excel, the Mach 3, and the Fusion / Fusion Proglide) has marked a major leap forward in the shaving experience. Every time I&#x27;ve gone back and used a Mach 3, in fact, I&#x27;ve been struck by just how big a difference there is between that product and the far superior 5-blade Fusion (or its slightly-improved successor the Fusion Proglide). Given that experience, I was excited to try the Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle (*full disclosure: the item was provided to me free from Gillette*), which features a hinge on the handle, supplementing the range of motion offered by the hinge on the cartridge itself (the hinge on the handle swivels left-to-right, while the hinge on the cartridge swivels forward-and-back). Unfortunately, the new handle did little to improve the shaving experience. Yes, the additional hinge does help keep the blades parallel to the shaver’s skin – but it doesn’t make nearly as great a difference as the hinge on the cartridge (which was one of the Mach 3’s novel features). The cartridge itself, meanwhile – which, after all, is the key to the shaving experience – remains basically unchanged. That’s not a problem: the Fusion Proglide cartridge is exceptional. But the value-add for the new handle is minimal. If you already have a Fusion / Fusion Proglide handle without the Flexball swivel, don’t bother buying this new product. That said, if you do *not* own a Fusion handle and you’re looking to buy one, the Flexball Handle does represent a marginal improvement on the old product.</li>
            <li> I used a Gillette razor before, but this one is amazing. The Flexball Handle Technology allows the razor to easily follow ever contour of my face while maintaining constant contact with my skin. The added range of motion provided by the ball became instantly evident when I was able to cleanly clear a sizable portion of my face in one clean cut without having to pick up the razor and adjust the blade to a different angle. All I can think of is the positives for owning this razor. The one negative is at some point I will have to buy new razor blades, but other than that it is great. I would definitely recommend this razor to someone and I already did to my best friend. Great Razor!</li>
            <li> After receiving the Proglide Razor with Flexball handle I opened the box and was pleased with the packaging for the razor. It was easy to open and get access to the product. I used a foam cream for this initial shave and was surprised at how close of a shave resulted. To test it further  I went back to my old disposable razor for my next shave and did not get even near as close a shave. I then decided to purchase and use the Gillette pro glide shaving gel for my next shave with the test razor. Wow!! The results were amazing. A clean close shave with no irritation or nicks. I think this is an amazing product. I am definitely going to continue to use the Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle.</li>
            <li> I am long time electric shaver user and never thought I would go back to regular razors again. However after trying the new Proglide razor from Gillette not only am I mainly using this razor now, but I am making sure I have enough time in the morning for a proper shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro glide gives a very clean clean and easy shave that last all day … no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  With the new flex ball handle i find I can do a one stroke shave down the side of my face and not miss a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor and I would recommend it to anymore</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide is the best of the Gillette razors line, thus far. The blades are far enough apart to allow for easy rinsing and cleaning, and they provide a good, close shave for about two weeks. While I got this particular sample through the Amazon Vine program, I had already switched to using Fusion and purchased several on my own last month. It is a very good value and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received my Fusion Pro Glide from Gillette and My experience with the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide was largely a positive one.  It may very well have given the closest shave I have ever had.  The edging blade I would say is mostly gimmicky and not really of use to me as I use a powered trimmer for edging in my facial hair.  However the largest drawback to this product is that the blades do not last much longer than the average multi-blade razor and after 5 shaves I started feeling the blades pull on the hairs rather than cut.  At the average price of the replacement blades I do not see replacing my current razor as the blades are half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up (1 to 10 - 1 being worst 10 being best)&lt;br /&gt;Closeness  10&lt;br /&gt;Blade longevity  6&lt;br /&gt;Blade cost  5&lt;br /&gt;Overall  7&lt;br /&gt;I will not continue to use this product but would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I know most guys with a lot of facial hair would want the exact opposite, I&#x27;ve always wished I had more facial hair to shave. I&#x27;ve had a &#x27;stache since my late teens, but it actually took over 40 years for a somewhat decent beard (goatee), to appear.  I was terrified of even trimming it incorrectly (leaving a bare spot, etc.), as it might take another 20 years or so to grow back!  Fortunately, that did not turn out to be the case, but I&#x27;m still VERY careful when it comes to shaving and trimming it and the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO use a razor to trim the surrounding area and to keep my &#x27;stache even on top and sides, and this razor is one of the smoothest I&#x27;ve used, and also offers me the closest shave I&#x27;ve used to date. I also like the wide gaps between the razors so hair easily rinses out without much bother while offering that close, very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if Gillette would only make these blades more affordable, but if you believe (like I do), that you get what you pay for is true, you won&#x27;t be the slightest bit disappointed, even with the blades.  The razor&#x27;s excellent quality speaks for itself, but I would definitely wait for the blades to go on sale!</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology is a very good shaver.  My husband has been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Men&#x27;s Razor for a while and he likes it, but the Flexball technology appeared to make this one worth a try.  It is a very slight improvement over the old stationary handle, but not very noticeable.  The difference in the blades was not detectable.  Both razors are good and give a close shave so the choice is really your&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great product good shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Fusion Proglide line of razors for quite some time now. I&#x27;ve found them to be the best of this type razor on the market. They provide the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle is another in the fine line of razors. I can&#x27;t say that is shaves better, since the blades are the same, but it is easy to use and glides around the face very well. I don&#x27;t really know how much better a razor can get, but I applaud Gillette for continuing to try and upgrade their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I really like the Gillette Fusion Proglide line of razors and this new one with the Flexball is another great razor by the leader in this category.</li>
            <li> My sons have been using Gillette Fusion razors and cartridges for quite a while now. The Fusion cartridges feature 5 blades which are placed very closely together to reduce the chance of nicks and cuts and to provide and extremely close shave. There is also a lubricating strip which fades to white when it&#x27;s depleted, indicating you may want to replace the cartridge. (My sons clean and dry their razors every day so they get much more use out of a single cartridge after the lubricating strip has long been used up. These are quality blades and with care, they remain sharp and won&#x27;t rust like cheaper blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique thing about this Fusion Proglide razor is the Flexball handle. It pivots up and down, like most razors with replaceable blade cartridges, but it also pivots from side to side! This makes it even more comfortable to get a clean, close shave with no injuries or burn. Depending upon how you shave, you&#x27;ll be delighted at how easily the razor glides over curves and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes with one blade cartridge but I had a new package of Fusion cartridges in my house so 3 people tried the razor, each using a fresh cartridge. My son with a very heavy beard gives it a big thumbs up. The first day he tried it, he had 5 days worth of growth and he got a close shave in a surprisingly short period of time with only a slight bit of irritation under his jawline. He continues to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son with an average to light beard but with an extremely thin and angular face also gives it a big thumbs up because of the Flexball. He also got a close and comfortable shave without nicks on his chin or near his Adam&#x27;s apple, where he almost always gets a nick. He usually uses an electric razor but uses a blade razor before important meetings or photo ops or other special occasions when a very close shave matters. He says he is going to buy one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my legs and underarms and like my sons, I was very pleased with how easily it glided over my knees and ankles - places that I often get nicks. I don&#x27;t have much hair on my legs and my underarm hair isn&#x27;t especially coarse or heavy, but it still requires removal. When I&#x27;m shaving (vs. epilating), this is a very comfortable razor and I&#x27;ve set aside my cartridge for the next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave anything ever, you will like this razor.how easily it glided over my knees and ankles - places that I often get nicks.

            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor gives a really close, clean shave, without nicking the skin. It has a pivoting joint, which allows it to turn easily around curves. To be honest, I liked this razor better than some of the razors targeted toward women that are on the market, and will probably use this in the future when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> Awesome new razor from Gillette! I got my razor free to test out from Gillette and see how their new technology works. Its amazing! stays contoured to me face and make every stroke count. Great new technology and gives your face a silky smooth feel that every woman will want to feel.</li>
            <li> First off, let me get a few things out in the open. I have used Gillette products for many years now. I have more than one version of Gillette razor cluttering up my medicine cabinet. Another important thing to mention is that I received this particular model for free from Gillette in return for the review you are now reading... so take what follows accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, I wanted to mention the packaging of this razor. I particularly liked that the blister pack that this razor comes in has a recycled pressed-paper backing. (Almost like cardboard, and easily recycled) The clear plastic front is still a wasteful land-filler, but at the very least, the packaging makes an attempt at being environmentally responsible. Also, packaged with the razor is a nice little plastic tray to set the razor on after your shave, keeping the head of the razor off the counter. Necessary? Probably not, but I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a nice feel in your hand. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or insubstantial. If you are at all familiar with previous Gillette Razors featuring the multi-blade head, this will not seem much different to you. The big difference here (or so Gillette would have you believe) is in the rotating head. As you shave, the razor&#x27;s head swivels left and right, as well as up and down. The thinking is that this helps the razor maintain closer contact to you skin regardless of facial contours. It is a neat idea, but I found it a little difficult to get precise control over the razor because of the head&#x27;s ability to swivel so easily. I really did not notice much difference in the quality of shave from this razor compared to earlier versions of the Gillette Fusion. It provides a close shave, leaving my skin smooth and irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got this razor for free and I haven&#x27;t researched the price, I can&#x27;t really speak to the cost of the handle, or the cost of replacement blade cartridges. I doubt they will be much different than earlier Fusions though, and that means a couple things. They will be a little on the spendy side ( I am a cheapskate, so we&#x27;re talking in the neighborhood of ten to fifteen dollars for the razor itself, and nearly twenty bucks for a 4 count razor cartridge refill.) For me, a razor cartridge lasts a long time (6 to 9 months usually) because I don&#x27;t shave daily. Typically I go four or five days between shaves, and I don&#x27;t shave at all through the winter months, so keep that in mind and weigh it accordingly when considering my statement that a razor cartridge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with previous fusion blades, the head will clog easily with stubble if not rinsed often. For me, since I don&#x27;t shave daily, it goes something like stroke, followed by a rinse, stroke followed by a rinse, etc. etc. I use Gillette Shaving gel as well. Your choice in cream, gel, or other facial lubricant may have an impact on the razor&#x27;s performance as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I will say that the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor with \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot; technology provides a good, close shave. Is it the greatest thing since sliced bread? No, not really. Is it worth replacing whatever your using now? Again, no, probably not. But if you&#x27;re in the market for a new razor anyway, you might as well give this one a shot as it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I sceptical when I first recieved my razor from Gillette, but after trying it out, it gave me a great shave and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, it was a closer shave than my previous razor and left my face feeling smooth..I plan on sticking with this razor because of it&#x27;s incredible results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed my experience with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  I received the product from the Gillette brand so I could try it out and tell others about my experience.  It naturally curves with my face so I don&#x27;t have to contort to make sure I&#x27;ve gotten everywhere.  It is comfortable and makes shaving that much more enjoyable.  I mean enjoyable in the way that it&#x27;s still a chore, but it doesn&#x27;t nick my skin or how I used to contort in weird positions that weren&#x27;t natural.  My experience over the past month have been all positive and I would recommend purchasing this razor based on my experience.</li>
            <li> Gillette recently sent me the new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  Not only was it the most thorough, quickest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, but the product is at such a top quality that is blows every other razor I&#x27;ve ever used in my life out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest curiosity prior to receiving the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology was whether or not the added Flexball technology would safe to use.  All I could think about beforehand was how a razor on a swivel simply doesn&#x27;t sound safe to use.  I was quickly proved wrong within the first 30 seconds of using it.  As someone with a wide, curvy face, I was quickly taught that the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology is the razor that I&#x27;ve been waiting for since I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology, I&#x27;ve tossed out every other razor that I owned.  The Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology will be in my medicine cabinet for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Worked great on side of face and cheeks. I tried it  on chin but cut me up. I didn&#x27;t use sang more force than I did on other spots of face.</li>
            <li> Great razor. I thought that the swivel was a bit of a gimmick at first, but the articulation was actually really helpful. I have something of an angular face and the swivel helped me not nick my cheekbones and jaw. I got a very close shave on fewer passes. It was quite gentle on my skin as well.</li>
            <li> I like both the Fusion Proglide Power and manual blades and tend to simply buy whichever I can find for the best price when I need more blades. The difference between the two -- the &amp;#34;microcomb&amp;#34; at the edge of the Power&#x27;s cartridge, which allegedly exists to &amp;#34;help guide the hair to the blades,&amp;#34; seems like a silly concept to me. Then again, I&#x27;m a daily shaver and my hair isn&#x27;t so long after one day that it needs to be &amp;#34;guided&amp;#34; into the razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the Fusion line because I get a close and comfortable shave. I never get nicked or scratched when using a Fusion blade unless I&#x27;ve been using it too long; the first nick is a sign that the blade is dull and needs to be replaced, which sometimes happens before the lubricating strip indicates a replacement is warranted. I get about two week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of each cartridge and don&#x27;t do anything special to try to prolong their life.</li>
            <li> I received this razor in the mail from Gillette. Disclaimer:  I always try out the latest and greatest Gillette products, however, I&#x27;ve generally found that the new blades improve the shaving experience and not so much the razor. For example, I purchased the Power version of the razors but didn&#x27;t stick with it as the vibrations were rather annoying and didn&#x27;t seem to improve my shave.  That said, I always use the most current version of the blades as soon as they are available.  The first day I used the razor I got the typical great shave I&#x27;ve come to expect from Gillette, however, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was any better than my current Fusion Proglide razor. The next two days I used the Flexball to shave one side of my face and the current fusion to shave the other and I can tell you that the blade definitely tracks the contours of the face much better with the Flexball and results in a more efficient shave (few strokes).  If you are like me and view a great shave as one of life&#x27;s simple pleasures I would definitely recommend upgrading to the Flexball razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Quality feel, nice and heavy. Smooth shave. Did have an issue with cartridge not locking securely onto unit - took 3 tries to engage properly. Stylish design, but at 5 am, I guess that isn&#x27;t a huge selling point for me.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball handle from the company to try out. This is a great razor! It offers a close shave without tugging on my skin with minor irritations, if any. I felt nice after I shaved and didn&#x27;t feel the need to shave again for a couple of days. Great close shave with out and discomfort, definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li> When a new razor comes out I am always skeptical. Something as simple as a straight razor has evolved over years, adding gripped handles, thinner blades, and comfort strips. The &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; razor always seems to add another blade or some other gimmick that doesn&#x27;t amount to much (if it did it would put the single blade disposables out of business). The Flexball finally adds something of substance to razor technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Razor from Gillette in the mail a couple of weeks ago. I held off on any review to be sure if what I was experiencing wasn&#x27;t just the typical new blade honeymoon. While nothing earth-shattering, it did legitimately solve the awkward pain point of flexing and contorting your face to get at hairs. The handle is the same great handle you could expect from Gillette. The blade isn&#x27;t reinvented and gets the job done. The flex ball isn&#x27;t exactly a ball, but creates a pivot point that allows it to hug your face without causing any nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is definitely worth the cost to update your old razor to one with the new Flexball. Bottom line is that it makes shaving a little easier and a little less awkward.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Prorglide Manual Rozor with Flexball Handle as a sample to test. At first I thought hey this is a good razor.  And it is just fine but I didn&#x27;t think it really did that much better of a job then the Gillette fusion without the flexball.  I have a pretty angular face so I thought this would really get into my tough areas well. But it seemed like there was a little bit too much resistance with the flexball.  I have sensitive skin and I feel like I would have had to push to hard to make it work effectively on my face.  With that said its a good razor, just nothing special.</li>
            <li> When I was asked if i would like to try this product by Gillette, I was skeptical that the new flexball handel would really help me get a better shave. However, after shaving with this razor for over a month now I have to admit that I am very impressed. While this new technology does help get a closer shave, I am most impressed with how much this new handle helps make my daily shave more comfortable. Not only does the pivoting head help around the jaw area of the face, but it makes a world of difference around the adams apple. I almost don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself when shaving in that area anymore which is perhaps the most impressive thing of all about this product. Overall I am very satisfied with this product as it has replaces my old non flexball handle.</li>
            <li> Got the Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Razor and tried it out. It had a very close shave and a very smooth feel to my face. The curving of the head of the razor was a little different than what I was use to,but worked very well. My wife had asked me did I change razors or put a new bladed on my old straight razor that I had been using and I told her that I had  got the Fusion ProGlide FlexBall Razor  online to try out. She was very surprised of the close shave that it gave and the smoothness of my face. It was a good deal.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks</li>
            <li> I Received the Gillette Flexball Manual razor from Gillette to try.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Gillette Fusion Power Proglide. The first thing I&lt;br /&gt;noticed was that the razor itself had a nice heffty feel to it. The&lt;br /&gt;flexball technology does makes a difference in that It conformed to all the curves&lt;br /&gt;and angles on my face. The shave was great. All in all it&#x27;s a great razor&lt;br /&gt;and I highly recommend it. I intend on buying the Flexball Power version.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out! I just received the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide® manual razor with Flexball™ technology. I must say, I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle. Personally, I have sensitive skin and there&#x27;s nothing worse than getting ready for a date, and showing up as if you&#x27;ve slaughtered your neck with a butcher knife. But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette. The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave. The five blades are extremely sharp, with virtually no tugging, even after missing shave day for the past week. This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!</li>
            <li> Ok- so this is for men. I am all girl and I love it! Works all those contours like a dream. Those girlie razors are for almost hairless blonds. If you are brunet and have courser hair, this is great. It really glides along with your skin.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver for as a promotional for free in the mail. I read the reviews already posted about it, and I honestly thought people were just trying to look good in hopes for more free promotionals. However, after using it this morning, I doubt I&#x27;ll be using another razor anytime soon. I started using Gillette razors a few years ago, but ran out of cartridges so I went for a cheaper razor (I&#x27;ll leave that brand out of this review). I honestly have never gotten such a close shave that I didn&#x27;t have to go back in a few places. The precision trimmer is great for right under the nose, where most razors have a problem reaching. I will be buying cartridges from now on, once this one dulls out. It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I received this razor compliments of Gillette to try. I typically had preferred their earlier generation Mach3 product, as I found the larger razor head tough to maneuver around the smaller parts of my face (especially under my nose and above my lips). First, I was surprised at the quality of the shave -- very close, very smooth, with no bumps or razor burn at all. I then noticed I&#x27;d completed the whole shave without any awkward corners -- the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; which I thought was a silly gimmick actually helped make it easier to use. Instead of angling and re-angling the head of the razor, I was able to just shave through. At the end of this blade&#x27;s life, I find myself ordering another pack and retiring the Mach3. As a side note, the feel of the handle is one of the nicest I&#x27;ve ever had -- surprisingly nice for something that costs $8.</li>
            <li> The closest shave, period. The flexball really helps on those tricky spots.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free to try &amp; so glad I did. This razor does give you a much closer shave then the other Gillette razors. Good price so everyone can purchase one. Thanks Gillette for sending me this one.</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Gives a nice close shave that contours with your face. Received a trial version from the manufacturer and I think this will replace my old Gillette Mach 3 which I have been using for years. Thanks for the upgraded version and a closer more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the folks at Gillette, I was given the opportunity to try the new Fusion ProGlide with new FlexBall handle technology for FREE. I had previously been using the regular Fusion ProGlide and have been pretty happy with its performance.  The purported benefits of the new FlexBall Handle Technology, is that it responds to every contour of your face as if it&#x27;s been aware of them for years.  What&#x27;s not to like about that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after trying it for a couple of days I was a bit unimpressed. I did like the feel of the razor, and the close shave that the five blades provided, but I didn&#x27;t really find that the FlexBall handle provided any different shave than the regular Fusion ProGlide. To me, it seemed that it only moved slightly and didn&#x27;t give me any closer shave than razors without this feature.  It made me wonder if I was missing something. Why would Gillette go to market with something that was really no different than their other products?  It seemed a bit gimmicky.  I decided to give it one more try and conduct an experiment.  With my next shave, I used the regular Fusion ProGlide on one side of my face, and the Fusion ProGlide with new FlexBall handle technology on the other side.  With this experiment I did notice a difference in how they performed.  The FlexBall razor did work the contours of my face a bit easier than the regular razor and made the shaving process a bit easier.  However, the finished product on both sides was equivalent, thus I can&#x27;t say that I will be running out to switch versions any time soon. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> Got my new Fusion Proglide with the Flexball Handle from Gillette and it was an interesting experience.  The unique feature to the Proglide is a ball that lets the blade swivel to the contours of  your face. In other words, the difficult to get close areas such as under the chin.  It was indeed a smooth shave but with fewer strokes than I usually take.  It curved around the tough spots easily where I used to take a bunch of short strokes to get all the angles.  I am impressed.  My old razor now resides in the drawer next to the sink.</li>
            <li> I have used straight razors in the past but have been an electric shaver user for years. I have recently received a Fusion Proglide straight razor from Gillette to try out and was totally amazed with the shave I experienced with it. First of all, this razor is light to the feel and when shaving I can hardly tell I have anything against my skin. The shave it gave me was very smooth and complete. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about nicks or cuts on my skin. Overall, after my first straight razor shave in years, I was totally impressed. Nice job Gillette on this product!</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent with bzzagent.com, I received one free Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the razor for a few weeks now, I can say that I am truly pleased with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The five blades give me a cliose shave without nicks and without irritation of my sensitive skin;&lt;br /&gt;2. The FlexBall handle enhanced the razor&#x27;s ability to maintain contact with my face while making effortless hairpin turns around the contours of my face with very little effort and no irritation. As a result, I&#x27;ve been able to shave my whole face with less effort; and, at the end of my shave, I find I consistently have less unshaved foam left on my face, which indicates to me that I got a close shave. I can even shave over the problem area of my face - the top of my cheek bone just under my eyes. With other razoers, I have to be very careful to avoid nicks there. Not on nick with the Gillette Fusion!&lt;br /&gt;3. Unlike cheaper razors and disposables, the Fusion razor has weight to it and it is balanced. It feels &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; in your hands and feels like quality and not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. This may not matter to some, but it&#x27;s something I pay attention to. The balanced nature adds to the effortless nature of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It has a single-blade opposite the five main blades for edging and clean up. That works well with my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one &amp;#34;situation&amp;#34; with this razor. I tried to shave the tight area between the very bottom of my nose (under my nostrils) and the top of my mustache with the 5-bladed razor head. The razor head is just too big to shave that area, and i ended up cutting into my mustache. I should have used the single-blade edging feature, but since I didn&#x27;t, I had to shave the entire mustache off and rock the hairless upper lip for the first time since middle school. It wasn&#x27;t so bad. Variety is the spice of life! I enjoyed the new look until my girlfriend made it known she wanted &amp;#34;her&amp;#34; &#x27;stache back. So, the &#x27;stache is back!</li>
            <li> I was given this razor by Gilette to test it out and give my opinions. This razor provided a very close and very smooth shave. The handle makes it possible to shave at a wider range of angles than what a traditional disposable razor would allow. It also adapted to these angles better and didn&#x27;t cut or nick my skin at all. It&#x27;s a little pricier than what I&#x27;d normally go for but it did provide an excellent shave. The blades have retained their sharpness over quite a few shaves, something that certain razors can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  I get a close shave and the Flexball makes a difference.  It enables the razor to go over the contours of my face more smoothly and, therefore, I wind up with fewer nicks and cuts.  I wish the handle had a better grip. It&#x27;s somewhat slippery when wet and this one shortcoming keeps me from giving this razor a five star review.</li>
            <li> It is a great disposable razor. I normally use a safety razor. (The old fashioned kind). I am prone to ingrown hairs and this razor causes less irritation than cartridge razors. The Gillette fusion pro glide gives a smooth shave. It is easy to use. I will continue using the safety razor due to the irritation this razor causes me. If you are not prone to ingrown hairs this razor will work great for you.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball is a great shave.  I generally have trouble with disposable razors cutting me on my rough angles during a shave.  The Flexball allows the razor to adjust to the contours of my face which is great for me.  I only shave 2-4 times a week, which means that I generally have quite a bit of stubble.  Many razors give me razor burn, but this one did not.  I have been using this one for five weeks, and most razors last 3-4.  I suspect I will have to replace it in another week or two, but overall a very good razor.</li>
            <li> I love the new Flexball, I have been using a Proglide Power for the last year and thought it gave a great shave, when I received a free trial of the new razor with the Flexball handle I was impressed.  I does a great job hugging the curves of my face and giving me a close clean shave with a single pass.  If you have never used the Fusion Proglide I would recommend it, the Flexball just makes a great razor even better.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free to try from Gillette. I was a bit skeptical at first - was it really any different from the last model?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit the &#x27;Flexball technology&#x27; does make a difference. The handle is now easier to hold and the razor is easier to shave with. It moves smoother and goes with the angles of my face. I don&#x27;t have the nicks, cuts and scraps that I have had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor a few times and am still getting a smooth shave. Pretty impressive for a &#x27;non-electric&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from Gillette to test, and while I was impressed, as always, with the shaving performance of the Fusion, I wasn&#x27;t overly convinced that the Flexball was making a significant difference. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette razors for over 20 years, all the way back to the Sensor, and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the closeness of the shave, and the powered Fusion shaves particularly smooth. This one does as well, with no complaints at all. In fact. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of difference I noticed between this and the previous, non-Flexball model. If you already have a Fusion, your just as well off with what you have, but I would easily recommend this to anyone using anything else to shave.</li>
            <li> What a razor!  When I got an opportunity from Gillette to try out their new Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology for free, I didn&#x27;t really think there would be much difference between it and the standard Fusion razor I currently use, but boy was I wrong.  This razor just goes where I want it to and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s fighting the contours of my face.  With other razors, you have to turn and rotate and move the blade to get the different angles of the face.  And I&#x27;m usually a two-step shaver...normal downstroke first and then an upward cut to get the leftovers.  But the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall Handle Technology totally eliminated the second step with a REALLY close shave.  And no nicks!  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I didn&#x27;t get even a small cut from my old Fusion.  I&#x27;m usually a skeptic about &#x27;new&#x27; and &#x27;improved&#x27;, but I&#x27;m all in with the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology.</li>
            <li> I am a man who dreads shaving.  I can only force myself to do it by skipping days, and I have a heavy beard.  Not a good look.  I was very impressed by the Gillette Fusion Proglide that I received from the maker.  I even used it several days in a row! The multiple blades stayed sharp for several uses.  The pivoting action made sure that all the angles of my face were covered.  The lubricating strip did a great job in helping the razor glide. The only downside is the price.  I&#x27;m a frugal guy and don&#x27;t normally buy razors that cost this much.  Of course, I also have to skip days with other razors.  I&#x27;m sure my wife will continue to buy these for me so she doesn&#x27;t have to be seen with a &amp;#34;Mountain Man&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;(Her rating for this might be the full 5 stars.)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am not a big fan of cartridge razors. I use safety razors as I find them more economical and usually I feel like they give a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I received this razor as a trial from Gillette.  Before I tried it I just knew it was going to be a bad shave. Well, I was wrong. I was very surprised at how smooth the shave was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I switched to safety razors I used to shave with the regular proglide. I was never impressed with the qaulity of the shave. I was pretty shocked by how much smoother the shave was with this handle. I also like how this handle feels, it seems to be heavier then the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I will switch back to using a cartridge razor (mainly because of cost), but if I ever do I would definitely keep this one handy</li>
            <li> Perfect razor. I received a complimentary sample of this product and it is one of the best razor I have used. Nice close shave. Smooth glide over skin.thanks Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion Manual razor for years and love it.  Whenever a product comes up with a version new and improved I am wary if the claims are true and if changing to it is necessary.  Here Gillette does an amazing job with the enhancements on the Fusion ProGlide.  The flexball  technology is very precise and allows the razor to move seamlessly into areas that may have been difficult in the past.  And when they say the blades are thinner and the best they&#x27;ve ever had it is no lie.  Even after about 20 shaves with one cartridge they give me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and the blades rinse out much easier than others.  Here Gillette has taken a great razor and made it better with user friendly enhancements.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great razor, close shave, no irritation.  Would definitely buy again!!!!!</li>
            <li> Received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology With 1 Razor Blade for free to test for company and it was super easy to access from beginning (always a +); the blade was very familiar to the other Gillette Fusion blades; the pivoting head on the razor seemed to work better than the regular Gillette Fusion razors... I&#x27;d buy as this is a great razor to own and can be reused with the gillette fusion blades! All in all &#x3D; a great shave!</li>
            <li> after watching commercials over and over i finally decided to give this a try. after using this razor for several days i can&#x27;t find anything i don&#x27;t like about it!  it gives an extremely close  shave the first time with minimal irritation. better than the razor iv&#x27;e been using for the past 10 years, i never thought i&#x27;d find a better one but here it is  jeb.</li>
            <li> Gillete sent me this razor to try for free and I very much liked the results. It gives a very close shave and true to its words it does contour very well to you face very well. The razor itself stays very clean and I also liked the feel and look of the overall handle. The only negative thing I could think to say is, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I would prefer, a little lighter would be better, but overall a very high quality product that delivers a very close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product when I ordered this razor from Gillette I honestly thought that it would have been the same as the other fusion razors but boy was I wrong. Once I received it I tried it out an loved it First off it was very flexiable just like it says it is and also love the fact that it has 5 blades but not only that all the fusion razors take the same blades so there for you don&#x27;t have to buy special blades for the particular one, also loved the fact that this razor did not give me razor burn as for all the other razors do. All in all I think this is an excellent razor and I defiantly will be buying heads for this one for now on.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Gillette as part of a campaign . I love this razor. I have used it for over a week and it moves over my face with ease. It did not miss a spot.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me this razor for free to test out. I usually don&#x27;t like these 5+ blade razors for one main reason, they don&#x27;t get under your nose very well, so your mustache is always sloppily shaved. This razor is absolutely the exception because of one feature, a trimming razor on the reverse side. This is my favorite feature, as Gillette addressed the main problem with these multi-blade razors by adding such a simple solution that&#x27;s so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the other features of the razor, they are a lot less gimmicky as I thought they would be. The flexball and the tilt of the blade makes it great for sensitive skin. It takes pressure and control out of your hand to make it swivel to the contours of your face so that you aren&#x27;t pressing hard enough to cause damage to your skin. It&#x27;s something that can take some getting used to for people like me who like to press hard to get the closest shave. Not being able to press very hard makes it very gentle on your skin while still being a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to taking away pressure control is that it doesn&#x27;t get as close as you may like. There were a few scruffy parts on my chin that I went over a few times with the blade, but just couldn&#x27;t get close enough because of the lack of pressure control. It get&#x27;s closer than I thought it would get for such a sensitive blade, but I prefer a bit more control when shaving since I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great razor, and by far my favorite multi-blade razor that I&#x27;ve used so far. I HIGHLY recommend this razor for anyone who wants a shave that&#x27;s easier on their skin. If you like the closest shave possible, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
            <li> I usually use an electric razor, but Gillette sent me the ProGlide for free to try.  I have to say the razor is great.  I have very sensitive skin and usually wind up with razor burn.  I let my beard grow for about a week and then shaved it with the ProGlide.  My face was smooth and wasn&#x27;t sore at all.  I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought into the hype of this razor and decided to give it a try when I got an invite to receive one for free from Gillette. I was still a little skeptical. But it&#x27;s actually an incredible product and glides really well over my face with really nice precision and not much pull at all. The blades are very sharp and they last a good while, but only as long as you clean them after you us them. It definitely lasted longer than the old one that I had (I think it was a Schick), and much longer and durable than any of the disposables that I&#x27;ve used in the past. Gillette has always had great products, but this is the best yet and I would highly recommend this to anybody out there who appreciates a good clean shave without cuts, nicks and pulling. I HATE that! As I&#x27;m sure every guy does! The only down side I see is that these razors are getting a little too big to get those hairs under your nose area, and the price of the refills are a little expensive. But if you think about how long the blades on the refills last, it&#x27;s actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Great product that I received from Gillette. The weight of the handle feels just right to me and it is ergonomically pleasing. Just when you thought there was no more innovations possible in manual shaving devices, along comes Gillette with a swiveling ball handle (perhaps taking a hint from British vacuum manufacturer Dyson?) that allows you to cover more area with less strokes. Rest assured that all the features that have become standard -- moisturizing gel strip, multiple blades, and swiveling head are there in the ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology. It&#x27;s a razor like no other!</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglids Manual razor from Gillette for free to try. I figured the razor would be a cheapo but I was wrong. The razor gives me a nice close shave and I don&#x27;t have stray hairs left on my face when I&#x27;m done. It has also been great for ingrown hairs. I haven&#x27;t had a problem in weeks. Now I only need to make sure I hide it from wife.</li>
            <li> Is good product shipped ontime.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor. The Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Razor with flexball handle is awesome.  I have never had a razor that works this well shave after shave.  From the first shave to the 10th, my face is still as smooth as it was out of the box.  I have a bunch of facial hair, mustache, beard side burns, with the flexball, it glides nicely. I recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great razor, especially if you have sensitive skin like myself. It feels funny shaving and not maneuvering around to get all your face so you don&#x27;t have patches when you&#x27;re finished. The flexball technology does exactly what it says it does on the commercials and I highly recommend this product. You can read my entire review by going to http://www.daddyshangout.com/2014/05/26/new-gillette-razor-makes-for-smooth-shave/.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I still love the original but this one takes the cake or should I say the hair off my face lol. It&#x27;s amazing how close and smooth it gets and makes my face. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT EVERYONE BUY ONE FOR YOU THEN SEND ME ONE LOL</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it!! Leaves my skin so soft even my wife noticed the difference! I received the product from Gillette and I decided to give it a try and leave my electric shaver on the side for awhile and I was surprised on how wonderful this product is.</li>
            <li> My package just arrived it works really well good quality materials it really does a grat job i would recomend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> i received the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology, has a free sample from Gillette, well to be honest i don&#x27;t see a big difference between this and the old gillette profusion, both work excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent .. shaving blades are very sharp, shaving is very fast and leaves skin soft, I&#x27;m really loyal consumer of gillette fusion for several years and  i do not change it for any other brand since their last long sharp knives.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me one of their Fusion Prodglide razors to try out and review. Sorry Gillette, but I’m not a big fan of this item. I will say that it gave me the most comfortable and closest shaves I’ve ever had, but it is big and clunky and misses spots. Hard to reach places like under the nose were impossible to get to with this behemoth. Every time I used it I found myself going back to my 99 cent Bic to trim the places it missed.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave.  I am not much for spending extra money on higher end products unless I have been shown proof it really is worth the extra money.  I can tell you that this razor is worth it!  It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave.  I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards.  I would highly recommend trying this product at least once so you can see for yourself!</li>
            <li> My mom got this free from the company to try out and tell how I liked it. I like the close shave I get from it. Less nicks or cuts. The swivel is nice to help from nicks and cuts. My only issue is that the blade don&#x27;t last long. I was hoping the blade would last longer than normal but it lasts about the same as usual.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Fusion razors for years now and i always enjoyed them, so when this one came out i had to try it out,so i got one from Gillette and i must say it is great. I shave my head and face and this is a upgrade on both surfaces. With the flex-ball i can better get in all the groves of my face and head. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a clean shave</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion free from Gillette to review. It&#x27;s a fantastic product. The best razor on the market today... but is it that big of a jump from the last version...my opinion is no. The last 5 blade they came out with was the best razor on the market and to tell you the truth.. I don&#x27;t notice a difference between them.. The flexball doesnt really move all that much. Not enough to make me go out and buy the latest version. But that being said... this is now the best razor on the planet</li>
            <li> Thank you Gillete for creating one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used to shave after I cut my hair every few weeks or so. I had Gillete&#x27;s Fusions old model back in the day, but this new model they created takes the cake. So smooth like the old model, but this Razor is very much like the Vacuums of today. Today&#x27;s Vacuums can get in a corner of a house for dust or dirt, and this Razor is same way. You can get every hair on your face, and not have to worry about irritations on your face. If you want want to look good, and a close shave with no bumps on your face get the Gillete Fusion Proglide you won&#x27;t be sorry for the purchase.</li>
            <li> In all honesty it is ok and does a good job, Sit pulls and is prone to nicking your face. I have used every razor to mankind and find that the Schick hydro wins with hands down giving you a comfortable shave with built in gel that outlasts Gillette. Gillette is mad in Mexico and is not the same company that it once was</li>
            <li> What a difference a razor can make. This Gillete Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technnology takes shaving to another, more comfortable level. Gillette sent me one to test out and my face thanks them for it. The Flexball handle allows to razor to better hug the contours of my face. I also found the shave itself was much closer than what I would get with other razors that I have tried. The new combination lubricating strip was also a welcome surprise, as it left my face feeling smooth, without the embarassing nicks and patches others leave behind!</li>
            <li> I am not a daily razor user, in fact more like a biweekly user at best. With that said the Gillette Fusion Proglide provided the smoothest and easiest shave I have ever experienced. Previously I most often used some iteration of the Mach3, and the Fusion Proglide was much better. I will definitely purchase replacement blades for this razor when necessary.</li>
            <li> Third day using the Gillette Fusion Proglide- with Flexball Handle that I received from Gillette. I am still trying to get used to the large handle and I see no difference in the closeness of the shave from the other type of Gillette I normally use.  This shaves close, easy to use; just the handle is bulky.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette products for a while now so no surprise here!  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology adds a new element to shaving that I have never experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually can&#x27;t get the area on my neck around my Adam&#x27;s apple.  With the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball Handle Technology  it was a smooth transition to the different contours on my face.  I will be using this from now on!&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree</li>
            <li> This razor gives a smooth comfortable shave with no pulling or irritation. the flexball technology allows you to get closer to your chin and upper lip area. i would recommend this razor to anyone who is serious about shaving.</li>
            <li> When receiving this product from Gillette i was skeptical. However I was very impressed by its performance. It was the closest shave I have ever had. The flexball handle created a more comfortable shave. Also I was able to shave faster than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Adam</li>
            <li> This razor is a great razor. It got the job done. The 5 blades allowed me to cut my shaving time almost in half. The only complaint I have is with the pivot ball, it didn&#x27;t really help or hurt in any way with the way that I shave. Overall awesome product</li>
            <li> I like this razor which  i got from Gillette to review the Gillette Fusion for free . I get a close shave and the Flexball makes a difference to me. It enables the razor to go over the contours of my face more smoothly then my razors before and, therefore, I wind up with fewer nicks and cuts. I wish the handle had a better grip. It&#x27;s somewhat slippery when wet and i did drop it using it for the first time and this one shortcoming keeps me from giving this razor a five star review.</li>
            <li> This razor is great. I love the closeness and smooth shave that it offers. I almost never get ingrown hairs, razor burn, or nicks. The blades offer enough comfort that you almost don&#x27;t need shaving cream, I usually just use water, unless I grow my facial hair out for a week. I thought that the pivoting head would be a bit gimmicky as really how much would that help. However, with the free trial that was offered to me by Gillette, I was pleasantly surprised. Ultimately it helped to get around my entire face and flexed easily to the different angles on my face. Very good razor and seems to be a well build product. I would recommend for any guy looking to get a better/smoother shave!</li>
            <li> I received this awesome razor from Gillette for reviewing purpose.  My name is Anthony and I have used many razors over the years nothing quite compares to the smooth and clean feel I get when I use the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle.  I got a close shave and the Flexball makes a huge difference.  It&#x27;s an improvement over my other razor.  I enjoyed using this razor very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy. In fact, I usually wait for two to four days between shaves just to get the hairs out long enough for the shaver to something to grab. (At 51, I&#x27;m not complaining.) Nonetheless, one aspect that does cause a fair amount of trouble is around my adam&#x27;s apple and on both sides of the neck, just below my jawline. In both cases, I have hairs that grow out in a number of different directions, making them very hard to grab without scraping a couple of times from every direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I heard about the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology, I was hoping that the 3-D movement, instead of just a pivot, would help me get into those evasive spots. I was elated to get a free sample of the new shaver in the mail. After three or four shaves in a couple of weeks, I can truly say that I DO like the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology; although, it may not be for the promoted reason. I loved the smooth glide over my skin and the closeness of each shave; however, the adam&#x27;s apple and sub-jawline areas still took considerably extra strokes to eradicate all of the stubble. I&#x27;m presuming this is because the width of the shaving head still restricts the amount that the Flexball can &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34;. While it would increase the number of strokes necessary for shaving the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, flatter surfaces, I wonder if a more narrow head might better serve the Flexball&#x27;s purpose. Has Gillette considered a two-headed shaver with a standard width on one end and a half-width on the other? (More refill sales!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the smoothness of the shave itself, I noticed the following bullet-points in some of the promotional material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Reengineered Low Cutting Force Blades have thinner, finer edges and advanced low-resistance coating for effortless cutting with less tug and pull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Blade Stabilizer keeps blade spacing optimal, allowing the blades to respond to the contours of your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Streamlined Comfort Guard produces optimal blade contact by channeling excess shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Enhanced Lubrastrip® is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that allow the razor to move smoothly over your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely say that that these components really do make a difference. I am certainly inclined to stick with the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology simply for the smooth comfort of the shave alone.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. The moving ball is a gimmick. Stick with the original!</li>
            <li> I received unit from the brand for review, liked very much. Very smooth shave. Impressed with quality of razor, nice feel in the hand, was surprised at how heavy it was. Nice for wife, she used and liked the results also. Price seems a bit high for my budget but still a nice result.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the shave. Thought it did very well going down the contours of my neck, and didn&#x27;t pull the hairs but instead gave me a really close shave.</li>
            <li> I received the product from GILLETTE to try out and I have used a lot of razors in my life, from disposable to 5 blade razors. Forgive me if I was expecting just a regular shave, I mean how much can one razor differ from another. Well, the Gillette Fusion Proglide amazed me, it really was different from others. What set it apart for me what the flex ball and how easy it was able to reach each hair on my face. It really did glide along my face, especially under my nose. That for me is the toughest spot to reach, but the Proglide had no issues with it.My face was super smooth all over, which is something that should happen... and did. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone. Actually, I already have!</li>
            <li> One of the best razor I used thus far!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a new razor.  I mean how many razors are they going to make and can they function any differently than the previous one?  Well after giving this razor a try, the answer is yes, they can be different.  The Gillette fusion proglide contours to the curves in my face and easily cuts coarse facial hair.  It leaves a clean shave finish without razor burn.  Gillette your best razor yet!</li>
            <li> This product is great. Gentle on the skin, versatile. Big Win. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very Close shave, didn&#x27;t miss a hair, didn&#x27;t get stuck on hard stubble.  AWESOME RAZOR!!</li>
            <li> I received this product from Gilette to try. I used it every day for a couple weeks. The first thing I noticed was that the razor seemed heavy in my hand. I&#x27;ve used disposable razors for 10+ years, mostly Gillette Mach3. The Mach3 is light and easy to use, even though the FlexBall flexes to fit the contours of my face. The weight (or perceived weight) of the FlexBall detracts from its usefulness. The FlexBall does flex rather well. I found myself using my thumb to direct the ball (and therefore the head). I expected it to be easier to put the razor in a different direction, and it just naturally flex in that direction. The flex was OK without direction, but it was quite adequate when I directed it with my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexBall did work reasonably well overall; no nicks, no scratches, and relatively easy to use. I used the FlexBall as a finishing razor since I use an electronic razor to do most of the shaving work. I used the Flexball to clear off my neck and upper cheeks. I have a beard that I sculpt, and I found this razor was a good razor to sculpt the edges and keep the hair edges flush. It seemed to be a little slow to clean up my facial hair with this razor compared with the Mach3. I shave dry, and I had no comfort issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was buying this razor with my own money, I would probably wait until I could buy just the refill blades. These are sold on Amazon as a razor with a blade and 2 refills. This isn&#x27;t as cheap as Gilette&#x27;s other Fusion ProGlide blade refills. This isn&#x27;t really a reflection on the product, but a fact to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: A good razor, especially considering it does flex. Its bulk/weight was a factor for me, and probably enough of a factor not to buy. I have used other premium disposable razors, and they are lighter and easier to use, even when you consider the flexing of the FlexBall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other details:</li>
            <li> VERY SMOOTH SHAVE LOVE THE ROLLER BALL ATTACHED. MY FACE FEELS YOUNG AGAIN AFTER I SHAVE REFREAHING.</li>
            <li> This razor is absolutely amazing!!!! That&#x27;s saying a lot coming from me, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other razors to keep a perfect groom style between visits to my barber. This razor gave me one of the smoothest shaves ever and that&#x27;s very important as I have sensitive skin and with other razors would suffer the ugly razor bumps the following days. I give this razor an outstanding 9 of 10.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving regularly (daily, or every other day) and this razor was amazing for the first few shaves. Surprising, the flex ball did wonders for my annoying angular chin. However, with the price of just one of these razors, and how often one is &#x27;recommended&#x27; to buy new ones, I would be broke very quickly. I only used the razor 5 times in about two weeks, and it&#x27;s already causing burn after. But no cuts, and I believe its because of the flex ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for the mobility of the razor, (since its the first time I haven&#x27;t got cut on a razor on my chin after using it. (burn is a different story)) but the blades are the same old ones that are done in just a few uses. However, I am buying definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love the flex ball! It makes shaving muh easier. I always use Gillette razors and this is one of the best. It makes my skin soft and smooth! No Knicks or cuts either.</li>
            <li> I got this free from Gillette. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as an everyday razor, it tears your face up. I don&#x27;t see the point of the swivel unless you shave at a weird angle.</li>
            <li> Works well , Used this every day for 45 days . gave a GREAT shave , I have a few scares and usually they get cut -up, not  with this Razor . Will Buy more  ,Great Job</li>
            <li> Great razor......... I got the Gillette Fusion free from Gillette to review............Gives me a smooth clean shave and does it in half the time of my other disposables. Good for several shaves and worth the money. I would suggest anyone looking for a great shave to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received The Fusion ProGlide from Gillette to try and review my experience. I had given up on manual razors because I have very sensitive skin and they usually leave me red and in pain.  At first glance the design of the razor was great.  It appealed to both me and my wife.  The flex ball handle allowed me to navigate easily and smoothly to a clean shave.  The flexball allowed me to get around my face with ease without difficulty.  The handle felt sturdy and felt solid in my hand.     Pro&#x27;s    Close shave because of the Flexball technology  The moisturizer actually works and you can feel it afterwards  The blades missed no hair on me  It looks good (not a huge pro for me but the wife thought it was cute)    Con&#x27;s    These blades are costly (I don&#x27;t so this might be a pro for me but a con for others)</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I have used. It was very smooth and not a single knickknacks. Easy to control and extremely easy to rinse. The roller ball made this razor easily glide around the contours of my face. I highly reccomend this razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball Technology&lt;br /&gt;In writing this I am at 2 1/2 weeks of daily use of the Gillette Fusion ProGlide with Flexball Technology. This razor is exceptionally sharp, probably more so than my wit. I am still using this with the same blade, at this point most blades would require a change yet this one is still good by both indicator and cut without nicks due to dulling of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Where this technology shines is around the Adams apples of the throat and the contours of the chin making the glide a smooth effortless journey and in my case allowing for additional pressure to be applied. I would rate this razor as a whole a 8 out of 10 with the caveat that no razor has made it any farther than an 8 leaving room for new innovation, the blade however has to be one of the best in both shave (noting handles involvement) and sharpness along with comfort of shave which could have everything to do with the technology, as one of the best on the market in both comfort and blade longevity.&lt;br /&gt;This equates to more kisses due to smoothness and duration of smoothness, and as we all know the value in the is enormous, love knows no bounds except a scratchy face ;-) PRICLESS!</li>
            <li> I was given this razor by Gillette to review. The flexball really doesn&#x27;t add anything to my shave. I have been shaving since before the Mach3 came out and have used Gillette cartridge razors exclusively for shaving until the last year when I switched to a double sided safety razor (Merkur Heavy Duty #34c w/ Derby blades, which I love btw).  This Flexball razor is almost identical to the Fusion, which is almost the same as the Mach3 except it has 5 blades instead of 3. I didn&#x27;t notice the razor doing any pivoting or flexing or whatever they say it does, so it seems to be mostly marketing hype like all their other \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; razors. That said, it does give a decent shave, it&#x27;s quick, and it&#x27;s safe. In fact, the whole time I have shaved with Gillette cartridge razors I have never once cut myself.    Negatives on this razor mainly come with the price of the blades. You will be dropping hundreds of dollars a year for these blades if you replace them at the recommended intervals (does anyone actually do that?). The other downside is that despite all the fancy technology that make for a quick and close shave, having the multiple blades actually gets too close for me. I can&#x27;t shave more than about twice a week with these razors because my skin is pretty prone to razor burn. I tried going every other day like I do now with my Merkur, for science, and it chewed up my face pretty bad. I did all the prep work and was very careful, but by the end of the first week my skin was in bad shape so I had to stop.    If you already have a Fusion or Mach3 or any of the variations you really aren&#x27;t missing anything with this. It&#x27;s not a bad razor by any means, but even the amazing Flexball will not get me to switch back from my Merkur.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology is a cool looking razor.  The handle is the same as a regular Fusion handle but at the top it splits apart and there is a hinged ball and sprig to allow for some pivoting action.  If you like Gillette Fusion razors then there is nothing here that will turn you off.  However it is hard to say what a slightly pivoting head does for its efficiency.  I did not notice any significant change from shaving with a non Flexball handle.  But it offers at least the same good shave as other Fusion handles and it does look cool.</li>
            <li> The first thing I notice was the solid feel in my hand.This razor has some heft to it. Next was that the head of the razor pivots from side to side and back and forth. Now how does it shave? Excellent!!!! This razor gives a very close shave. The Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall is my new razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide is a solid razor with a close shave. It is smooth on the skin and contours to the face nicely, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a big step forward for Gillette. The Flexball Handle feels very gimmicky and less than functional, except for maybe the slightest difference is shave closeness. Comparing it to the Mach 3 Power Razor, which I have been using for some time, I feel the Power Razor created less skin irritation, but the Flexball had a closer shave. There was not enough of a difference to warrant an upgrade in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Reviw from the Electric razor camp&lt;br /&gt; May 26, 2014 by fjsenters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have for so many years I cannot remember used electric razor. So when I was asked to use a regular blade razor I was lets say a little CUT shy. Most razors for whatever reason seem to cut me around my chin area. I am not too keen on having to stand around with toilet paper on my face waiting for the blood to quit pouring out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I got the Fusion ProGlide with NEW FlexBall Handle Technology from Gillette through the Buzz agent campaign and found that I had one more problem. I don&#x27;t have shaving cream in the house. I started looking in the mans toiletry drawer.(yup its a junk drawer for toiletries) and low and behold I did have a shaving lotion that lathers into a cream. SO not sure how well this would work because it has to be years od, I used it. To my surprise, it worked and so did the new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waited a few days to write this as I wanted to see if it continued to work. It did. in fact, (sorry electric shaver guys) it has given me one of the closest shaves I have had in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I had a chance to use this... I think I am going to get some good shaving cream and keep using it for a while to see how it lasts..&lt;br /&gt;I normally get things through Buzz Agent, but this one came from the manufacturer. Thank you Gillette. ( And Buzz Agent for telling them about me...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for now ... Big thumbs up...No toilet paper face...</li>
            <li> I received this Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette to try. At first I was a bit scheptical but always like new adventures. I tried it and was amazed at how they have improved the manual razor blade. The all-around feel of it is great. As I used it I noticed right away how comfortable it was. No nicks as I experienced from razors of the past. The flexball technology is really neat. It just glides over face and really gets the facial hair thoroughly off. A great razor .....</li>
            <li> I had use other Gillette Razors, prior to recently, getting the Fusion Proglide Razor.  The experience was with the razor was fantastic.. The shaver glided smoothly, over my face, and for once, I did not cut myself. I plan on using the Gillette Fusion Proglide, for a long time.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from Gillette - and it is a great razor!  I keep a low cut beard, but like to keep it clean by cleaning up extra growth around my cheek bones and neck - all razors get this done just fine, since it&#x27;s not much to shave, but the razor was very nice as far as keeping contact and only taking a couple of swipes to get everything done. Kinda funny,  you wouldn&#x27;t think that razors could really do anything special, but this did push that notch a bit further compared to other razor companies. I&#x27;m sure if I fully clean shaved, It&#x27;d be a nice touch with the pivoting head - so if you&#x27;re looking to try a good razor without the &amp;#34;electronics&amp;#34; - this is a good one!</li>
            <li> Got this razor, not expecting anything different from previous Gillette prducts. Sure the swivel ball sounds like a cool idea, but I didn&#x27;t think it was enough to change products permanently. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Out of the box, its sharper than any other razor I&#x27;ve used. It held up to hair too long to be considered stuble. The swivel ball function Is in fact a change the increases the function of the product. I was able to cross my jaw line both against and with the grain. Prior to a device like this, I&#x27;d always knick myself attempting to get every hair on the jaw line. From now on, the slick motion and function of the flexible handle is what I&#x27;m sticking with, unless they make another great improvement...</li>
            <li> Throughout my life I have only ever used the Mach 3 and the regular Fusion Proglide razors but I was recently sent a sample Flexball razor from Gillette.  Wow I never realized how much better my shave could be.  It does exactly as it says by actually hitting every hair and giving a much closer shave than I am used to.  When I used my old razors, I used to feel some irritation around the corners of my chin that I thought was normal.  The flexing head of this razor contoured well enough to my face so that I will never have that problem ever again!  No ingrown hairs or other issues.  Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Shaving in the morning is soft and fast with this razor. I don&#x27;t have to go back over like with some razors. The pivoting of the head allows me to get those tight spots without giving myself razor burn or cuts. I used to use an electric razor but I&#x27;m pretty sure I just found my permanent replacement.</li>
            <li> After getting this razor from the brand Gillette I shaved half of my face with the Gillette Fusion Proglide and the other half with just the Gillette Fusion and the gliding power of the Proglide is exceptionally better!</li>
            <li> The razor, like the non flexball version, is super sharp and will give you a great shave. However thd pivot movement of the flexball means the blades move from side to side, and so I ended up putting a nice slash into the side if my head. Not great . I will stick with the regular Proglide or , even better, the mach 3, still the best gillette razor in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think at first. After using I came away with a very smooth shave and no cuts. Definitely would use it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical at first that a design such as the new ProGlide would make any kind of difference. However, after using the razor and actually FEELING the difference I will never use another razor. It follows every contour of your face keeping the blades in contact with your skin. I have noticed fewer strokes while shaving making it possibly the fastest manual razor ever! Gillette has raised the bar with this product!</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette and I like it a lot. It looks nice and does its job as any other G-products. The only thing the should have added to it was that vibrating function, as they had on other Gillette Fusion Proglide. Hope it will be their next step.</li>
            <li> First off, I received this from Gillette itself to test for them. Now with that out of the way, let&#x27;s get on with the review.&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle adds a new flair to the original design of the disposable razor. The body is actually much stronger then I had previously assumed and has some heft to it. I don&#x27;t feel like I might snap the thing. It has the normal Gillette colors of silver, blue and orange.&lt;br /&gt;I used the razor for the first time and from the first stroke it was a smooth shave. I had a bit of hair build-up since I was waiting for the razor to show up in the mail. It took a couple strokes to tear through, but it did a magnificent job. A very close shave with very few nicks. The flexball actually does help contour the blade to the shape of your face by pivoting as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;The blades themselves are nice. I usually use Gillette razors, so I know they stand up for quite a while. I personally love the five blade design, since it seems to get a better shave then the lesser models.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good, close shave for an affordable price, this product would be for you. I would highly recommend this product to a peer.</li>
            <li> only used one time but seems to be very good quality</li>
            <li> It seems like razor manufacturers are always coming out with new gimmicks so I’m usually skeptical when I hear about something like a flexball handle because usually  the gimmick does nothing for me and I’m content to stick with my Gillette Mach 3. The latest gimmick is the swiveling head of this Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology. However, this gimmick is actually pretty cool and helpful. The head of the razor (the blade part) rotates from side to side. I notice that while shaving not a lot of actual rotation occurs but it’s enough to make a difference. I got a very close, smooth, and cut free shave that appeared to stem partially from the flexball technology. I also like the fact that this razor is heavier so it felt more solid and comfortable in my hand. The question will be how much are replacement blades? I like this razor but not enough to pay more for replacement blades than I’m paying for Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> For us guys that do shave our faces on a regular basis, the one thing we want to make sure we do is get a close shave that will leave us looking and feeling good. Gillette Fusion Proglide&#x27;s new razoe with teh flexball handle does that in a way that I didn&#x27;t quite expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an attractive razor with a easy grip handle and the technology to cover every area of your face with ease. I&#x27;m normally a disposable razor guy, but this Gillette Fusion Proglide razor is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette for a long time. I recently received this razor from Gillette to try. In short I love it. It will now be the only razor that I will ever use. The shear number of blades must be the reason that it cuts the hair on my face and head with only one pass. I have never had a razor that shaves my face and head so close with only one stroke. There&#x27;s no re lathering and going over the areas again. One pass over your face is a real time saver to a daunting task that has to be done daily. When you finish shaving you don&#x27;t have that irritating burn that happens most times after shaving. After 52 years I have finally found the razor that will be with me for life. If you clean and dry the blades after each use they will last a lot longer before they need replacing. I recommend everyone at least give this razor a try and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband as he is quite picky about his razors.  This is one that is a keeper and I will be purchasing more for him.</li>
            <li> ive been using gillette products ever sense i started shaving regularly(i also use gillette shaving cream)and currently use a gillette fusion.&lt;br /&gt;after recieving the fusion proglide from gillette it go to show the professional quality you use in building your razors from the close shave to following the contours of your face its top quality,id recomend gillette fusion and gillette products to anybody.....thank you&lt;br /&gt;what id like to see is a razor that contours to the shape of your head for the people that shave there heads regularly</li>
            <li> I remember the worst shave I ever had (this isn&#x27;t it - I&#x27;m just offering a comparison). It was with a single-blade disposable razor that I bought from the employee shop for $1.10. It was a first job and I was running late so I didn&#x27;t shave that morning, but my boss called me out for dress code because my face looked shaggy. After that single-blade shave, my face looked like I&#x27;d lost a fight with a rather aggressive chicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long and short - having more blades is good. I&#x27;ve since forever shunned single-blades, and I eventually walked my way up to the 4-bladed Shick Quattro, but the blades got to be expensive so I went back down a blade to the Mach-3. I think the Mach-3 is a great balance of comfort and cost, and that&#x27;s my point of comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology has an astonishing 5 blades and gives a very smooth shave. The razor is called (oddly) manual not because you use it with your hands - I mean, you do. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d trust a razor that shaved me of its own accord. Rather, I think that&#x27;s to contrast the other Fusion products which have a battery in them and vibrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball allows side-to-side adjustment, at least the way my face is contoured. That allows jawline and chin to be covered in fewer strokes - yes, I actually shaved one day with the Proglide w/Flexball and another with my Mach-3 and counted. That really does matter if you&#x27;re prone to get razor-burn. The comfort strip is excellent, as I expect from other Gillette products. I didn&#x27;t notice as much of an advantage with the advertised improved grip, but the grip on the Mach-3 is nice anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get back to those blades - yes, there are five of them on the cartridge and this product comes with one cartridge and the handle, with refills sold separately. The head isn&#x27;t that much bigger than a Mach-3&#x27;s and hence the blades seem thinner and I treat them more delicately. Perhaps that allows for such a nice shave, but I have to wonder about their durability. I tend to use my blades far longer than recommended (I admit it, I&#x27;m cheap), though after two weeks of shaving almost every day, I&#x27;ve not noticed the shave becoming rougher yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor with Flexball Handle Technology 4 stars because I really do like it, though I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll forever switch from the Mach-3. I will most likely pick up a refill pack though there are times that the Mach-3&#x27;s lower price point (the Proglide is roughly 50% more expensive for refills) will sway me that way.or such a nice shave, but I have to wonder about their durability.

            <li> I bought it for the flexible handle.  Good improvement.  It improves what was already a 95 point shave into a 98 point shave.  In particular it does a much better job on the curve of my chin.  The only place it still can&#x27;t reach is right under my nose, which is ironic given the TV ads Gillette is running show various men scrunching up their faces to reach that spot.  I think it&#x27;s due to the 3/8&amp;#34; of plastic surface below the blades which keep the blades from reaching that last spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the old Fusion blades are compatible with this new handle.</li>
            <li> I I have to say received this razor from Gillette as a gift for reviewing it and I have to say it does a nice shave. I like the Proglide line and have been using them for a while. When I saw this I was very interested in how well the flexball worked. I have to say that it does give a smooth  shave but for me I can take the flexball or leave it. The flexball really doesn&#x27;t do anything major for me. But the razor itself is what I have  come to expect from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I just received the free razor from bzzagent.com. I have been shaving with blades since I was 8 years old; started with the Wilkinson and later the Gillette single blade razor. I tried other razors such as big or shick but like the single blades they gave me razor burn. Then I grew my beard and until I was in the ARMY HARDLY SHAVED. So I had to get blades and equipment: first the double blades, then triple, then quadruple and now the five blade with pivot head. I have been a user of Gilette products for years. So I finally got to try this new razor; my beard is strong and I use the razors to trim or shape my beard, but I always had a hard time to get rid of hair or skin cells left in between the blades; the new swivel head helps me tremendously getting the space clear of muck from shaving. I still use the regular Fusion, but with the addition of the pivot ball I might even change to the power version. I also shave everyday to keep the skin smooth and silky for the lady.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing! The cut is as smooth and close as Gillette&#x27;s other five blade razors but I am very happy about the new innovation in the swivel design. I normally have some difficulty shaving two areas of my jaw line, one on the side of the chin and the other back towards the neck but thanks to the new swivel technology those two spots are about 5 times easier to shave. I&#x27;m usually needing to stop my shave and adjust position in order to get a proper shave in those odd angle areas of my face and I&#x27;m often adjusting three or four times to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;When I used this new razor, I was impressed, I didn&#x27;t need to adjust my position at all. The swivel was designed perfectly to bend to my face because the swivel moves not only side to side but also up and down. The best part is that the two motions can happen at the same time, which works fantastically for reaching those tough to shave angles on the side of the chin and jaw. The blade could curve around the chin/jaw while bending to stay firmly against my skin with one single up stroke! I&#x27;ve never seen another razor that can do this. I would absolutely recommend this razor to a friend. I received a free razor from Gillette but the opinions are entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette fusion for a long time and live the precision of their razors and how close the shave is. The razors are excellent. That&#x27;s why when I bought the new razor with the new handle I was pretty excited. As for the new flex ball handle, I like it although it feels like I have to be more careful than normal because I feel like it&#x27;s going to slip and cut my face. It might just be that I&#x27;m used to the handle being rigid but I find myself always more careful with this handle. I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet so it&#x27;s probably just me being neurotic. Overall great razor. I like the new handle, just not sure how necessary it was.</li>
            <li> As described works great</li>
            <li> My dad got this and he is quite happy with the performance. He stated it is an exceptionally smooth shave, very easy to use, and the closeness of the shave was excellent. Not sure how cost effective it is yet, but initial impression is totally satisfied and he has one of those beard growths that has him often saying, &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t I just shave?&amp;#34; He thinks he might actually be able to skip a day for a change!</li>
            <li> The razor I received for free from Gillette moves smoothly over my skin, even on repeat strokes. Gets almost every hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> I received the proglide in the mail from Gillette and used it at once. I was impressed at how well the proglide gave me a smooth close shave. At first, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be different from any other razor that I have used. But once I used the proglide I felt the difference. The proglide with PowerBook technology is my razor of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> Love the flexibility, and the fact that it use the same blades as earlier Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> Just noticed review under my wife&#x27;s account. This is my review, not hers. I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology to try out and see how I would like it. I have a beard that grows in every direction and trying to get a close has always been a challenge. I either ended up with a raw neck or worse - ingrown hairs from shaving the wrong direction. I had settled on a less than close shave because of this. When I received the new Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology I was eager to try out the pivoting head to see if I could get a closer shave without the agony of past attempts. I have been delighted to find out I can shave inn any direction, with the beard, against the beard, and across the beard to achieve a closer shave than I have obtained in years! The additional lubrication on the strip is an added bonus as I have found the previous Gillette strips have lost lubrication too fast. I would recommend the new Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Technology to everyone who wants to get a closer shave than they have had in a long time!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Gillette to try out and review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I haven&#x27;t used a manual razor in years, however I was highly satisfied with how comfortably this shaves. I rinsed my face with warm water and then applied some shaving cream and let it sit for a minute or two. I then proceeded to shave with the grain. The result was a close shave with no nicks. The &amp;#34;Precision Trimmer&amp;#34; did an excellent job of shaving under my nose and the bottoms of my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, did the &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; contribute to how comfortable the shave was? Again, it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a manual razor, so I can&#x27;t really judge that. I can say that I did notice the razor pivoting while I was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lubricating strip... It certainly did it&#x27;s job of reducing friction and it seemingly isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; out as quickly as I remember from the past (again... it&#x27;s been a while...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I noticed, and it seems that several others have as well, was that it tends to take more than a simple rinse to get all of the shaving cream out.</li>
            <li> I have been using gillette since I started to shave when I was young. Its my #1 brand I dont think I would change it. Now when I received the Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with flexball handle for free from Gillette, I thought that the flex ball would make a difference, but truly there is no difference. I did like it, but its not like I would replace my old one for this one. Still gillette will be my favorite brand is just that this wasn&#x27;t a good improvement.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Gillette guy, but when the prices of their razors went up and the availability of the Moch 3 went down, I opted to switch to the electric razor. This was my first foray back into manual razors in over two years - and it was not pleasant. I received this razor from Gillette to try out a few weeks ago.    I&#x27;ve gone through two cycles of shaving (always post shower, with shaving gel). Both times, I&#x27;ve had numerous knicks and raw spots on both my neck and cheeks. Perhaps I just have sensitive skin - but I have always perceived of the 5 blade razors as \\&quot;dragging\\&quot; a bit too long on my face - leaving noticeable bumps and irritation.    Also, the pivot function wasn&#x27;t as useful as advertised. I imagine if I regularly shaved areas that had more curves (e.g. arms, chest, legs, etc) - then pushing down and pivoting the blade might be more useful. As for the face areas, the pivot made absolutely no difference.    Overall, I was disappointed with this product - I still did get a shave, but irritation to follow. If I switch to anything, it&#x27;ll be a safety razor or straight blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent It works perfect. No complaint so for…….</li>
            <li> I love this, but it&#x27;s a little expensive. Worked great with even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I received the razor from Gillette in order to test it out and it exceeded all my expectations. Everyone do yourselves a favor and throw away your old razors and buy this one</li>
            <li> This is a legitimate upgrade in the Fusion series. I actually love the vibrating version and would recommend that for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> The razor has done excellent!  It shaves a wonderfully close shave.  The Flexiball handle really makes the razor work even better than a normal Gillette Fusion, and that is saying tons.  Very good for face and head shaving, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at what the flexball did, it made a smoother shave and the blade lasted for roughly a month at 3-4 shaves per week.</li>
            <li> I have used the proglide for a month after I received it as a test sample from gillette and overall I feel it does a good job shaving but I find the head is a little big when shaving under the nose.    pros: an outstanding smooth close shave, good handle grip, wears well.    neutral: the swivel head does not appear to do much good    cons: I find the head is too big in some places, the top single blade is slightly difficult to use.    overall a good razor but I will buy one with a smaller head next time</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me this razor to try and overall, I&#x27;ve had no complaints with the use of this razor. It gives me exactly what I would expect. A good shave. The commercial seems to indicate that this razor would bend and flex around the curvature of the Earth itself. It might, but I don&#x27;t believe it matters as much for the overall shave. Basically, if you&#x27;re deciding between this razor and a more expensive one, then this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I received one of these razors from Gillette and I was really impressed.  I was worried about how the flexball would work.  It was flexible, but not too flexible.  It moved around by chin and jaw line nicely.  And as a cyclist I also had to try it out shaving my legs.  It worked well there too.  Overall, I think this was a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty awesome razor I haven&#x27;t found one that is like it price wise or quality.</li>
            <li> I am a convert!  I have also bought these for my friends.  The flexball really does help with the curves of the neck.  I&#x27;ll never go back</li>
            <li> Have used the regular Fusion for a few years, I tried this on a whim, I am very happy with the feel of an even cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> Move over Gillette there is a new and better shhaver on the block and it is called the Schick Hydro 5. See my earlier review of theis new Schick shaving systemthat will surely be favored over Gillette within a year or so. Until this new Schick came out i was Inlove with the Fusion, but no longer!</li>
            <li> I always wondered how many blades will it take for them to be satisfied that we are receiving the best shape ever, Over time there is been multiple changes in the way we have to conquer our beard. But I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with Gillette Fusion Proglide because even though I have sensitive skin I have received the perfect shave, and I have to say that the blades stay sharp much longer than any others I have used before.That&#x27;s why receiving this product for free thanks to Gillette was the icing on the cake. This product is well worth it and one that I will keep using for a long time.</li>
            <li> Last week I received the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor as part of the BzzAgent to test out and review.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the razor. I used the razor 5 times in the past seven days and have yet to have a problem with the blade.  I was skeptical of the utility of the flexball, but its performance has won me over.  The subtle shift of the head helps the razor to hug my face when transitioning from the check to under the chin in the same stroke. The five blades do an excellent job of shaving with fewer passes and have remained sharp over the past week.  Just as important, the thin blades do not clog as easily and are easier to clean than other multi-bladed razors I have used. It has been all smooth, clean shaves with no stubble or irritations. Definitely no complaints, I will update the review with the service life for a razor as I continue to use the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using the same razor for over three weeks and still getting a good shave.  It takes a couple of more stokes than the fresh out of the pack razor but it has yet to snag or cut. But I do have to rinse the blade more to unclog the blades.  Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with the razor and am about to order a refill pack of blades.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t think the flexball really does anything special. It&#x27;s the same blade you would get in any other Gillette Fusion package. Although I think you only get one blade here as opposed to 2 blades in the regular Proglide package.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best razors I have ever used, to go back to my old shaver which was pretty good seems like a step, backwards 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 razor for well over 10-15 years and every time I have switched and tried something new, or different, no luck. I have a very tough beard. I cannot be in a rush to shave if I’m heading out the door as I will always nick myself enough that it takes awhile to heal. Very frustrating. Well, I received an email to try the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology. Of course seeing “Free” just for reviewing or talking about it certainly helped! I went in to this thinking I have tried and tried more blades on a razor and the only difference is I have more nicks, 1 for every blade . Now, they did send the razor and gel together. The first day I tried both and I was quite amazed. I did not cut myself and I had a very smooth shave. The second day I did have a small cut, but I the razor still gave me a very smooth shave as it actually traced my face and chin. It really does flex! The tester I am, I tried using my Mach 3 with this gel. Although it helped, I still had a lot of pulling and cuts. Then I tried the new Fusion along with my typical gel, Edge with Aloe. This was the only shave cream I could use that would reduce 10+ nicks all the time. Although I still had minimal pulling and nicks, it is definitely not as smooth as the Fusion ProGlide 2-in1 Gel +Skin Care! So for the past couple of weeks I have been enjoying my morning shave with both the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Gel + Skin Care and ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology. Then I’m thinking the price of the replacement cartridges are going to be sky high over the Mach 3, but to my amazement the cost difference is negligible. $0.50 each or so, not bad well worth it as I’m actually getting more uses out of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me one of these to try for free. It seem to work well for me. I like it and I&#x27;d recommend it to people if you can afford the refills. The only reason for a 3 star instead of 5 star review is the price of refills</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband - he likes it a lot.  I&#x27;m subscribing to the razor refills as well. It&#x27;s super easy and convenient to purchase them on Amazon (and I got the razor at a great price).  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I am long time Gillette Customer. I don&#x27;t even remember using a different razor even when i am travelling. There is no other Razor which is comparable to Gillette performance at the same time i never thought it was perfect until now. They nailed it this time. Always had little issues when shaving the neck area because of my sensitive skin. But with the Flexiball handle technology my shaves are quick, easy, smooth and last long. I would never buy any other razor other than Gillette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the flexball or the blade, but I am extremely impressed with the closeness of the shave. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Finally caved for the 5 blades. Used coupon $4 off. When blade is new this thing glides..... Nice balanced weight. Looks cool.</li>
            <li> Gillette is usually the brand I used. I like it and this preclude with the swivel head is no exception. The shave is smooth, clean and close. O usually get irritated with other types of razors but not this one. The only &#x27;bad&#x27; thing I would say about this is that because of the swivel head, it takes a shave or to to get used to the way it moves. I usually shave early in the morning right before work and I usually shave in a hurry... That&#x27;s how I tried the swivel head for the first time and I have no idea how, but I knocked my nose. Its just a tad different experience than a non-swivel head but after you get used to it, its awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fusion razors for several years. I like the way the razor industry keeps improving, especially with multiple blades that reduce nicks and cuts. However, this razor is NOT as good as my regular Fusion. I don&#x27;t really like the floating head. It is supposed to make it safer and easier to shave. However, it reduces the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; I have when shaving, and that leads to more nicks and cuts, not less. So this time I can say: please, DON&#x27;T change what you had before. That was great. This isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> As with all manual, multiple blade shavers, I found I got a decent shave with this razor. I do tend to get a few ingrown hairs, which I can&#x27;t necessarily fault the razor for, but this one was certainly no different in that respect. I had to pass over a few areas a few times; again, really nothing new. The &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; handle was fine but more of a gimmick, IMO, than a really innovative technology. Plus there was a tiny bit of a learning curve to using it.  My main gripes with this, or really any disposable razor these days, are 1) the lube strip works great for the 1st shave, just OK for the 2nd, and even if the blades are sharp enough for more shaves than that, the lube strips are useless; and 2) The refills are outrageously expensive. I am guessing that&#x27;s why myself, and many others, got to try this for free from Gillette - they can make a mint back on us from buying refills for this. The truth is, I&#x27;m a simple guy and while I appreciate a close shave, and do think that multiple blades have improved shaving, the gimmicks (roller ball, vibration, lube strips, etc.) are really just ways to boost the cost of the refills without really changing the overall experience.  Give me a few blades, some shaving cream, and I&#x27;m good to go. You probably won&#x27;t hate this razor but you won&#x27;t be blown away either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just to be sure you understand, I did try this for free from Gillette.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really surprise me, but this razor isn&#x27;t much different than the last &#x27;new thing&#x27; to come out. Sure, its flashy. It has a roller ball thingy...but really, why? I have super sensitive skin and i am always looking for a new razor to keep down the burn and let me shave comfortably more frequently than every 3 days, and so i gave it a shot. I could tell that the flexball helps, but only by a bit (and for the extra money...probably not worth it), but the real problem with this razor is that as soon as it gets wet, it slips out of your hands! I even had to put it down and pick up my Mach 3 just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have some type of hand muscle thing going on....and nope! had no trouble hanging on to that one. Oh well. I give the guys at Gillette a thumbs up for continuing to try to make our shaving lives a bit better and easier, but this one for me is a no go. Maybe next time Gillette, but for now im sticking with my Mach 3 turbo.</li>
            <li> Here is my analysis and test results for the new Gillette &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor. Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #1,&amp;#34; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting. I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For &amp;#34;Field Test #2,&amp;#34; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel. I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck. I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave. Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product. It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel. With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat. After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous &amp;#34;Flexball&amp;#34; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose. The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face. That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all those divots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.) To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the &amp;#34;Enhanced Lubrastrip.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and &amp;#34;lubricating polymers.&amp;#34; Well, my skin appreciated those &amp;#34;polymers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris LawsonY: My shaving &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; passed with flying colors.

            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this razor and the shave was so smooth and easy…it left my face feeling smoother than any other previous razors I have used.  I think I have found my new razor and I love it.</li>
            <li> The shave from this new razor is really good. But is it worth it? I have used the Mach 3 razor for quite some time. Yes, I enjoy the discounts at Costco, so there may be some play in this review. But I can also say that I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;Shower shaver.&amp;#34; Meaning I shave in the shower and honestly I see only a marginal difference (for the better) when using this new 4 blade razor as opposed to the 3 blade Mach 3. In fact, when checking the next morning, the shave is really close (a close race).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all said, I DO very much like the heft of the ProGlide handle and ball. Whether it actually makes a difference with the ball and adapting to my face, I cannot be sure. But the handle itself is heavier and provides a more secure feel and &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; like a better shave! So take it for what it&#x27;s worth, and check your wallet as well.</li>
            <li> [As a note, I received the Flexball razor for free from Gillette as part of a promotion.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked forward to trying something new with the Gillette Flexball razor, but my first few shaves left me only frustrated as I seemed to lack the dexterity I was used to with disposable razors. Unlike its rigid companions, the Flexball razor seemed to take control out of my hands. Instead of the quick strokes in tough-to-reach areas of my face, I eventually learned to use even strokes over my entire face and chin and ended up with surprisingly good results. It may not have offered as close of a shave, but the Flexball aspect did make shaving an easier and more rote action. And even after two weeks - the normal lifespan of a disposable razor - the blades seemed just as sharp and I was razor-burn free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from disposable razors, I may have been a bit foolish to think the Flexball razor from Gillette would really be that different - press event or not, it&#x27;s hard to believe that Gillette could have &amp;#34;disrupted&amp;#34; the market by adding a few degrees of movement to their latest 5-blade razor. Still, the Flexball razor from Gillette provides a forgiving shave at a surprisingly frugal price.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology from Gillette to try. I must say that I was excited to test the new FlexBall technology. It is supposed to be preferred 2-to-1 compared to the former ProGlide. Having tried the previous ProGlide Fusion and now the FlexBall technology, I don’t really see the added benefit of the FlexBall. In both versions, I get a nice clean shave with little effort. I tend to shave in straight lines, so I didn’t really see how the FlexBall added to my shaving experience. Even when I tried to ‘use’ the FlexBall while shaving, I didn’t notice much difference. I still got a great close shave, so the ProGlide Fusion is still a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly enjoying the Gillette Fusion Proglide -- I received a complimentary trial version from Gillette.  A loyal Gillette user for years (I have historically used Gillette Fusion Power), this is the first new release that has impressed me enough to consider upgrading.  The flexball technology is innovative and definitely provides a closer, more precise shave.  It reminds me of a Dyson Rollerball Vacuum in its design.  I miss the trimmer side of the blade for easier cutting of sideburns.  I also wonder over time and in my travel bag if the flexball mechanics will break.  That said I think I&#x27;m willing to give it a try for awhile as it is providing a superior, longer lasting shave.</li>
            <li> this works as good as any other over priced fusion razor.. the flexball part is just a gimmick and worked no better or worse than the regular fusion. save your money and just go with the regular fusion..</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology to try out and loved it! It provided a close shave and did not irritate my skin.  It left it nice and smooth and really liked the FlexBall technology to get around the sides and creases.</li>
            <li> I received this razor as a promotion from Gillette to test out and share my opinion. Unfortunately, I saw little difference in shaving between this razor and the previous ProGlide manual razors, which I have tried out two previous ones. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it cuts the hairs smoothly, just that in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t do any better job than any of the other Fusion ProGlide or similar multi-blade razors in its class. If you have the previous multi-blade exchange cartridge razor, I don&#x27;t see the need to rush out and grab this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the razor to my father-in-law to try out also. When I asked him how it worked out for him, he told me the same thing, except he uses the cheap disposable single blade razors. He said he will be sticking with those since he didn&#x27;t see much, if any, improvement for him in shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I&#x27;ll be sticking with my electric razor and older ProGlide for closer shaving if needed.</li>
            <li> Waited about 2 weeks to write this review, as i wanted to really get a feel for it before reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much enjoyed shaving with this new razor. The flexball feature definitely adjusts to the natural contours of my face, certainly makes shaving over my cheekbones and neck much easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve found this have much closer and has greatly reduced razor burn and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short it has definitely enhanced my overall shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the handle -- good rubber grip, little thicker handle. Feels good in my hand and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me a free sample and I have to say this is a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sick for close to 2 weeks and personal grooming was the last thing on my mind.  When I started feeling better, I had quite a bit of shag growing.  This razor cut through it like butter and I only had 1 nick in a tight spot under my lip.  I have been using this one blade daily for over two weeks now after the initial mow down and it is still sharp as ever.  Other multi-blade products I have used tend to get clogged up with hair between the blades after just a few uses, but this razor is still clog free.  One morning I over slept and was in a hurry and even dry shaved with this razor and had absolutely no issues - no cuts, pulls or razor burns.  Quite impressive.  I do maintain a van dyke beard, so I probably have not used this razor to 100% of it&#x27;s potential, but there is an extra feature I was really impressed with.  On top of the regular multi-blade shaving surface, there&#x27;s an additional single blade on the edge.  This single blade come in very handy for neatly edging the beard.  This alone puts this razon in a special class in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure what the hype is about the flex ball.  I can&#x27;t say it helps improve my shaving experience over other handle types, but YMMV.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating is price.  The refill blades are a substantial step up in price from the average Mach 3 blades - costing about 2/3 more even in the larger multipacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: no clog blades, edging blade, solid feel in hand, virutally no nicks - even when dry shaving&lt;br /&gt;Cons: premium price</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first razor that has made shaving my head a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;I get less cuts on my head.&lt;br /&gt;I have to take fewer swipes and I am missing less hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I would have bought this razor myself had it not been the a trial from Gillette but I am now a big fan of the Fushion Proglide with the Flexball.  I might even go buy the handle power handle.</li>
            <li> I usually use an electric razor from Norelco but I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide as a sample from Gillette to try. The amazing blade system is the star of this razor which is what should be the focus of a razor.  I was concerned that this razor would take longer for me to shave than my electric but I was wrong.  The flex ball makes the blade glide over your skin for an extremely close shave all in one motion.  It left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I received a free Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor from Bzzagent.com. I was really surprised by how much smoother the shave was than my old razor. I can honestly say that I can&#x27;t recall ever having a better smoother shave. I will definitely be a Gillette Fusion Proglide user from now on.</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide razor with the Flexball from Gillette to try out.  I usually use the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo, so that is what I am basing my review on.  I shave in the shower with a hand held mirror, so I don&#x27;t pull on my skin to tighten it when I am shaving, it is all about the razor.  I go over every area multiple times, so I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in the smoothness of the shave from my regular razor.  (5 vs. 3 blades)  The handle was maybe a little bit easier to hold onto, but not much difference.  As for the Flexball Handle Technology, to me it seems more like a gimmick.  The blades still stay in a straight line, so the Flexball does nothing that I can&#x27;t do myself by moving my wrist to follow the contours of my face.  I guess if I was shaving with a broken wrist it might be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good razor.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the extra cost of the blades.  I will need to use it more and see if the blade life is any greater than that of my 3 blade razor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this razor. Thanks to Gillette I got a free Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology to try out.  I usually get my razors from the dollar store.  To me a razor is a razor.  I didn&#x27;t need to spend money on any of those fancy razors.  Well I was pleasantly surprised to use this razor.  It had 5 blades which made shaving take half the time.  The Lubrastrip helped the razor glide right across my face without any pulling or tugging.  The flexiness of the handle made getting the tricky spot on and around my chin not so tricky after all.  I found the cost of the replacement razors very expensive. So because of the costly refills I could only give 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary from BzzAgent for free  and I thought most Gillette razors were the same BUT the Gillette Fusion Proglide has proven me wrong. The Flexball Handle technology lets you get the closest shave ever it is the best razor you can get out there for the price which speaking of price its not that much at all</li>
            <li> I received a fusion proglide in the mail the other day and as soon as I started my morning shave all I can saw is wow. I was excited by the commercials and even more when I showed up at my door; I was dumbstruck by how smoothly and efficiently the razor worked. My face isnt as curvy or as trechoress  as a race course but this razor did one hell of a job. Once again I have been impressed by Gillette and will keep this as my razor till the come up with something even better. Anyone need a Mach 3?!</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite razors! Love the precision and the close shave! It glides with the movement of your face which makes shaving a breeze!</li>
            <li> Just got this razor from gillette and let me tell you it works great very smooth,  will recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I received my Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle Technology from Gillette to try. I was a bit skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think it would be that much different from the Gillette razor that I regularly use. I did however notice that I got a much closer shave because it was able to form to my face better as I was shaving. While it didn&#x27;t flex as much as it did on the commercials, I was able to tell the difference.My face feels great and  I will definitely be using this razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Brandon</li>
            <li> I found that the flexball allowed the razor to glide around and over my chin and jaw line nicely and clean better than the previous razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Gillette sent me their new razor free for review.  It seems to make sense that the more ways the razor can flex and pivot, the better it will follow the contours of your face.  I wanted to try the new flex ball technology and see if it really lived up to the claims made.  I have to say that compared to my old razor, I got a closer smoother shave.  I also noticed fewer nicks and cuts.  I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars because I thought it got dull faster than it should have.  Keep in mind we are talking about a sample size of only one, but after about a week, it wasn&#x27;t shaving quite as well.</li>
            <li> Great razor, and very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It seems that razor manufacturers are constantly looking for new gimmicks to sell their product.  That said, this razor does a fine job giving me a close and comfortable shave.  I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;flexball technology&amp;#34;, but the fact that the blades move on two axes (up and down, side to side) really does allow the razor to navigate the contours of your face effortlessly. It would have been nice if Gillette had included a bonus blade, but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Gillette gave me the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall technology for free to enjoy, and after using it for more than a month, I am still impressed. I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion ProGlide Manual Razor variants for some time now, and the Flexball handle technology helps with shaving down and under the chin, especially when the hair on my face/neck grows diagonally not straight down. With just a bit of pivoting, the FlexBall can maneuver the blade just enough to comfortably shave my chin and neck with one or two passes. The occasional patch of razor burn has become increasingly more infrequent with prolonged use of the Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall technology.</li>
            <li> I received one of these razors to try from Gillette. I was skeptical that this would provide a good shave, as I tend to prefer an electric razor. I have sensitive skin, and usually turn red after a bad shave. I even have to be choosey about an electric, or the same thing happens. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this razor cut my beard without pulling. Five blades help do the trick I guess. I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to go over my face as often because the flexball really does follow the contours of your face. The Lubrastrip on the cartridge helps it glide right along, which seemed to help keep away the razor burn. Compared to other cartridge razors and disposable razors of different brands, this one comes out ahead.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor 3 times so far. I get the same close shave every time! Do these blades ever dull? My wife absolutely loves how soft my face is after using this razor from heaven! Gillette, you really did a great job with razor and it only seems to get better with each one that comes out! Keep up the amazing work!! Thanks for this awesome razor Gillette, I will never use any other brand besides Gillette!</li>
            <li> This is at first, a frightening little implement.  It&#x27;s noticeably heavier than any other &#x27;swap-a-cartridge&#x27; razors I&#x27;ve held, so it feels substantial when you first pick it up.  I gave it a once-over before lathering up, and was surprised to see 5 blades in tandem on the one side, and then a single blade facing the opposite way (for squaring sideburns and touch-ups around margins, I presume).  Anyway, that sixth blade was a good one to see ahead of time, since flipping the razor over is usually how I smooth my sideburns before squaring...in other words, I almost lopped off my sideburns by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that out of the way, I smoothed the &#x27;burns with a finger, and went to work.  This thing is legit, and that&#x27;s just the whole story.  One pass, and you&#x27;re done.  No reason to get in a hurry, no reason to press hard, no reason to do anything but use this thing to clear shaving cream off your face.  The whiskers will be gone too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flex head won&#x27;t let you press hard, so the upper lip was a little hard to get used to, but that was the only part that was a challenge.  I presume that practice will make perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not the cheapest razor, so the radio host/cheapskate Clark Howard won&#x27;t be signing up for this one.  He once used a $0.17 disposable for 1-year by sharpening, etc ...  I don&#x27;t have time for all that - not to save $20, and risk razor burn.  I believe in being frugal, but the misery of razor burn, coupled with the added frustration of a new hobby, makes me think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOILERPLATE:  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  I DEFINITELY think you&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s a darn smooth shave in just one pass.  The single blade on the back is a great idea for what I see as the only multi-blade system weakness ... you never know \\&quot;where the line is\\&quot; for trimming sideburns and maybe a touch-up in front of ears.  This thing mimics how barbers did it for years...just use with care (since it IS A RAZOR after all), and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.be pleased.</li>
            <li> I received this razor complimentary from BzzAgent and while I thought most razors are the same the Gillette Fusion Proglide has proven me wrong. The Flexball Handle technology lets you get the closest shave and allows easy flexibility to shave from side to side. My Wife was very happy with this smooth, close shave!</li>
            <li> I tend to prefer razors marketed to and made for men over women because I find they are usually more solidly built and feel better in my hand. It seems to me a lot of the razors for women invariably end up being too much plastic and too much &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;. I like a less wide head that is more compact and a razor that has substantial feel in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meets those requirements. It shaves just fine. I noticed no issues going around knees, under arms, and certain other spots (which will remain unmentioned in light of not providing TMI). The shave is close, it does not nick easy (though it is wicked sharp) and it rinses simply and doesn&#x27;t get hair clogged up into the blades. It has no &amp;#34;scraping&amp;#34; feel (that can happen with some razors) so whatever lubrication they are using works well without making it slimy and slippery. It handled all the curves pretty well - but not really any different than most other mens razors I&#x27;ve used. I will say (it got an extra star for this) that it was easier to maneuver in places like behind and around the knee - and (for once) I didn&#x27;t miss any strips that had to be touched up later. I did not notice any difference in stubble -still had it the next day like clockwork but overall this is a solid tool that will do you well. I did not notice (yet) any difference in the battery powered one vs. the non so I will update after a month or two if I see a difference. At this point I&#x27;d go with the cheaper one as I could not really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t mince words here - the blade is the star of this product.  They can trumpet the ball, the cool new look, the breakthrough technology of running across your face, but it all boils down to the blades doing the cutting of the hair.  The blades are amazing - smooth and cut close.  And for that - I am a happy user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to sample one of these for free from Gillette.  I really am a fan of the results of my shave.  So I suppose Gillette will be happy to hear that.  But ball does not really make a huge difference.  I don&#x27;t notice that the razor glides any better because of this ball, but I do love the closeness and smooth cut the blades provide.  So - yes, if the price is not too great against the competition..I give it a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This razor was provided to me by Gillette to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with the razor was that it seemed pretty much the same as my older, regular ProGlide. I wasn&#x27;t sure that the FlexBall really made any difference...or I&#x27;m just too light handed when shaving. Not that it was a bad shave, just didn&#x27;t seem much better than my old handle. After using it a couple more times though the FlexBall really is starting to shine. The shave is very smooth and effortless around the different contours of my face. Maybe there was a &#x27;break-in&#x27; period to loosen up the flexball, or maybe it was just me, but I love it now. I use both manual and an electric razor and recently I found myself going to my electric more. However since receiving this new handle I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively and have put my electric razor away at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, and I&#x27;m not sure anyone cares, the packaging is great. No trying to saw through the plastic sealed packages that I&#x27;m used to. A super easy to open tab that allows the razor to freely be removed from the package. Plus it uses less plastic than I typically see with products like this.</li>
            <li> My husband related that this razor shaves his facial hair perfectly. It provides a close cut shave.  My husband reports that the handle is easy to use while shaving. He highly recommends this razor because it provides a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I thought the flexball was just a marketing ploy, but wow does it do a great job to allow me to reach all those contours of my face!  Thanks to Gillette for sending me a razor to try.  Very happy with this product and will continue to purchase cartridges for it!</li>
            <li> Well, this is a decent cart razor,no doubt. But, it&#x27;s no safety razor (DE). Tried this razor as I got a sample. Had used cartridge razors for years, then went back to traditional wet shaving with double edge safety razors. This razor has a good, close shave, but it&#x27;s cost prohibitive. Upfront cost for DE shaving is where the cost is, but you can buy 100 blades for less than 4 of these cartridges, and you put less plastic in our landfills so you can claim you&#x27;re living green. :-) Once you try wet shaving with a single, double, or straight razor, you&#x27;ll never go back to cartridge shaving, no matter what the new technology comes up with, as I found after giving this razor a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s a good razor and provides a close shave. It has its niche market, but for me personally, these cart blades are cost prohibitive, and companies like Gillette are raking in the money for these overpriced, overrated cartridge razors. I like the traditional DE shave much, MUCH better. 2 stars is for the razor, as it does its job.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I am one of those guys that thinks \\&quot;more is better\\&quot; when it comes to razor blades.  I probably am being influenced by advertising and my own naivety, but if they made a razor with 20 blades I would be the first in line to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this razor to be the smoothest cutting, longest lasting blade that I have ever used.  Since I have a light beard (and don&#x27;t shave my upper lip) I have used the same blade for a month and it is still working great.  The lubrication part wore off in 2 weeks but I am okay with that.  The Flexball technology seems to work for me, especially around the chin area which is where I usually cut myself. I will be buying more blades for this one in the future (once I have saved up for them, that is.)  :-)</li>
            <li> Tried the Gillette Fusion with Flexball from a sample from Gillette and it works great.I really did not feel the flexball working but it you watch the head while shaving around jaw line or chin you can actually see the head of the razor shifting without having to pick up and move or arrange your hand in a weird way to get those angles.&lt;br /&gt; Most guys I know shave there neck and face separate stopping at the jaw line. with the Flexball head there is no reason to stop at the jawline the flexball head enables the transition from face to neck without a problem while keeping a constant pressure on My face so not to miss anything.&lt;br /&gt; Now from how close of a shave it is &amp;#34;Really Close&amp;#34; usually I have to make a second pass on some areas that grow thicker but the razor left it very smooth with only a single pass. The razor handle itself feels very sturdy and quality was not overlooked and almost has a perfect balance. Another thing that others might overlook are the nonslip grips on the handle these are great while shaving do to lotion in shaving creams helping keep a tight grip</li>
            <li> I tried this razor after receiving it as a sample from Gillette. I didn&#x27;t think I needed a new razor as I really liked my previous one, but I sure was wrong! The way this razor contours, I can easily shave all my hairs without risk of razor burn or cutting myself. I will definitely be buying this product next time I need a new razor.</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide razor from Gilette for free to try and review.  Overall, the razor feels very well made.  The blades made for a quick, smooth shave.  The flexible, or swivel, head is how Gilette is differentiating this razor from others.  Although it does slightly swivel, it felt like more of a gimmick to me than a must-have.  I can&#x27;t say that I would pay more for the swivel head.  Also, the sideburn trimmer is pretty much worthless - use the normal blades.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology.  It gave me an incredibly close shave with zero irritation.  I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot time and time again because one stroke was enough for the Fusion ProGlide Razor.  I enjoyed using it until it mysteriously made its way from the sink into the shower after a week.  My wife is unapologetic about her thievery and says it is the best razor she has ever used and loves how it hugs her curves without getting rough with her delicate skin.  It seems like I am going to have to buy my own soon!</li>
            <li> The cost of refill cartridges is OUTRAGEOUS!  $4+ for one cartridge?  No thanks!  Go with a double edged razor and pay just 10¢ a blade if you know where to buy.  Don&#x27;t want to go the safety razor route?  Look for a Dorco system with $1 cartridges.</li>
            <li> First off, I have a very heavy stubble and I am never able to get a truly close shave unless I go to the barber,  I also normally have to make multiple passes with a disposable razor which naturally causes more irritation.  I also have very sensitive skin.  This is absolutely the BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever used at home.  My shave was exceptionally smooth.  In fact, the first time I used it, I gave myself razor burn from using my typical multiple rapid strokes over the same areas of my face that I was used to doing with other razors.  DO NOT do that with this razor.  One (maybe 2 in really tough spots) pass with this thing does the trick.  I also sometimes keep a goatee and I used the single blade on the top of the head to shape around this area.  This also takes some getting used to as you are basically using a single straight razor and have to be very careful.  It just gives a remarkably close shave and does cut down on skin irritation because you have to use less strokes.  I received this a free promo but I will be buying it in the future, without question. Outstanding.</li>
            <li> I received this from Gillete for review.  It mostly worked out well for my face.  I thought it would be smoother than it ended up being, but it still worked out great. I am more than likely to purchase these to give them another shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette Mach 3 user for 15+ years.... Old Trusty, if you will.  As such, I was skeptical when my Gillette Fusion Proglide arrived.  I must admit that the first few shaves with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Razor with Flexball Handle have been amazingly comfortable and quite close.  The razor moves with your face, which is certainly something that my Mach 3 doesn&#x27;t do.  Even my wife commented on how my face looked and felt smoother. I&#x27;m going to give it another few weeks before I make a long term commitment to it, but at that point its quite possible that Old Trusty will just become Old.</li>
            <li> SHWWWWOOOPPP!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the sound of this razor making an awesomely close and comfortable swipe of now bareskin across my face! No irritation at all. The flexball really does keep the blade close to the skin avoid cuts and ensuring a clean and comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - many of these reviewers are clearly sissy-men with weak beards and the hair growth of a 12 year old girl. In comparission, I am on par with the hair growth of a male Amazonian Gorilla! With a truly awe-inspiring beard, I use a razor to clean up my neck and ensure straight and clean lines down my cheek. This razor did a fantastic job! In one swipe I went from 4-5 days of growth to clean skin. The ability for this razor to end the careers of many upward seeking hairs would make Donald Trump jealous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor free-of-charge as part of a promotion from Gillette. I was skeptical but hey, why not try a free razor? I am a fan and will be using this razor going forward!</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion Proglide with Flexball from Gillette to review and used it numerous times. The blades are good for a nice close shave.  I have used Fusion Proglide without the Flexball in the past but prefer the Mach 3 Turbo because the blades are spaced farther apart and therefore, make cleaning easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexball didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  I purposefully watched to see if it moved and it never did.  I generally shave in straight lines so I intentionally tried to make the Flexball move by making &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; moves with the razor and going around my jaw, still no movement.  The 3 star rating is because while the razor itself is good, I think the Flexball is a little gimmicky.</li>
            <li> A very close and comfortable shave, probably the closest shave I have had in a long time. I would recommend this razor to anyone who wants a great experience while shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been impressed by manual shaving razors but this new Fusion Proglide blew me away. Actually, I&#x27;ve been using the old Fusion Proglide for about a year and liked it better than several others that I&#x27;ve tried.  Because that razor was so much better than all the others I&#x27;ve used, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that a new version of the Proglide could be that much better.  All I can say is you gotta try this product. When looking at yourself in the mirror, seeing will be believing.</li>
            <li> I received a Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette as a marketing test product, and I&#x27;m very impressed.  The shave was extremely close and effortless.  And best of all, the blades didn&#x27;t gunk up the way most multi-bladed razors do.  I&#x27;m sold...</li>
            <li> I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette in the mail. I find it weird more than useful how many new razor models come out and find most of them gimmicky. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much more out of this one.  Yes it has a million blades and they are of typical Gillette good quality.  But this Proglide, for once, I am actually impressed with one of these new handles.  I shave about 3x a week so it&#x27;s often a chore when I do, but this moving razor actually made it easier and quicker.  Many fewer repeat strokes to get the odd missed hair around chin and jaw line without any razor burn or nicks to my skin.  Very impressed.  I&#x27;ll be keeping this handle and reusing w/the razor refills.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion free from Gillette to review a few weeks ago and let me just say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to have a bad shave. The movement of the blade is subtle but effective, no nicks, cuts or razor burn. Just a nice clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I received a free gillette fusion proglide and I think its amazing compared to others I&#x27;ve tried. A big thumbs up</li>
            <li> Let me start off by stating I have a thick, coarse beard. I have, in the past, made lesser razors cried. To achieve a particularly smooth shave, my straight edge needs to be sharp enough to shave granite. I once dropped my straight razor and the sheer edge of it caused it to go through the floor tile, concrete, clay, mantle, and subsequent molten core of this earth like butter. The thing could cut Superman. I will never retrieve that razor. But that is not the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device was shipped to me from the manufacturer for demo purposes. They&#x27;ve heard of my beard and subtly stated: &amp;#34;Challenge Accepted&amp;#34;. They&#x27;ve designed a head that keeps tension uniform across the blade surface. One would think this is just another gimmick to sell a lesser shave device... That is not true. This is a fantastic feat of engineering. Coming from someone who could polish diamonds with his stubble, this concept helps reduce the amount of time the razor is not on your skin, preventing nicks, drag, and pulls. In my case, this contact helps prevent me from dulling the blade in one shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. Hyperbole aside, I&#x27;ve done that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this razor does not do is reduce the amount of strokes required to fully shave my face. That is quite fine, actually, because this blade has given me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a multi-blade system. I am pleasantly pleased at how close this head can get. Though I still prefer the older three blade Mach 3 system from Gillette, as the blades were further apart. The fusion heads are still too close together for thicker, coarser beards. It does cause some drag and irritation, but I am going to assume I&#x27;m the exception to the rule in this case scenario. Not everyone grows bamboo shoots from their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide is well designed, well built, and well balanced. This could definitely everyone&#x27;s default razor. I&#x27;m just hoping Gillette will eventually spread their sharp blades a little further apart for us blessed denser beards.</li>
            <li> Got this razor to replace my beloed Fusion ProGlide Power. Used it for a week. It&#x27;s OK, but I still prefer my old razor. The new swivel feature wasn&#x27;t as impessive as I had hoped. Maybe I should try the power version and see if I like it bettter</li>
            <li> I received this Gillete Fusion ProGlide manual razor from Gillete, It&#x27;s getting better and better, I love how flexibly  and a how perfectly it moves. The new grip is amazing, and I Love it.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion Proglide  Flexball razor in the mail from Gillette and wow, it really was a fantastic shave. I can tell you that this razor is worth changing out from the original Fusion Proglide! It really does provide a very smooth shave, remaining in constant contact with the skin over subtle curves and provides a great shave. I have sensitive skin as well and did not have any problems with cuts or razor burn afterwards. I would highly recommend trying this product at least once so you can see for yourself!</li>
            <li> Received this razor from Gillette to try. This is by far the best razor I have ever owned. I have tried manual, vibrating, and Mach3 razors and this razor was awesome in comparison to the other razors. The flexball handle was easy to hold and use. I get less nicks and cuts or none at all because of the smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me by gillette. It was for testing and let me say Shaving with this product is great. No more bumps. It flexes so that you never have a rough shave again</li>
            <li> Received the product free from Gillette as a promotional offer. Heavy duty and solid razor, good grip, swivel action not much of use for me but am sure over time I would get use to it (my wife said the swivel was good for shaving legs, so I guess this is good for women too). The blade was super sharp the first few uses but I thought dulled a bit faster than expected. I would definitely buy this product and give it another try.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I vpbeen using this for a really long time. I love how smooth it goes with everything</li>
            <li> It works really well, but had some irritation on my neck. But it gave a really smooth shave! #bzzagent #gotitfree</li>
            <li> worked great for me and my wife, we both used the same cartridge for almost 3 week, me daily and her every other day and on the 3rd week it probably would have still been great but my wife left it in the tub an the strips melted off from setting in water overnight.</li>
            <li> I received a trial from Gillette and have been using the product for a few weeks. Overall I think its a great razor. Very clean shave and sharp blades that minimize pulling. A good shaving experience for sure. I feel like the rotating head sounds like a good feature, when in reality it seems to be more of a gimmick than an actuality. I expected the motion that was shown in the commercials, but found that it was quite limited to just either moving left or right. With that being said, it did its job, and did it well. A high quality razor that has held up and still feels as good now as when I first started using it weeks back, and I have not replaced the blade even! I also very much like the single blade on the reverse side for trimming purposes, it does help reach places that I otherwise couldn&#x27;t with my harrys razor. All in a ll, a very good razor that leaves me feeling clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I received one of these razors from Gillette as a promotion and have to say, it does work great. I usually use a Mach 3, but I found this one held to the contour of my face better and the blade lasted one shave longer than Mach 3. The price is a but more, but I do feel it gave a superior performance.</li>
            <li> I received this razor from the brand for FREE!! and i have to say this one of the best razors i&#x27;ve ever used! I tried just about every brand out there but this razor is awsome very easy to used and great results. I seriously thought how much different can this be WOW! This is the closest shave possible you can get from this razor.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Gillette for letting me test out this razor. This is a solid razor!! I love how it gives me a close shave. It does not irritate my skin. I enjoy the flexball and it can reach all the hard to reach places normal blades can miss. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products since 1994, and I can say they continue to improve and provide me with a great shave. I&#x27;ve had a full beard since 2009 and this razor by far gives the easiest mobility to shave my cheeks and neck with out worrying if I accidentally took a swipe out of my beard. I have not nicked or cut myself once since I upgraded.  Truly a great Razor.</li>
            <li> This is an overpriced ,over designed item. It does not last longer than any other blade. It is not worth the price. What ever happened to the old blue blade/</li>
            <li> its a real nice razor</li>
            <li> I love the Fusion blade technology this razor features.  It give a really close shave, and the handle is comfortable and easy to navigate.  A great razor!</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first that this razor would really be worth the extra price. I mean, my face isn&#x27;t that jagged or rugged that the head needs to rotate that much. I received a free Fusion Proglide from Gillette in the mail, so of course I used it. My shave this morning was incredibly smooth. They razor wasn&#x27;t rotating to the extreme they show in the commercials, but it was able to hit those subtle curves so nicely. As someone who never looks forward to my morning shave, I am actually excited to bust this out again tomorrow morning. I generally have thought that there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference between the easy disposable razors and the high-end ones, but this razor changed my mind.</li>
            <li> By far, the Fusion cartridge razors are probably some of the best. The problem is that for too long they have really just moderately changed the cartridges and considered it a major upgrade. So that is why I really took interest in the new FlexBall handle when I read about it. So when I saw a free trial of this razor from Gillette, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think everyone has used a Fusion cartridge by now. It&#x27;s real nice and does a great job getting close. I&#x27;ve used them on various handles and it really all seemed the same. This isn&#x27;t the case with the FlexBall. One of the nice things about cartridge razors is they allow the blades to go up and down to keep contact with the face. The FlexBall also goes side to side. This allows the cartridge to stay in contact with the face better. This allows for an effortless close shave. Like most guys, I have problems with certain parts of my neck. With a couple of passes, those trouble areas are smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been. And the shave took probably half the time as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself is well built. It&#x27;s mostly metal, which gives it a good heft, but it&#x27;s not heavy. It have a very nice rubber padding to give it a good grip. The only, extremely minor, problem I had with it was trying out switching blades. Because the FlexBall end allows the head of the razor to rock side to side, the new cartridge may not line up and click in as easily as other handles in the Fusion line. But again it&#x27;s extremely minor and with no real effort you can re-position and get it to click right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I switched to using a vintage Gillette Ball End Tech safety razor. I probably won&#x27;t be switching from that, mainly for cost reasons. I do keep some Fusion cartridges and a handle around in case I don&#x27;t have the time to use my vintage razor, which is more fun. I&#x27;ll be tossing out the old Fusion handle in favor of the FlexBall and will probably end up using it more. Especially for special occasions where I want tobe really smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mach III blades for years.  I will only be using Fusion Blades from now on.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men&#x27;s Razor With Flexball is an extraordinarily smooth razor.  This is the smoothest razor I have ever used, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball head rotates perfectly and smoothly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a bit on the heavy size, but that is actually a benefit as it seems to impart a little more control.  It makes it only a little less desirable as a travel razor if you are trying to save weight.  I imagine that Gillete will make lighter, disposable versions using the Fusion blade which can serve that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend without reservation.</li>
            <li> All I need in a razor is a clean, comfortable shave. I&#x27;m not much for the latest gadgets, bells and whistles, and other so-called improvements that more often as not are changes for the sake of increased sales and offer no improvement in the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll admit this razor really does seem to live up to the hype, at least for me. It gives a very close shave and the flexball handle technology works great. I&#x27;ve yet to nick or cut myself after using the razor about ten times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only quibble I have is that for my arthritic hand the razor is just a little uncomfortable to hold. It feels somewhat out of balance to me. I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars because of that, but that&#x27;s not an option so I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars. The shave it gives is great.</li>
            <li> My husband has been going through a new appreciation go the shaving ritual. He has been researching for all types of products. He has settled on an English lather with a brush, so he is quite into the process. When this razor showed up it was good timing for a true test. It was fine, but no big shakes for him. It really acted like a disposable but with a higher price tag. He is still looking.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor that provides a close shave and cuts down on irritability.  I shave in less time with the FlexBall technology however I think it would provide an even better shave if it had a battery and vibrated.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me.  Good for two to three uses, with good, clean shaves.  After three uses, it gets grabby.  Overall, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best razor known to men and women! Proglide is amazing and should not be seen as just a mans product. Please try it!</li>
            <li> Close, comfortable and clean shave with this bad boy. Nice ergonomic design and glad I bought two for I know my wife will &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; one. Great price for a nice shaver. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for and found it at Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> The title to this review completely sums up my opinion of the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor. I have what you may consider moderately thick facial hair. I used to use a two blade razor, but always had discomfort with shaving, regardless of the shave cream or gel I used. Then I received a free trial of the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power razor with the vibrating handle. After getting used to the handle, I really enjoyed that razor, but the blades seemed to wear out fairly quickly considering the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I received a free trial of the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor. I am very impressed with the comfort and close shave of this razor, even shaving every-other-day! I can&#x27;t say that the Flexball Handle makes a difference to me since I do maintain some facial hair (I do not shave my jawline.)  The blades are wonderful, which I already knew. What I found interesting is that they seem to last longer on the Flexball razor than the Power razor. Maybe the vibrating from the handle on the Power razor dulls the blades faster? Regardless, I love the feel of the blades, and the handle is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment is that he blades are very expensive. A 12-pack costs a whopping $40, $3.33 a piece! Yikes! Despite the fact that the blades seem to last longer on the Flexball razor than the Power razor, I still use at least two per month. Quite expensive for the year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball Handle razor for comfort and close shave, but not for cost.</li>
            <li> my wife said this razor gave her a good shave. she said the flexball was nice, but wouldn&#x27;t go out of her way in the future to use it again.</li>
            <li> What an amazing shaver. This gave me the closest and most comfortable shaving experience ever. My wife told me that I look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I was given a new gillette proglide flexball as part of the flexball promotion. I was previously using the proglide battery operated razor&lt;br /&gt;and was disappointed that the flexball didn&#x27;t give me any better a shave. I guess it&#x27;s difficult to improve on perfection because both gave me an excellent, smooth shave and I will stick to my vibrating blades.</li>
            <li> This is a solid razor, silky smooth as it glides around your face neck. Almost feels like a Dyson vacuum for your face the way the ball rotates. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this razor free through BzzAgent and I must say that I am completely impressed with it! It easy to handle and gives a very close shave along. I also like how the hairs dont stay caught in between the blades which also provides to a smooth shave! This will be my go to razor from here on out!</li>
            <li> I just received my new Gillette Fusion Pro-glide razor.  To start, my eight year old son wanted to help me open the box as that the packing makes it look like a razor made for superheroes (that&#x27;s me) - impressive package and design.  The razor itself is kinda like that Dyson vacuum with the ball joint that can hug corners like Mario Andretti except for your face and it gets much better gas mileage.  If you like the Gillette predecessors like me you are sure to dig this one as well.</li>
            <li> I received one of these through BzzAgent to try, and I was impressed. I have been using a Gilette Sensor 2 for years now, and the flexibility of the pivoting heasd is best likened to a paint brush. Shaving off the stubble is like applying paint, and the results are very smooth. I can&#x27;t say that I noticed the benefits of the pivot ball, but I really liked the shave. The one aspect that&#x27;s somewhat lacking is the detail blade on the top. I found it tricky to get under the nose and square up my sideburns, but overall I&#x27;m sold and plan to switch.</li>
            <li> The swivel head glides easily and forms to my face for a nice clean shave! I have used it multiple times now and the blades are still as sharp as new, I highly recommend this razor its innovative and worth the money! I will be picking up more of these for sure!</li>
            <li> Always used a single blade or at most a double blade. Didn&#x27;t want to go up to a 5 blade. BUT I must say, this gives an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Gillette Fusion ProGlide 2-in-1 Shave Gel + Skin Care in combination with a Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor with FlexBall Technology that I got for free from BzzAgent.  I will never go back to any other brand! I have to shave everyday, and my skin is dry and somewhat sensitive, so I use to get little itchy bumps with other gels, but not at all with this one.</li>
            <li> Really gets the job done for the first 5 shaves. After that effectiveness drops off noticeably. Smooth, very hard to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> I got this razor a few weeks ago im am very happy with the results you get the closest shave ever truely amazing everyone should give it a try</li>
            <li> I received the product Fusion Proglide razor from the brand gilette to try..It gave a very close shave w/ no razor burn/bumps. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this razor to try from Bzz Agent and I absolutely love it! I have always used Gillette Razors but this one is by far my favorite. I have somewhat sensitive skin and shave at least 3 times a week. This razor gives me a smooth clean cut shave and my wife loves how soft my face is afterward. I will continue to use this as my go to razor in the future! Thanks Bzz Agent and Gillette Fusion Proglide!</li>
            <li> I received the Fusion ProGlide from Gillette to try out. I&#x27;m normally an electric razor user, but I figured I would give this a shot. It&#x27;s a great razor that gave a very close, comfortable shave. I love the way it pivots around the contours of my face. Definitely worth a try if you are in the market for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I got the Gillette Fusion Proglide from Gillette and my husband&#x27;s face is wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently received this razor free from Gillette in order to try out and review.  The Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall handle technology was something I was truly excited to have the opportunity to use, the name and technology behind the razor sounded great.  After using the razor for several weeks, I found that a description / product name can sound better than it actually is.  The Proglide aspect of the razor was not as effective as other brands that I have used and I found that I was having to reapplying shaving gel after the first pass.  If I did not apply a second layer of gel, the razor what actually cutting my face.  Also, the FlexBall handle did not seem to move smoothly across my face and I had difficulty using it especially when going from a side to side motion.  I would like to mention that my facial hair is very coarse and this might have been one of the reasons that I did not have a better experience than others.  Overall, Gillette is a great brand that I enjoying using, but this razor in particular is not right for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> big fan f fusion --works on skin of color no more bumps</li>
            <li> A great shave.  However, my Trac 2 did a great job, as have all the Gillette shavers I have used over 50 years now.  I go back all the way to blue blades, and Gillette is my choice of manual shavers.  Is the ball gizmo necessary?  Not for me, but times change.  Nowadays I use my trusty Norelco electric shavers.  No muss, no fuss and very close to a blade shave.  Next year, maybe there will be a real neutron beam atomic phaser shaver!  I will try it!</li>
            <li> shape and cheap,good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gillette,  top brand and expensive shaving but decent price add on to avoid cost of shipping.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. I think this product is better than some other automatic razors in consideration of price, quality and function. Good product!</li>
