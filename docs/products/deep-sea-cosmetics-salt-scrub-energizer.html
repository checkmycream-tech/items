            <li>but I loved it once I got it home and started using it.  </li>

            <li>Very satisfied.</li>

            <li>and it smells so good and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it is absolutely the best body scrub</li>
            <li>She said she really liked the product and it had a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>awesome beautiful scent, makes my skin feel so refreshed and super soft after use.</li>
            <li>With so many things ordered online these days, the company should be able to figure out how to package this product so the customer receives 100% of it --- in the jar!</li>
            <li>My skin has not felt this good in years, lucky I am on vacation!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not to strong at all, and she loves the way her skin feels after using the product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the original formula was.</li>
            <li>I started using DSC body scrub, body butter, and hand/body lotion over a year ago and just love the line.</li>
            <li>I love the scrub - be sure to step away from the water massage in, let it stay on your skin for a while....</li>
            <li>And then massage in some more before washing off.</li>
            <li>For oily skin, the salts work great, but there is so much additional oil, that it would leave you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It has also help keep my skin hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this body scrub...</li>
            <li>It works for every skin type, but even better for ppl with the driest skin.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this on amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with it, as well as the body butter.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Buy from amazon or another reputable seller.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would love it in a hand cream.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and what it has done for my life and confidence.</li>
            <li>I had used this product before and love it ..</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Helped me with my acne scars, has a great scent, very oily though, you have to get used to that.</li>
            <li>and smooth!</li>
            <li>The orginal is much better</li>
            <li>Though the seal on the jar was intact when I received it, most of the oil had leaked into the shipping bag.</li>
            <li>Product is very easy to use in the shower and hydrates my skin to a comfortable feel and healthy look.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for removing dry itchy skin and adds to the smoothness of lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin really feels good after using it..and the smell I really Love...</li>
            <li>Normally sells for 85-55$  Great deal and worth every dollar!</li>
            <li>Works great as a moisturizer leaving skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My elbows and feet are \\&quot;smooth as buttah\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>i was recently in a mall in orlando florida when i was approached by a guy selling this  body scrub...and while the product smells great  </li>
            <li>The skin softly became smooth &amp; well as for the smell and it was good.   </li>
            <li>very fun experience.</li>
            <li>The product works great as an exfoliant and definitely is a must-have for anyone that wants to experience softer, more radiant skin</li>
            <li>It liked it very much though scrub that the aroma oil entered was used for the first time.   </li>
            <li>Luckily it didn&#x27;t get on any important mail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product but can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s perfect, only because the oils used seem to be abundant, to the point where it seems we&#x27;re getting just as much oil as dead sea salt, and they are very strong, almost to the point of feeling greasy, so you&#x27;re left as to wonder if this product is more for dryer skin or for oily skin, or normal.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>and it was just a fresh clean smell</li>
            <li>It was good for me with dry skin.   </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed being accosted at the mall by people selling these products because my hands come away feeling so soft, and the aroma is just divine!  </li>
            <li>Feels a little greasy in shower, but great after shower.</li>
            <li>, Green Tea isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>but I think its worth every cent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I opened it right away and used it, when I got to work</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Scrub is absolutely amazing!  </li>
            <li>It makes a great face scrub if you add a little water in the palm of your hand and GENTLY massage your face.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, that is looking for more than a regular light-body wash.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also interested in giving the Ahava brand a try.  </li>
            <li>well maybe if I find a mall kiosk where I can smell it first</li>
            <li>I just bought this today from a mall Kiosk and it seems to work pretty well, Im</li>
            <li>I too was first introduced to this product at the mall.</li>
            <li>I had been prescribed many things for my psoriasis included selsum blue dandruff shampoo, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>My husband bought me a sample from our mall when they were first introducing these products.</li>
            <li>exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it leaves your body feeling smooth and fresh, and I was very surprise that at the same time it cleared up my eczema....</li>
            <li>Be careful when using does leave the tub/shower floor super slippery from the oils in the scrub but love the scent and how soft it leaves my skin!</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I use this and we love how it cleans so deep and leaves our skin soft!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of any product to do wonders.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES EXFOLIATE AND SOFTEN YOUR SKIN[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So I get it here at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The jar had leaked quite a bit but not so much as to ruin the mix.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast though</li>
            <li>this dead sea scrub is amazing it makes your skin so soft  </li>
            <li>my previous purchase and more cost.  </li>
            <li>the freckles on my arms can hardly be seen since I started using this, I love it !</li>
            <li>Definitely a product I will be getting for myself; or putting on my next Mother&#x27;s Day List :).</li>
            <li>makes skin very soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this body scrub to anyone who has normal/dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you have dryer skin and can tolerate the salts, or normal skin, I say the product is a must-have.  </li>
            <li>I love Dead Sea items.  </li>
            <li>I love all dead sea products but this is number one on my list.</li>
            <li>It really helps clear up and smooth dry skin leaving my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love scrubs for winter use to clear up all the dead and drying skin..</li>
            <li>The dead sea salts work wonderfully, especially for blemishes and other skin conditions; gives you a very soft/clean feeling, and is a much more powerful body product for cleansing than so many other cleansers/scrubs out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other companies and products that are similar items</li>
            <li>I have had multiple bottles of this and was the first time I bought one online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once again another product that was super oily and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect this to be so greasy that I would be slipping all over the tub.</li>
            <li>I wet the area, scrub it on in small, gentle circles, then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear and feels salty/sandy; like the sea).</li>
            <li>The salts remove all the dead skin and dryness from my legs leaving them soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Leave my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>LOVE the line, especially the green stuff (it&#x27;s not really green...</li>
            <li>My friend who has psorisis ordered this and it made her skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>so I wrapped it in a zip lock baggie and figured I&#x27;d see if I could return it, thinking it was old or something and saw the sell won&#x27;t take returns on opened product.  </li>
            <li>It makes me sad because I loved it and had my husband using it on his callouses on his feet.  </li>
            <li>If you have very severa plaque psoriasis and it is more widespread, you can purchase dead sea salts in influx and bathe in them everyday.</li>
            <li>he had the price marked up to $79.99 and the facial peel for $39.99...</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the Green Tea, thinking it may be a little more subdued than the others.</li>
            <li>After using this product for the first time I spent the next 24 naked!</li>
            <li>They have a few kiosks at Orland Mall in Orland Park, Illinois, if you live near there and don&#x27;t want to order online.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast though</li>
            <li> this dead sea scrub is amazing it makes your skin so soft  </li>
            <li> my previous purchase and more cost.  </li>
            <li> the freckles on my arms can hardly be seen since I started using this, I love it !</li>
            <li> Definitely a product I will be getting for myself; or putting on my next Mother&#x27;s Day List :).</li>
            <li> makes skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this body scrub to anyone who has normal/dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you have dryer skin and can tolerate the salts, or normal skin, I say the product is a must-have.  </li>
            <li> I love Dead Sea items.  </li>
            <li> I love all dead sea products but this is number one on my list.</li>
            <li> It really helps clear up and smooth dry skin leaving my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love scrubs for winter use to clear up all the dead and drying skin..</li>
            <li> The dead sea salts work wonderfully, especially for blemishes and other skin conditions; gives you a very soft/clean feeling, and is a much more powerful body product for cleansing than so many other cleansers/scrubs out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other companies and products that are similar items</li>
            <li> I have had multiple bottles of this and was the first time I bought one online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once again another product that was super oily and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect this to be so greasy that I would be slipping all over the tub.</li>
            <li> I wet the area, scrub it on in small, gentle circles, then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear and feels salty/sandy; like the sea).</li>
            <li> The salts remove all the dead skin and dryness from my legs leaving them soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> LOVE the line, especially the green stuff (it&#x27;s not really green...</li>
            <li> My friend who has psorisis ordered this and it made her skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> so I wrapped it in a zip lock baggie and figured I&#x27;d see if I could return it, thinking it was old or something and saw the sell won&#x27;t take returns on opened product.  </li>
            <li> It makes me sad because I loved it and had my husband using it on his callouses on his feet.  </li>
            <li> If you have very severa plaque psoriasis and it is more widespread, you can purchase dead sea salts in influx and bathe in them everyday.</li>
            <li> he had the price marked up to $79.99 and the facial peel for $39.99...</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the Green Tea, thinking it may be a little more subdued than the others.</li>
            <li> After using this product for the first time I spent the next 24 naked!</li>
            <li> They have a few kiosks at Orland Mall in Orland Park, Illinois, if you live near there and don&#x27;t want to order online.  </li>
            <li> and after I got out of the shower other than my skin feeling extremely soft</li>
            <li> i bought the peel... and by the time we finished talking about random things he ended up GIVING me the body scrub for free....</li>
            <li> It takes patience, and clears up slowly, but my psoriasis on my knees was gone never to return thanks to God and this product.</li>
            <li> Since psoriasis is a chronic disease, I got another outbreak on the back of my neck only to find that the kiosk that at the mall had been closed down.</li>
            <li> The oils used leave your skin moisturized for a very long time; they also counteract the drying effect of the salts.  </li>
            <li> Step out of the shower, pat dry, and follow immediately with the body butter.</li>
            <li> so my skin is pretty thin, but using this scrub the way I described makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the Dead Sea facial mud mask from this company.  </li>
            <li> Even with the jar closed</li>
            <li> I got the Deep sea Cosmetics Dead sea Energizing body scrub for my girlfriend for her birthday</li>
            <li> and your house smells like the scrub for the next few months.</li>
            <li> Unlike previous salt scrubs purchased from Deep Sea, they have now started to water down this product.</li>
            <li> B000VG0MU6 Deep Sea Cosmetics Dead Sea Energizing Body Scrub - Green Tea]]</li>
            <li> What man made out of evil, God made good.  </li>
            <li> There were 3.5 ounces less that</li>
            <li> I wished that it was less greasy and</li>
            <li> The seller offered a slight discount or product return.</li>
            <li> One of two jars leaked water out in the mail and was dry, hard to get refund, still do not have refund.</li>
            <li> but the pirce is a little &amp;#34;salty&amp;#34; so to speak.  </li>
            <li> When the little package arrived with this in it, I knew immediately because of the smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is an overpowering lemon smell, even though it&#x27;s marketed as Green Tea, but it works well if you are looking for a rejuvenating aroma, to go along with your usage with the product.  </li>
            <li> a few days ago i had gotten sun burn and</li>
            <li> I ordered the green tea scented one</li>
            <li> He said he had tried my dead sea salt scrub on his feet</li>
            <li> I like the dead sea mineral scrubs, soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> Too bad they try to jack up the price so much.  </li>
            <li> I found it here on amazon, bought it, and now,my outbreak is slowly dissapearing.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to pay the original ridiculous price of the mall kiosk but was VERY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> No more ashy knees, or heels!  </li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers from skin conditionws knows how hard it is, and I reccommend it for anyone trying to find something for their psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I ended up paying $60 for the salt and lotion so about $30 a piece, but before I got her down in price, she was trying to charge me $60 a piece!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its on the expensive side</li>
            <li> I kept smelling something that was making me sick and realized it was still lingering on my hands.  </li>
            <li> and I asked him to go up and re-wash his feet because the smell was making me sick.  </li>
            <li> it was very disappointing if I were you</li>
            <li> Outrageous!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is great.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it wasn&#x27;t packaged well, and the lid cracked on one of the jars and some spilled out.  Luckily it didn&#x27;t get on any important mail.</li>
            <li> came in record time and this has to be the best on the market ! not only does it moisturize it even lightens freckles, no joke. the freckles on my arms can hardly be seen since I started using this, I love it ! and it is great on the feet !</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom for Mother&#x27;s Day. She&#x27;d been wanting a product like this for a good while now. I know she doesn&#x27;t like a lot of scent so I decided to try the Green Tea, thinking it may be a little more subdued than the others. Well, she LOVES it! She said there&#x27;s a hint of smell but it&#x27;s not to strong at all, and she loves the way her skin feels after using the product! Definitely a product I will be getting for myself; or putting on my next Mother&#x27;s Day List :).</li>
            <li> This is one of the best body scrubs I have ever used. Leave my skin soft and hydrated. The aroma is wonderful. Great price, excellent seller. Super fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I started using DSC body scrub, body butter, and hand/body lotion over a year ago and just love the line. My elbows and feet are \\&quot;smooth as buttah\\&quot;. I love the scrub - be sure to step away from the water massage in, let it stay on your skin for a while....it feels great; I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working. And then massage in some more before washing off. Step out of the shower, pat dry, and follow immediately with the body butter. It doesn&#x27;t take much of any product to do wonders. LOVE the line, especially the green stuff (it&#x27;s not really green...it&#x27;s clear and feels salty/sandy; like the sea). Pamper yourself!</li>
            <li> TRULY WONDERFUL....IT REALLY DOES EXFOLIATE AND SOFTEN YOUR SKIN[[ASIN:B000VG0MU6 Deep Sea Cosmetics Dead Sea Energizing Body Scrub - Green Tea]]</li>
            <li> The skin softly became smooth &amp; well as for the smell and it was good.   It liked it very much though scrub that the aroma oil entered was used for the first time.   It was good for me with dry skin.   Repetition.</li>
            <li> This product when it arrived was terrific. It smelled very nice, packaging &amp; product description were perfect;  very satisfied with the product itself and the exterior/jar.  The dead sea salts work wonderfully, especially for blemishes and other skin conditions; gives you a very soft/clean feeling, and is a much more powerful body product for cleansing than so many other cleansers/scrubs out there.  The oils used leave your skin moisturized for a very long time; they also counteract the drying effect of the salts.  The product works great as an exfoliant and definitely is a must-have for anyone that wants to experience softer, more radiant skin, that is looking for more than a regular light-body wash.  It&#x27;s a great product but can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s perfect, only because the oils used seem to be abundant, to the point where it seems we&#x27;re getting just as much oil as dead sea salt, and they are very strong, almost to the point of feeling greasy, so you&#x27;re left as to wonder if this product is more for dryer skin or for oily skin, or normal.  If you have dryer skin and can tolerate the salts, or normal skin, I say the product is a must-have.  For oily skin, the salts work great, but there is so much additional oil, that it would leave you feeling greasy.  The scent is an overpowering lemon smell, even though it&#x27;s marketed as Green Tea, but it works well if you are looking for a rejuvenating aroma, to go along with your usage with the product.  Overall, this product is a treat, and I recommend it!  If you know your skin type.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It leaves your skin so soft and smooth. It has also help keep my skin hydrated and healthy. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub...awesome beautiful scent, makes my skin feel so refreshed and super soft after use. Be careful when using does leave the tub/shower floor super slippery from the oils in the scrub but love the scent and how soft it leaves my skin!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this body scrub to anyone who has normal/dry skin.  Works great as a moisturizer leaving skin soft and smooth.  Feels a little greasy in shower, but great after shower.</li>
            <li> Unlike previous salt scrubs purchased from Deep Sea, they have now started to water down this product. It&#x27;s not as good as the original formula was. I believe they fill the jars by weight so you do not get the same amount of salt. Additionally within a week of purchasing this from Amazon the price shot up dramatically!   I think I need to find another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST body scrub. It works for every skin type, but even better for ppl with the driest skin. My friend who has psorisis ordered this and it made her skin so soft. I recommend this for everyone, because it feels like silk, smells invigorating and this is a great price! Normally sells for 85-55$  Great deal and worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> After using this product for the first time I spent the next 24 naked! My skin has not felt this good in years, lucky I am on vacation!</li>
            <li> I got this product for Christmas and all I want to say is that is is CURING my eczema, which has been hanging around, off and on, on my hands for YEARS.  I am definitely going to buy this product again when I run out.  I love Dead Sea items.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the Dead Sea facial mud mask from this company.  I&#x27;m also interested in giving the Ahava brand a try.  This stuff is GREAT!  They have a few kiosks at Orland Mall in Orland Park, Illinois, if you live near there and don&#x27;t want to order online.  What a great Christmas gift this was!</li>
            <li> One of two jars leaked water out in the mail and was dry, hard to get refund, still do not have refund.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin so soft. a few days ago i had gotten sun burn and the scrub took some of the excess skin off and it didnt feel irritated after using it. :D</li>
            <li> Great Product. I ordered the green tea scented one and it smells so good and refreshing. makes skin very soft!</li>
            <li> É um esfoliante bem cheiroso, e tem um óleo misturado a um sal bem grosso. Então à medida que vc esfolia também fica passando o óleo e no final nem precisa hidratar. Achei melhor para usar no inverno.</li>
            <li> I tried this scrub at the mall at one of those pushy kiosks.  I ended up getting it for the price I paid here...must have needed a sale that day but I loved it once I got it home and started using it.  I don&#x27;t like scented products and it was just a fresh clean smell and after I got out of the shower other than my skin feeling extremely soft I had no smells following me around all day.  I thought I would order it off Amazon so I didn&#x27;t have to pay the original ridiculous price of the mall kiosk but was VERY disappointed.  I opened it right away and used it, when I got to work I kept smelling something that was making me sick and realized it was still lingering on my hands.  I went to the restroom and washed and washed to get rid of the smell.  I got home and when my husband came out to help me with some things I picked up I could smell it again.  He said he had tried my dead sea salt scrub on his feet and I asked him to go up and re-wash his feet because the smell was making me sick.  Even with the jar closed I could still smell it in our bathroom so I wrapped it in a zip lock baggie and figured I&#x27;d see if I could return it, thinking it was old or something and saw the sell won&#x27;t take returns on opened product.  It&#x27;s in the trash and out of the house now and I will never order it again...well maybe if I find a mall kiosk where I can smell it first but that would be the only way.  It makes me sad because I loved it and had my husband using it on his callouses on his feet.  I&#x27;m sure there are other companies and products that are similar items but this one is off my list.</li>
            <li> I got the Deep sea Cosmetics Dead sea Energizing body scrub for my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved it! That was one of the things she wanted for her birthday! Very good product! :)</li>
            <li> I just bought this today from a mall Kiosk and it seems to work pretty well, Im so upset at the price I paid. I ended up paying $60 for the salt and lotion so about $30 a piece, but before I got her down in price, she was trying to charge me $60 a piece!!!!! Glad I found this on amazon</li>
            <li> Product came by the promised date. It really helps clear up and smooth dry skin leaving my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Product is very easy to use in the shower and hydrates my skin to a comfortable feel and healthy look.  I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with it, as well as the body butter.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  It is very nice and I would recommend it but the pirce is a little &amp;#34;salty&amp;#34; so to speak.  There were 3.5 ounces less that my previous purchase and more cost.  Hope this lasts  a while.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again at that price.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The salts remove all the dead skin and dryness from my legs leaving them soft and smooth.  Scent is great too.</li>
            <li> I like the dead sea mineral scrubs, soaps and lotions. They improve skin hydration greatly. I tried this scrub and the body butter at the mall at one of those pushy kiosks. Don&#x27;t let them trick you! They tried to have me pay $80 for this! Outrageous! Buy from amazon or another reputable seller. Those mall kiosks are a scam!!!</li>
            <li> This is a Excellent Product, as I use this, I have notice that my Eczema has cleared up..I am very happy about that. I have used lots of products for my eczema and look at this done it... I did not buy it for that reason, I bought it cause of the smell and it leaves your body feeling smooth and fresh, and I was very surprise that at the same time it cleared up my eczema....I love this product. My skin really feels good after using it..and the smell I really Love...Happy Customer..2011</li>
            <li> I have been using this sea salt for about 6 weeks.  I love it and wont go a week without using it!  I have seen a awesome difference in the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for removing dry itchy skin and adds to the smoothness of lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love it.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Scrub is absolutely amazing!  What man made out of evil, God made good.  This scrub softens your skin and removes dead skin cells gently.  You will truly appreciate this product when you rub some on your feet, legs, and arms.  No more ashy knees, or heels!  This is the way God made your skin to feel.  Refreshed and invigorated.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I use this and we love how it cleans so deep and leaves our skin soft!</li>
            <li> I think that this product is over priced I purchesed it and it ended up giving me the same results as regular sea salt scrubs that I purchased for $1.00 at cvs it was very disappointing if I were you I would not buy this product and just go to a drug store and save money. Also once you open it the oils spill every where and your house smells like the scrub for the next few months.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed being accosted at the mall by people selling these products because my hands come away feeling so soft, and the aroma is just divine!  Too bad they try to jack up the price so much.  So I get it here at a reasonable price.  When the little package arrived with this in it, I knew immediately because of the smell. The jar had leaked quite a bit but not so much as to ruin the mix.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know what the aroma is made up of?  I would love it in a hand cream.</li>
            <li> i was recently in a mall in orlando florida when i was approached by a guy selling this  body scrub...and while the product smells great  ( i have yet to use it) and seems legit... he had the price marked up to $79.99 and the facial peel for $39.99... i bought the peel... and by the time we finished talking about random things he ended up GIVING me the body scrub for free.... I had never seen or heard of this line of products before this interaction so i had no pricing to reference... but after seeing it here on amazon, i can only advise others to  price check via the internet before making purchases elsewhere</li>
            <li> I too was first introduced to this product at the mall. The woman had mentioned that this product is also used to treat various skin conditions including psoriasis. The lady did not know at the time that I haave psoriasis, but I ended up purchasing the salt scrub. I had been prescribed many things for my psoriasis included selsum blue dandruff shampoo, but nothing worked. I used this on my psoriasis three times a day. I wet the area, scrub it on in small, gentle circles, then rinse with warm water. Then apply the body butter. It takes patience, and clears up slowly, but my psoriasis on my knees was gone never to return thanks to God and this product. Since psoriasis is a chronic disease, I got another outbreak on the back of my neck only to find that the kiosk that at the mall had been closed down. I found it here on amazon, bought it, and now,my outbreak is slowly dissapearing. I absolutely love this product and what it has done for my life and confidence. Anyone who suffers from skin conditionws knows how hard it is, and I reccommend it for anyone trying to find something for their psoriasis. BE PATIENT it takes awhile but once it is gone it will never come back. If you have very severa plaque psoriasis and it is more widespread, you can purchase dead sea salts in influx and bathe in them everyday. This product has changed my life.</li>
            <li> this dead sea scrub is amazing it makes your skin so soft  i recomind it to any one that is looking in to getting it for you or for a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for five years. My husband bought me a sample from our mall when they were first introducing these products. It makes a great face scrub if you add a little water in the palm of your hand and GENTLY massage your face. I&#x27;m 68 so my skin is pretty thin, but using this scrub the way I described makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> Once again another product that was super oily and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect this to be so greasy that I would be slipping all over the tub. Not&lt;br /&gt;a very fun experience. I wished that it was less greasy and not so harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast though so that was good.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before and love it .. it is absolutely the best body scrub I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> I found that this product was energizing and relaxing at the same time.  It&#x27;s made for those stressful but fullfilling days!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is , the price keeps going up. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love all dead sea products but this is number one on my list.Its on the expensive side but I think its worth every cent.Best scrub Ive ever tried and Ive tried a lot!</li>
            <li> I sent this to my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  She said she really liked the product and it had a nice smell.  I love scrubs for winter use to clear up all the dead and drying skin.. So am taking her word for this product</li>
            <li> Helped me with my acne scars, has a great scent, very oily though, you have to get used to that. But left my skin hydrated! and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have had multiple bottles of this and was the first time I bought one online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t smell the same or feel exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it in a store and spend the extra money, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Green Tea isn&#x27;t that great. The orginal is much better</li>
            <li> Though the seal on the jar was intact when I received it, most of the oil had leaked into the shipping bag. The seller offered a slight discount or product return. With so many things ordered online these days, the company should be able to figure out how to package this product so the customer receives 100% of it --- in the jar!</li>
