            <li> I usually use the liquid version of Witch&#x27;s Hazel as my toner in my skincare. I bought these for travel and they are so convenient. Already moist and easy to use!</li>
            <li> The actual product is great!  The delivery too hard to use on a squirmy little boys face.  For me, the circle pads are too small and fold up when I try to use.</li>
            <li> My skin has been saved. I have super dry skin but I get terrible zits and worst of all, blackheads. I bought this after hearing so much about witch hazel. The hype is real. The convenience of having t on a face pad makes it even better. Get this!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural that would cleanse and tone my face, and these Witch Hazel Pads did the trick! I love using them and will definitely be ordering through this company again!</li>
            <li> Pleased with these.  Some people complained about size, but they work for my purpose (cleaning face). THe only thing is that I have super oily skin and am not supposed to use alcohol based products and these seem to have alcohol.  I wanted pure witchhazel.  They do burn.  I probably won&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> I liked these pads, at first I thought they were way to wet. but I added a couple of cotto balls to the jar and that seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry with you wherever you go... This is a great skin cleaner and toner. High quality witch hazel</li>
            <li> My pet has problems with his ears and I use these to clean them. Previously, I just used witch hazel on a cotton ball and it was quite messy. This is a great idea! This product also shipped very quickly!!</li>
            <li> This is great for stopping bug bite itches. I know others use it to clean the skin but I purchased it for my red head because the bugs love him.</li>
            <li> Product was as described. Excellent service. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Vendor</li>
            <li> The witch hazel seems to work as well as the kind from the bottle, but these little wipes are very small and probably only useful if you need them on the go. I put them in my medicine kit to use on bug bites.</li>
            <li> My wife loved these after childbirth (great along with frozen pad soaked in bottled witchazel).  She said that they saved her and uses them still in the bathroom and around her makeup counter.</li>
            <li> I love witch hazel wipes because they work so well on my face. They keep it clean and fresh. These wipes are quite thin and small, but they work perfect for what I need. I do wish that they were soft rather than textured. It is kind of cool because the texture feels like it is helping the cleaning process, but it is a bit rough.</li>
            <li> What else can I say....what a great product for so many purposes...hemorrhoids, acne, cleansing etc....This is a miracle lotion. Go for it</li>
            <li> I have very blotchy skin with occasional breakouts and since I&#x27;ve been using these my skin looks amazing!!! Even is I have a problem at night, I use them before going to bed and by morning it&#x27;s gone!!! Amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these Witch Hazel pads to make having Witch Hazel easily available and usable while traveling. I tried them here at home and this will be very useful in my travels.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any skin irritation. Excellent value. More convenient than witch hazel in a bottle.</li>
            <li> The pre-soaked wipes are a bit textured so they have exfoliating benefits.  How handy they are also.  Great way to clean your face before going to bed.  Shipment was fast.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Awesome and so convenient.  All of my teenagers use these when they pay the bathroom a visit.  It&#x27;s helping with the too frequent acne outbreaks.</li>
            <li> very small pads.  You need 2 or 3 together to be of any use at all.  A major waste of money</li>
            <li> The pads makes it very convenient for use. Works great also they are not super soaked so while using it no liquid drips off. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to separate an individual pad when pick one up you need to make sure it&#x27;s not 2 since they stick together. However once you get the hang of that it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> thank you for sending me exactly what I ordered ! i love this product and use it daily. it cleans and refreshes your skin</li>
            <li> I keep these in the car to wipe grim off me. I don&#x27;t wear makeup and work outdoors in the dust alot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived  without these. Makes a big difference with skin.</li>
            <li> They even helped with redness caused by a skin condition.  Witch hazel seems to work way beyond an oily skin issue.</li>
            <li> I received a jar of pads.  Not the towelettes I ordered.  The towelettes are individually wrapped, which make it easy to take with me, are larger, and what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the price was great, now I see why.  It was a bait and switch.  I will never buy from this provider again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a happy customer!</li>
            <li> They clean my face well yet they don&#x27;t dry it out!&lt;br /&gt;I have difficult skin and it keeps my skin clear for the most part, unless it&#x27;s that time of the month or I ate something really bad for me.&lt;br /&gt;but these clear my face up fast!</li>
            <li> What the description didn&#x27;t make clear is that these contain alcohol . I have very sensitive skin and these make it dry, flaky, and red after just one use.  That said, if I was in the wilderness with no access to water or face wash, I think these would be an effective wipe.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel works like magic to soothe, cure, or help heal almost every skin issue. Maybe that&#x27;s the reason for the name. Powerfully anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li> A great product  that help when you shave and when you want to clean your face. Also good for any skin problem.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the larger sized pads, but because of the way Hazelets are labeled, there was a misunderstanding on my part, and I received the smaller pads.  The pads, other than being small, are great.  They make a wonderful refreshment to the face and eyes, remove makeup and a quick washup in the car  after consumming food or handling other sticky items.  I also use them at the computer - careful, not for monitor use.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the ones with Aloe which I adore and are now discontinued!  Wish they didn&#x27;t stop making them!</li>
