            <li> Ripped after a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> it is so cute I love it</li>
            <li> Horrible cheap flimsy plastic!!  Arrived in tiny pouch completely wrinkled so I put it in with a slightly warm load of towels in the dryer that had been sitting there after dry cycle ended, ( barely warm dryer ) and it melted and stuck together.  Cheap crap is right!!!  You would also sweat to death in this, like wrapping yourself in a plastic table cover from the Dollar Store.  Awful!!!!!! And wouldnt stay tied even before I melted it....guess you get what you pay for.  Hmm...I could have had 8 table covers for what I paid, lol!!!</li>
            <li> Great deal, love this, when I&#x27;m cutting my sons hair.</li>
            <li> cheap. Arrived broken</li>
            <li> it looked like it was sitting around in this cheap wrapper for decades. the water from the sink soaks right through the apron.</li>
            <li> The worse product.  It&#x27;s plastic.  Rip right away.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed...quality of a rubber raft.  The print was transparent not what I expected from the image.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Good apron! Not exactly the material I was expecting but still good quality! Stains wash right off which Is wonderful</li>
            <li> I got this and the matching capes for my daughter who is in cosmetology school.  She loves the print, she wanted something different from the other classmates and this was just the thing!</li>
            <li> This apron is really cute, but started to rip the second day I wore it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a kitchen apron and by the little picture seen, it looks cute. However, the description implied it was fine but when I got it, it was a one piece vinyl with a pocket in the middle and looks like a beauty shop operator uses. I am very frustrated as it was placed in with aprons for housewares.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Thought it was cloth. Cute design, but not practical.</li>
            <li> wish i would have read the reviews as i usually do.  The picture and the description implies it is a silk material.  It is plastic, smells toxic when it arrives.  I am a massage therapist in a day spa and was looking for something a little jazzy to hold oils in.  This is not at all what i expected. sad</li>
            <li> My apron came quickly and was extremely cute! The material is a little thin/cheap but for the price this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> She has the matching cape for her clients at cosmetology school.  The two of these together make for a professional fasion statement.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality. Apron is plastic and doesn&#x27;t stay tied. Cheap crap</li>
            <li> bought this apron for work and it came apart in a matter of weeks.. not good quality. it is all plastic so it is very hot when you wear it.</li>
            <li> Good design but thin material</li>
