            <li>Excellent product, alcohol free</li>

            <li>Nice and light on my face!</li>
            <li>Make up goes on nicely over the top.</li>
            <li>I have used Neutrogena products for years and have found this moisturizer to be the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is the best on sensitive, acne-prone skin with ezcema.</li>
            <li>, i feel like i got a good volume of good product for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer, but this would work fine too!</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>I guess, I gave this to my daughter however who uses it with great success and enjoys it just fine.</li>
            <li>Love it as an aftershave and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>favorite drugstore moisturizer is still [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So glad to see it offered through Amazon at such a great price!</li>
            <li>; however, I was hoping to find a better price, but no luck even on this site</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth!</li>
            <li>WAY too many parabens----why??????</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find another like it.</li>
            <li>Deff reccommend this as a try! : )</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product it does everything it claims and does not clog my pores or irritate my skin, Finally found a product this works!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Neutragena is one of the most trusted brands of skincare out there.</li>
            <li>Since my face tends to get more shiny and oily as the day goes on</li>
            <li>Do not buy unless you want a really really really light moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>:) I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS FOR EVERDAY USE</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s more lightweight than an SPF lotion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A+  :)</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Nice and light.  </li>
            <li>I love this face lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best and light weight lotion out there.</li>
            <li>The Clinique moisturizer has a more runny consistency than this moisturizer and glided on the skin more easily.</li>
            <li>This is the best, by a long shot.</li>
            <li>I like this one better than the one with sunscreen in it because it feels the most oil free and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see it is for sensitive skin and oil free, but once you put it on, it feels like nothing!  </li>
            <li>It is light, oil free, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores!</li>
            <li>Great face lotion for sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>So, for the most part, I just want an oil-free moisturizer, fragrance free</li>
            <li>It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I put this product on my face, it was kind of oily and not get absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>great product, I love the way it moistures my skin, I definitely recommend it to those who have problematic skin</li>
            <li>people can use moisturizers with alcohol and have no problems, so I understand that this may work fine for some people.</li>
            <li>and it sure isn&#x27;t turning bright red.</li>
            <li>and everything has been smooth sailing ever since.</li>
            <li>I have been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for one month.</li>
            <li>are:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s kind of watery, yet leaves your face looking/feeling very greasy.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is advertised as being \\&quot;free of drying</li>
            <li>free--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have perfume, it&#x27;s smooth as silk and light.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light as air.  </li>
            <li>I recently started moisturizing my face and this product is great.</li>
            <li>its light</li>
            <li>it felt too light.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Wash followed my a toner and moisturizer if anyone was wondering.</li>
            <li>Great for oily teen skin.</li>
            <li>It has no yucky smell and absorbs comfortably in my skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively cheap, it&#x27;s light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all shiny.  </li>
            <li>and this product is too light for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet does the job.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and works great with mixing other products (retinol cream, vitamin d, etc)</li>
            <li>Honestly,  it works great, non greasy, all day moisturizing for your face with just one small application in the morning before going to work.  </li>
            <li>well say that my skin looks oily , &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the product that is cussing me breakouts ...</li>
            <li>I always try to take this with me to reapply because i love it so much!</li>
            <li>has by far been the best for my skin in terms of daily use and price.</li>
            <li>However, I need to do more research to find a worthwhile cream for sensitive skin that is affordable.</li>
            <li>I used to use Proactiv, but the moisturizer turned my skin bright red.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s important to wear that when you&#x27;re going to be in the sun, but I live in Seattle, and I&#x27;m in an office building most of the day, so</li>
            <li>It was perfect for my sensitive skin and got rid of all the dry skin within a couple of days of use.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face right before bedtime and in the morning my skin feels so smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried maybe 3-4 other kinds but am quite happy with this.  </li>
            <li>and this is a great light moisturizer for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m trying to get better at having a more regular moisturizing routine since turning 36).  </li>
            <li>Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer and use it every day as do my teenage daughters, great product that does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and mosturizes well without leaving greasy feeling</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and disappears quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that seems to be becoming more and more sensitive as time goes on.</li>
            <li>This did not work for me although it seems no matter how many Neutrogena products I try none seem to agree with my very sensitive and picky skin, it&#x27;s just something in their formula</li>
            <li>I still have to test it out in winter, but it&#x27;s my favorite moisturizer so far!</li>
            <li>Although this states it is an oil free moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy it works for some people, but this moisturizer DRIED out my skin</li>
            <li>in them that are irritating....or are for more mature skin)</li>
            <li>It does not make your face oily at all but give enough moisture where it feels really nice.  </li>
            <li>For me though, it wasn&#x27;t such a nice experience.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, since that proves it is fragrance</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s only good for night as it makes your face very</li>
            <li>I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin than&lt;br /&gt;alcohol based products</li>
            <li>I love this sensitive skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it is the only kind of moisturizer I can use.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh with no greasy feeling</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I did not find the neutrogena moisturizing cream on amazon or other stores but this can be a good substitute.</li>
            <li>This absorbs right in &amp; does not leave my face shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use this in the morning before I apply makeup and at night right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s all I have right now and keep forgetting to buy something else.</li>
            <li>The others are not bad though, but you can certainly feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>purchased as a gift - grand daughter will use no other</li>
            <li>It is great for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I usually use Mary Kay moisturizer which I am usually happy with but not all the time.</li>
            <li>It basically moisturized and evened my chin&#x27;s tone, reduced the redness and inflammation on my cheeks and made my skin look healthy in general.</li>
            <li>Works great on my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer but it leaves a slight &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>The Avon moisturizer was light from the jar and went on smoothly and left no greasy feeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Without any prejudice, I put it on my skin at night and the day after I was surprised how soft, even and nice my skin was looking.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very fast in the skin and doesn&#x27;t moisturize well at all.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and have been using this stuff for many years now.  </li>
            <li>It works great at moisturizing oily skin with out causing break outs, which is hard to find as I have discovered</li>
            <li>now use Clinique dramatically different lotion, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about the lotion I use for my face.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what you would find at the drugstore and saved me time.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light, water-based, and absorbs in your skin completely.</li>
            <li>Will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li>It feels light when you put it on, and keeps my face soft all day.</li>
            <li>A light lotion that does well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>worked great for my skin and the irritation slowly went away.</li>
            <li>do your research first.  </li>
            <li>I get this for my wife; she won&#x27;t use any other kind of lotion for her face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, I switched over the Clean &amp; Clear, but that made my skin oily.</li>
            <li>If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I wake up and my skin is super soft!  </li>
            <li>For a long time I was able to get a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; oil-free moisturizer from Avon</li>
            <li>Even so, it is very useful for general use and i will probably purchase it again</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty fair and is pretty sensitive to any harsh chemicals or exposures.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion because I don&#x27;t notice it when it&#x27;s on, but I do when I don&#x27;t use it (skin feels dry).  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, it dries quickly and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>bought while my face was super sensitive during pregnancy.....</li>
            <li>This certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>only bought this because it said it was oil and alcohol free- as both ingredients cause me to break out, and really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products claiming to be great for sensitive skin, but those claims don&#x27;t usually hold true</li>
            <li>No oily residue- very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and hydrates my skin well.</li>
            <li>It really solves the oil problem while moisturizing AND providing sun protection.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a fantastic moisturizer, and I finally found it with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it got to me fast and was not busted or dammaged.</li>
            <li>It hurt so much.</li>
            <li>so I need a gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I cannot use any of the normally available commercial moisture creams.  </li>
            <li>I use this along with the very  ultra gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have used this periodically over the years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I regret this purchase so much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but aside from the burning, I found it very occlusive.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li>Very soothing</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than 5 years and I totally recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I would started to get more acne than I did using the other moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Had some special treatments to kill precancer cells and after the aloe vera for several days  </li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wife has pretty sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product it was decent and worked well for my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If Neutrogena decides to go paraben-free, I&#x27;ll probably start using it again, because I don&#x27;t really like the new stuff I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>A decent buy.</li>
            <li>It seemed that Neutrogena is a decent brand.</li>
            <li>Had acne all thru my 20s, it&#x27;s clearing up the older Im getting</li>
            <li>extra step)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I have yet to find a moisturizer like my all-time favorite one (Lancome Visionaire moisturizer).</li>
            <li>Coupled with their liquid soap, this keeps me moist and lovely without being a zitty mess.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>BP is effective but easily made my facial skin dry and tight.</li>
            <li>I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is a little bit thicker and that makes it more moisturizing than the Clinique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually really expensive in stores $15-20, so Amazon&#x27;s price is actually a great one.  </li>
            <li>Its not thick and greasy like others.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, although I&#x27;m too wary to try it on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product, not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I have found that is light enough to keep oil sheen away (for a few hours at least- blotting papers are my best friend) as well as not aggravate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liquidy not as thick as I would have liked but gets the job done</li>
            <li>product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day (until I wash my face my again).  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and acne prone and this moisturizer made my skin red and itchy.</li>
            <li>I have tried the normal variety with SPF, which I wish I could use every day in the punishing New Mexico sun, but it makes me break out.</li>
            <li>Now my texture is grainy under the chin, and bumpy along the right jaw line; and my skin looks red and irratated.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin smooth without the added fragrance which makes me break out with other products.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two new bottles.</li>
            <li>I sought to find a new moisturizer and came across this product.  </li>
            <li>It feels nearly as good as my expensive one, but it doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin quite as fast.</li>
            <li>Before, I had velvety smooth skin that only received an occasional blemish from menstrual acne.</li>
            <li>At the time, I had a break out on my cheeks but my chin was super dry.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel very soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to, well, basically everything except this.</li>
            <li>but do have sensitive normal skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend a better daily facial lotion, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn at all after facial treatments.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for ethnic, aging, dry, super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>also use the Neutrogena Clean make-up after applying the lotion and have never had any caking or other problems with make-up application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to expect of this other than a clean moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it feels very sheer and absorbs nicely, so not a bad product, just not for me personally.</li>
            <li>It literally feels watery to the touch and absorbs right into the skin, preventing dry, flakey skin for me after washing my face without clogging pores.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and feel like this moisturizer is a tad on the rich side, so i prefer to use it at night, or a dab anytime on any dry spots, especially around the lips.</li>
            <li>I now have extremely clear skin and</li>
            <li>I selected this product for my sensitive skin oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin helps.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, acne-prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Really soft and not oily for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I have combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of moisturizers and face products because I have ridiculously sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>this product works well on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>And on the bottle, it said that for sensitive skin and not clog pores.</li>
            <li>I have soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Within three months, I developed sever acne.</li>
            <li>I really like it, especially for the warmer times.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have oily and acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft too.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just surprised that something that states</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Before trying the Sensitive Skin moisturizer I was using SPF 15 moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use this moisture cream because my skin is really sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I am 58 years old.</li>
            <li>The lotion makes your face soft without making it feel oily.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s somewhat sensitive.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin feeling moisturized as moisturizers normally do and does not break me out more than i usually do.</li>
            <li>you skin feels soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li>I would avoid this moisturizer if you have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>After using Oil of Olay sensitive skin for years, I found my skin becoming very dry as I aged.  </li>
            <li>I finally Google the ingredients and found out that it contains Ethylhexyl Palmitate and Isopropyl Isostearate which are highly comedogenic (pore clogging).</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use this after washing my face but with just normal pre makeup application or daily use it does not burn.</li>
            <li>I have a combination skin consist of very dry chin, normal cheeks, slightly oily forehead and very oily nose!!!</li>
            <li>I had originally planned to use this as a replacement of my former Yes to Cucumber Night Cream because I had hopes of finding something less oily.</li>
            <li>I tried some other products, but I think most of my trouble came from having sensitive</li>
            <li>Sometimes I think I&#x27;ll try something new, and I go back every time.</li>
            <li>The only way to keep it from totally clogging your pores is with very harsh cleansing, which if you bought this product for the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; label, you&#x27;re not going to be able to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am prone to dry, sensitive skin as I get older...</li>
            <li>My nose gets dried up after a shower, so I quickly apply this once I get out</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy, has sunscreen, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very sensitive and this is the only lotion that does not cause itching, redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin due to Rosacea and my skin is also very oily.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking a little shiny for a while but once absorbed</li>
            <li>I generally use</li>
            <li>moisture (obviously) and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is one of the only moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Finally a product for people who are sensitive to perfume, some oils and aloe.</li>
            <li>skin is now red and blotchy from a reaction to the moisturizer itself and it&#x27;s caused a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>One of very very few fragrance free products that actually smells like nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried putting it on when my face is still damp right after a shower hoping it won&#x27;t be as heavy, nah.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my usual moisturizer and needed a quick fix.</li>
            <li>There was not a single sign of moisterization.</li>
            <li>I have 30 years old, white female.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat dry skin and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I use this product daily, as well, I mix it with my thick foundation for light sheer summer coverage.</li>
            <li>I also use their face wash which is not harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is really dry sometimes and extremely sensitive.</li>

            <li> I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer, but this would work fine too!</li>
            <li> Very light.</li>
            <li> I guess, I gave this to my daughter however who uses it with great success and enjoys it just fine.</li>

            <li> I love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> favorite drugstore moisturizer is still [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> So glad to see it offered through Amazon at such a great price!</li>
            <li> ; however, I was hoping to find a better price, but no luck even on this site</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth!</li>
            <li> WAY too many parabens----why??????</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find another like it.</li>
            <li> Deff reccommend this as a try! : )</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product it does everything it claims and does not clog my pores or irritate my skin, Finally found a product this works!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Neutragena is one of the most trusted brands of skincare out there.</li>
            <li> Since my face tends to get more shiny and oily as the day goes on</li>
            <li> Do not buy unless you want a really really really light moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> :) I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FOR EVERDAY USE</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s more lightweight than an SPF lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A+  :)</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Nice and light.  </li>
            <li> I love this face lotion.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best and light weight lotion out there.</li>
            <li> The Clinique moisturizer has a more runny consistency than this moisturizer and glided on the skin more easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best, by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the one with sunscreen in it because it feels the most oil free and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to see it is for sensitive skin and oil free, but once you put it on, it feels like nothing!  </li>
            <li> It is light, oil free, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores!</li>
            <li> Great face lotion for sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> So, for the most part, I just want an oil-free moisturizer, fragrance free</li>
            <li> It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I put this product on my face, it was kind of oily and not get absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> great product, I love the way it moistures my skin, I definitely recommend it to those who have problematic skin</li>
            <li> people can use moisturizers with alcohol and have no problems, so I understand that this may work fine for some people.</li>
            <li> and it sure isn&#x27;t turning bright red.</li>
            <li> and everything has been smooth sailing ever since.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for one month.</li>
            <li> are:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s kind of watery, yet leaves your face looking/feeling very greasy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is advertised as being \\&quot;free of drying</li>
            <li> free--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have perfume, it&#x27;s smooth as silk and light.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light as air.  </li>
            <li> I recently started moisturizing my face and this product is great.</li>
            <li> its light</li>
            <li> it felt too light.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Wash followed my a toner and moisturizer if anyone was wondering.</li>
            <li> Great for oily teen skin.</li>
            <li> It has no yucky smell and absorbs comfortably in my skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively cheap, it&#x27;s light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all shiny.  </li>
            <li> and this product is too light for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light yet does the job.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion and works great with mixing other products (retinol cream, vitamin d, etc)</li>
            <li> Honestly,  it works great, non greasy, all day moisturizing for your face with just one small application in the morning before going to work.  </li>
            <li> well say that my skin looks oily , &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the product that is cussing me breakouts ...</li>
            <li> I always try to take this with me to reapply because i love it so much!</li>
            <li> has by far been the best for my skin in terms of daily use and price.</li>
            <li> However, I need to do more research to find a worthwhile cream for sensitive skin that is affordable.</li>
            <li> I used to use Proactiv, but the moisturizer turned my skin bright red.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s important to wear that when you&#x27;re going to be in the sun, but I live in Seattle, and I&#x27;m in an office building most of the day, so</li>
            <li> It was perfect for my sensitive skin and got rid of all the dry skin within a couple of days of use.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face right before bedtime and in the morning my skin feels so smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe 3-4 other kinds but am quite happy with this.  </li>
            <li> and this is a great light moisturizer for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m trying to get better at having a more regular moisturizing routine since turning 36).  </li>
            <li> Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer and use it every day as do my teenage daughters, great product that does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and mosturizes well without leaving greasy feeling</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and disappears quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that seems to be becoming more and more sensitive as time goes on.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me although it seems no matter how many Neutrogena products I try none seem to agree with my very sensitive and picky skin, it&#x27;s just something in their formula</li>
            <li> I still have to test it out in winter, but it&#x27;s my favorite moisturizer so far!</li>
            <li> Although this states it is an oil free moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy it works for some people, but this moisturizer DRIED out my skin</li>
            <li> in them that are irritating....or are for more mature skin)</li>
            <li> It does not make your face oily at all but give enough moisture where it feels really nice.  </li>
            <li> For me though, it wasn&#x27;t such a nice experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it, since that proves it is fragrance</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s only good for night as it makes your face very</li>
            <li> I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin than&lt;br /&gt;alcohol based products</li>
            <li> I love this sensitive skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it is the only kind of moisturizer I can use.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh with no greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I did not find the neutrogena moisturizing cream on amazon or other stores but this can be a good substitute.</li>
            <li> This absorbs right in &amp; does not leave my face shiny.  </li>
            <li> I use this in the morning before I apply makeup and at night right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s all I have right now and keep forgetting to buy something else.</li>
            <li> The others are not bad though, but you can certainly feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> purchased as a gift - grand daughter will use no other</li>
            <li> It is great for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually use Mary Kay moisturizer which I am usually happy with but not all the time.</li>
            <li> It basically moisturized and evened my chin&#x27;s tone, reduced the redness and inflammation on my cheeks and made my skin look healthy in general.</li>
            <li> Works great on my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer but it leaves a slight &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> The Avon moisturizer was light from the jar and went on smoothly and left no greasy feeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Without any prejudice, I put it on my skin at night and the day after I was surprised how soft, even and nice my skin was looking.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very fast in the skin and doesn&#x27;t moisturize well at all.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and have been using this stuff for many years now.  </li>
            <li> It works great at moisturizing oily skin with out causing break outs, which is hard to find as I have discovered</li>
            <li> now use Clinique dramatically different lotion, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about the lotion I use for my face.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what you would find at the drugstore and saved me time.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light, water-based, and absorbs in your skin completely.</li>
            <li> Will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> It feels light when you put it on, and keeps my face soft all day.</li>
            <li> A light lotion that does well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> worked great for my skin and the irritation slowly went away.</li>
            <li> do your research first.  </li>
            <li> I get this for my wife; she won&#x27;t use any other kind of lotion for her face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, I switched over the Clean &amp; Clear, but that made my skin oily.</li>
            <li> If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I wake up and my skin is super soft!  </li>
            <li> For a long time I was able to get a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; oil-free moisturizer from Avon</li>
            <li> Even so, it is very useful for general use and i will probably purchase it again</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty fair and is pretty sensitive to any harsh chemicals or exposures.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion because I don&#x27;t notice it when it&#x27;s on, but I do when I don&#x27;t use it (skin feels dry).  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , it dries quickly and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> bought while my face was super sensitive during pregnancy.....</li>
            <li> This certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li> only bought this because it said it was oil and alcohol free- as both ingredients cause me to break out, and really irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products claiming to be great for sensitive skin, but those claims don&#x27;t usually hold true</li>
            <li> No oily residue- very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and hydrates my skin well.</li>
            <li> It really solves the oil problem while moisturizing AND providing sun protection.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a fantastic moisturizer, and I finally found it with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it got to me fast and was not busted or dammaged.</li>
            <li> It hurt so much.</li>
            <li> so I need a gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I cannot use any of the normally available commercial moisture creams.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with the very  ultra gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have used this periodically over the years and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I regret this purchase so much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but aside from the burning, I found it very occlusive.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter how much I put on.</li>
            <li> Very soothing</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 5 years and I totally recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I would started to get more acne than I did using the other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Had some special treatments to kill precancer cells and after the aloe vera for several days  </li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wife has pretty sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product it was decent and worked well for my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If Neutrogena decides to go paraben-free, I&#x27;ll probably start using it again, because I don&#x27;t really like the new stuff I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> A decent buy.</li>
            <li> It seemed that Neutrogena is a decent brand.</li>
            <li> Had acne all thru my 20s, it&#x27;s clearing up the older Im getting</li>
            <li> extra step)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I have yet to find a moisturizer like my all-time favorite one (Lancome Visionaire moisturizer).</li>
            <li> Coupled with their liquid soap, this keeps me moist and lovely without being a zitty mess.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> BP is effective but easily made my facial skin dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a little bit thicker and that makes it more moisturizing than the Clinique.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually really expensive in stores $15-20, so Amazon&#x27;s price is actually a great one.  </li>
            <li> Its not thick and greasy like others.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, although I&#x27;m too wary to try it on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have found that is light enough to keep oil sheen away (for a few hours at least- blotting papers are my best friend) as well as not aggravate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liquidy not as thick as I would have liked but gets the job done</li>
            <li> product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day (until I wash my face my again).  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and acne prone and this moisturizer made my skin red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have tried the normal variety with SPF, which I wish I could use every day in the punishing New Mexico sun, but it makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Now my texture is grainy under the chin, and bumpy along the right jaw line; and my skin looks red and irratated.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin smooth without the added fragrance which makes me break out with other products.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two new bottles.</li>
            <li> I sought to find a new moisturizer and came across this product.  </li>
            <li> It feels nearly as good as my expensive one, but it doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin quite as fast.</li>
            <li> Before, I had velvety smooth skin that only received an occasional blemish from menstrual acne.</li>
            <li> At the time, I had a break out on my cheeks but my chin was super dry.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel very soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to, well, basically everything except this.</li>
            <li> but do have sensitive normal skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend a better daily facial lotion, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn at all after facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for ethnic, aging, dry, super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> also use the Neutrogena Clean make-up after applying the lotion and have never had any caking or other problems with make-up application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to expect of this other than a clean moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it feels very sheer and absorbs nicely, so not a bad product, just not for me personally.</li>
            <li> It literally feels watery to the touch and absorbs right into the skin, preventing dry, flakey skin for me after washing my face without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and feel like this moisturizer is a tad on the rich side, so i prefer to use it at night, or a dab anytime on any dry spots, especially around the lips.</li>
            <li> I now have extremely clear skin and</li>
            <li> I selected this product for my sensitive skin oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin helps.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, acne-prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really soft and not oily for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I have combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of moisturizers and face products because I have ridiculously sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> this product works well on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> And on the bottle, it said that for sensitive skin and not clog pores.</li>
            <li> I have soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Within three months, I developed sever acne.</li>
            <li> I really like it, especially for the warmer times.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have oily and acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft too.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just surprised that something that states</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Before trying the Sensitive Skin moisturizer I was using SPF 15 moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this moisture cream because my skin is really sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am 58 years old.</li>
            <li> The lotion makes your face soft without making it feel oily.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s somewhat sensitive.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling moisturized as moisturizers normally do and does not break me out more than i usually do.</li>
            <li> you skin feels soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sensitive and acne prone.</li>
            <li> I would avoid this moisturizer if you have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> After using Oil of Olay sensitive skin for years, I found my skin becoming very dry as I aged.  </li>
            <li> I finally Google the ingredients and found out that it contains Ethylhexyl Palmitate and Isopropyl Isostearate which are highly comedogenic (pore clogging).</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this after washing my face but with just normal pre makeup application or daily use it does not burn.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin consist of very dry chin, normal cheeks, slightly oily forehead and very oily nose!!!</li>
            <li> I had originally planned to use this as a replacement of my former Yes to Cucumber Night Cream because I had hopes of finding something less oily.</li>
            <li> I tried some other products, but I think most of my trouble came from having sensitive</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think I&#x27;ll try something new, and I go back every time.</li>
            <li> The only way to keep it from totally clogging your pores is with very harsh cleansing, which if you bought this product for the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; label, you&#x27;re not going to be able to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am prone to dry, sensitive skin as I get older...</li>
            <li> My nose gets dried up after a shower, so I quickly apply this once I get out</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy, has sunscreen, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very sensitive and this is the only lotion that does not cause itching, redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin due to Rosacea and my skin is also very oily.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking a little shiny for a while but once absorbed</li>
            <li> I generally use</li>
            <li> moisture (obviously) and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is one of the only moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Finally a product for people who are sensitive to perfume, some oils and aloe.</li>
            <li> skin is now red and blotchy from a reaction to the moisturizer itself and it&#x27;s caused a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One of very very few fragrance free products that actually smells like nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting it on when my face is still damp right after a shower hoping it won&#x27;t be as heavy, nah.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my usual moisturizer and needed a quick fix.</li>
            <li> There was not a single sign of moisterization.</li>
            <li> I have 30 years old, white female.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I use this product daily, as well, I mix it with my thick foundation for light sheer summer coverage.</li>
            <li> I also use their face wash which is not harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is really dry sometimes and extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s summer right now where I&#x27;m at, and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and is just the right combination of moisturizing without being thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin was never dry or greasy as long as I used that moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This particular purchase was for a male friend who told me he swears by it and uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, and only need a small pump or two to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with dry, acne-prone skin, and all moisturizers I tried caused me to break out, left my face feeling oily, or would wear-off and would need to be re-applied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Got rid of the red, scaly patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> wash my face with the Neutrogena regular or dry-skin glycerin bars, pat dry, and apply two squirts of this lotion every morning and every night before bed.</li>
            <li> I do microdermabrasion at home and was having trouble finding a sensitive moisturizer that didn&#x27;t make my face tingle, turn red etc afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just use a very small amount and that&#x27;s enough to cover my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and could not live without it!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell or oil, but it&#x27;s really nothing special.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complete shit.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and it absorbs immediately, leaving a good base to apply makeup or just tool around au naturale.</li>
            <li> out extremely well, with all the concepts explained very simply and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> out extremely well, with all the concepts explained very simply and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-mixes well with other products (beauty oils, facial serums,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using Aquaphor just to repair the extreme dryness on my face.</li>
            <li> I go swimming, and the chlorine causes my face to dry up and flare.</li>
            <li> It clogged my pores and dry my skin.</li>
            <li> 1 pump is plenty- apply to face, let dry (5 mins or so) and then apply makeup.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m away and notice my face is feeling wicked dry</li>
            <li> I have oily t-zone and dry cheeks</li>
            <li> you have dry skin, you might like this.  </li>
            <li> My husband has really dry skin on his arms and this quality product helps.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating, sinks right in, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if using it at bedtime and again in the AM is overdoing it... but will def use this product before bed to hopefully prevent dry skin, and keep my face soft and wrinkle-free.  &#x3D;</li>
            <li> It does need a few minutes to really absorb into the skin after applying it though (at least before starting to put on make up or whatever).</li>
            <li> shiny.&lt;br /&gt;you are  aware that it&#x27;s on your face, you feel it at irritating.</li>
            <li> I would try to layer on more but was still left with dry skin. :(</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Only moisturiser that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or mess up my skin (dryness etc.)</li>
            <li> and I are very allergic to sunscreens and it is very hard for a woman to find make-up and face products without the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I dont use it everyday only when I want to wear make up.</li>
            <li> I have to start out by saying that I am really not a fan of Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s littlebit expensive but definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use harsh products such as benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li> It made things much worse and really did not help with moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has a really nasty, cloying smell (like sunscreen).&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t seem to really moisturize, just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought they would tell a blatant lie right on the box, yet they did.</li>
            <li> I typically love Neutrogena products, so I was really disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> and I dont feel the dryness or clogging of pores as it occurs with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I figured I try this one since it is supposed to be lighter than the other one.</li>
            <li> However, after undergoing heavy skin exfoliation treatments, this product can still cause some minor irritation.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than the other products that I have been using that would make me break out or would feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily T-zone and my cheeks are usually dry and tend to get a little flaky.</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful about what I use.  </li>
            <li> I felt like the Clinique moisturizer just stayed on the skin for a few hours and than my cheeks started to feel dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s weighing my face down all day</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you have skin that&#x27;s less prone to breakouts and allergies, this could be a product for you.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes some decent products, but I&#x27;ve been seeing this advertised as alcohol-free all over the place, and I&#x27;m legitimately angry about it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little less</li>
            <li> They were too greasy, too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> but it does feel a little oily.</li>
            <li> I am not familiar with the brand here.</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad breakout while using this Sensitive Skin variety of the daily</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product is too heavy for day time use.</li>
            <li> One of few that don&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> so I tried it a few days in a row.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s heavy, greasy and makes my face itch.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and acne-prone, and everything else I&#x27;ve tried has failed.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, it felt like my skin was burning for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This lotion dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I know it is here ahead of time for less!</li>
            <li> I used to use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel, but decided to try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> Usually lotions will cause me to break out in a purple patchy rash around my mouth, but this doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using it past 1 month on my face</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my skin breakout, but they were all those gigantic, blind pimples.</li>
            <li> Three days after starting Accutane, I ran out of my expensive moisturizer ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and i have crazy sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it was from that</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, rosacea skin and this product burns like crazy when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for at least the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We have a hard time finding it in the stores so getting it here is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed to make it a little worse.  </li>
            <li> have used Aveno (aggravated my skin), Cetaphil (too heavy for my oily skin), Eucerin (recommended by my dermatologist- too heavy), and Clinique Redness solutions (worked well but too expensive for every day use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wife says it works, and hasn&#x27;t complained to me, so I say its a winner.</li>
            <li> I was forced to change another brand.</li>
            <li> If u have acne and an oily face, that doesn&#x27;t mean u dont need hydration.</li>
            <li> After using it for about a week (with rather unpleasant results) I finally read the label.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked to find my skin red and blotchy almost immediately after application.</li>
            <li> I mean, I have all the skin problems!</li>
            <li> But advertising it as alcohol-free is really frustrating for those of us who can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> seems to make the situation worse.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t give me any negative or uncomfortable reaction at all.</li>
            <li> I have dried out my skin real bad trying to be completely dry skin</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to apply make up over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to have horrible acne and this was the only moisturizer that helped me get through it.</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG, after applying it to my face</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any irritating fragrances!</li>
            <li> Keep ya head up, I know acne is tuff and can be depressing</li>
            <li> The painful ones with no head, so that they take forever to go away and are impossible to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for use on my face which has really bad Rosacea.</li>
            <li> and I broke out on my chin so bad.</li>
            <li> I am not saying this is a bad product, I am just saying don&#x27;t replace your daytime moisturizer just yet.</li>
            <li> Too painful to use.</li>
            <li> Then tragic thing happened.</li>
            <li> disappointed in this product....</li>
            <li> No wonder I broke out from it! :(</li>
            <li> I have hated it since day one.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it but it does feel a little oily. No skin irritation though</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my skin, so won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to keep my face moisturized. My nose gets dried up after a shower, so I quickly apply this once I get out and everything has been smooth sailing ever since. Great product!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she had to stop using it because it broke her face out. And she had flawless skin.</li>
            <li> Love it as an aftershave and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I selected this product for my sensitive skin oily skin.  I have been using Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for one month. I just ordered two new bottles. This product does not clog my pores. I have noticed a great improvement in the clearing up of whiteheads and shrinking my pores. I use this product morning and night. I also use the Neutrogena Cleansing Cream. Excellent product for what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products.  Have extremely sensitive skin so I have to be very careful about what I use.  This did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> only lotion that doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that seems to be becoming more and more sensitive as time goes on. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products claiming to be great for sensitive skin, but those claims don&#x27;t usually hold true (they either make me break out or itchy or have scents, etc. in them that are irritating....or are for more mature skin) but this stuff does! It moisturizes without being greasy or causing irritation. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it. Usually lotions will cause me to break out in a purple patchy rash around my mouth, but this doesn&#x27;t at all. It does need a few minutes to really absorb into the skin after applying it though (at least before starting to put on make up or whatever). Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I typically love Neutrogena products, so I was really disappointed in this. My biggest issues are:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s kind of watery, yet leaves your face looking/feeling very greasy. Almost like applying sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a really nasty, cloying smell (like sunscreen).&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t seem to really moisturize, just sits on top of your skin. This makes it difficult to apply make up over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use Clinique dramatically different lotion, and I LOVE it. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> An excellent moisturizer, I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was good, did not cause any acne, provides a somewhat dewy finish.  Not the best texture and perhaps alittle bit liquid like.  A decent buy.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and have been using this stuff for many years now.  It&#x27;s usually really expensive in stores $15-20, so Amazon&#x27;s price is actually a great one.  I like the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; version (no sunblock included), because it&#x27;s so incredibly light-weight and non-greasy.  It literally feels watery to the touch and absorbs right into the skin, preventing dry, flakey skin for me after washing my face without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this lotion.  I wanted soemthing to add under my makeup in the winter that would add extra moisture without feeling greasy.  This absorbs right in &amp; does not leave my face shiny.  Very happy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this on Amazon, but have purchased at Wal-Mart and my local grocery store for about $7-$8... I wanted to write a review because I have been using this moisturizer off and on for several yrs (I&#x27;m trying to get better at having a more regular moisturizing routine since turning 36).  I am prone to dry, sensitive skin as I get older... I used to have oily, acne prone skin as a teenager, but that all changed about 10 yrs ago.  This product makes my skin feel very soft and refreshed.  I used this last night after using a Neutrogena scrub, and again this morning.  My face feels so soft, I can&#x27;t stop touching it!!  Not sure if using it at bedtime and again in the AM is overdoing it... but will def use this product before bed to hopefully prevent dry skin, and keep my face soft and wrinkle-free.  &#x3D;+)</li>
            <li> No oily residue- very lightweight. Need to massage a bit to get it to absorb but it feels very good and light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about the lotion I use for my face.  I can&#x27;t stand to have my face feel dirty/oily.  This is my favorite lotion because I don&#x27;t notice it when it&#x27;s on, but I do when I don&#x27;t use it (skin feels dry).  I use it every morning.  Great product.</li>
            <li> got my product on time no trouble...will order again</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is beyond perfect. It is light, oil free, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores!</li>
            <li> Excellent for oily skin types - extremely light and non-greasy, it works great!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. I love this lotion. Its not thick and greasy like others. Dries fast and hydrates my skin well.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product is too heavy for day time use. It makes my skin look shiny and does not allow my mineral powder to be applied evenly as it sticks to the lotion making the powder look cakey (I wait about 20-30 minutes after applying moisturizer). This product works fantastically as a night \\&quot;cream\\&quot; especially in the winter months. For day time I would recommend Ideal Image matte moisturizer with SPF 30. It really solves the oil problem while moisturizing AND providing sun protection. Also, the list price for this Neutrogena product is not $19.99...there is not one store I could find online or otherwise selling it at that price so don&#x27;t be fooled by the supposed discount % advertised.</li>
            <li> Nice and light on my face! I don&#x27;t have that greasy  feeling. I have acne and I like that this moisturizer works without causing more pimples!</li>
            <li> No surprises here. Exactly what you would find at the drugstore and saved me time. I love this lotion and works great with mixing other products (retinol cream, vitamin d, etc)</li>
            <li> Excellent for combination/acne prone skin. I have fair skin that&#x27;s very sensitive and this is the only lotion that does not cause itching, redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been using it past 1 month on my face and I dont feel the dryness or clogging of pores as it occurs with other moisturizers. I did not find the neutrogena moisturizing cream on amazon or other stores but this can be a good substitute.</li>
            <li> Very light. One of few that don&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item seeing as it locked in two key points I needed in my moisturizer: moisture (obviously) and sensitive skin. I tried this product once on my face in the morning and I was shocked to find my skin red and blotchy almost immediately after application. This is a return for me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is advertised as being \\&quot;free of drying alcohol.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;...yet alcohol is listed among the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only bought this because it said it was oil and alcohol free- as both ingredients cause me to break out, and really irritate my skin. After using it for about a week (with rather unpleasant results) I finally read the label. Neutrogena makes some decent products, but I&#x27;ve been seeing this advertised as alcohol-free all over the place, and I&#x27;m legitimately angry about it. What a load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people can use moisturizers with alcohol and have no problems, so I understand that this may work fine for some people. But advertising it as alcohol-free is really frustrating for those of us who can&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t have thought they would tell a blatant lie right on the box, yet they did. Change the product description please!</li>
            <li> Works really nicely.  It does not make your face oily at all but give enough moisture where it feels really nice.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible! Not only did it make my skin breakout, but they were all those gigantic, blind pimples. The painful ones with no head, so that they take forever to go away and are impossible to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product ingredients, which I just finally got to check out now (they aren&#x27;t listed on the bottle, just on the box that comes with the bottle) include dimethicone.  This is the stuff known for being non-water soluble, which causes it to just sit on the skin and build up instead of ever washing off.  The only way to keep it from totally clogging your pores is with very harsh cleansing, which if you bought this product for the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; label, you&#x27;re not going to be able to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have skin that&#x27;s less prone to breakouts and allergies, this could be a product for you. For me though, it wasn&#x27;t such a nice experience.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all. Works great before I put on my make up.</li>
            <li> Great cream. It moisturizes, and it cools my rosacea. I love it. I go swimming, and the chlorine causes my face to dry up and flare. Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin helps.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, has sunscreen, and absorbs quickly. I love the scent, too - reminds me of a day at the beach!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 months I dont use it everyday only when I want to wear make up.I get the occasional zit here and there.I was looking for something that would soak in and not feel gressy this made me feel greasy I could&#x27;nt wait to get it off at night when I wash it off it&#x27;s like my skin could finally breath.It might work well with dryer sking types I will not be buying this agin I think it works well for people like my sister in-law(she uses it)that have no acne but do have sensitive normal skin.Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have to start out by saying that I am really not a fan of Neutrogena products. This is one of the exceptions. Three days after starting Accutane, I ran out of my expensive moisturizer ([[ASIN:B003T4OL72 Physiodermie - Oily Skin Cream - 50ml]]) and had to run to the drugstore to buy moisturizer. I had a meltdown because they didn&#x27;t have Olay in stock and bought Aveeno, Cetaphil, and this. This is the best, by a long shot. It feels nearly as good as my expensive one, but it doesn&#x27;t sink into the skin quite as fast. The only downside is the smell, which is of clay. I don&#x27;t mind it, since that proves it is fragrance free-- I just wish it was a little less strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite drugstore moisturizer is still [[ASIN:B00008ZPG9 Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]], but I would definitely repurchase this neutrogena moisturizer!</li>
            <li> What a great book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laid out extremely well, with all the concepts explained very simply and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick read of this book will yield great benefits in saving you time and helping you prioritise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A \\&quot;must\\&quot; for your business book collection.</li>
            <li> What a great book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laid out extremely well, with all the concepts explained very simply and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick read of this book will yield great benefits in saving you time and helping you prioritise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A \\&quot;must\\&quot; for your business book collection.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It is one of the only moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it in Amazon I bought it is &amp;#34;CVC pharmacy&amp;#34; however I don&#x27;t think this is oil-free ,makes my face looks oily every time I used my hubby well say that my skin looks oily , &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the product that is cussing me breakouts ... I don&#x27;t like and I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with dry, acne-prone skin, and all moisturizers I tried caused me to break out, left my face feeling oily, or would wear-off and would need to be re-applied throughout the day. This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day (until I wash my face my again).  I use this product twice a day (morning and night) after I wash my face, and I love it!  If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have numerous skin challenges. Seborriec dermatitis and rosacea to name two.  This is wonderful!  Non irritating, sinks right in, not greasy.  Make up goes on nicely over the top. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Only moisturiser that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or mess up my skin (dryness etc.) Been using it for over 25 years. Sometimes I think I&#x27;ll try something new, and I go back every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Never breaks me out or clogs my pores. So glad to see it offered through Amazon at such a great price!</li>
            <li> After using Oil of Olay sensitive skin for years, I found my skin becoming very dry as I aged.  I sought to find a new moisturizer and came across this product.  Honestly,  it works great, non greasy, all day moisturizing for your face with just one small application in the morning before going to work.  I recommend this product for ethnic, aging, dry, super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I really loved this. It didnt make me break out or anything and i have crazy sensitive skin thanks</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. My wife uses it for years.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, although I&#x27;m too wary to try it on my acne prone skin. Leaves no residue and no oily feeling while sufficiently ending dryness.</li>
            <li> same product I&#x27;ve always used; however, I was hoping to find a better price, but no luck even on this site</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works great.  It was perfect for my sensitive skin and got rid of all the dry skin within a couple of days of use.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Used it for years....great for my teenagers, too.  No sunscreen and no fragrance!  The Best.  Recommended by my dermatologist, too!</li>
            <li> use this every day! (for 30 years) amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> This is NOT an oil-free moisturizer. I would never buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel-cream</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, acne-prone, sensitive skin. I mean, I have all the skin problems! I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a fantastic moisturizer, and I finally found it with Neutrogena. This moisturizer is light, water-based, and absorbs in your skin completely. It&#x27;s so smooth! It&#x27;s summer right now where I&#x27;m at, and a small amount goes a long way. I still have to test it out in winter, but it&#x27;s my favorite moisturizer so far!</li>
            <li> it burns my eyes, my yes seem to tear.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s only good for night as it makes your face very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;you are  aware that it&#x27;s on your face, you feel it at irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe 3-4 other kinds but am quite happy with this.  I like this one better than the one with sunscreen in it because it feels the most oil free and lightweight.  The others are not bad though, but you can certainly feel the difference.  Will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This was really good. Really soft and not oily for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this is a great light moisturizer for everyday use.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> WAY too many parabens----why??????</li>
            <li> great way to buy this...delivered every three months</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I use it on my face right before bedtime and in the morning my skin feels so smooth and well hydrated. I have combination and sensitive skin. This product does not irritate my skin at all. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I keep this on the sink to add moisture after every face wash. It&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have perfume, it&#x27;s smooth as silk and light. I have dry skin and it absorbs immediately, leaving a good base to apply makeup or just tool around au naturale.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of moisturizers and face products because I have ridiculously sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  This moisturizer is light as air.  I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s weighing my face down all day, it dries quickly and my skin feels so soft.  Best of all, it hasn&#x27;t caused any new breakouts!</li>
            <li> Although this states it is an oil free moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it. It is a good moisturizer but it leaves a slight &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling on your skin. For a long time I was able to get a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; oil-free moisturizer from Avon but they stopped selling it. The Avon moisturizer was light from the jar and went on smoothly and left no greasy feeling whatsoever. My skin was never dry or greasy as long as I used that moisturizer. I have not been able to find another like it. Guess my search is back on!</li>
            <li> works well not greasy</li>
            <li> this product works well on my sensitive face. As soon as I put it on, my face immediately feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> it got to me fast and was not busted or dammaged. Works great, i would most for sure buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local store. After I came to the U.S. several months later, my formal facial cream was used up. I was forced to change another brand. I am not familiar with the brand here. I saw the ads on TV. It seemed that Neutrogena is a decent brand. And on the bottle, it said that for sensitive skin and not clog pores. So I decided to try this one. I have soft and sensitive skin. My friends used to say that my skin is like baby&#x27;s. When I put this product on my face, it was kind of oily and not get absorbed into the skin. There was not a single sign of moisterization. I thought that maybe I needed sometime to adjust to it, so I kept trying this on my face!! Then tragic thing happened. Within three months, I developed sever acne. It clogged my pores and dry my skin. Acne was out of control. When I put benzoyl peroxide(BP) on my face to treat acne, it burned the skin on my neck like hell. It hurt so much. BP is effective but easily made my facial skin dry and tight. One simple decision made a big mistake. Another thing is, I will never forgot this event because Neutrogena left permanent scar on the 50 percent area of my face!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have rosacea.  It seemed to make it a little worse.  My daughter put it on and her face broke out requiring steroid cream but I&#x27;m not sure if it was from that or she had an allergic reaction to a food.  Either way, I&#x27;m hesistant to continue use of it.</li>
            <li> It works great at moisturizing oily skin with out causing break outs, which is hard to find as I have discovered</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is perfect for the summer, very light and has SPF for sun screen protection.</li>
            <li> Best face lotion. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and I use it exclusively in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I recently started moisturizing my face and this product is great. Wish they had a bigger bottle b/c i go through one of these every 2 months or so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s littlebit expensive but definitely worth every penny. Especially for oily skin, when you don&#x27;t want to use moisturizer just because it makes skin oilier. This is a great solution for your problem</li>
            <li> I have 30 years old, white female. Had acne all thru my 20s, it&#x27;s clearing up the older Im getting but this moisturizer has been a LIFE saver. I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked. They were too greasy, too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight. Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since. I use before my makeup every morning. 1 pump is plenty- apply to face, let dry (5 mins or so) and then apply makeup. I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer, but this would work fine too! So happy with this. No break outs, leaves my skin feeling wonderful and just enough moisture to NOT be oily! Deff reccommend this as a try! : )</li>
            <li> This did not work for me although it seems no matter how many Neutrogena products I try none seem to agree with my very sensitive and picky skin, it&#x27;s just something in their formula I guess, I gave this to my daughter however who uses it with great success and enjoys it just fine. I know from trying it myself it feels very sheer and absorbs nicely, so not a bad product, just not for me personally.</li>
            <li> We have used this product forever, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Very good cream, not sticky and leaves you a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer and use it every day as do my teenage daughters, great product that does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product it does everything it claims and does not clog my pores or irritate my skin, Finally found a product this works!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for people that cannot use oily lotions on their face.</li>
            <li> I get this for my wife; she won&#x27;t use any other kind of lotion for her face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a hard time finding it in the stores so getting it here is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has pretty sensitive skin and eyes but this stuff is very mild but very effective.</li>
            <li> I really like it, especially for the warmer times. For reference, I have oily and acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-moisturizes fairly well&lt;br /&gt;-dries matte (and keeps me from being shiny for about 4-5 hours if I only have this moisturizer on)&lt;br /&gt;-affordable&lt;br /&gt;-mixes well with other products (beauty oils, facial serums, sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-no SPF (personally, I find putting on sunscreen can be a laborious extra step)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I have yet to find a moisturizer like my all-time favorite one (Lancome Visionaire moisturizer). I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Finally a product for people who are sensitive to perfume, some oils and aloe.</li>
            <li> This feels very nice on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products to moisturize.  This is the BEST!!  It feels light when you put it on, and keeps my face soft all day.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face.  I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay.  I have always used a moisturizer after shaving, it does a far better job of soothing the skin than&lt;br /&gt;alcohol based products P.S. after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it.... I won&#x27;t make this mistake again of ordering this... Shame of them...</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to, well, basically everything except this. I used to use Proactiv, but the moisturizer turned my skin bright red. Then, I switched over the Clean &amp; Clear, but that made my skin oily. I tried some other products, but I think most of my trouble came from having sensitive, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to have struck the ideal balance. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy anymore and it sure isn&#x27;t turning bright red. It makes my skin feel really soft too. I have to force myself to not touch my face because of it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Very light on your face, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it after showering and before I apply my makeup. It absorbs quickly and mosturizes well without leaving greasy feeling</li>
            <li> This the absolute best moisturizer I have and will always use...its light but it works all day...I have used this product for more than 5 years and I totally recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and it&#x27;s the only one I use.</li>
            <li> I used to have horrible acne and this was the only moisturizer that helped me get through it. I now have extremely clear skin and this lotion NEVER makes me break out and works well with my combination skin. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s go to moisturizer as he has combination skin.  Neutragena is one of the most trusted brands of skincare out there.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning. Absorbs well, not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> Great face lotion for sensitive, acne prone skin.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin. I use harsh products such as benzoyl peroxide so I need a gentle moisturizer. I can&#x27;t use this. I put it on and my face turned red and it burned. I thought maybe it was just from something else so I tried it a few days in a row. Same thing. Too painful to use. Update... If I don&#x27;t use this after washing my face but with just normal pre makeup application or daily use it does not burn. I have this tucked in a backpack for emergencies. This is not my go to facial lotion but if I&#x27;m away and notice my face is feeling wicked dry I can put some of this on now without an issue. I&#x27;m just surprised that something that states it&#x27;s for sensitive skin seems to make the situation worse.</li>
            <li> Works great on my very dry, sensitive skin. Got rid of the red, scaly patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Before trying the Sensitive Skin moisturizer I was using SPF 15 moisturizer. Since my face tends to get more shiny and oily as the day goes on I figured I try this one since it is supposed to be lighter than the other one. I WAS WRONG, after applying it to my face it felt too light. My face wouldn&#x27;t even feel moisturized unlike the SPF 15. I would started to get more acne than I did using the other moisturizer. I generally use Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Wash followed my a toner and moisturizer if anyone was wondering. Do not buy unless you want a really really really light moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena products for years and have found this moisturizer to be the best for my sensitive skin. I have tried the normal variety with SPF, which I wish I could use every day in the punishing New Mexico sun, but it makes me break out. I have never had a bad breakout while using this Sensitive Skin variety of the daily moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with the Neutrogena regular or dry-skin glycerin bars, pat dry, and apply two squirts of this lotion every morning and every night before bed. Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Neutrogena Clean make-up after applying the lotion and have never had any caking or other problems with make-up application.</li>
            <li> A light lotion that does well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for oily teen skin. It is so lightweight and u cant even see visible shine unless of course u over apply. If u have acne and an oily face, that doesn&#x27;t mean u dont need hydration. I have dried out my skin real bad trying to be completely dry skin but I over did it and ur face will flake and turn darker. I recommend Neutrogena Daily Scrub and Skinceuticals oil-free SPF 20 if u have oily skin. Try a benzoyl peroxide gel with 5% or 10% if ur acne persists.  And please drink lots of water and wear a facial sunscreen . If u have oily skin stay away from alcohol products like Cetaphil. Good luck dont give up  . I also would recommend a peel like Dr Dennis Gross. Keep ya head up, I know acne is tuff and can be depressing but you will get over it if you have patience and find a good regimen.</li>
            <li> I use this moisture cream because my skin is really sensitive.  I cannot use any of the normally available commercial moisture creams.  So thank goodness Neutrogena has this product.  Hope they never discontinue it.  I also use their face wash which is not harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out when I used it</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old. People tell me I look like I am in my 40&#x27;s. I use this along with the very  ultra gentle cleanser. No breakouts, moisture and seems to lesson the lines to where you don&#x27;t look in the mirror anymore and go ugh! How about that for this price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to expect of this other than a clean moisturizer. It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad smell or oil, but it&#x27;s really nothing special. I would probably look for something cheaper next time.</li>
            <li> I love this sensitive skin moisturizer. It is great! Doesn&#x27;t clog pores! Makes your skin silky and smooth! :) I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.  Does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> The best! Moisturizer</li>
            <li> bought while my face was super sensitive during pregnancy.....worked great for my skin and the irritation slowly went away.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FOR EVERDAY USE</li>
            <li> great product, I love the way it moistures my skin, I definitely recommend it to those who have problematic skin</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin smooth without the added fragrance which makes me break out with other products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; even though I am 82, I have problem skin and it is the only kind of moisturizer I can use.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, does not make me break out</li>
            <li> I used this for years but stopped recently because I started worrying about parabens. If Neutrogena decides to go paraben-free, I&#x27;ll probably start using it again, because I don&#x27;t really like the new stuff I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers, but this is the best. It has no yucky smell and absorbs comfortably in my skin without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and feel like this moisturizer is a tad on the rich side, so i prefer to use it at night, or a dab anytime on any dry spots, especially around the lips. However, after undergoing heavy skin exfoliation treatments, this product can still cause some minor irritation. Even so, it is very useful for general use and i will probably purchase it again, i feel like i got a good volume of good product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use on my face which has really bad Rosacea. It made things much worse and really did not help with moisture.</li>
            <li> I have used this periodically over the years and really like it.  This particular purchase was for a male friend who told me he swears by it and uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> What a God send product.  I buy the Neutrogena make-up for sensive skin.  My brother  and I are very allergic to sunscreens and it is very hard for a woman to find make-up and face products without the sunscreen.  Thank you for this.  The lotion makes your face soft without making it feel oily.  Plus, great for being on a budget.  We all need face maintaining products.</li>
            <li> If I could make it 0 stars, I would. I&#x27;m happy it works for some people, but this moisturizer DRIED out my skin and I broke out on my chin so bad. My face wash has never done that to me.  I ran out of my usual moisturizer and needed a quick fix. I regret this purchase so much. I&#x27;m currently using Aquaphor just to repair the extreme dryness on my face. I would never recommend this to anyone, but people swear by it. This is proof that everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  It moisturizes well without adding unwanted oil to your skin and helps retain moisture to keep your skin looking great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, alcohol free</li>
            <li> Terrif, the same as the triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner. I like it and my husband loves it. Makes him act 25 years younger!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for at least the past 5 years.  Every time I try to switch, my skin hates me and I always end up buying this product again anyway.  It&#x27;s relatively cheap, it&#x27;s light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all shiny.  I&#x27;m a 21-year-old college student with rosacea, but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t sting my skin or make it feel greasy.  I wake up and my skin is super soft!  I absolutely love this stuff, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have oily t-zone and dry cheeks and this product is too light for my combination skin. It absorbs very fast in the skin and doesn&#x27;t moisturize well at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of moisturizer with SPF included. I know it&#x27;s important to wear that when you&#x27;re going to be in the sun, but I live in Seattle, and I&#x27;m in an office building most of the day, so I don&#x27;t need SPF all the time. So, for the most part, I just want an oil-free moisturizer, fragrance free, that&#x27;s more lightweight than an SPF lotion. This certainly does the trick. It also works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and feels good on your skin. I use this in the morning before I apply makeup and at night right before I go to bed. It absorbs quickly and does not clog pores. It works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, rosacea skin and this product burns like crazy when I put it on.  I really wanted to like this, but aside from the burning, I found it very occlusive.  It just sits on your skin and it feels like you have a mask on.  It didn&#x27;t matter how much I put on. It later broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, you might like this.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily, as well, I mix it with my thick foundation for light sheer summer coverage. I have dry sensitive skin so this product has been perfect for me. I can&#x27;t recommend a better daily facial lotion, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Had some special treatments to kill precancer cells and after the aloe vera for several days  this was great!  Very soothing</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer. It is great for dry, sensitive skin. I use it daily and could not live without it!</li>
            <li> what can I say it is Neutrogena  A+  :)</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift - grand daughter will use no other</li>
            <li> Mom loves this and it does make her face feel nice and hydrated. Not greasy and easily absorbed. Nice size, good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and have used this for years after switching from Oil of Olay during my twenties.  It&#x27;s light yet does the job.  Not greasy, and only need a small pump or two to cover my whole face.  Not greasy and disappears quickly into my skin.  Keeps my face from drying out with our island tradewinds which are constantly blowing.</li>
            <li> Liquidy not as thick as I would have liked but gets the job done</li>
            <li> I tried this product out for a couple months and my conclusion is: 2/5. My skin is pretty fair and is pretty sensitive to any harsh chemicals or exposures. This only left my skin drier after putting it on. I would try to layer on more but was still left with dry skin. :( I&#x27;m not saying that this product won&#x27;t work for anyone, but for me personally it did nothing. Just my two cents.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and acne prone and this moisturizer made my skin red and itchy. It also aggravated my acne and clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and my face has become a disaster zone.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now red and blotchy from a reaction to the moisturizer itself and it&#x27;s caused a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. It&#x27;s complete shit.</li>
            <li> Love this product, not too heavy or oily. Gives my skin the drink it needs after a shower!</li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena, light and very good to my skin.</li>
            <li> OMG! This is the best oil free mousturizing face cream i have ever tried!!!. It Works ideally for my oily greasy face... I love it.. I use it before make up, or during the day, and at night, it really does as promised!its great!</li>
            <li> I usually use Mary Kay moisturizer which I am usually happy with but not all the time. Well in a money pinch and needing some moisturizer I bought this Neutrogena. I have hated it since day one. That was last winter. Not sure why I keep using it. I guess it&#x27;s all I have right now and keep forgetting to buy something else. For me it&#x27;s heavy, greasy and makes my face itch. I&#x27;ve tried putting it on when my face is still damp right after a shower hoping it won&#x27;t be as heavy, nah. Tried wetting my hand then applying then it don&#x27;t work at all. Will be looking for something different.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best on sensitive, acne-prone skin with ezcema. :) plus it&#x27;s affordable</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin due to Rosacea and my skin is also very oily. This is the only lotion I have found that is light enough to keep oil sheen away (for a few hours at least- blotting papers are my best friend) as well as not aggravate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Aveno (aggravated my skin), Cetaphil (too heavy for my oily skin), Eucerin (recommended by my dermatologist- too heavy), and Clinique Redness solutions (worked well but too expensive for every day use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has by far been the best for my skin in terms of daily use and price.</li>
            <li> Nice and light.  Isn&#x27;t greasy and does not make my face break out.  Way cheaper than the other products that I have been using that would make me break out or would feel greasy.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 with combo/acne prone skin that&#x27;s somewhat sensitive. I used to use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel, but decided to try something less expensive. The Clinique moisturizer has a more runny consistency than this moisturizer and glided on the skin more easily. This moisturizer is a little bit thicker and that makes it more moisturizing than the Clinique. I felt like the Clinique moisturizer just stayed on the skin for a few hours and than my cheeks started to feel dry and I&#x27;d feel like I needed to reapply it again. I don&#x27;t have to to reapply with this one. My skin still feels moisturized hours later. This moisturizer has a lightweight feel and that&#x27;s key for me because I have oily skin. I just use a very small amount and that&#x27;s enough to cover my whole face and neck. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy at all. I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts with this moisturizer either. I have an oily T-zone and my cheeks are usually dry and tend to get a little flaky. The Clinique moisturizer didn&#x27;t do anything for the flakiness on my cheeks. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin perfectly and I no longer have flakiness on my cheeks. One day I washed my face and decided not to use this moisturizer to see how my face would feel. I immediately noticed the difference. This moisturizer fits my budget and my skin loves it. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> But, I prefer cream to lotion.  However, I need to do more research to find a worthwhile cream for sensitive skin that is affordable.</li>
            <li> Always use this, but with subscribe &amp; save I know it is here ahead of time for less!</li>
            <li> I had originally planned to use this as a replacement of my former Yes to Cucumber Night Cream because I had hopes of finding something less oily. When I first started using this product it was decent and worked well for my highly sensitive skin. However, when I started using this in place of my using Olay day moisturizer it backfired. Before, I had velvety smooth skin that only received an occasional blemish from menstrual acne. Now my texture is grainy under the chin, and bumpy along the right jaw line; and my skin looks red and irratated. I am not saying this is a bad product, I am just saying don&#x27;t replace your daytime moisturizer just yet.</li>
            <li> My skin is really dry sometimes and extremely sensitive. This product left my skin feeling moisturized as moisturizers normally do and does not break me out more than i usually do. This doesn&#x27;t have spf but i don&#x27;t mind because i use another sunscreen in the morning and whenever i&#x27;m going out. I always try to take this with me to reapply because i love it so much! I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any irritating fragrances!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those on HCG</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Lasts all day. Fragrance free. All good for healthy skin care.  Leaves my skin looking a little shiny for a while but once absorbed you skin feels soft and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> there are chemicals in this product known to clog pores!  do your research first.  if your sensitivity involves acne, DO NOT Buy this one.  i ended up with the combination formula instead</li>
            <li> My husband has really dry skin on his arms and this quality product helps.  Now, I just have to get him to use it daily.</li>
            <li> love this stuff ! It leaves my skin feeling fresh with no greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin consist of very dry chin, normal cheeks, slightly oily forehead and very oily nose!!! and it&#x27;s sensitive and acne prone. I also have hyper pigmentation around my mouth. At the time, I had a break out on my cheeks but my chin was super dry. So, I grabbed this at target without reading any review of this beforehand. Without any prejudice, I put it on my skin at night and the day after I was surprised how soft, even and nice my skin was looking. It basically moisturized and evened my chin&#x27;s tone, reduced the redness and inflammation on my cheeks and made my skin look healthy in general. I&#x27;ll recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion.  I have somewhat dry skin and very sensitive.  I can never use lotion with dyes, perfumes or sunscreen.  This is by far the best and light weight lotion out there.</li>
            <li> Wife says it works, and hasn&#x27;t complained to me, so I say its a winner.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my mom.  Geez, they make a lot of different kids of Neutrogena creams....  Amazon had the specific one my mom wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I can use on my face. My skin is extremely sensitive and acne-prone, and everything else I&#x27;ve tried has failed. This lotion doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and is just the right combination of moisturizing without being thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn at all after facial treatments. I do microdermabrasion at home and was having trouble finding a sensitive moisturizer that didn&#x27;t make my face tingle, turn red etc afterwards. This doesn&#x27;t give me any negative or uncomfortable reaction at all.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> can u tell me where i can find it?&lt;br /&gt;most of the product should have the using date.&lt;br /&gt;why i can&#x27;t find it???</li>
            <li> Excellent product, will  continue to use and highly recommend for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> for oily skin is perfect</li>
            <li> I was happy to see it is for sensitive skin and oil free, but once you put it on, it feels like nothing!  skin is as it was before applying....no difference.  disappointed in this product....just didn&#x27;t pay to return it.</li>
            <li> Coupled with their liquid soap, this keeps me moist and lovely without being a zitty mess. I&#x27;ve been buying it for over 10 years and won&#x27;t change. One of very very few fragrance free products that actually smells like nothing.</li>
            <li> I would avoid this moisturizer if you have sensitive acne prone skin. I purchased this at my local Walgreens. When I put it on, it felt like my skin was burning for a few minutes. This lotion dried my skin out. Oh, it made my skin shiny and greasy looking. Very disappointed in this moisturizer. I finally Google the ingredients and found out that it contains Ethylhexyl Palmitate and Isopropyl Isostearate which are highly comedogenic (pore clogging). No wonder I broke out from it! :(</li>
