            <li>color super bright and great for summer time.</li>
            <li>but looks really nice and</li>
            <li>, so it takes more than 2 coats to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>One coat isn&#x27;t enought to cover and doesnt look bright, but after you apply the second coat it is the perfect summer orange!</li>
            <li>I was also pleased that the polish stayed beautiful for a full 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Very bold!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this color!</li>
            <li>Really glows bright!</li>
            <li>Two coats is plenty for nice coverage and then let the fun begin!!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely color</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments when wearing this color.</li>
            <li>More orange than it shows in picture</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the color.  </li>
            <li>my favorite nail color for this summer.&lt;br /&gt;its NEON orange.</li>
            <li>Got many compliments :).</li>
            <li>100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love gel nails</li>
            <li>My all-time favorite gel color.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy shipping!</li>
            <li>I added a coat of foundation gel to help keep them strong and from chipping while away.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely beautiful and I will definitely be using it again soon!</li>
            <li>Application, wear and removal were fine.</li>
            <li>It is a great big bottle too.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great color, but the color swatch next to this image makes it look like it has a rosy coral or pink-ish tint when it is in fact NEON orange -- like construction-worker vest orange.</li>
            <li>Fun summer color that will brighten your day!  </li>
            <li>I got so many compliments when I wore this color out trying out Gelish polish for the first time.</li>
            <li>From the image, I thought it would be more tiger lily-ish, but I love it all the same!</li>
            <li>Color loved by young and old....</li>
            <li>Some lights it looked neon orange, other lights it wasn&#x27;t as bright.  </li>
            <li>Pretty for Summer.</li>
            <li>product seems to be fresh and new.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I didn&#x27;t rate it very high.</li>
            <li>This is very orange.  </li>
            <li>Just received this nail polish yesterday, it covers very well with two coats.</li>
            <li>It looks different in every light.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more orange as I had bought it for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>Great color, but very thin consistency</li>
            <li>I have talked to others who have had the same issue with this particular color.  </li>
            <li>I suggest 3 or more coats, for mine polish was really thin.  </li>

            <li> i usually do neons only for summer, but hey, if you like neon all year round, this one is super neon.</li>
            <li> This is a very strange color.  </li>
            <li> The picture online makes the color look like a pink, but its a neon orange.</li>
            <li> This color is not a pretty color pink, but instead neon orange.</li>
            <li> I look forward to wearing this color this summer and using it with other brights.</li>
            <li> a neon pale orange/peach.  </li>
            <li> It is nothing against Gelish but out of all the colors I&#x27;ve bought this was the only one that disappointed me.</li>
            <li> ( I did not try a white base under it.)</li>
            <li> It is safety cone orange NOT coral :(</li>

            <li> Love this color! Pretty for Summer. Application of two color coats works best for a bright color. Really glows bright!</li>
            <li> This is very orange.  If you&#x27;re looking for detour cone colored nails, this is for you!  I like it on my toes.</li>
            <li> This color is as described.  One coat isn&#x27;t enought to cover and doesnt look bright, but after you apply the second coat it is the perfect summer orange! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Color loved by young and old....product seems to be fresh and new. Likeed how it was sent protected in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Great color, but very thin consistency, so it takes more than 2 coats to get good coverage. Consequently, I didn&#x27;t rate it very high. But my clients do love the color!</li>

            <li> Very bright and I love the color.  Got a lot of compliments with this color.  Quick and easy shipping! Thank you.</li>
            <li> my favorite nail color for this summer.&lt;br /&gt;its NEON orange. the picture doesnt do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;i loved it for this summer. i usually do neons only for summer, but hey, if you like neon all year round, this one is super neon.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous bright color, especially nice for summer. It makes you look tanned even if you aren&#x27;t. It is a great big bottle too. This was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was looking for a NEON orange. Well, that is NOT what I got. ( I did not try a white base under it.) I have talked to others who have had the same issue with this particular color.  Application, wear and removal were fine.</li>
            <li> I used this polish recently and received lots of compliments on the color. I was also pleased that the polish stayed beautiful for a full 2 weeks. I removed it because my nails were growing longer. The polish was still perfect no chips or wearing off on the tips. I have been using gelish polish for 8 months now and noticed my nails are actually stronger and longer.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great color, but the color swatch next to this image makes it look like it has a rosy coral or pink-ish tint when it is in fact NEON orange -- like construction-worker vest orange. Just bear that in mind if you buy the color.</li>
            <li> Awesome! color super bright and great for summer time. Got many compliments :). 100% satisfied.  I love gel nails yay</li>
            <li> This is a very strange color.  It is almost a neon pale orange/peach.  It looks different in every light.  I wish it was a little more orange as I had bought it for Halloween.  We did go to glow in the dark golfing and it was wild!  I goes on well and stays put.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color. It is nothing against Gelish but out of all the colors I&#x27;ve bought this was the only one that disappointed me. It is not even close to the picture. It is safety cone orange NOT coral :(</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments when I wore this color out trying out Gelish polish for the first time. It is absolutely beautiful and I will definitely be using it again soon!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this color! I just went away to the Dominican and this was the perfect color to wear! Some lights it looked neon orange, other lights it wasn&#x27;t as bright.  I suggest 3 or more coats, for mine polish was really thin.  I added a coat of foundation gel to help keep them strong and from chipping while away. This is the perfect color for the summer with an awesome tan! Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful fire/pink/orange color.  Very bold!  I look forward to wearing this color this summer and using it with other brights.</li>
            <li> This color is not a pretty color pink, but instead neon orange. No big deal to me, but be warned</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite gel color. So glad I bought this! It&#x27;s so beautiful and perfect for the summer.. great buy!</li>
