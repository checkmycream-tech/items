            <li>Shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li>I can say, if you are doing this at home, there is a huge difference between using this with heat and without.</li>
            <li>You need to know how to use this- great for use with the EQ glosses- do not use regular developer!</li>
            <li>I love redken gloss and for the price its worth it..</li>
            <li>I love the whole Shades EQ system.</li>
            <li>It has never failed me, and is so easy to use.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to mix with whatever shade you want - 1:1 ratio, simple as pie (actually easier than pie, LOL).    </li>
            <li>it was MUCH darker and more intense.</li>
            <li>The product itself is professional grade for sure.</li>

            <li>Glad it comes in a big bottle!  </li>
            <li>Great price and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks ; )</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described and very well with Redken Shades EQ gloss in the color Espresso.</li>

            <li>This is mild to hair and  does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li>As a new mom with gray hairs poking through, this is a life-saver!</li>
            <li>I just had my hair colored and really just want to use the clear gloss and shine.</li>
            <li>So, worth the money, you save buying the larger bottle.</li>

            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny with no odor.</li>
            <li> This last time my tips had residual permanent dye slightly lighter than the rest of my natural hair and that didn&#x27;t seem to affect the Redken Shades EQ color gloss&#x27;s results at all.</li>
            <li> But considering it&#x27;s a 1:1 ratio, this should last a really long time!</li>
            <li> It truly did look like chrome but did not last very long.</li>
            <li> Next time, I think I will only use heat for half the processing time and see what happens when I do that.</li>
            <li> and I realized the only way to get that was to lighten and then use the Redken Shades EQ color glossing over my extremely lightened hair.</li>
            <li> A little expensive at first, but it will last a year!</li>
            <li> The package came torn apart, which is in part, due to the post office.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll even try what&#x27;s left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I usually get my hair glazed at a local salon, but since I have the recipe I ordered all of the supplies on Amazon</li>
            <li> I used to have my hair colored with Shades EQ in a salon with regularity, but now it&#x27;s difficult to get out so much.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m the odd one out here because I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I used this as compared to when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I am always too frightened to try the drugstore box kind because you hear terrible stories</li>
            <li> I would have thought it would have been sent in a box since it&#x27;s heavy and not in a bag.</li>
            <li> I realize its because its so heavy</li>
            <li> but I usually go 30 and wash it out.</li>
            <li> No more will I spend $100 at the salon to get my hair glazed.</li>
            <li> I has this treatment years ago at a salon and was amazed at the results, the salon moved and I had a hard time finding a salon that carried Redken Shades EQ.</li>
            <li> I found the ratio info confusing.  </li>
            <li> this product does nothing to help shine hair  shouldn&#x27;t be selling such a crappy product  its to bad</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  :(</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Real deal and came fast</li>
            <li> As a new mom with gray hairs poking through, this is a life-saver! I used to have my hair colored with Shades EQ in a salon with regularity, but now it&#x27;s difficult to get out so much. This helps immensely. It&#x27;s so easy to mix with whatever shade you want - 1:1 ratio, simple as pie (actually easier than pie, LOL).    Shipping was quick too!</li>
            <li> Did not cover gray hair, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought the Shades EQ gloss processing solution to ensure I achieved perfect results -- and the results were perfect.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, fast processing time and great when used with redken eq shades</li>
            <li> The processing solution works with the Shades EQ colors.  I like using this product because it is semi-permanent.  If you want permanent hair color, you need to find something else.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I decided I wanted silver hair and I realized the only way to get that was to lighten and then use the Redken Shades EQ color glossing over my extremely lightened hair. It works great! I can say, if you are doing this at home, there is a huge difference between using this with heat and without. I have used the Chrome 09T twice. The first time I did it with no heat. It truly did look like chrome but did not last very long. The second time I was under heat (via hairdryer and diffuser) it was MUCH darker and more intense. Next time, I think I will only use heat for half the processing time and see what happens when I do that. Buying in bulk makes sense here.</li>
            <li> Redken toner processing solution goes  with EQ toners</li>
            <li> received as stated - great</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10+ years. I love it. It gives you shinny hair, easy to work with, great product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product if you want to save some money and tone your hair between visits to a stylist. I use Platinum and Violet Kicker mix together and add the same amount of solution for brilliant brunette with caramel highlights.  Cheaper to buy on Amazon than on eBay.</li>
            <li> Equal parts process and a gloss shade that you like, I think it is recommended to sit for 20-25min but I usually go 30 and wash it out. It has almost no smell which is nice and I don&#x27;t notice any damage to my hair at all. This last time my tips had residual permanent dye slightly lighter than the rest of my natural hair and that didn&#x27;t seem to affect the Redken Shades EQ color gloss&#x27;s results at all. The demarcation line vanished. I recommend this to anyone who wants hair color at home. It is incredibly easy and the results are lovely every time. I am always too frightened to try the drugstore box kind because you hear terrible stories but this always works!</li>
            <li> this product does nothing to help shine hair  shouldn&#x27;t be selling such a crappy product  its to bad I learned the hard way!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Redken is OK. Goldwell is better.</li>
            <li> Looooooove! My friend is a stylist and she let me in on some of her secrets, Redken Shades EQ Color Gloss system being one of them! This processing solution was perfect and just like the salon. Will buy again when mine eventually runs out! But considering it&#x27;s a 1:1 ratio, this should last a really long time!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly &amp; authentic redken product. You need to know how to use this- great for use with the EQ glosses- do not use regular developer!</li>
            <li> The package came torn apart, which is in part, due to the post office. Quite a bit leaked out inside the bag it was mailed in and that&#x27;s probably because the lid wasn&#x27;t sealed.  I would have thought it would have been sent in a box since it&#x27;s heavy and not in a bag. Even with all the leaking, it didn&#x27;t smell like processing solution.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll even try what&#x27;s left in the bottle.  I am very disappointed.  :(</li>
            <li> This is perfect band new great quality i use this for toning all the time and my clients love it as much as i do! thank you so much</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! No more will I spend $100 at the salon to get my hair glazed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It seems to be diluted.</li>
            <li> I has this treatment years ago at a salon and was amazed at the results, the salon moved and I had a hard time finding a salon that carried Redken Shades EQ. I just had my hair colored and really just want to use the clear gloss and shine. Is this possible? I found the ratio info confusing.  Redken Shades EQ Gloss Processing Solution, is what I want to buy but not if I have to color my hair to use it.. HELP! Thanks ; )</li>
            <li> I love redken gloss and for the price its worth it.. I use it on all my clients</li>
            <li> Redken Shades is the best haircolor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 20 years. It has never failed me, and is so easy to use. Hardly any odor at all, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like this product but really didn&#x27;t need a salon size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;You must use with and EQ. I guess I  will have it for the rest of the year</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m the odd one out here because I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I used this as compared to when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> If you are going to use the Redken Shades EQ, you have to use this processing solution.  It&#x27;s easy to mix, does not have much of an odor, and the odor doesn&#x27;t linger. Glad it comes in a big bottle!  I love the whole Shades EQ system.</li>
            <li> Fast turn around.  Part was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and met my expectations</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my purchase and would recommend this seller to others.</li>
            <li> This product goes with the redken shades colors.  You use it with the coloring.  I like it and would buy it again</li>
            <li> Gorgeous shine.  My hair was in better condition than before.</li>
            <li> ITS MY 5 STAR PRODUCT FOR MIX MY SHADES EQ COLOR GLOSS, THE RESULT ITS LIKE A DEEP TRATAMENT, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Good stuff as Redken always is. You will needs it for Redken toning products. Mine arrived damaged with liquid all over the place so I had to refuse shipment and buy locally. The product itself is professional grade for sure.</li>
            <li> Redkens is always a good product!  The solution works well. I would definitely buy it again. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to go with my RedkenEQ color. These are the same products my hair dresses uses to color my hair. I ordered on-line to be able to have the supplies on hand for those times when  my hair needs a touch up, or when we are traveling.</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair glazed at a local salon, but since I have the recipe I ordered all of the supplies on Amazon and it turned out great!  Actually, probably even BETTER than my own hairstylist because I could adjust the colors a little according to my fancy!</li>
            <li> This is required for my shades EQ but I wish it were cheaper. I realize its because its so heavy</li>
            <li> This is mild to hair and  does not dry it out.  The semi-permanent colors are beautiful when used with this product.</li>
            <li> Not stinky, worked great, color came out perfect, non-damaging!</li>
            <li> A must with the use of Redkens  hades EQ Conditioning Color gloss. Leaves hair soft and shiny with no odor.</li>
            <li> Happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> This processing solution is designed to work with Redken HQ color. It is very gently, yet very effective. A little expensive at first, but it will last a year! So, worth the money, you save buying the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a giant bottle, the kind salons would have on hand. You&#x27;ll have this for a while but it&#x27;s worth it if  you dye your hair often.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described and very well with Redken Shades EQ gloss in the color Espresso. Color lasts about 8 weeks for me, gradually fading. Doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much. Great price and will last a long time. I&#x27;ve bought this before and I noticed after about 3 years, it expired and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
