            <li>Works ok, but is cumbersome and is hard to reuse or cut up</li>

            <li>Newgel silcones that I purchased recently, really works on new scar, not really seeing any difference in my old scars</li>
            <li>This is only the second month post surgery, but I can attest that these things really work well.</li>
            <li>Now, two years later, the scar is barely visible on my face.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too long but can customize size</li>
            <li> Good grief</li>
            <li> After a week or so, my girlfriend used medical tape to hold it down.</li>
            <li> My wife had a double mastectomy and she ended up deciding to just do shea butter as she couldn&#x27;t stand to mess with these after 2 tries.</li>
            <li> you really really *really* going to wear these everyday for *at least* 2 months (which is the directions)?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I used this product for the past two and a half months and my scars have diminished considerably .</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my scar after a small surgery and it has definitely helped.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too expensive for a life with smaller scars but they are costly if you are going to just wear once or twice then shove them to the back of the cupboard.</li>
            <li> I wore it faithfully about 16 hours a day everyday for about five weeks and holy Toledo</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> Half of my nose was removed and replaced with a graft from behind my ear .</li>
            <li> Since wearing them the pain is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> Very expensive considering you only get 4 strips.</li>
            <li> I used these over my c-section incision to keep my pants from rubbing and irritating along the scar line.  </li>
            <li> well, i am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> no idea if the strips will work because they are kinda annoying to deal with.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very sticky gel. But my scar us partly on the bottom of my foot and so I had to use a thinner brand also.</li>
            <li> I used these over my c-section incision to keep my pants from rubbing and irritating along the scar line.  I scar very easily and I do still have a scar, but I am sure that it is much less noticeable because of these.</li>
            <li> irritates skin a bit, itchy</li>
            <li> I had a tummy tuck with a vertical incision on my abdomen from belly button to breast and I was very selfconcious of the scar. I didn&#x27;t use this product until I was 14 months post operative. I wore it faithfully about 16 hours a day everyday for about five weeks and holy Toledo these work! My scar is all but gone and for the first time since I had my daughter 19 years ago I wore a bikini and I didn&#x27;t even notice my scar! Yes, I had to use surgical paper tape to keep in place but I was bothered by that since the product was effective. The cost may seem high but if you&#x27;re faithful and take dare of them one strip will work for the entire course really.</li>
            <li> well, i am so disappointed.  These strips are suppose to be washable and last 12 weeks.  I could not keep them on my skin mo matter what I did.  I even applied tape...but didn&#x27;t last..WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> Works great.  My doctor recommended this for my scar after a small surgery and it has definitely helped.  It&#x27;s only been two months and I will need to use it for the recommended three months for the full benefit.</li>
            <li> product works very well I would recommend it to my friends when you order it make sure you want the clear or the Bandade style</li>
            <li> This review is appropriate for butches and transmen as well as anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mixed review--no idea if the strips will work because they are kinda annoying to deal with. So what I would ask myself before buying is:  &amp;#34;Are you really really *really* going to wear these everyday for *at least* 2 months (which is the directions)?&amp;#34; Deal with sticking and un-sticking and storing and cleaning them? Some people are the type to be an A+ patient and some are not. My wife had a double mastectomy and she ended up deciding to just do shea butter as she couldn&#x27;t stand to mess with these after 2 tries. Also she has sensitive skin so she worried about that. Reviews say the strips work great so she told me to buy them. But we didn&#x27;t know you had to wear them so loyally for them to work. That&#x27;s why I am writing a review to point out that you may want to think about your lifestyle and personality when you think about what to buy. They aren&#x27;t too expensive for a life with smaller scars but they are costly if you are going to just wear once or twice then shove them to the back of the cupboard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too long but can customize size</li>
            <li> Newgel silcones that I purchased recently, really works on new scar, not really seeing any difference in my old scars but I ll be patient and keep u guys updated.</li>
            <li> They apply directly on your problem incision. I put it on so I can wear a bra. The strip/beige has a cloth side. Since wearing them the pain is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> This is not a verified purchase from Amazon because I got a package from my doctor after I had skin cancer surgery on my face. It was a basal cell carcinoma. This is only the second month post surgery, but I can attest that these things really work well. I followed the directions and cut a strip big enough to cover the incision - about 1.5 inches. Surprisingly, these are very reusable. Also, you can shower with them and they stay on. After a week or so, my girlfriend used medical tape to hold it down. I also had skin cancer surgery two years ago and I guess that was before these strips came out. I didn&#x27;t use them, but I rubbed [[ASIN:B001DKGJQU PRO EMU OIL (8 oz) Pure All Natural Emu Oil - AEA Certified - Made In USA - Best All Natural Oil for Face, Skin, Hair and Nails. Excellent for Dry Skin, Burns, Sunburns, Scars, Muscles and Joints]] which I did buy from Amazon on the scar regularly. Now, two years later, the scar is barely visible on my face. Regarding the fresh scar, I am wearing the silicone gel strip during the day and at night I remove it and put on Emu oil. I thought the combination work very well since the oil by itself did a good job. I am midway through my second month on the fresh scar and it is definitely beginning to disappear.</li>
            <li> Good grief what a wonderful product . Half of my nose was removed and replaced with a graft from behind my ear . The scar that remained was large, crooked, and unsightly . I used this product for the past two and a half months and my scars have diminished considerably . This stuff was given to me by my doctor and it really really works .</li>
            <li> Title pretty much says it all. The ends peel up after one use even when washed/rinsed well. Very expensive considering you only get 4 strips. I broke out in a rash from them, too. Meh.</li>
            <li> GREAT RESULTS ! LARGE JAGGED SCAR GREATLY REDUCED BY CONTINUED USE OVER SEVERAL MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Scar is almost all the way gone! Just learned that I needed to cut it smaller though, because it sloughs off the healthy skin AROUND the scare as well. And don&#x27;t go too far or you&#x27;ll end up with skin trying to come off that&#x27;s still attached!</li>
            <li> These strips are wonderful at reducing (and even eliminating) scar tissue.  Had a knee replacement and my doctor recommended these as I keloid really bad - starting using them one month post surgery and scar is barely visible now - an absolutely awesome product.  Noticed some people said they do not stick well - my doctor recommended putting a tegaderm patch over the strip once it is in place and this works great.  I would highly recommend NewGel+ products to anyone for scar management.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but is cumbersome and is hard to reuse or cut up but when applied it does the job</li>
