            <li>The color is legit and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this wig.  </li>
            <li>but their mother and I were so pleased with them that we each kept one and bought a play wig in order for each girl to have one.</li>
            <li>I but that item for my wife And is more beatiful.</li>
            <li>like that product, well the color is lightbrown but is ok</li>
            <li>i realy love the style make and color of this wig....</li>
            <li>Its great, looks realistic, thought it doesn&#x27;t look like what&#x27;s on the pic.</li>
            <li>This wig is very nicely made and at most realistic.</li>
            <li>but it is cute not as much of the reddish color more of a brow tan good for cosplaying a darker hair Dave from homestuck</li>
            <li>An excellent purchase for the money spent.</li>
            <li>The play wig cost more than any of the 3 that I bought originally.  </li>
            <li>I thought the wig itself was very cute, but it has lost so much hair, just from me taking it out of the box</li>
            <li>Think I might shape it to suit my oval shaped face and adjust the width to fit my head.</li>
            <li>I receive compliments on my new, hair color -- a reddish brown -- not just light brown as described, but it&#x27;s a nice color.  </li>
            <li>The best thing was that it was shipped so quickly; I received it within just a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the wig, but  It&#x27;s a little darker than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>He fell for it for at least a good 10 minutes before I told him!</li>
            <li>(Maybe I&#x27;m fooling myself, but I think most people really think it&#x27;s natural.)  </li>
            <li>Needs a little brushing and styling, but is gorgeous even right out of the package.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very big, love the colour and texture though.</li>
            <li>The actual wig looks more like a Justin beiber haircut.</li>
            <li>This wig has too much hair</li>
            <li>It was all a light brown and a completely different style.</li>
            <li>The picture looks nice in comparison to the wig it is a ht mess!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s longer than apparent in the photo, with the longest tendrils of the bob curving below my chin (more like the photo of the Maysu capless short bob, which I also ordered, but it was way longer than shown and took 15 calendar days to arrive).  </li>
            <li>It was nice to find a good quality wig that I can wear when I feel like having short hair again (without cutting it, of course).</li>
            <li>I would not think that it is human hair because of the price, but to touch it and see it you would believe it to be real hair.  </li>
            <li>it fits my  5 yr old but its spose to be mines....</li>
            <li>If I couls send it back I would, but it cost way too much to send back.</li>

            <li> This wig has too much hair and it&#x27;s very big, love the colour and texture though. Think I might shape it to suit my oval shaped face and adjust the width to fit my head.</li>
            <li> This wig is very nicely made and at most realistic. The color is legit and beautiful. I recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking to buy a short wig.</li>
            <li> I love this wig.  I could not believe the quality of it.  I would not think that it is human hair because of the price, but to touch it and see it you would believe it to be real hair.  I bought 3 wigs for my grandaughters to play in but their mother and I were so pleased with them that we each kept one and bought a play wig in order for each girl to have one. The play wig cost more than any of the 3 that I bought originally.  An excellent purchase for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I had a pixie cut just like this one for years and have since grown my hair out. It was nice to find a good quality wig that I can wear when I feel like having short hair again (without cutting it, of course). Needs a little brushing and styling, but is gorgeous even right out of the package.</li>
            <li> I but that item for my wife And is more beatiful. Thanx&lt;br /&gt;I like that product, well the color is lightbrown but is ok</li>
            <li> The crown for the head is a bit small.  I do like the colour.</li>
            <li> I hated it, besides the delivery  took 100 years. I wore it once in my room, and swear I will never put it on again.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality . I am currently using wigs for  a medical reason. This simply did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Not as it appears!! Looks really bad!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the wig itself was very cute, but it has lost so much hair, just from me taking it out of the box</li>
            <li> If you have an average head it&#x27;s kinda tight but it is cute not as much of the reddish color more of a brow tan good for cosplaying a darker hair Dave from homestuck</li>
            <li> I am happy with the wig, but  It&#x27;s a little darker than I wanted.  Great product for the price.  Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This matched my hair color perfectly! I put it on as a joke to trick my husband since he&#x27;s been bugging me to get my hair cut. He fell for it for at least a good 10 minutes before I told him! Took some playing around with the hair to hide the wig cap, but overall it worked well!</li>
            <li> i realy love the style make and color of this wig....only bad thing is the size...it fits my  5 yr old but its spose to be mines....i feel my,head isnt abnormally big the wig is just LITTLE...</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. The bangs are to long and hangs down way over my eyes. Didn&#x27;t send it back because I figure you get what you pay for. Can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> Its great, looks realistic, thought it doesn&#x27;t look like what&#x27;s on the pic. The actual wig looks more like a Justin beiber haircut. But I like it</li>
            <li> I receive compliments on my new, hair color -- a reddish brown -- not just light brown as described, but it&#x27;s a nice color.  It&#x27;s longer than apparent in the photo, with the longest tendrils of the bob curving below my chin (more like the photo of the Maysu capless short bob, which I also ordered, but it was way longer than shown and took 15 calendar days to arrive).  I had to trim the bangs a bit.  Only two people know that it&#x27;s a wig.  (Maybe I&#x27;m fooling myself, but I think most people really think it&#x27;s natural.)  I have to admit that I grab it off as soon as I get home.  The best thing was that it was shipped so quickly; I received it within just a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> The caption says it all. It was all a light brown and a completely different style.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me to take it off it looked to boyish and not lady like at all.  The picture looks nice in comparison to the wig it is a ht mess!  If I couls send it back I would, but it cost way too much to send back.</li>
