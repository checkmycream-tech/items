            <li>It works great for him.  </li>
            <li>Is it a great gag and conversation piece if people have caught notice of your mustache?  </li>
            <li>in all, if youve got 10-11 bucks to spare, and need a good mustache comb... buy it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfectly designed for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, absolutely.</li>
            <li>He said it was real unique and that he didnt know they made combs for staches .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The gentleman thought it a great gift and funny because of the shape</li>
            <li>love mine</li>
            <li>Sure.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and quality was good.</li>
            <li>This item is very sturdy and a good size.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool and functional, but I have to stress, very cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Made of strong plastic.</li>
            <li>The quality of this comb is hands down the best I&#x27;ve seen out there</li>
            <li>: i was hoping this would have finer teeth, should they make a fine tooth version, consider me a repeat</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Cute design would make it a fun gag gift, though.</li>
            <li>Plan on having a conversation when you pull The Original Cowboy Comb out of your pocket, because it&#x27;s going to get noticed.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>If you must ask, this little comb is really the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun, and does the trick.</li>
            <li>but when i pay almost as muc to ship the item as the item itself i expect it pretty damned quick.</li>
            <li>This is very clever and a fine addition to our collection of unusual combs.</li>
            <li>this is be far the best ever comb to tame those whiskers!</li>
            <li>I only gave it 2stars because it is cute.</li>
            <li>The comb is too large and the tines are too far apart for this to feel useful.  </li>
            <li>As sturdy as a real man&#x27;s stache.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves this comb.</li>
            <li>shipping, the shipping cost nearly as much as the comb (5.99 for the comb, 4.99 to mail it?)</li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very cheap looking, matte black comb.</li>
            <li>After trying several different combs to handle my facial hair i discovered the Cowboy Comb in my own town.</li>
            <li>definitely the right size for your stache, your goatee and your sideburns.&lt;br</li>
            <li>friend ,who had just grown his stache a few months back and who was also the inspiration for me to start mine , was super excited when I gave him the comb .</li>
            <li>it took nearly two weeks to show up, which normally wouldnt be a problem</li>
            <li>good quality very tough</li>
            <li>Just a cheap regular little plastic comb molded like a moustache.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in your pockets.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I spent so much on a novelty I could have gotten at a dollar store for 2 in a pack.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no higher quality than a fast food restaurant toy.</li>
            <li>My son misplaced his first one</li>

            <li> This comb works really well on thick mustaches and beards.</li>
            <li> I have put up with mustache combs that are cheap and second thought, the Cowboy Comb is sturdy and tough, unlike the toy combs one usually finds.</li>
            <li> Nice little comb, delightfully whimsical shape!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the price (especially not if you have to pay any shipping)</li>
            <li> The other firemen  </li>
            <li> although dull, they are sharp enough to poke through pockets in some materials and did leave a couple of holes in my jacket pockets.  </li>
            <li> The only negative was unforeseeable.</li>
            <li> thing is SOLID, its thick and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> Little chance of it breaking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i have a FEW complaints...</li>
            <li> so this showed up in the mail yesterday, none too soon as my last mustache comb broke in a tragic wallet</li>
            <li> I say do yourself a favor, pick up one of these bad boys, heck buy two, one for a gift.  </li>
            <li> do not hesitate you will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Epicly awesome. As sturdy as a real man&#x27;s stache.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect comb for any mustache or beard!!  The quality of this comb is hands down the best I&#x27;ve seen out there and at this price it&#x27;s a steal!  Plan on having a conversation when you pull The Original Cowboy Comb out of your pocket, because it&#x27;s going to get noticed.  I say do yourself a favor, pick up one of these bad boys, heck buy two, one for a gift.  You owe it to yourself...you owe it to your stache!!</li>
            <li> This item is very sturdy and a good size. Works well. It is as well-made as advertised. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great gift for the bearded man or woman!!!!</li>
            <li> After trying several different combs to handle my facial hair i discovered the Cowboy Comb in my own town. this is be far the best ever comb to tame those whiskers! do not hesitate you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These combs are awesome !&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of them , one for me and one to give as a gift .&lt;br /&gt;My friend ,who had just grown his stache a few months back and who was also the inspiration for me to start mine , was super excited when I gave him the comb . He said it was real unique and that he didnt know they made combs for staches .&lt;br /&gt;I love mine and he loved his so 2 happy customers here !!</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Made of strong plastic. Little chance of it breaking.  Easy to hold. Small enough to fit in your pockets. Big enough to find if you drop it.  The only negative was unforeseeable. The ends point upwards and although dull, they are sharp enough to poke through pockets in some materials and did leave a couple of holes in my jacket pockets.  Apart from them tearing wholes in my clothes on two occasions the product is great. That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this comb. enough said.</li>
            <li> The comb is too large and the tines are too far apart for this to feel useful.  Cute design would make it a fun gag gift, though.</li>
            <li> As a female I got these 2 combs for gifts and have already given one for a birthday gift. The gentleman thought it a great gift and funny because of the shape</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very cheap looking, matte black comb. it&#x27;s perfectly designed for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, absolutely. but it&#x27;s not worth the price (especially not if you have to pay any shipping) it&#x27;s cool and functional, but I have to stress, very cheap looking. it&#x27;s got plastic bits from the molding process sticking off in some spots. it&#x27;s no higher quality than a fast food restaurant toy.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 2stars because it is cute. It is way overpriced for what it actually is. Just a cheap regular little plastic comb molded like a moustache. Can&#x27;t believe I spent so much on a novelty I could have gotten at a dollar store for 2 in a pack.</li>
            <li> This comb works really well on thick mustaches and beards. If you have peach fuzz you need not apply here.</li>
            <li> My son misplaced his first one so I replaced it.  It works great for him.  The other firemen  at his station call him the stache.  The price was right and quality was good.</li>
            <li> This is very clever and a fine addition to our collection of unusual combs.</li>
            <li> The image and title are misleading.  I thought I was purchasing a comb for facial hair that ironically was shaped like a mustache.  Instead I received a regular hair comb shaped like a mustache; I&#x27;d have been happier with a mustache comb shaped like a head.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard/mustache and you don&#x27;t have this comb, quit kidding yourself and shave your face. Otherwise his comb is for you!</li>
            <li> good quality very tough</li>
            <li> so this showed up in the mail yesterday, none too soon as my last mustache comb broke in a tragic wallet accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this thing is SOLID, its thick and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;its definitely the right size for your stache, your goatee and your sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a FEW complaints...&lt;br /&gt;a: i was hoping this would have finer teeth, should they make a fine tooth version, consider me a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;b: shipping, the shipping cost nearly as much as the comb (5.99 for the comb, 4.99 to mail it?) it took nearly two weeks to show up, which normally wouldnt be a problem but when i pay almost as muc to ship the item as the item itself i expect it pretty damned quick. perhaps in the future the makers could invest in some bulk shipping accounts so they dont have to charge as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, if youve got 10-11 bucks to spare, and need a good mustache comb... buy it</li>
            <li> I have put up with mustache combs that are cheap and second thought, the Cowboy Comb is sturdy and tough, unlike the toy combs one usually finds.</li>
            <li> If you must ask, this little comb is really the best.  Could it use finer teeth?  Sure.  Is it a great gag and conversation piece if people have caught notice of your mustache?  Absolutely.  It&#x27;s fun, and does the trick.</li>
            <li> The comb is great! It was a gift for my bf. He uses it every day. Fits perfectly in his pocket.</li>
