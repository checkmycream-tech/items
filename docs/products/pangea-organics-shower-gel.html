    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product and the moisturizer are perfect and the results are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I know organic shower gels are not known for being the best suddsy products and</li>
            <li>Instead it is delightfully like a walk in the woods.</li>
            <li>Best organic bodywash I have found.  </li>
            <li>This one was great too.</li>
            <li>Pangea is a great brand.</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>Very nice product and organic.</li>
            <li>I think they have a good mission and great</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly pleasant in the shower, but afterwards, I could smell something acrid, almost BO-y, and soon realized it was me.</li>
            <li>Hubbie loved this gift.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And even though it says 1 bottle is good for 90 showers....</li>
            <li>Plus, it has nothing but good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Still, it is good.  </li>
            <li>Love it great product</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent that brings me to a calm feeling.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this shower gel!</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the scent is amazing</li>
            <li>But again, if you are on a strict budget of some sorts this may not be the best product, as 8.5 ounces is not that much</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of hike in a forest during a nice summer day.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell of this product but the lather was practically non existent.</li>
            <li>The packaged was handled nicely with tape over the top to avoid or in case of any spills.</li>
            <li>If you love a nice woodsy realistic scent, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>and I had to reapply shower gel way more than a quarters size like it says on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they could find an another saponifiying agent that could make the shower gel more sudsy...</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I was expecting more. &#x27;</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>*Love* the brisk fragrance of pine; it&#x27;s absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased with my experience purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>While the package says that the shower gel is concentrated which it may very well be, it does not provide a good lather.  </li>
            <li>You need just a little bit and it works great!</li>
            <li>Thankfully amazon has these products available and I appreciate the service.</li>
            <li>excited about this product when it arrived but will keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;pro&#x27;s:&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I felt refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Your skin will thank you for trading in the soap for this amazing smelling, soft making shower gel.</li>
            <li>The product is good, as are the ingredients, but the scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like, and I prefer the body feel of other shower gels (Acure Organics, Method) over this one.</li>
            <li>pangea organics canadian pine and italian white sage bar soap however is excellent</li>
            <li>Quick rinsing with no soapy residue, this Pangea delivers on a well thought out product and packaging.</li>
            <li>want to edit to add that I would not recommend purchasing this item from lucky vitamin.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like that it doesnt form a really soapy lather (and therefore isn&#x27;t ideal for a pouf or loofah), but it lathers enough with my hands for me to get a good whole-body wash out of a relatively small amount.  </li>
            <li>Its refreshing and comprised of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The smell is unisex but more  than sufficiently masculine</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave you clean and the smell is very manly, BUT</li>
            <li>Just found out that the French Martime pine bark extract is great taken internally as a supplement.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned a little goes a long way and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>(all three of the different scents are lovely).  </li>
            <li>The scent is very relaxing but not too powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other fragrances and always liked them very much.  </li>
            <li>Let me first state that I really like the pangea organics company and line.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and have never had the smallest problem with this shower gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure aromatherapy every time I shower with it.  </li>
            <li>so the non-foaming nature of these shower gels actually really appeals to me.</li>
            <li>With Sage scent as a whole, and this body wash is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I find it deodorizes very well.</li>
            <li>It did not remind me too much of Pine Sol, but it does smell like pine, so if you like pine</li>
            <li>Its runny because its very concentrated.</li>
            <li>That being said, it applies to the skin smoothly by hand and is sudsy enough to have a user know</li>
            <li>, I am very fond of woodsy scents-sage and pine, in particular.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price given that you really do not need to use as much as most products so it lasts 2-3 times as long.</li>
            <li>So in theory obtaining the same results from a non-chemical laced body wash is definitely beneficial over the normal cheap stuff full of chemicals that who REALLY knows the long term effects of.</li>
            <li>But this leaves my skin feeling a little dry, kind of like bar soap.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with their customer service that could have easily been fixed but little to no effort was made to get my issue resolved.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have already noted, this product is not for you if you are looking for something super lathery.</li>
            <li>Masculine without a hammer.</li>
            <li>The pine scent is not heavy and does not make you think of pine-sol.  </li>
            <li>Well&amp;#34; I thought, &amp;#34;This stuff better at least smell good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>OLD REVIEW:</li>
            <li>Normally, we only use Aubrey Organics shampoos and conditioners - and still do - but this organic fragrance was too much to pass up.</li>
            <li>Naturally, one&#x27;s sense of smell and body chemistry will differ from the next, so I will give the product development team at Pangea the benefit of the doubt on this shower gel.</li>
            <li>I have ordered organic homemade items from that other site but the shipping took twice as long and some of the prices for organic/natural products cost twice as much!</li>

            <li> Some say it&#x27;s expensive, but it lathers great with just a few drops about the size of a nickel, and has lasted a few months.</li>
            <li> Only a dime size goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a product that is natural without all of the nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> Definitely high, but a little indulgence I now wouldn&#x27;t want to be without!</li>
            <li> Have used some other Pangea products and they are terrific as well.</li>
            <li> this shower gel also fell victim to that.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that though, I found the gel to be quite concentrated, making just a few drops of the gel on my luffa sponge go a long way.</li>
            <li> I would bring that down to 30-45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product means what it says about \\&quot; a little goes along</li>
            <li> /&gt;As for the Canadian Pine shower gel I was disappointed in it just based on it not being a rich lather product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;having my skin dried out and tacky</li>
            <li> When I first got it, the size of the container disappointed me.</li>
            <li> It is quite a common allergen (I&#x27;m allergic to it)</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed by how dry my skin feels after using it, but then again, the gel doesn&#x27;t claim to be moisturizing (although it does claim to work well as a shaving gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the Pangea Organics Canadian Pine</li>
            <li> The reason it doesn&#x27;t lather is because it doesn&#x27;t have sodium laureth sulfate - a nasty chemical added to shampoo&#x27;s and body washes to make them foam</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hubbie loved this gift.</li>
            <li> Love it great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this shower gel for about two years.  As others have mentioned a little goes a long way and it smells wonderful (all three of the different scents are lovely).  The reason it doesn&#x27;t lather is because it doesn&#x27;t have sodium laureth sulfate - a nasty chemical added to shampoo&#x27;s and body washes to make them foam - this doesn&#x27;t actually add anything to skincare products it just produces the foamy-ness.  It is quite a common allergen (I&#x27;m allergic to it) so the non-foaming nature of these shower gels actually really appeals to me.</li>
            <li> excited about this product when it arrived but will keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;natural and organic!&lt;br /&gt;awesome pine/ clove scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;digustingly tacky film left after rinsing&lt;br /&gt;dries out skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;having my skin dried out and tacky is not how i want to feel after a shower.  i would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the Pangea Organics Canadian Pine With Sage scent as a whole, and this body wash is no exception.  It&#x27;s pure aromatherapy every time I shower with it.  My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like that it doesnt form a really soapy lather (and therefore isn&#x27;t ideal for a pouf or loofah), but it lathers enough with my hands for me to get a good whole-body wash out of a relatively small amount.  Oh, but the price... Definitely high, but a little indulgence I now wouldn&#x27;t want to be without!</li>
            <li> This product and the moisturizer are perfect and the results are wonderful.  Just found out that the French Martime pine bark extract is great taken internally as a supplement.  Have used some other Pangea products and they are terrific as well.</li>
            <li> This product means what it says about \\&quot; a little goes along way\\&quot;. I have super sensitive skin and have never had the smallest problem with this shower gel. Your skin will thank you for trading in the soap for this amazing smelling, soft making shower gel. It&#x27;s aroma therapy/skin therapy in one bottle. It&#x27;s worth the price given that you really do not need to use as much as most products so it lasts 2-3 times as long. LOVE IT!  P.S. I find it deodorizes very well.</li>
            <li> If you love a nice woodsy realistic scent, this is a great product. It also seems to be a good moisturizer. Some say it&#x27;s expensive, but it lathers great with just a few drops about the size of a nickel, and has lasted a few months.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of all-natural bath products, but I&#x27;ll probably keep looking rather than re-ordering this one. It is a bit runny for my preference, and doesn&#x27;t lather readily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is noticeable but I did not find it overpowering. It did not remind me too much of Pine Sol, but it does smell like pine, so if you like pine you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> Let me first state that I really like the pangea organics company and line.  I think they have a good mission and great products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Canadian Pine shower gel I was disappointed in it just based on it not being a rich lather product.  I know organic shower gels are not known for being the best suddsy products and this shower gel also fell victim to that.  I use a dove body scrubber and I had to reapply shower gel way more than a quarters size like it says on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave you clean and the smell is very manly, BUT I think it&#x27;s just a hassle to keep reapplying the gel 2-3x while in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pangea organics canadian pine and italian white sage bar soap however is excellent and I think i&#x27;m going to switch back after my bottle has run out.  While the package says that the shower gel is concentrated which it may very well be, it does not provide a good lather.  And even though it says 1 bottle is good for 90 showers....I would bring that down to 30-45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could find an another saponifiying agent that could make the shower gel more sudsy...they would knock this one out of the ballpark.  Let&#x27;s hope they come through on this one.</li>
            <li> Its refreshing and comprised of natural ingredients. So in theory obtaining the same results from a non-chemical laced body wash is definitely beneficial over the normal cheap stuff full of chemicals that who REALLY knows the long term effects of. But again, if you are on a strict budget of some sorts this may not be the best product, as 8.5 ounces is not that much</li>
            <li> Quick rinsing with no soapy residue, this Pangea delivers on a well thought out product and packaging. I can&#x27;t get enough of the pine scent: Masculine without a hammer. We use  this, the liquid hand soap and the bar form. Luv them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other fragrances and always liked them very much.  This one was great too. The pine scent is not heavy and does not make you think of pine-sol.  Instead it is delightfully like a walk in the woods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this shower gel! The scent reminds me of hike in a forest during a nice summer day. Its runny because its very concentrated. Only a dime size goes a long way. Plus, it has nothing but good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent that brings me to a calm feeling. Scent reminds me of a cabin in the woods. Very nice product and organic.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell of this product but the lather was practically non existent. I concluded my use as hand soap.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, the size of the container disappointed me. For the price I paid, I was expecting more. &#x27;Well&amp;#34; I thought, &amp;#34;This stuff better at least smell good&amp;#34;. Thankfully, the scent is amazing and I love it. Aside from that though, I found the gel to be quite concentrated, making just a few drops of the gel on my luffa sponge go a long way.</li>
            <li> *Love* the brisk fragrance of pine; it&#x27;s absolutely lovely. I recommend it for aromatherapy alone. But this leaves my skin feeling a little dry, kind of like bar soap.</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW: The product is good, as are the ingredients, but the scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like, and I prefer the body feel of other shower gels (Acure Organics, Method) over this one. Still, it is good.  OLD REVIEW: Normally, we only use Aubrey Organics shampoos and conditioners - and still do - but this organic fragrance was too much to pass up. You need just a little bit and it works great!</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  The smell is unisex but more  than sufficiently masculine is you are guy looking at getting this.  Best organic bodywash I have found.  Pangea is a great brand.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have already noted, this product is not for you if you are looking for something super lathery. That being said, it applies to the skin smoothly by hand and is sudsy enough to have a user know it&#x27;s there, if applied to a washcloth or loofah sponge. I am somewhat disappointed by how dry my skin feels after using it, but then again, the gel doesn&#x27;t claim to be moisturizing (although it does claim to work well as a shaving gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the smell: to preface, I am very fond of woodsy scents-sage and pine, in particular. The smell is fairly pleasant in the shower, but afterwards, I could smell something acrid, almost BO-y, and soon realized it was me. Naturally, one&#x27;s sense of smell and body chemistry will differ from the next, so I will give the product development team at Pangea the benefit of the doubt on this shower gel. Nevertheless, I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with my experience purchasing this product. It smells great and I felt refreshed and clean after using it. The scent is very relaxing but not too powerful. The packaged was handled nicely with tape over the top to avoid or in case of any spills. It also arrived on time. It&#x27;s great to find a product that is natural without all of the nasty chemicals. I have ordered organic homemade items from that other site but the shipping took twice as long and some of the prices for organic/natural products cost twice as much! I believe I&#x27;m spoiled from amazon prime and start getting antsy if I haven&#x27;t received my item in a week. Thankfully amazon has these products available and I appreciate the service. I recommend this product and purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to edit to add that I would not recommend purchasing this item from lucky vitamin. I had an issue with their customer service that could have easily been fixed but little to no effort was made to get my issue resolved.</li>
