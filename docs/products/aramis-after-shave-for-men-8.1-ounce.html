            <li> Aramis Classic</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Order to try something new.  </li>

            <li> While a little stronger in aroma than I would like, I do enjoy the overall smell.  </li>
            <li> This is my husbands long time go to.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Aramis for as long as I can remember (15 to 20 years?)</li>
            <li> After shaving I wash the shave cream off my face with cold water, pour about a tablespoon of this after shave in my hands, slap it on my face, then rinse my hands with some more cold water and use my wet hands to pat my face, to raise the oils and let the alcohol sting a little.</li>
            <li> The container is made of heavy glass.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I started this, talkes too long....</li>
            <li> CRAZY ABOUT THE PRODUCT</li>

            <li> Been using it for years...Get one for my birthday and one for Christmas....Hate to think about running our too soon.</li>
            <li> Aroma is fantastic and it stays with you for the evening.</li>
            <li> Aramis Classic After Shave 8.1 fl oz (240 ml)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very quick and the quality is the same good quality I&#x27;ve enjoyed for almost 40 years.</li>
            <li> Husband always uses this for 36 years I know him, he loves it and so do I. I am sorry I started this, talkes too long....</li>
            <li> Mr Stevens loves this after shave. Product shipped on time.</li>
            <li> This is a great classic after shave. It has a very pleasing light scent. I find it really conditions my skin after a close blade shave.  After shaving I wash the shave cream off my face with cold water, pour about a tablespoon of this after shave in my hands, slap it on my face, then rinse my hands with some more cold water and use my wet hands to pat my face, to raise the oils and let the alcohol sting a little. It&#x27;s the perfect after shave.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift.  Person has used it for years.</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma. The container is made of heavy glass. If it is dropped, it will not break. I have found that women seem to like this aftershave lotion more than I do. Whenever I go shopping, I use the aftershave and have a better relationship with female store employees.</li>
            <li> Aramis After Shave remains the only after shave that my husband uses.  He has used it for over 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant masculine odor.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for more than ten years</li>
            <li> This is my husbands long time go to.  His favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Great value...&lt;br /&gt;thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> While a little stronger in aroma than I would like, I do enjoy the overall smell.  Sometimes I may dilute it to soften the intensity a bit.  It does give my face a good feeling.</li>
            <li> Aramis After Shave meets all my expections. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> used it for years, never fails its nice to pay less than at the mall. thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using Aramis for as long as I can remember (15 to 20 years?) I still love it.</li>
            <li> We used to buy this at WalMart, but they no longer carry it. So we were happy to find it on Amazon. Even though it is an older fragrance, I do not tire of it and still like it.</li>
