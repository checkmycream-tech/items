            <li>My favorite colors in one, love it</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Really cute colors</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love all things OPI.  </li>
            <li>And I love OPI</li>
            <li>and I truly wish they made more Nordic colors.  </li>
            <li>I do love two of the colors which are My Dogsled</li>
            <li>/&gt;The glitter one is ok, too many like it and way cheaper at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Love these</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>This collection is easily her favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was an easy 5 star review for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip as easy as some do</li>
            <li>While I have witnessed her thoroughly enjoy OPI for awhile now, I have never seen her so excited about how easily the polish coats and how striking the colors are.  </li>
            <li>These are very different and beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved these so much that I had to go get the full size bottles in these two</li>
            <li>I love OPI and think this collection is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li>I would buy the full sizes of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package came very quickly and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>As described, came quickly:  </li>
            <li>The mini bottles of nail polish were just enough for me to test out and decide if I liked them or not before purchasing a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>found the green one to be bright enough but not too bright and inappropriate for work.</li>
            <li>loved the colors so much, bot the regular size in all of them!!</li>
            <li>My daughter really liked the colors and the smaller bottles</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased and hope to use them a lot as a new addition to my nail polish army.</li>
            <li>Opi is a great, long lasting quality brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently began purchasing nail polishes, but OPI is quickly becoming my favorite.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really paint more than 2-3 nails before the brushes get gunked up on the tiny bottlenecks.</li>
            <li>and she looks as if she could be the same (blonde hair with fair skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the mini size of OPI nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Very translucent polish.</li>
            <li>They were a bit smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be but the colors are fantastic</li>
            <li>But I can really see it flatter most&lt;</li>
            <li>I loved this small mini pack of OPI&#x27;s Nordic Collection!  </li>
            <li>These are such pretty, pretty colors!</li>
            <li>Those colors are great for winter time, but the green and the glitter can be used all year long.</li>
            <li>highly recommend that for the price of this set.. you just buy one of these two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>round and for some strange reason is super flattering on my light skin tone.</li>
            <li>I got these for my 15 year old neice and she loves them.</li>
            <li>Bottles are very small though so bear in mind if it&#x27;s for an event that you might need a top up for.</li>
            <li>My only complained would be that the blue-purple color is more purple than blue, but that&#x27;s an issue with opi.</li>
            <li>I like my nails to feel smith not rough.</li>
            <li>More than half of the colors were dried out.</li>
            <li>Colors are lovely and amazing - just the worst bottles and brushes ever.</li>
            <li>I was fully aware that the bottles were tiny, but unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know that meant that they would clump up quickly.</li>

            <li> She has purchased quite a few herself.  </li>
            <li> work well with few coats</li>
            <li> My favorites are My Dogsled is a Hybrid and My Voice is a Little Norse!</li>
            <li> Bottles are fairly small.  </li>
            <li> Like the choice of colors in small size bottles.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> and I will be sad to give them away!  </li>
            <li> Terrible one of the brushes was broken.</li>

            <li> Colors are lovely and amazing - just the worst bottles and brushes ever. Can&#x27;t really paint more than 2-3 nails before the brushes get gunked up on the tiny bottlenecks. But they&#x27;re enough to give me an idea of what the colors look like, and I have purchased the full-size versions of two of the colors.</li>
            <li> loved the colors so much, bot the regular size in all of them!!</li>
            <li> This Nordic Collection set included all the colors I was hoping to get. Perfect!</li>

            <li> Gave 2 of these as gifts to my friends.  They loved the colors.  Bottles are fairly small.  But great colors.</li>

            <li> Very translucent polish. Need at least 3-5 layers to make color bold and with these small bottles you will probably get only one use out of them.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who lives in Denmark. She is Danish so she loves the &amp;#34;Dane&amp;#34; references. She said she likes the polish.</li>
            <li> As described, came quickly:  My sister loved it!</li>
            <li> Love the mini sets.... work as great gift sets for any age.</li>

            <li> I loved this small mini pack of OPI&#x27;s Nordic Collection!  The mini bottles of nail polish were just enough for me to test out and decide if I liked them or not before purchasing a full size bottle. The colors were perfect for Fall.  My favorites are My Dogsled is a Hybrid and My Voice is a Little Norse!</li>
            <li> I was fully aware that the bottles were tiny, but unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know that meant that they would clump up quickly. Left streaks on my nails from the get-go.</li>
            <li> More than half of the colors were dried out. Not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> great polishes and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I purchased this collection for my wife because I am of very strong Viking heritage (still have family living in Denmark) and she looks as if she could be the same (blonde hair with fair skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I have purchased perhaps 3-4 dozen OPI colors for my wife over the years.  She has purchased quite a few herself.  This collection is easily her favorite.  While I have witnessed her thoroughly enjoy OPI for awhile now, I have never seen her so excited about how easily the polish coats and how striking the colors are.  She loves this set and I truly wish they made more Nordic colors.  I would buy the full sizes of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an easy 5 star review for me.  Perhaps my easiest yet.</li>
            <li> These are 1/8 fl oz. They are so so tiny lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly do not think this mini collection is worth buying at all... because of the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do love two of the colors which are My Dogsled is a Hybrid and Do You Have this Color in Stock-holm.&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprise and impressed by both. I have a ton of purples and greens but none like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the green one to be bright enough but not too bright and inappropriate for work. I feel like I can wear this one&lt;br /&gt;year round and for some strange reason is super flattering on my light skin tone. But I can really see it flatter most&lt;br /&gt;skin colors. It&#x27;s just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the purple one, the reason I tried out this set, is gorgeous and I have nothing like it. It&#x27;s just beautiful and&lt;br /&gt;if I had to just buy one, it would be this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend that for the price of this set.. you just buy one of these two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved these so much that I had to go get the full size bottles in these two colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glitter one is ok, too many like it and way cheaper at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;And the brown one is.. brown lol</li>
            <li> I like the collection but lose the sparkle one. It has the consistency of liquid sand which I did not like. I like my nails to feel smith not rough.</li>
            <li> Great winter colors!  I bought these as a gift and I will be sad to give them away!  I love OPI and think this collection is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Made great stocking stuffers! Love these</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It doesn&#x27;t chip as easy as some do and I find myself not having to reapply every other day!</li>
            <li> work well with few coats</li>
            <li> These are very different and beautiful colors. My set arrived quickly, and were in perfect condition. Overall, I am very pleased and hope to use them a lot as a new addition to my nail polish army.</li>
