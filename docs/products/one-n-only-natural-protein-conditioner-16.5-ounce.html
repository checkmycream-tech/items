            <li>I have natural kinky coily hair that is very fine and porous as well.</li>
            <li>really one of the best  i usually buy in store</li>
            <li>I was using Nexxus Emergencee, and I still do, but once I started using this more frequently my breakage AND dryness/black of moisture retention</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>right ..old but</li>
            <li>The reason why is I used a Keratin treatment right when I purchased this and for best results, the keratin treatment instructions suggested not using any products with Sodium Chloride in them which, unfortunately this conditioner had.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast though so that was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>

            <li>thanks amazon for coming  to my rescue...................  </li>
            <li>This product really made my hair thicker and longer along with my conditioner.  </li>

            <li> I am a professional hairdresser</li>
            <li> Only 4 natural ingredients in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have less breakage and my hair is much stronger.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to cut down on using shampoos in general and had researched natural protein conditioners to use as a cleanser instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this stuff is watery and stinks to high heaven (like soy sauce), so what I did is mix it with my sulfate free shampoo and it worked just as well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if used too much or what</li>
            <li> I have a few greys scattered over the entire head but a large patch in the front, so when l got my perm l decided to colour a few days later but there was greys to be found.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for the strong odor, smells exactly like and looks like SOY SAUCE, and it was extremely runny like water, very, very messy to apply and keep on my hair.</li>
            <li> Some might think it strange because of its watery consistency, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to distribute it, because I have long hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not readily available in a store near me..</li>
            <li> have long since used this product and forgot to update my review therefore now a 2.</li>
            <li> a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add this to my damp or dry hair section by section and braid it up.</li>
            <li> but I must say when I bought it(as all the other reviews say)</li>
            <li> By doing this, it holds, it does not run, and the smell is &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; by my other conditioner.</li>
            <li> It naturally repairs damaged and thin hair</li>
            <li> I threw the contents of both bottles down the sink  .  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever damaged your hair while over-bleaching or when using other harsh products then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes</li>
            <li> I also add a small amount to hair color before applying.</li>
            <li> but my hair was hard and sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this conditioner was an epic fail for me.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell, it was very messy and it made my hair hard and dry.</li>
            <li> I only used this once because it was hard to distribute and it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> However, because my hair has been damaged so badly over the past two years, I reluctantly decided to return to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very weak and brittle because of my thyroid issues</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about using it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with the product.  </li>
            <li> I could not go wrong when a friend told me to use it.  </li>
            <li> Stinks like soy sauce, but the smell washes out when you rinse it.</li>
            <li> just because it smells bad...</li>
            <li> It must have gone bad.  </li>
            <li> Ladies and gents, if you need to strengthen your hair, please try this, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hated it!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and know that it&#x27;s really good at restoring damaged hair and making hair healthy and strong again.  I stopped using it for a while because they changed the packaging and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product would have been the same so I was skeptical about using it.  However, because my hair has been damaged so badly over the past two years, I reluctantly decided to return to it.  I have been using it for about a month now and so far, I can already see the difference in my hair.  It&#x27;s great for steaming your hair especially when used with aloe vera. Do this over a period of time and your hair will grow stronger without being damaged.</li>
            <li> I have always had great success with Jheri Redding products, I would always recommend using this product line for any of you&#x27;re needs. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This product is great. If you&#x27;ve ever damaged your hair while over-bleaching or when using other harsh products then this product is for you. Some might think it strange because of its watery consistency, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. It reminds me of a product I used many years ago when I worked as a beautician. It seems to revitalize the hair. I also add a small amount to hair color before applying.</li>

            <li> this is the best protein on the market   right ..old but really one of the best  i usually buy in store but they were   out of it, so thanks amazon for coming  to my rescue...................  [[ASIN:B004P8A9M2 Jheri Redding Natural Protein Conditioner 16.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Have used many years. Great addition to my conditioner. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply carries this product and it was only 6 bucks. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to distribute it, because I have long hair. The 1/2 oz with conditioner isn&#x27;t enough to cover my hair.  Any help? I don&#x27;t want to over do it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> lov it, service was great and would continue using this retailer.  Have bought from this company before and the service was always quick and easy, never a problem.</li>
            <li> It did what I thought it would do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is kinda like medicine.... just because it smells bad... it is still good for you!  I am a professional hairdresser and I use this stuff all the time.  I mist it lightly on hair before a perm.  I add it to hair color before I put it on the ends.  I add it to a good hydrating conditioner for very damaged hair, and process under a dryer for 15 minutes, and it works magic!  I hope they NEVER quit making this product!</li>
            <li> This product really made my hair thicker and longer along with my conditioner.  I would recommend this product to anybody with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best, all-natural, inexpensive protein on the market. Stinks like soy sauce, but the smell washes out when you rinse it. Only 4 natural ingredients in the bottle.  This is a once a week staple for my very porous, afro-textured hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years. I&#x27;m so pleased to still be able to find it. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Old product , New name, I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It will restore your hair from chemicals. It is awesome! If you bleach your hair you need this , but can also be used for coloring &amp; perming I was so glad to find it online, it&#x27;s not readily available in a store near me..</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with the product.  It smelled rotten. It must have gone bad.  I threw the contents of both bottles down the sink  .  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky coily hair that is very fine and porous as well. I read about this somewhere on a hair blog or something and decided to try it. It sat in my cabinet for a while, because it&#x27;s a liqiud and I wasn&#x27;t sure how to incorporate it into my deep conditioning routine. When I finally used it, I was impressed! I add this to my damp or dry hair section by section and braid it up. Then I sit under a plastic cap for about 30 minutes. I follow up with either another protein conditioner and/or a moisturizing deep conditioner. I was using Nexxus Emergencee, and I still do, but once I started using this more frequently my breakage AND dryness/black of moisture retention was literally stopped in in tracks. It&#x27;s cheap, no frills, all natural, gentle on your hair, lasts a long time, and is very EFFECTIVE! The only downside is of course it&#x27;s runny but it did not stain my clothing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this conditioner was an epic fail for me. I hated the smell, it was very messy and it made my hair hard and dry.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome. Glad to find it.</li>
            <li> Very good conditions hair well. Does not smell nice but does the job.</li>
            <li> Hated it!!!!!!!!!! Smelled like soy sauce. Beware before you buy!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 35 years.  I have used it before my perms were rolled , and also in the bleach paste when doing a foil,  It is the best product of this kind on the market.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;But the problem is that I have been told that it has been discontinued, and I have no idea why that would happen.</li>
            <li> Thank you,  Could not find it locally!!!! It&#x27;s great to help to rebuild hair Strand!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I love the softness of my hair and the healthy look.  I could not go wrong when a friend told me to use it.  I have recommended it to many who do their own hair.  The beauticians should recommend to their clients...maybe if they did...they would stop going to her.  I take care of my own hair...without perms and this stuff is a BOMB!!</li>
            <li> I was originally looking for another product from Jheri Redding, a plumping spray, that was really, really good, but it is no longer available in stores. After searching the web, found this product by JR instead and since so many people gave it good reviews, figured I try it. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for the strong odor, smells exactly like and looks like SOY SAUCE, and it was extremely runny like water, very, very messy to apply and keep on my hair. After rinsing it out and styling my hair, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference,  so  rather than return it I just gave it away. Would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this a 3 although I never used it. The reason why is I used a Keratin treatment right when I purchased this and for best results, the keratin treatment instructions suggested not using any products with Sodium Chloride in them which, unfortunately this conditioner had. I had wanted to cut down on using shampoos in general and had researched natural protein conditioners to use as a cleanser instead. This one had high reviews so I bought it. It arrived very fast though so that was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;I have long since used this product and forgot to update my review therefore now a 2. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me but I only used it once. Not sure if used too much or what but my hair was hard and sticky afterwards. Still have it and may use again in a different way from what the myriads of hairblogs that had suggested it.</li>
            <li> Shedding has stopped after a couple of uses. Only downside it leaves hair hard but nothing a good conditioner will not correct!</li>
            <li> because I have used it for years and like it and can&#x27;t find anywhere&#x27;s in Las vegas where I can buy it</li>
            <li> I only used this once because it was hard to distribute and it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> I use this as conditioner (before wash) for my hair and/or rinse (after shampoo and regular conditioner).  As conditioner:  leave it on hair (shower cap on for heat penetration) 20 min to an hour or so (when I have the time).  Strengthens the hair!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely AMAZING.  My hair is very weak and brittle because of my thyroid issues but once I put this stuff on it INSTANTLY strengthens my strands.  A little bit goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this stuff is watery and stinks to high heaven (like soy sauce), so what I did is mix it with my sulfate free shampoo and it worked just as well.  Ladies and gents, if you need to strengthen your hair, please try this, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used is product for years like to use it in my hair color when doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! Fast responds &amp; delivery!!! Great Quality!!! Everyone has to buy this product!!!  It really dose help your hair grow with full strength!!!! &amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I love this product! I did not purchase it here but I must say when I bought it(as all the other reviews say) it IS very runny and smells BUT my solution is that whenever I use this product I mix it with one of my keratin conditioners. By doing this, it holds, it does not run, and the smell is &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; by my other conditioner. I only mix them right before use. And I leave it in for about 30 minutes, rinse out and style. It comes out feeling soft, feeling healthy and looks healthy too. I used it by itself only the first time and never again lol I have been mixing it with my other conditioner ever since. I have been using this for over a year now. I have less breakage and my hair is much stronger. I love this product. But I would not reccommend using it by itself. Mix away!</li>
            <li> I have not permed my hair in years, so l decided to make the change because l sweat in my head and on a hot day water just literally flows from my head, and you can guess what that means for straightened hair (I live on a tropical island). I have a few greys scattered over the entire head but a large patch in the front, so when l got my perm l decided to colour a few days later but there was greys to be found. (During the processing of my hair the hairdresser used this stuff LIBERALLY)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product as a protein treatment.</li>
            <li> I was using this product back in the nineties when i remove my weave from head. this product will strengthen and grow your hair even its damaged. I started using this protein soy sauce product again it is worth every penny. some people say it stink, stink stuff works for me.</li>
            <li> Just once month is all you need to make your hair feel and look full, healthy, and shiny.  It smells aweful but believe me it works. It naturally repairs damaged and thin hair&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in NYC anymore.</li>
            <li> used this long ago...  very good for damaged hair...</li>
