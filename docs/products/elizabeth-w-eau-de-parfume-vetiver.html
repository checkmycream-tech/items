            <li>I have never received so many compliments when wearing a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume and have worn it for years.</li>
            <li>I wear more in the winter, it&#x27;s what I would call a more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; smelling fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>This is not an overwhelming flowery scent but more spicy.</li>
            <li>We both love the scent of vetiver.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the Neroli which wasn&#x27;t available thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wear the Royall Vetiver and Lime as my signature scents and decided to get her this more light and feminine scent.</li>
            <li>This one is so unique and lovely.  </li>
            <li>I started using the body lotion, and the scent is so beautiful that I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>Leaves a light, lingering scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those light clean smelling fragrance.  </li>
            <li>bought Vetiver by Elizabeth W for the first time while in San Francisco and love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and packed well.    </li>
            <li>It is a favorite of mine and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Crisp and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>smells nice but scent does not stay very long</li>
            <li>This fragrance is light and pretty long lasting and for the price it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>She LOVES it and has already bought more of the other fragrances from Elizabeth W, she&#x27;s become a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I love it, especially in the warmer months</li>
            <li>I discovered this at a jewelry store in Salem, MA, which, unfortunately closed its doors after many years.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat these perfumes, lotions &amp; soaps of Eliz W &amp; the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It wears nicely for several hours, but I would suggest \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; mid day.</li>
            <li>found it on Amazon for a decent price...</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was pleased that Amazon has a partner who carries it -- with free shipping, too!</li>
            <li>I am not into heavy perfumes and prefer the clean, fresh fragrances out there.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t smell as nice as  my last few shipment&#x27;s ,I guess I don&#x27;t understand why?</li>
            <li>Wow, what is that and who is wearing it????</li>
            <li>#34;I am allergic&amp;#34; because I developed an immediate headache.  </li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, I got onto an airport shuttle that had 6 other people onboard and two of them immediately said:  </li>

            <li> I discovered this fragrance in San Francisco and LOVE IT!  I am not into heavy perfumes and prefer the clean, fresh fragrances out there.  This one is so unique and lovely.  The first time I wore it, I got onto an airport shuttle that had 6 other people onboard and two of them immediately said:  Wow, what is that and who is wearing it????</li>
            <li> We got this on a trip one year and now my mom is crazy about it.  I order it for her 2x a year.  I personally hate the smell but she loves it and says that everyone always asks her what it is that it smells great.</li>
            <li> Great scent, not overpowering. This fragrance is light and pretty long lasting and for the price it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is nice and light and adjusts to your body&#x27;s chemistry. I keep an extra one on hand. It wears nicely for several hours, but I would suggest \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; mid day.</li>
            <li> I started using the body lotion, and the scent is so beautiful that I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I wish more people knew about it. I just happened to be in San Francisco and found it by chance.</li>
            <li> The best the best the best! I love the vetiver scent. It smells great and stays with me all day.</li>
            <li> Found this while in Block Island a couple of years ago. I am purchasing my second bottle because I cannot get enough of this. I also use it as a room spray. Wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> bought Vetiver by Elizabeth W for the first time while in San Francisco and love the scent.  found it on Amazon for a decent price...I will always wear this!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  Leaves a light, lingering scent.</li>
            <li> I have never received so many compliments when wearing a fragrance.  Crisp and fresh smell.  I love it, especially in the warmer months</li>

            <li> I love this perfume and have worn it for years. It is my go to fragrance, and there isn&#x27;t a time that someone doesn&#x27;t comment on how great I smell.  It&#x27;s one of those light clean smelling fragrance.  I also wear the fragrance &amp;#34;Leaves&amp;#34; by Elizabeth W as well, it&#x27;s totally different than the Vetiver.  Leaves I wear more in the winter, it&#x27;s what I would call a more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; smelling fragrance.  You can&#x27;t beat these perfumes, lotions &amp; soaps of Eliz W &amp; the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume. It was delivered quickly and packed well.    thanks</li>
            <li> smells nice but scent does not stay very long</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  This is with out a doubt the best smelling product I have ever used.  My favorite is the Neroli which wasn&#x27;t available thru Amazon.  Wonderful product, inlcuding lotions and bath gelee.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth W.&#x27;s vetiver scent rocks the Casbah.  It&#x27;s my Bono, my hero, my savior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like vetiver scents which are slightly feminine, this is the product for you. I&#x27;ve been purchasing Elizabeth W.&#x27;s vetiver scent for over 3 years now.  You will not find a similar scent anywhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, there is no selection for &amp;#34;I am allergic&amp;#34; because I developed an immediate headache.  I wanted another fragrance of the elizabethW (that is correct, at least that is the way it&#x27;s spelled on my bottle) and they simply did not have it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I don&#x27;t believe you want to show my rating,eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beverly Rutledge</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim, missing an old vetiver perfume that I used to have.  This one did not disappoint.  I am very pleased with it.  If you like the stronger herbal scents, this one is for you.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t smell as nice as  my last few shipment&#x27;s ,I guess I don&#x27;t understand why? .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean scent. I love this but very expensive (for me). I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a &amp;#34;bubble gum&amp;#34; brand of perfume, then forget about buying this product. The scent is sophisticated and layers nicely with the Elizabeth W Body Lotion. It is a favorite of mine and I highly recommend this product.This is not an overwhelming flowery scent but more spicy.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume and the matching lotion for my aunt for Mother&#x27;s Day. We both love the scent of vetiver. I wear the Royall Vetiver and Lime as my signature scents and decided to get her this more light and feminine scent. She LOVES it and has already bought more of the other fragrances from Elizabeth W, she&#x27;s become a huge fan.</li>
