    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this product for washing the important parts ;) NO perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Good old fashioned product</li>
            <li> Fast and secure shipping.  Ivory liquid soap leaves you clean with no residue or heavy perfume smell. I love it.</li>
            <li> We prefer the light scent and normal (not antibacterial) soap that Ivory offers.  Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t find it locally in any stores.  Hooray for amazon.  Next time, we may go for a larger quantity to refill all of our dispensers around the house.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MANY USES,  I NEED IT FOR CLEANSING MY PROSTHETICS .&lt;br /&gt;We fo;und that many retail stores no longer handle this great product.  We now use it in all our hand soap dispensers.,</li>
            <li> One of the very few &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; liquid soaps that really is unscented. I should actually, to be accurate call it liquid detergent as the term &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; refers to the old fashioned bars.</li>
            <li> this is a clear liquid likes it better when it was a creamy white  doent seem to lather as well as old style</li>
            <li> This is the best soap, I use it in the bathroom and kitchen. No strong scent and doesn&#x27;t have anitbacterial ingredients.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in brick and mortar stores so I found through research and reviews here that P&amp;G has discontinued it.  I have started stocking up.  Those who are concerned about scent, it is very mild in the bottle, but I don&#x27;t think it is overpowering or can be smelled on your hands.  I don&#x27;t like overly-scented products so I wouldn&#x27;t use it if it did.</li>
            <li> I love the original Ivory liquid hand soap, and the stores aren&#x27;t carrying it any longer for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the order I received is one I&#x27;ve seen on the reviews that others have experienced -- several of the lids were loose and soap had leaked.  Don&#x27;t know why the vendor can&#x27;t hand-tighten the caps before packing and shipping them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find liquid soap that doesn&#x27;t have smelly perfumes or unneeded antibacterial additives.  This soap fits the bill perfectly.  It does a great job cleaning your hands, and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like perfume or leave a oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for soap that&#x27;s just soap, this is it!</li>
            <li> Clear soap, nice light scent.  Ivory cleans greasy hands using a smaller amount then our previous liquid handsoap.  Really wish I could find bigger refill bottles here on Amazon, but grateful to be able to buy it here.  This Ivory is a winner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, it&#x27;s soap, what more could you want? No fragrance, no iffy anti-bacterial stuff, no dye. It works great to clean your hands.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ivory for many years and it is great. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the whole antimicrobial scare that so many have been talking about.</li>
            <li> only hand soap i ever use for years...</li>
            <li> Cannot find this item in the stores anymore.  Ivory has a pleasant non-offensive smell to those with allergies are sensitive too.  Glad that we could find this product on Amazon.  Arrived with 6 containers which should last for some time.  Glad not to walk around without an offensive odor.  We gave a very clean feeling after each use.</li>
            <li> Here in NH, it has been getting very difficult to find liquid soap without anti-bacterial additives and perfumes. While we were aware of and preferred Ivory Liquid Soap over all others, our grocers and our drug stores ceased carrying it on a consistent basis, especially in larger, more cost effective sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I resorted to Amazon, purchasing a six pack of Ivory Liquid Soap in the 16 ounce size. The price was competitive. It arrived very quickly using Prime shipping. Our household of two will not be running out of soap for a long time to come. I can end my futile searches of the confusing arrays on the liquid soap shelves at local vendors on every trip into town. What is this obsession with anti-bacterial poisons in liquid soap and all the added stinkums?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use Ivory in our bathroom vanity soap dispensers and also in the shower soap dispenser. It has no offensive perfumes. It pretty much smells like the bar of Ivory soap we used when we were kids. Hands and body feel clean. The soap rinses off quickly, without leaving a slimy, persistent coating. It cleans up greasy work hands well. I use the soap for the occasional shampoo. It&#x27;s strong, but it can&#x27;t hurt a bristle cut like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this product a four star rating instead of a five is a problem that other reviewers have mentioned as well. You might experience some product leakage occurring during shipping. The caps are not screwed on very tightly and there is no membrane seal under the cap. Six out of six of our containers had leaked and were a sticky mess. Though we were lucky to not experience any catastrophic loss of product, others have. A simple hand tightening of each container before packing would take care of most of this problem. Thankfully, the product we are talking about is soap. It cleans up, as if one were using, uh, soap. I will still use this product and this source despite the leakage. I might change my mind if I receive half empty bottles of soap in a leaking box delivered by a cursing UPS agent.</li>
            <li> I recommend to my patients, family and friends to use soaps that do not contain additional antimicrobial additives.  Ivory Liquid Hand Soap is one of the few appropriate liquid soaps currently available. (Regular soap kills germs sufficiently, antimicrobial soap can sensitize and damage skin negating their original intent.  Plus antimicrobial soaps may be contributing to the selection of resistant species...in your own home! )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelves of my local brick and mortar stores are loaded with unnecessarily toxic soaps and I shudder to think of what those soaps are doing to a generation of kids and their parents.  Look at it this way:  you&#x27;re washing your hands for dinner, not prepping for bare-handed cardiothoracic surgery.  Ivory is a decent, gentle liquid soap that gets the job done.  I&#x27;m glad I can get this via Amazon when my local stores have run out of it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this product in the stores any more.  I was glad to find it here and be able to buy it in a multi pack.</li>
            <li> I love this soap because it is gentle on my skin but works great and has a great price.  You can refill your soap dispenser of use the flip top on this product.</li>
