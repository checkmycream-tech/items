            <li>The scent is amazing!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing !</li>
            <li>I was tempted to get myself this perfume after a good recommendation in a woman&#x27;s magazine (Norway: HENNE) .</li>

            <li>It has a nice light floral smell to it.</li>
            <li>After that more like watered ...</li>
            <li>No, this amber is sophisticated and even a bit</li>
            <li>My friend introduce this to me and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Once I see that I am about done, it&#x27;s time to order more.  :)</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>y love Amber</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the price of AG is ever-steadily rising, and it&#x27;s becoming a bit &#x27;precious&#x27; here in the UK</li>
            <li>First couple of days was kind of strong.</li>
            <li>I have had an excellent experience with buying fragrances from Amazon, and found their price to be almost half of what Ambre Gris sells for at a boutique, so</li>
            <li>because it is still very nice and it was only $35.</li>
            <li>NOT the original box.</li>
            <li>I bought this lovely, warm scent from a different online shopping site</li>
            <li>I think the best word for this scent is &amp;#34;pleasant.&amp;#34;  The classy gray bottle suggests to me a more serious or dark scent, but there was something very pleasant and uplifting about it.  </li>
            <li>Granted, we pay for the packaging as well, and I have yet to discover any DIY bottle worthy of the ingredients and true passion I put into my tinctures, so...</li>

            <li>So, my point in stating the latter is that I have fallen, hard, for this amazing, warm, cosy scent!</li>
            <li>Still very pretty to wear and for $35, I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Most likely will continue using it...</li>
            <li>Indeed a &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; for me this fall ;)</li>
            <li>pretty</li>
            <li>In fact, so much so, I&#x27;ve embarked upon a new endeavour of creating my own scents using essential and fragrance oils, as well as chemical compounds.</li>
            <li>one of the things that makes this fragrance so endearing is that it&#x27;s far more affordable than products with far less integrity, charm, and allure.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>very Amber&lt;br</li>
            <li>much for me</li>
            <li>Ambré Gris is a bit of a play on words; French for &#x27;Grey Amber&#x27;, which is really befitting, as there is an outstanding, although neither an overpowering nor musty/outdated smelling, amber here.</li>
            <li>Smells great but seems to be watered down, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite chuffed that I&#x27;ve found an affordable scent that I can positively douse myself in on a daily basis.    </li>
            <li>What you get with AG, are soft, powdery, amber/benzoin/incense notes with just enough salty-skin (ambergris), grey driftwood undertones to save you from smelling of a cheap face powder compact (Nand. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I would say the strength of the bottle from Amazon is kind of weak.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Mild and flowery, but last long.</li>
            <li>Neither a simple nor inexpensive journey, however, but I tired of trying sample after sample, falling in love with a scent, only to find a full bottle prohibitively pricey...time after time after time.</li>
            <li>new condition.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with a simple taped together cardboard covering.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is not terribly expensive.  </li>
            <li>With my particular bottle, the fragrance is how I remember it from the sample, however it does not last half as long as the sample, in terms of staying power on my skin, and it quiets down to a soft skin scent very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the scent dissipates very quickly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this scent. delicious.  and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Love it! Beautiful packaging as well. Smells wonderful and I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely order again soon! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had wanted this fragrance since I&lt;br /&gt;First smelled it at Neiman Marcus. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in price. Product was the same, from France, same ounces.</li>
            <li> I think the best word for this scent is &amp;#34;pleasant.&amp;#34;  The classy gray bottle suggests to me a more serious or dark scent, but there was something very pleasant and uplifting about it.  Love the bottle, too.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light floral smell to it. I adore it. a classic scent That I love to layer with another scent at times .</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  I&#x27;m not fond of floral scents, so the woodsy character of this perfume appeals to me.  My only complaint is that the scent dissipates very quickly.  If I spray it on clothing, it lasts a bit longer, but I don&#x27;t always want to scent my clothing.  I find that I must reapply often.  On the other hand, it is not terribly expensive.  I always thought that eau do parfum was stronger than eau do toilette, so this is puzzling.</li>
            <li> My daily go to perfume. I can&#x27;t believe the price.</li>
            <li> First couple of days was kind of strong. After that more like watered ...fading ...I can&#x27;t smell it&lt;br /&gt;However, I like it. Most likely will continue using it...</li>
            <li> I was tempted to get myself this perfume after a good recommendation in a woman&#x27;s magazine (Norway: HENNE) . The scent is amazing! It sticks on your body and clothes even to the next day. Mild and flowery, but last long. I never left home without a spray. Indeed a &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; for me this fall ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this lovely, warm scent from a different online shopping site but I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers it as well so my resources never run dry. This is how much I adore Ambré Gris, and let me tell you, I have been fascinated with and have immersed myself in the universe of fragrance for at least 35 years. In fact, so much so, I&#x27;ve embarked upon a new endeavour of creating my own scents using essential and fragrance oils, as well as chemical compounds. Neither a simple nor inexpensive journey, however, but I tired of trying sample after sample, falling in love with a scent, only to find a full bottle prohibitively pricey...time after time after time. Granted, we pay for the packaging as well, and I have yet to discover any DIY bottle worthy of the ingredients and true passion I put into my tinctures, so...I&#x27;m quite chuffed that I&#x27;ve found an affordable scent that I can positively douse myself in on a daily basis.    So, my point in stating the latter is that I have fallen, hard, for this amazing, warm, cosy scent! I&#x27;ve stumbled upon a beautiful juice, in an absolutely gorgeous bottle--at an affordable price?? Am I dreaming? What you get with AG, are soft, powdery, amber/benzoin/incense notes with just enough salty-skin (ambergris), grey driftwood undertones to save you from smelling of a cheap face powder compact (Nand. &#x27;Pink&#x27;, are you listening?). Ambré Gris is a bit of a play on words; French for &#x27;Grey Amber&#x27;, which is really befitting, as there is an outstanding, although neither an overpowering nor musty/outdated smelling, amber here. No, this amber is sophisticated and even a bit..tweedy? A periwinkle, gold-rimmed sun dip, over the pearly grey stones of a quiet seashore...soft, salt breezes buffeted by rustling dry reeds and white driftwood. Incredible.     I&#x27;ve noticed that the price of AG is ever-steadily rising, and it&#x27;s becoming a bit &#x27;precious&#x27; here in the UK were I now reside. NOOOO!! I understand the concept of supply and demand, and I appreciate good commerce as much as the next guy, however...one of the things that makes this fragrance so endearing is that it&#x27;s far more affordable than products with far less integrity, charm, and allure. Let&#x27;s keep this little treasure buried, please.</li>
            <li> RaJuR real deep kool on the web and YOUTUBE!!!  APPROVED</li>
            <li> Smells amazing ! Perfect fall/winter smell</li>
            <li> My friend introduce this to me and I fell in love with it.  I purchase the lotion and perfume.  Once I see that I am about done, it&#x27;s time to order more.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing lots of perfumes lately, and I must say this one Balmain Ambre Gris is the one for me. Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice parfum very Amber&lt;br /&gt;to much for me but it stays on very&lt;br /&gt;nicely i will try another balmain&lt;br /&gt;if y love Amber this is for y&lt;br /&gt;so pretty</li>
            <li> Smells great but seems to be watered down, it doesn&#x27;t last long. Makes me wonder if I was sold a knock off..</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of this before I bought it from Amazon, and I really like Ambre Gris, it is a very cozy and comforting scent.  I have had an excellent experience with buying fragrances from Amazon, and found their price to be almost half of what Ambre Gris sells for at a boutique, so I thought I&#x27;d take the opportunity.  With my particular bottle, the fragrance is how I remember it from the sample, however it does not last half as long as the sample, in terms of staying power on my skin, and it quiets down to a soft skin scent very quickly.  I would say the strength of the bottle from Amazon is kind of weak.  Still very pretty to wear and for $35, I won&#x27;t complain too much. I am a bit disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t last as long and project as powerfully on my skin as my sample does.  This is the only fragrance that I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon (and I&#x27;ve bought quite a few) where I started to wonder if I&#x27;d somehow received an old or possibly watered-down product.  Everything else I&#x27;ve bought here has been of excellent quality.  I chose not to return it (I don&#x27;t think I can return a fragrance, can I?) because it is still very nice and it was only $35. So I will happily spray with abandon!</li>
            <li> I specifically chose the \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; option so that I would get the box and perfume in \\&quot;brand new condition.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with a simple taped together cardboard covering. NOT the original box. I would call that \\&quot;unboxed\\&quot; not \\&quot;brand new\\&quot;.</li>
