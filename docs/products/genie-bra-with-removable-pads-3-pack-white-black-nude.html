    <ol>
            <li>Great price also!</li>
            <li>While they are not the best sports bra out there, they serve the purpose for me to wear them around the house and sleep in.</li>
            <li>It fits and looks great!</li>
            <li>However they fit my mom perfectly.</li>
            <li>and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>The fit and support were perfect.</li>
            <li>But I guess I was thinking Genie was synonymous with magic!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>will buy more!</li>
            <li>The bra also gives your chest a nice amount of support</li>
            <li>I like this kind of bra.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable, very satisfied</li>
            <li>great fit, easy to wear even after surgery</li>
            <li>Love these bras.</li>
            <li>I love the removable pads.</li>
            <li>I am somewhere between sizes on most bras between a 36 - 38 an between a B and C cup size.</li>
            <li>After many washes I noticed the inserts fall out almost every time and the inserts started to wrinkle and the fabric of inserts started to come undone.</li>
            <li>I love my Genie&#x27; Bras.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely, Jan P., Huntington Beach, CA</li>
            <li>Being a skinny girl most of my life, I would never have guessed that someday I would need an XL anything, but there you have it.  </li>
            <li>Anything more than that and the Genie Bra is not what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>The bra;s were perfect, I just ordered the wrong size, I did pick them up in the correct size and they do a wonderful job for sleeping and just hanging around the house use.</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you are more than a C cup or a &amp;#34;36 long&amp;#34; as they say, don&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable bra I own.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the comfort.</li>
            <li>Ordering more today again.</li>
            <li>I purchased is more like an XL instead of</li>
            <li>a plus size 1X where there is more room.</li>
            <li>I think I am going to enjoy wearing them a lot!</li>
            <li>I should have bought more</li>
            <li>Love the fit, feel and comfort of the genie bras.</li>
            <li>LOVE THESE - so comfortable</li>
            <li>I really wanted these to be good.</li>
            <li>ooh, I&#x27;m a full &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; now!  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash.</li>
            <li>One fit better then another but still fit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for around the house or to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable and look fine under my clothes.  </li>
            <li>They fit just fine</li>
            <li>and they are so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I needed a bra to fit and be comfortable all day...</li>
            <li>as you know you don&#x27;t get fit and comfort in a bra</li>
            <li>They are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>The fit and support me with comfort.</li>
            <li>I bought originally at Walmart</li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure it is the real Genie bra.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, and would have bought everyone, but they have no support for women with real breasts that have any sag at all.</li>
            <li>most were saying size is smaller than expected but for me it was the perfect size for me xl</li>
            <li>I loved these bras so much I decided to get rid of almost all my normal underwire bras and switch to these.</li>
            <li>And the foam deteriorates quickly with machine washing and drying.  </li>
            <li>I bought a single Genie Bra at a store, and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>The fit is a bit snug so I would order a size larger than you normally wear if you want more comfort.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough the more I wear these bras</li>
            <li>First off, these did not arrive in the box that Genie Bras come in, they were in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>The Large works for me.</li>
            <li>so they are the real thing.</li>
            <li>They are extremely reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them and in fact, have already done so!  </li>
            <li>Hides back fat and gives a smooth look on sides.</li>
            <li>was really looking forward to this</li>
            <li>Material is much thinner, and will not hold like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy them again.</li>
            <li>I have ready the review after I have purchased this and</li>
            <li>They were shipped from China, so I have no idea if they are really Genie bras or not.  </li>
            <li>Price much better than other retailers.</li>
            <li>But they are very comfortable and provide enough support for daily wearing.</li>
            <li>This is the sole reason I buy from Amazon &amp; not eBay....but will be more diligent to purchase SOLD &amp; SHIPPED BY AMAZON items only.</li>
            <li>The genie bra fit as expected.</li>
            <li>I might be able to wear this for that long, but not in public.</li>
            <li>Now, I needed to get new ones and could not find them in the store in my size, so I checked Amazon and found these.</li>
            <li>Hard to get on but very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The material feels different, the fitting or cut of them is slightly off.</li>
            <li>36&amp;#34;-- plus my one-inch boobs for a grand total of 37&amp;#34;-- yet their &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; is way too tight.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I have purchased these bras and they fit as expected.  </li>
            <li>came in clear plastic bag with no tags.</li>
            <li>After being poked and prodded with underwire bras it is a relief to find something that supports yet is so soft.  </li>
            <li>the pads were round (which I liked) but different and stitching was different and the elastic bunched &amp; gave me a rash.  </li>
            <li>The pads are nice and thin so your skin still breaths</li>
            <li>And the bottom band rolls right up, as I expected it would.</li>
            <li>The white is really bright white which is not good under a lighter fabric.</li>
            <li>the first one,white,that I put on,had a tear in the back shoulder strap,very flimsy workman ship,I will not return the shipment,since it was only 18 something for 3,but</li>
            <li>They are not super wide but they do show when I wear them under a sleeveless shirt Update: My order came in an Amazon box but the bras were not in any special packaging just a clear plastic bag.</li>

            <li> I decided to keep them because they serve my purpose, but I do not believe they are going to last as long.</li>
            <li> Too hard to get on and off for ladies with large breasts.  </li>
            <li> They also hide any embarrassing bumps that may pop out if you get cold:)</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t fit and the size was 2x sorry</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long before trying it.  </li>
            <li> These are made for taller people, the straps were so long that they do not give support.</li>
            <li> I like them very much, but the black one is too small.  </li>
            <li> I have other Genie Bra&#x27;s and this one is not of the same quality.  </li>
            <li> I have searched for at least 30 years for a comfortable bra that I can where for at least 18 hours.</li>
            <li> I have to wash them carefully by hand and air dry them because otherwise the pads fold over and move around inside the cup.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is to have the straps be a little narrower.</li>
            <li> I ordered the XL but it was a little big for me.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Here when expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little small, but I can live with them.</li>
            <li> The bottom rolls up, the left strap slips off, and the pads are stiff and move around.  </li>
            <li> They are all supposed to be the same size (and they are all snug), but the black one is way too tight.</li>
            <li> Product too small around the chest and back.</li>
            <li> I would never purchase this item again,I am giving the other 2 to a friend,lets see how she likes them</li>
            <li> It was not offensive enough for me to return as I usually just wear them around the house.</li>
            <li> not criss cross making it hard to wear some tank tops.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t &amp; still slide down my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I would prefer that they came in a three pack of 2 nude, one black; or 3 nude.</li>
            <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve been a AA and because I hated wearing a bra, I just didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Does not properly fit</li>
            <li> no zipper and run small.</li>
            <li> I ordered 1X because all reviews had said they run small.</li>
            <li> When washing, the pads come out or move and they are difficult to get back into place.</li>
            <li> but it was too small.</li>
            <li> Insert pad are too small for cup size and roll around.</li>
            <li> They run small n</li>
            <li> Its my fault its too small, not yours.</li>
            <li> So I really need to wear a bra, but I still hate them -- until now.  </li>
            <li> So there are a few of mine I can no longer wear with the inserts :(</li>
            <li> Although Iwas sent the wrong size it worked out.</li>
            <li> I am returning it, sad</li>
            <li> The triangle inserts misaligned my breasts awkwardly.  </li>
            <li> However, unless you like being constricted, don&#x27;t believe their SIZE CHART because it is so wrong!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Buy one or two size up</li>
            <li> Love these bras. I bought originally at Walmart but there you only get a two pack for $19.99 here you get 3. I loved these bras so much I decided to get rid of almost all my normal underwire bras and switch to these. I love the removable pads. The pads are nice and thin so your skin still breaths and you can not tell it is padded if you are wearing a thinner shirt. They also hide any embarrassing bumps that may pop out if you get cold:) The bra also gives your chest a nice amount of support so I can even wear them when I work out. Strangely enough the more I wear these bras the firmer my breast get. I guess the muscles are building up since they no longer rely on a wire to hold them up. I am somewhere between sizes on most bras between a 36 - 38 an between a B and C cup size. I also tend to wear between a size 12 and 14 shirt. I tried both the LG genie bra and the XL and found I prefer the L. The Xl is slightly to big in the cup area but the LG fits well. The only thing I would change is to have the straps be a little narrower. They are not super wide but they do show when I wear them under a sleeveless shirt Update: My order came in an Amazon box but the bras were not in any special packaging just a clear plastic bag. THey did all have to Genie bra logo on the inside of the bra so they are the real thing. I ordered the XL but it was a little big for me. However they fit my mom perfectly. She tend to wear an XL to 2XL shirt and has a size C bra. The Large works for me. Update After many washes I noticed the inserts fall out almost every time and the inserts started to wrinkle and the fabric of inserts started to come undone. So there are a few of mine I can no longer wear with the inserts :(</li>
            <li> I love my Genie&#x27; Bras.  I have now purchased 5 of them and wear them exclusively.  They are so comfortable and look fine under my clothes.  They are extremely reasonable in price.  I would highly recommend them and in fact, have already done so!  Sincerely, Jan P., Huntington Beach, CA</li>
            <li> The genie bra fit as expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely are being returned as they are not Gene Bras.....no zipper and run small.</li>
            <li> Love the fit, feel and comfort of the genie bras. Hides back fat and gives a smooth look on sides. Great price also!</li>
            <li> After being poked and prodded with underwire bras it is a relief to find something that supports yet is so soft.  I even ordered some for my daughter in law because I gave her one of the 3 I got in the mail and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> I ordered 1X because all reviews had said they run small. I received the XL and sent a message to the seller and they said that was the same thing!  Would not order from them again. I am not 100% sure it is the real Genie bra. When washing, the pads come out or move and they are difficult to get back into place. I bought because the one I bought at Wal-Mart, the straps stayed in place. These don&#x27;t &amp; still slide down my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve been a AA and because I hated wearing a bra, I just didn&#x27;t.  Now I&#x27;m well into my 50&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve gained a cup size... ooh, I&#x27;m a full &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; now!  So I really need to wear a bra, but I still hate them -- until now.  Genie is my version of the &amp;#34;Miracle Bra&amp;#34;, because it&#x27;s a miracle that I will wear one!  However, unless you like being constricted, don&#x27;t believe their SIZE CHART because it is so wrong!  For instance, I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and weigh about 145 and wear a Size 8-10 dress.  My chest measures 36&amp;#34;-- plus my one-inch boobs for a grand total of 37&amp;#34;-- yet their &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; is way too tight.  Being a skinny girl most of my life, I would never have guessed that someday I would need an XL anything, but there you have it.  I prefer comfort over all else, so XL it is!</li>
            <li> Although Iwas sent the wrong size it worked out. The XL was plenty big enough.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Genie Bras in the store before. While they are not the best sports bra out there, they serve the purpose for me to wear them around the house and sleep in. Anything more than that and the Genie Bra is not what you&#x27;re looking for. Now, I needed to get new ones and could not find them in the store in my size, so I checked Amazon and found these. First off, these did not arrive in the box that Genie Bras come in, they were in a plastic bag. Second, I compared them to the ones I already have and there are some differences. The material feels different, the fitting or cut of them is slightly off. The straps are wider apart so I tend to have to push the straps back up on my shoulders. Lastly, the printed tag information that is on the back of all the Genie Bras is coming off on these bras. I decided to keep them because they serve my purpose, but I do not believe they are going to last as long.</li>
            <li> Does not properly fit</li>
            <li> Straps stay where they are supposed to. The bra itself does not ride up when you lift your arms...big plus!!  The fit is a bit snug so I would order a size larger than you normally wear if you want more comfort. I like the removal pads since I can remove them when I work out. Easy to wash. Travels well. I would prefer that they came in a three pack of 2 nude, one black; or 3 nude. The white is really bright white which is not good under a lighter fabric. I would order these again.</li>
            <li> The bra;s were perfect, I just ordered the wrong size, I did pick them up in the correct size and they do a wonderful job for sleeping and just hanging around the house use.</li>
            <li> Too hard to get on and off for ladies with large breasts.  Only wore one once and then gave away.</li>
            <li> was really looking forward to this but it was too small. I am returning it, sad it didn&#x27;t fit and the size was 2x sorry</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to be good. I have searched for at least 30 years for a comfortable bra that I can where for at least 18 hours. But this isn&#x27;t it either. I might be able to wear this for that long, but not in public. Ladies, if you are more than a C cup or a &amp;#34;36 long&amp;#34; as they say, don&#x27;t get these. I love the colors, and would have bought everyone, but they have no support for women with real breasts that have any sag at all. And the bottom band rolls right up, as I expected it would. But I guess I was thinking Genie was synonymous with magic!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased these bras and they fit as expected.  I knew there was not much support, but I like the soft, stretchy band for summer time. I like how the straps stay on shoulders and not criss cross making it hard to wear some tank tops.</li>
            <li> I will never wear a traditional bra again. genie bras are the only bra for me for the rest of my life .</li>
            <li> One fit better then another but still fit</li>
            <li> I have other Genie Bra&#x27;s and this one is not of the same quality.  Material is much thinner, and will not hold like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I have ready the review after I have purchased this and most were saying size is smaller than expected but for me it was the perfect size for me xl I wear 39-40 D</li>
            <li> They do roll up. Insert pad are too small for cup size and roll around.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable bra I own.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long before trying it.  Money well spent.</li>
            <li> No complaints. LOVE the comfort. Here when expected. Price much better than other retailers. Thank you. Ordering more today again.</li>
            <li> They run small n I suggest it be posted in the information about the bras</li>
            <li> Hard to get on but very comfortable. Can wear all day without tugging or pulling</li>
            <li> Product too small around the chest and back. Couldn&#x27;t wait to get it off.</li>
            <li> The size 1X I purchased is more like an XL instead of a plus size 1X where there is more room.</li>
            <li> great fit, easy to wear even after surgery</li>
            <li> I bought a single Genie Bra at a store, and absolutely loved it. The fit and support were perfect. These bras, however, ate designed somewhat diffrrently. The coverage is not quite as ample, and the materisl is thinner, affecting the support. You get what you pay for, I guess. No deal here.</li>
            <li> They fit just fine and they are so comfortable.  I think I am going to enjoy wearing them a lot!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE - so comfortable</li>
            <li> Love it! will buy more!</li>
            <li> I ordered a 1X but received a XL for all three. They&#x27;re a little small, but I can live with them. I just can&#x27;t breathe.</li>
            <li> I needed a bra to fit and be comfortable all day...as you know you don&#x27;t get fit and comfort in a bra but with these you do..I should have bought more</li>
            <li> I have to wash them carefully by hand and air dry them because otherwise the pads fold over and move around inside the cup.  And the foam deteriorates quickly with machine washing and drying.  But they are very comfortable and provide enough support for daily wearing.</li>
            <li> These are made for taller people, the straps were so long that they do not give support.</li>
            <li> I like this kind of bra.  It fits and looks great!</li>
            <li> this item seems like counterfeit. came in clear plastic bag with no tags. to compare to my existing genie bras, these did not seem like from same manufacture, thus my concern they are counterfeit. the pads were round (which I liked) but different and stitching was different and the elastic bunched &amp; gave me a rash.  These are being returned.  Shame on Amazon for shipping this.  This is the sole reason I buy from Amazon &amp; not eBay....but will be more diligent to purchase SOLD &amp; SHIPPED BY AMAZON items only.</li>
            <li> the first one,white,that I put on,had a tear in the back shoulder strap,very flimsy workman ship,I will not return the shipment,since it was only 18 something for 3,but I would never purchase this item again,I am giving the other 2 to a friend,lets see how she likes them</li>
            <li> Its my fault its too small, not yours. I always get this size and didn&#x27;t even think about checking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be reordering the next size up.</li>
            <li> I like them very much, but the black one is too small.  They are all supposed to be the same size (and they are all snug), but the black one is way too tight.</li>
            <li> The triangle inserts misaligned my breasts awkwardly.  It was not offensive enough for me to return as I usually just wear them around the house. They are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, very satisfied</li>
            <li> This is not a comfy bra to wear every day.  It&#x27;s fine for around the house or to sleep in.  But it offers no real support for my D cups.  I would not buy it again.  I gave 2 of the 3 to my sister who is nursing a baby.  She said they work for wearing to bed.</li>
            <li> This bra is ill-fitting.  The bottom rolls up, the left strap slips off, and the pads are stiff and move around.  They were shipped from China, so I have no idea if they are really Genie bras or not.  I will probably end up giving them to charity and would not recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> I need the Genie Bras for work.  The fit and support me with comfort.</li>
