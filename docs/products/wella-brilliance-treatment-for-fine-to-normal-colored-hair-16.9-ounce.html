            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and smoothe, very good treatment for dry, damaged hair</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! Makes me feel like I&#x27;ve just left the salon!</li>

            <li> Great product for long, color treated hair. I use it very frequently in Summer when my hair can be drier than usual. Smells great too. Makes hair very soft and shiny and easy to detangle. Better than all Kerastase masks I have tried....and way cheaper.</li>

            <li> I love it. It give my hair brillance, radiance, makes it more manageable and above all my hair smells clean for two days until I wash it again.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST treatment for your hair!  My hair was drying out and was super knotty after washing.  This smooths and softens so wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. I have very course, chemically-treated hair and this really softens my hair after use. Be sure to follow instructions and leave the cream in hair for 5 minutes (or longer).</li>
            <li> Excellent product for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend that use to work at a salon! The reviews on the product looked great and with her recommendation I decided to give it a try! Product arrived right on time as expected &amp; I have to say that this product is pretty amazing I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it made my hair I used the product Monday night and it&#x27;s now Wednesday morning and my hair is still silky smooth I love it!!! Comparing how my hair naturally air dries (vs. using a blowdryer) with this product vs. using my regular shampoo/conditioner I was really amazed with the significant difference! The way I applied it was I put on the product and then put a cap over it and then used the blow dryer to put some heat on it ever few mins. My friend made a point that, that&#x27;s how they do it in the salon so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to put some heat on it.  I also left it on for about 15 mins. Def. highly recommend this product!</li>
