            <li>The scent is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, just as described in the promotion.</li>
            <li>Very Happy to see that it&#x27;s carried by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>very good and prompt attention.</li>
            <li>I wore this beautiful body powder in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, does the job, but</li>
            <li>I am happy</li>
            <li>Oh My goodness, I was so happy when I saw the Maja Dusting Powder.  </li>
            <li>My friend and I are both now enjoing a delightful, refreshing</li>
            <li>This talk is in a good looking container for my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The price is good and inviting also.</li>
            <li>She loved it...</li>
            <li>Shipping was prompt, and product was sealed and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE the fragrance of this!</li>
            <li>An olfactory triumph, makes you feel like a sexy babe!</li>
            <li>I ordered one for myself and one for a good friend who also has enjoyed Maja over the years.  </li>
            <li>I use a perfume that has notes of tonka bean, vanilla, and patchouli, and this complements the scent nicely.</li>
            <li>was shipped quick and is great.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Maja Dusting Powder.</li>
            <li>I also use the wonderful body lotion and soap daily.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I will prolly finish using it, but I won&#x27;t buy more of the scent...</li>
            <li>I have been using maja since I fell in love with the scent in 1954 - absolutely love it still.</li>
            <li>Exotic, spicy, what I imagine a harem bath would smell like, or a courtesan&#x27;s boudoir.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this body power most of my life.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Maja has been around for a long time; an excellent product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the webside in&lt;br /&gt;the future and continue to enjoy Maja with many delightful memories.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing it from Amazon after I read good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky and light in texture, and the seductive scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>loved opening this box of Maja dusting powder, being hit with that same, exotic smell.  </li>
            <li>RUNS OUT QUICKLY  </li>
            <li>I have been a long time fan of Maja products, and was delighted to remember that Maja has a dusting powder with the expected&lt;br /&gt;delightful fragrande.  </li>
            <li>I loved the look, and especially the scent, of that bar of soap so much that I saved it for years in the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very particular when choosing powder, as most perfume powders smell &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; and old to me.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, I would give it a five star but only giving it a four because the product is in cardboard container.  </li>
            <li>I felt that the scent was a bit more floral than the description left me feeling.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what comes to my mind as well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as dated smelling as some I have tried, but it certainly didn&#x27;t equal a smell I would call Sexy...</li>
            <li>This dusting powder is unusual in that it does have a relatively strong and lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very prompt and the product was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for being there for all of us fans and for the new&lt;br /&gt;customers who discover it based upon these reports.  </li>
            <li>The scent is unique and habit-forming, I have been using it for years and still find it a &#x27;necessary&#x27; for my grooming.  </li>
            <li>I ripped off half the covering because I love the large amount of powder that coats the puff.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely make future purchases exclusively from this seller!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would rather have my usual favorite scent, it isn&#x27;t made anymore</li>
            <li>I also looked for the product in Spain recently, and is was hard, but not impossible to locate there.  </li>

            <li> that carries a long memory for us.  </li>
            <li> My only hesitation is, that like bath powders I remember from my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom, the container is sealed with paper - am I supposed to poke holes in it or rip it off entirely or tear only a small hole in it?  </li>

            <li> It is the height of luxury to fluff this all over myself after my shower.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this and other Maja products for years.  </li>
            <li> I punch holes in a circular pattern (about the size of a half dollar), in the center of the protective paper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;to find the website, as the product is not easy to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> By the way, what does &amp;#34;prolly&amp;#34; mean?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff, use as body powder.  </li>
            <li> This has never been that expensive a product.</li>

            <li> I love, love, love Maja Dusting Powder. I also use the wonderful body lotion and soap daily.</li>
            <li> This dusting powder has a heavenly scent.  I&#x27;ve be using it for 40 years and will keep on using it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, I would give it a five star but only giving it a four because the product is in cardboard container.  I would have expected it to be in a plastic container.</li>
            <li> This talk is in a good looking container for my bathroom.  The scent is unique and habit-forming, I have been using it for years and still find it a &#x27;necessary&#x27; for my grooming.  The price is good and inviting also.</li>
            <li> mother has been using this for years.  she lived in spain for years when dad was in the navy, and if you buy this product from their website its alot more expensive.  was shipped quick and is great. my mom loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff, use as body powder.  Lovely.</li>
            <li> I felt that the scent was a bit more floral than the description left me feeling. It isn&#x27;t as dated smelling as some I have tried, but it certainly didn&#x27;t equal a smell I would call Sexy... so for dusting it&#x27;s great, does the job, but the scent was definitely not what I would want to use... I will prolly finish using it, but I won&#x27;t buy more of the scent...</li>
            <li> Smells both spicy and a wee bit floral. The scent is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been using maja since I fell in love with the scent in 1954 - absolutely love it still.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Mom and home.  Absolutely love it!  Highly recommend.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, just as described in the promotion. very good and prompt attention. the product was wrapped correctly. fulfilled expectations.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this and other Maja products for years.  We used to have to drive forty miles one way to get them.  The delivery was very prompt and the product was well packaged.  Maja has been around for a long time; an excellent product</li>
            <li> I wore this beautiful body powder in the 80&#x27;s. My younger sister has become a body power addict, so I bought her this to add to her collection. She loved it... Shipping was prompt, and product was sealed and in good condition.</li>
            <li> RUNS OUT QUICKLY  PURCHASE TWO  SMELLS DIVINE</li>
            <li> The fragrance has remained the same all these  years</li>
            <li> I would rather have my usual favorite scent, it isn&#x27;t made anymore so this will do. By the way, what does &amp;#34;prolly&amp;#34; mean? I can&#x27;t find it in any dictionary.</li>
            <li> Like the fragarance, will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of Maja products, and was delighted to remember that Maja has a dusting powder with the expected&lt;br /&gt;delightful fragrande.  I ordered one for myself and one for a good friend who also has enjoyed Maja over the years.  I am happy&lt;br /&gt;to find the website, as the product is not easy to find in stores.  My friend and I are both now enjoing a delightful, refreshing&lt;br /&gt;product that carries a long memory for us.  We used to go to Tiajuana and bought Maja there, but that is not currently a good&lt;br /&gt;idea.  I also looked for the product in Spain recently, and is was hard, but not impossible to locate there.  I&#x27;ll use the webside in&lt;br /&gt;the future and continue to enjoy Maja with many delightful memories.  Thanks for being there for all of us fans and for the new&lt;br /&gt;customers who discover it based upon these reports.  Joann Toll, Glendale,Californa</li>
            <li> This powder smells heavenly.  It is the height of luxury to fluff this all over myself after my shower.  My only hesitation is, that like bath powders I remember from my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom, the container is sealed with paper - am I supposed to poke holes in it or rip it off entirely or tear only a small hole in it?  I ripped off half the covering because I love the large amount of powder that coats the puff.  Oh, such a scent!  Exotic, spicy, what I imagine a harem bath would smell like, or a courtesan&#x27;s boudoir.</li>
            <li> I am very particular when choosing powder, as most perfume powders smell &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; and old to me. Maja is not that powder. It has the scent of lavender, spice, citrus, and woods. This was my first time purchasing it from Amazon after I read good reviews. Another reviewer suggested it reminded her of a courtesan&#x27;s boudoir.... And that&#x27;s exactly what comes to my mind as well. Think Moulin Rouge! I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s silky and light in texture, and the seductive scent lasts all day. I use a perfume that has notes of tonka bean, vanilla, and patchouli, and this complements the scent nicely. I punch holes in a circular pattern (about the size of a half dollar), in the center of the protective paper. Use after a bath, and after you&#x27;ve applied lotion. I will most definitely make future purchases exclusively from this seller!</li>
            <li> This dusting powder is unusual in that it does have a relatively strong and lasting fragrance.  The price is a little high for the amount provided, however.  This has never been that expensive a product.</li>
            <li> Almost bought standard Jean Nat&amp;eacute;. Glad I didn&#x27;t. LOVE the fragrance of this!</li>
            <li> Oh My goodness, I was so happy when I saw the Maja Dusting Powder.  Very Happy to see that it&#x27;s carried by Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using this body power most of my life. I stopped using body powder when I couldn&#x27;t find Maja.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My cousin got Maja soap for me on a trip he took to Europe in the 1960s.  I loved the look, and especially the scent, of that bar of soap so much that I saved it for years in the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved opening this box of Maja dusting powder, being hit with that same, exotic smell.  An olfactory triumph, makes you feel like a sexy babe!</li>
