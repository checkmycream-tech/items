            <li>And it smells nice too.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years still love it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product, it has helped with my under eye wrinkles.</li>

            <li>:)))</li>
            <li>I really love this product though and can recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Just love Clarins products.  </li>
            <li>Nice feel, smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard stories of people buying beauty product on here that weren&#x27;t authentic.</li>
            <li>After using this along with the Clarins daycream for about 3 months, my sister&#x27;s commented my skin had never looked better.</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years (practically since it came out).</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Oh well ! :)</li>
            <li>Its to soon to say for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li>While I wish it the product would tighten my eye lid skin more, I appreciate the brightening effect it has around the eye area.</li>
            <li>It smells like roses, which is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clarins products for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I think its kind of funny to be honest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this fairly routinely and haven&#x27;t really,noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Hydrates, removes wrinkles, goes under make up easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t see any improvement on the existing fine lines.</li>
            <li>have noticed a difference in fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can also say that my fine lines have improved also.</li>
            <li>but this product is helping keep the puffiness in check and diminishes the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the cheap creams at the stores.</li>
            <li>I like this product and here it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, light weight.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines did get softer but nothing significant.</li>
            <li>I very rarely giver overly ecstatic reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li>I must say I am really pleased with the product thus far and am glad I decided to get this from an authorized dealer to make sure I get the right thing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever gotten excited about the way a cream feels before.</li>
            <li>but lasts forever since it&#x27;s rich</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy and exactly as described</li>
            <li>It is super soft and feels incredibly good on the sensitive area around my skin.</li>
            <li>Once you hit a certain age, the sooner the better, you really have to do your research.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>You are worth it.</li>
            <li>To me the cost is worth the benefit.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li>The eye creme is nice, but I see no major differences in any lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;ve tried countless eye creams and gels that claim they really work, but so far, this is the best.</li>
            <li>I just use one pump and it is more than enough.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>I sure hope I dont jinx myself by saying what Im about to say, given that I have only had this product for a week, but this stuff works!!!</li>
            <li>I have yet to find the magic cure to fine little lines..</li>
            <li>In fact, I strongly recommend to take before and after pictures with the same background.</li>
            <li>Definitely see an improvement in puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li>still too much time to get in China.</li>
            <li>You apply it morning and night and gently sweep upward over the lids and temple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can really dee a difference in skin withim the fitst applications</li>
            <li>This eye concentrate has never caused my eyes to water, is very soothing, and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I being using it for a while, and I can really see and feel the difference....</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and skin, and it is not unusual to have problems with most products that is why when I find a product that works I stick with it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it was miraculous or all my fine lines have disappeared because that is not realistic.</li>
            <li>Have tried many creams, and some that were much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought this after intense research for dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>(yeah unfortunately I am not getting free supply or anything for my little review here.</li>
            <li>But this feels like gentle touch and soft caressing of your skin.</li>
            <li>I do not have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The bottle pictured was the original packaging, but the bottle I got recently look very different.</li>
            <li>I would say its at the moderate to higher price end though because the container is deceiving.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin around my eyes feel plumped and soft.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my sensitive eye area.  </li>
            <li>I like this eye cream so far.</li>
            <li>I have naturally puffy eyes, so don&#x27;t expect miracles</li>
            <li>Clarins is one of those products that work for me and never cause problems for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product - you use such a tiny amount that it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I always use it first, then use the other eye products.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Its kind of weird.</li>
            <li>brand is slightly less known in the US but very poular in France.</li>
            <li>It really does work to reduce puffyness and those little lines around the eyes.</li>

            <li> It really does work to reduce puffyness and those little lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> If you want to retain your looks as long as possible don&#x27;t be a penny-pincher.</li>
            <li> First off let me say I purchased this from Ulta only to find it here on Amazon for nearly half if  not more of the cost as i found it at Ulta and debated whether or not i would return it.</li>
            <li> I think both, the old and the new bottles contain 15 ml, however, the new cream appears to be a little less watery than the old formula, but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been told) and I&#x27;ve never used any other eye product long enough to test the difference.</li>
            <li> I am super-cheap and use very few cosmetics and plenty of natural home remedies when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> It is definitely expensive, but I believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I wish this line wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I do think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> am and pm, just in the pm right before bed, in hopes to have money on this expensive product.</li>
            <li> I think it works well with other products.</li>
            <li> and they said that they did not sell any of their product on Amazon or were not aware of anyone selling Clarins products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> You need to use only a small amount and you can see immediate results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I just know that I look younger than my 59 years</li>
            <li> Helps with my puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product has had no effect on my dark eye circles or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Decrease in puffiness and dark circles though.</li>
            <li> We all know they don&#x27;t work, or at least only a little bit.</li>
            <li> and when I applied this, my eyes puffed up a little for a bit.</li>
            <li> This product helps reduce puffiness and firm surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to say that Botox seems like such a waste of money when you can buy a product like this.</li>
            <li> After all, I did spend a ton on this small bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps my wrinkles</li>
            <li> but I use a small dab.</li>
            <li> No unusually noticeable improvement, but less expensive than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement in my dark circles and in fact they got worse.</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but I feel like this one is doing the job</li>
            <li> I’m seriously shocked because I haven’t been using it</li>
            <li> This winter has been brutal and I have seen an improvement since using this product.</li>

            <li> This product does reduce fine lines and softens my skin appearance!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years still love it.  Sometimes I try another eye cream but always return to Clarins.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it has helped with my under eye wrinkles. This winter has been brutal and I have seen an improvement since using this product. I use it at night with coconut oil and in the morning with my Olay eye roller. I just use one pump and it is more than enough. I think it works well with other products. I always use it first, then use the other eye products. It is definitely expensive, but I believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment. Be sure to check w with your Clarin&#x27;s rep to learn how to apply their products!  Once I figured that out the results were immediate and the product last alot longer!</li>
            <li> I apply this at bedtime and in the morning. It really does work to reduce puffyness and those little lines around the eyes. Actually, I&#x27;ve tried countless eye creams and gels that claim they really work, but so far, this is the best. Goes on smoothly without a greasy feel. Apply sparingly.</li>
            <li> I very rarely giver overly ecstatic reviews on Amazon but here I couldn&#x27;t help myself and just had to do it:&lt;br /&gt;This is by FAR the best eye cream I have ever used - and I have used many throughout my life. I am now in my mid-40s and have tried many things to smoothen out lines and wrinkles around my eyes, including Botox. Unfortunately I have to say that Botox seems like such a waste of money when you can buy a product like this. The results here may not be instant... you will have to apply it regularly, twice a day if possible. Put on lots of sun screen afterwards. In fact, I strongly recommend to take before and after pictures with the same background. No make up. You will see a difference within 30 days I promise. Extra bonus: I absolutely love the way it feels. It is super soft and feels incredibly good on the sensitive area around my skin. I don&#x27;t think I have ever gotten excited about the way a cream feels before. But this feels like gentle touch and soft caressing of your skin. Don&#x27;t buy the cheap creams at the stores. We all know they don&#x27;t work, or at least only a little bit. Once you hit a certain age, the sooner the better, you really have to do your research. If you want to retain your looks as long as possible don&#x27;t be a penny-pincher. Invest in yourself if you can afford it. You are worth it. (yeah unfortunately I am not getting free supply or anything for my little review here. :))) I really love this product though and can recommend it to anybody. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually does help with bags and puffy eyes.  I wish this line wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I do think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Helps with my puffiness and dark circles. Have tried many creams, and some that were much more expensive. Great product.</li>
            <li> Just love Clarins products.  They are expensive, but I feel like this one is doing the job and you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> I am super-cheap and use very few cosmetics and plenty of natural home remedies when it comes to beauty products. But, I got roped into a chair at Bloomies and they put this on one eye only. After about 3 min, the difference was quite visible. I bought some and ever since my eyes look good all day. Keep in fridge. Taking a star off for the cost. Geez.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, smooth.  No unusually noticeable improvement, but less expensive than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference when I used this cream. It&#x27;s over priced and no change in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought this after intense research for dark circles and fine lines. I do not have very sensitive skin and when I applied this, my eyes puffed up a little for a bit. I continued to use it in hopes that, that was the process to get the results. After all, I did spend a ton on this small bottle. I have not seen any improvement in my dark circles and in fact they got worse. The fine lines did get softer but nothing significant. I have been using this product for 30 days and I&#x27;m super disappointed. I did, however, contact Clarins about products being sold on Amazon and they said that they did not sell any of their product on Amazon or were not aware of anyone selling Clarins products on Amazon. So I asked them to send my a sample of this to see if it would cause the same result as the product I bought from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard stories of people buying beauty product on here that weren&#x27;t authentic. I hope this isn&#x27;t the case because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when I receive the sample.</li>
            <li> always an excellent  product price very reasonable!!!!!</li>
            <li> The eye creme is nice, but I see no major differences in any lines around my eyes.  I will probably try another product next time.</li>
            <li> You need to use only a small amount and you can see immediate results.</li>
            <li> Always wonderful. Makes the skin around my eyes feel plumped and soft.</li>
            <li> Good product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After using this along with the Clarins daycream for about 3 months, my sister&#x27;s commented my skin had never looked better.</li>
            <li> I am picky about my eye creams... But this is great! Hydrates, removes wrinkles, goes under make up easily etc... Makes your eyes look like what they did 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> Just OK. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t see any improvement on the existing fine lines.</li>
            <li> wonderful to apply at night and in the morning before make up!</li>
            <li> Individual ingredients of this product are tested on animals&#x27; eyes. I will not purchase again as it is animal cruelty.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream! Delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li> have been a fan of this for years!! great for a.m. AND p.m.</li>
            <li> Reduces puffiness under my eyes and reduces the tiny lines.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product - you use such a tiny amount that it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eye area seems a bit brighter and tighter as well. I will continue to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is slightly less known in the US but very poular in France.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years (practically since it came out). I have very sensitive eyes and skin, and it is not unusual to have problems with most products that is why when I find a product that works I stick with it. The bottle pictured was the original packaging, but the bottle I got recently look very different. I think both, the old and the new bottles contain 15 ml, however, the new cream appears to be a little less watery than the old formula, but I could be wrong. Anyway it is a great product in that it moisturizers the area around the eye without irritation and without making it greasy; it also lasts a good 12 hours. Great product</li>
            <li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results. Really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Doesn&#x27;t eliminate, but smooths out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and really helps those &amp;#34;laugh&amp;#34; lines to relax and almost disappear.  One of the best products I have ever used.  And my husband remarks about it making my eyes prettier.</li>
            <li> this was for my dear sister. still too much time to get in China. but Good evaluation。</li>
            <li> My favorite eye moisturizer! I buy it on Amazon because it is about $25 cheaper than my department store!!</li>
            <li> This product has had no effect on my dark eye circles or wrinkles.  Trying something else.</li>
            <li> Smells like sugar and is creamy but not greasy.  I can wear this under my eye makeup without any issues.  Does not irritate my sensitive eye area.  Pricey but lasts forever since it&#x27;s rich you only need a tiny bit.  Not sure if it helps my wrinkles (I get botox for that) but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I am about halfway through the bottle. I like this eye cream. Feels moisturizing but not greasy. I would say its at the moderate to higher price end though because the container is deceiving. It&#x27;s a lot of plastic per actual cream amount. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was miraculous or all my fine lines have disappeared because that is not realistic. Decrease in puffiness and dark circles though. I have yet to find the magic cure to fine little lines.. Oh well ! :)</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream so far. Its to soon to say for sure but I think the lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried several brands including Estee Lauder&#x27;s eye cream. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fairly routinely and haven&#x27;t really,noticed much of a difference. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> I like this product and here it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> While I wish it the product would tighten my eye lid skin more, I appreciate the brightening effect it has around the eye area. It smells like roses, which is lovely.  You apply it morning and night and gently sweep upward over the lids and temple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey but I use a small dab.</li>
            <li> As I begin writing this review Isay to myself I sure hope I dont jinx myself by saying what Im about to say, given that I have only had this product for a week, but this stuff works!!! Its kind of weird. First off let me say I purchased this from Ulta only to find it here on Amazon for nearly half if  not more of the cost as i found it at Ulta and debated whether or not i would return it. I ended up keeping it and boy has it worked. I’ve always had a sleeping problem and as I write this have been up for 24 hours. I should have unsightly raccoon eyes but I don&#x27;t!!!  I think its kind of funny to be honest lol. It looks like my under eyes don&#x27;t want to be bags or become bags. It almost looks like I can see the product fighting the bags from coming on. I must say I am really pleased with the product thus far and am glad I decided to get this from an authorized dealer to make sure I get the right thing. I can also say that my fine lines have improved also. I’m seriously shocked because I haven’t been using it am and pm, just in the pm right before bed, in hopes to have money on this expensive product. I will continue to use this. After one week of usage I can see why this is the number 1 skin care line in Europe.</li>
            <li> It was best gift for my mom. Thank&#x27;s for your quality.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, light weight.  My mascara doesn&#x27;t smudge during the day.  I have naturally puffy eyes, so don&#x27;t expect miracles but this product is helping keep the puffiness in check and diminishes the fine lines.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and exactly as described</li>
            <li> You can really dee a difference in skin withim the fitst applications</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clarins products for more than 10 years. Clarins is one of those products that work for me and never cause problems for my sensitive skin. This eye concentrate has never caused my eyes to water, is very soothing, and is moisturizing. Whether it helps with wrinkles or lines I&#x27;m not sure I just know that I look younger than my 59 years (I&#x27;ve been told) and I&#x27;ve never used any other eye product long enough to test the difference. To me the cost is worth the benefit. And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love it and will recommend to all of  my friends and family! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I being using it for a while, and I can really see and feel the difference....</li>
