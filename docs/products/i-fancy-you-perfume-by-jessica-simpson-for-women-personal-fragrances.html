            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it is not overbearing and just smells appealing.  </li>

            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>If you love Miss Dior Eau Fraiche and Lanvin Ã‰clat d&#x27;Arpege, I Fancy</li>
            <li>You is the TOP choice.</li>
            <li>totally love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite</li>
            <li>and I get the most compliments I&#x27;ve ever gotten for perfume.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Fancy by Jessica Simpson, but this one doesn&#x27;t tickle mine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the smell, yet it seems to fade by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute, in design.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a nice, light smell.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes is Fancy.</li>
            <li>It would be safe to call this a fresh, bright scent with a hint of seriousness.  </li>
            <li>Most would think of it as a spring and summer scent.  </li>
            <li>and i love the smell</li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing fancy love instead of this one.</li>
            <li>Will get more.</li>
            <li>and I do believe I have knowledge of smell flavour and love to gift family and friends</li>
            <li>Otherwise love product.</li>
            <li>Fancy Love will always be my #1 scent from Jessica Simpson</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was great, and the scent works really well.  </li>
            <li>Have to spray on more than once a day.</li>
            <li>Refreshing too.</li>
            <li>Get many compliments &amp; shipping arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>hubby likes it!I love</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent of the travel size and ordered this.</li>
            <li>This perfume is fruity with a hint of spice, but delivered in a sophisticated way.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount for a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my absolute favorite perfume out there!!</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and has a very nice scent that is not too fruity and very feminine.</li>
            <li>but this is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>My wife said it was too strong but when she walks by I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the original Fancy and Fancy love.</li>
            <li>good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
            <li>It smells light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Almost every perfume I&#x27;ve tried (that would be suitable for nights) are overly sweet, and leave me gagging.</li>
            <li>I loved the fast shipping..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and beautiful perfume , I liked it&#x27;s color first</li>
            <li>Very mild and pleasing, no stains</li>
            <li>and it was still a strong fragrance</li>
            <li>Fragrance is a bit strong</li>
            <li>She said she recommends this perfume to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like strong scents or overpowering perfumes.</li>
            <li>I smelled this for the first time this weekend, this is a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overbearing, it&#x27;s really a light scent.</li>
            <li>cheap too...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap too.</li>
            <li>But please, ladies, no matter the perfume....go light.</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>Worth it, gona get 2 more as a gift.</li>
            <li>I like light, fresh scents rather than sweeter more flowery types.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume very much.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced as compared to many stores.</li>
            <li>Its a very young fragance, i love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>Its a very young fragance, i love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>Very soft sexy smell my wife loves it!</li>
            <li>Smells good and a great deal for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will love this as I get so many compliments on the other two Jessica Simpson perfumes that I buy, Fancy and Fancy Love.</li>
            <li>&quot; (I believe her first perfume) is a better perfume.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I&#x27;m in LOVE  with Fancy Love and consider it my signature scent and was hesitant at first when buying this because I didn&#x27;t get a chance to find out what this smells like</li>
            <li>She said it has a very light but long lasting scent so perfect for her to go out or go to work wearing it.</li>
            <li>Clean and floral, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>oh yeah its a fresh clean scent.not strong at all.not</li>
            <li>Smells like clean laundry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells really clean.</li>
            <li>Omg I&#x27;m in love with this particular perfume and such a great deal on here ..</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and lasts quite long but the bottle&#x27;s lid was damaged when I received the perfume package.</li>
            <li>This sent is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>My wife does not like the strong smell, Jessica Simpson was just right.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice soft scent to it</li>
            <li>This perfume smells really good and it last all day.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much I am giving them out as gift for christmas.</li>
            <li>I just love this scent, floral and very feminine, think I can wear it every day.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell</li>
            <li>Dont care for this one as much as her Fancy Love, that&#x27;s why I got this one to try it out.</li>
            <li>I do not write reviews often but this perfume is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Not a bad aftersmell as some perfumes leave.</li>
            <li>Received in time Great price a little strong smelling for me</li>
            <li>I sprayed some on an hour ago, the scent holds up but not as strong as when I first applied it, it appears to have worn off a bit.</li>
            <li>This scent is a little more flowery than that one, but still smells good.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely soft fragance; i like it very much when i want to smell lovely and fresh but not too sweet!!&lt;br /&gt;Really like this perfume, is okey for morning use as well, not recommended for partys, is a soft fragance okey for the morning, and for a nice dinner.</li>
            <li>The smell disappears so quickly you smell it once and</li>
            <li>This was shipped out really quick</li>
            <li>This smells great but the scent fades way too quickly almost as if it were watered down.</li>
            <li>VERY, VERY fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Very soft, kind of sweet, but not too much.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a light, crisp fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The bottle is heavy duty and very cute also!</li>
            <li>New in box with original packaging as well!</li>
            <li>It smells really awesome,very light, just as I needed.</li>
            <li>Its the perfect everyday perfume for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the scent..very common/generic smell.</li>
            <li>It is airy and fresh.</li>
            <li>but when you have several loving it..</li>
            <li>I thought it would be the smaller bottle because of how cheap I got it for, but it&#x27;s not, and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, along with J.S.&#x27;s other Fancy Love.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and has some green notes in it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right choice</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this one is sweet, but not so much so that it leaves my stomach turning.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast .</li>
            <li>Smell pleasant and can be used all year round.</li>
            <li>It smells a little like cleaner at first but the smell is pleasant the longer it is worn.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The scent is very sweet, soft and very feminine , you will get lots of compliments everytime you wear it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll regift to someone else tho ;)</li>
            <li>the bottle is really pretty and fancy looking.</li>
            <li>well ok scent that DOES NOT LAST AT ALL!!!!</li>
            <li>FANCY LOVE AND THOSE SCENTS LAST!!</li>
            <li>It contains white musk and sandalwood with top notes of lily, apple, pear, and tuberose  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for my 17 year old niece and then for myself.  </li>
            <li>Then the sandalwood shows up, tones it all down, and rounds it out nicely.</li>
            <li>and I realize this was not the original, even it was eau de parfum this fragrance did not last more than 30 minutes, a total dissapointment</li>
            <li>this perfume smells great and is slightly floral/fruity scent and is very romantic and alluring.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling and beautiful bottle, but didnt last as long as some of her other perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I had to tell you the little story because you can&#x27;t explain really that much about perfume because everyone has their own taste</li>
            <li>Its what I call an everyday perfume, It smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but she didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast</li>
            <li>It is ok but not really my taste.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so much</li>
            <li>THANKS JESSICA</li>
            <li>and I am very picky when it comes to perfumes.</li>
            <li>IT GOES AWAY FAST.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I bought myself a backup bottle and several other bottles for my sisters for christmas.</li>
            <li>ALSO THE TOP PART WHERE THE LID IS MOVES AROUND AND MY OTHER 2 PERFUMES DO NOT DO THAT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but bold, it catches attention from many people( male &amp; female).  </li>
            <li>Less is better.</li>
            <li>; highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty scent!</li>
            <li>Love the cologne disappointed that it did not have top to bottle and not in original box.</li>
            <li>It smells expensive, classy, clean, fresh and elegant.</li>
            <li>generally have fairly oily skin, but right now its still really dry from the winter, and this perfume seems to last fairly long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become pretty much the only one I wear.</li>
            <li>Well worth it for a gift or personal use.</li>
            <li>Planning on buying a few more bottles for gifts around the holidays for sister and cousins.</li>
            <li>I Love the smell of the perfume but the smell does not last very long.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it last very long</li>
            <li>It is probably one of very good to have a daily casual wearing fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this perfume!</li>
            <li>it smells like an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume!</li>
            <li>I typically prefer Bath and Body products but wanted to try a light perfume for a change.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last for more than half an hour</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thinking on it a little more, I&#x27;m changing my review to a four star just for the fact that I can actually stand to wear this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used this perfume during the summer time and the smell smeed to fade quickly than other Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
            <li>It comes in with a cute blue bottle and I would say it was a disappointment  because although it smells quite pleasant and girly, I remember smelling this before from other ladies.</li>
            <li>The scent lasted pretty long, as well.</li>
            <li>and definitely you will have the attention of the people because I try it on and my whole house have the smell after that</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on an inanimate object (a sweater) to see how long it would last, and it was also pretty much gone after about 1.5 hours.  </li>
            <li>but then again, I exclusively use much lighter scents such as Revert and Curve Chill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smelled like an old women, I had to wash after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not a huge fan, and I believe the people saying this perfume is light are out of their minds...</li>
            <li>This is a good daytime, casual scent.  </li>
            <li>so I think she hot with the baby weight thick!! :-)</li>
            <li>this perfume is a little stronger than the perfume I usually use, s by shakira, but it still smells good and seems to stay on well.</li>
            <li>I am not typically a perfume wearer.  </li>
            <li>but I do like the pink Fancy bottle a little better &amp; this one was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li>so one should spray sparingly, it will last long ;)</li>
            <li>I purchased this scent for my 24-year-old daughter, who still likes the fruity scents that have become all too ubiquitous, but needs a more adult perfume [is anyone else tired of the fermented fruit scents?].  </li>
            <li>This has a light, delicate floral scent with some woody notes underneath it.  </li>
            <li>Quality product, soft fragrance, lasting.</li>
            <li>all perfumes cheap or expensive have long lasting power.showers are the number one thing ( clean skin) before applying perfumes,oils, body sprays</li>
            <li>Not really for an &#x27;older&#x27; woman, but from young to middle age it works.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad perfume, but its not a overwhelmingly favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>You opens with a sharp, fruity tang - you certainly get the apple and pear initially --</li>
            <li>it smells like a cheap perfume with a after tone not is not pleasant.</li>

            <li> It is my all time favorite</li>
            <li> and I get the most compliments I&#x27;ve ever gotten for perfume.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Fancy by Jessica Simpson, but this one doesn&#x27;t tickle mine</li>

            <li> The bottle is cute, in design.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice, light smell.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes is Fancy.</li>
            <li> It would be safe to call this a fresh, bright scent with a hint of seriousness.  </li>
            <li> Most would think of it as a spring and summer scent.  </li>
            <li> and i love the smell</li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing fancy love instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Will get more.</li>
            <li> and I do believe I have knowledge of smell flavour and love to gift family and friends</li>
            <li> Otherwise love product.</li>
            <li> Fancy Love will always be my #1 scent from Jessica Simpson</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was great, and the scent works really well.  </li>
            <li> Have to spray on more than once a day.</li>
            <li> Refreshing too.</li>
            <li> Get many compliments &amp; shipping arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> hubby likes it!I love</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent of the travel size and ordered this.</li>
            <li> This perfume is fruity with a hint of spice, but delivered in a sophisticated way.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount for a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my absolute favorite perfume out there!!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and has a very nice scent that is not too fruity and very feminine.</li>
            <li> but this is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> My wife said it was too strong but when she walks by I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the original Fancy and Fancy love.</li>
            <li> good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
            <li> It smells light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Almost every perfume I&#x27;ve tried (that would be suitable for nights) are overly sweet, and leave me gagging.</li>
            <li> I loved the fast shipping..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and beautiful perfume , I liked it&#x27;s color first</li>
            <li> Very mild and pleasing, no stains</li>
            <li> and it was still a strong fragrance</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a bit strong</li>
            <li> She said she recommends this perfume to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like strong scents or overpowering perfumes.</li>
            <li> I smelled this for the first time this weekend, this is a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overbearing, it&#x27;s really a light scent.</li>
            <li> cheap too...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap too.</li>
            <li> But please, ladies, no matter the perfume....go light.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> Worth it, gona get 2 more as a gift.</li>
            <li> I like light, fresh scents rather than sweeter more flowery types.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume very much.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced as compared to many stores.</li>
            <li> Its a very young fragance, i love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> Its a very young fragance, i love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> Very soft sexy smell my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Smells good and a great deal for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will love this as I get so many compliments on the other two Jessica Simpson perfumes that I buy, Fancy and Fancy Love.</li>
            <li> &quot; (I believe her first perfume) is a better perfume.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I&#x27;m in LOVE  with Fancy Love and consider it my signature scent and was hesitant at first when buying this because I didn&#x27;t get a chance to find out what this smells like</li>
            <li> She said it has a very light but long lasting scent so perfect for her to go out or go to work wearing it.</li>
            <li> Clean and floral, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> oh yeah its a fresh clean scent.not strong at all.not</li>
            <li> Smells like clean laundry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells really clean.</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;m in love with this particular perfume and such a great deal on here ..</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and lasts quite long but the bottle&#x27;s lid was damaged when I received the perfume package.</li>
            <li> This sent is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> My wife does not like the strong smell, Jessica Simpson was just right.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice soft scent to it</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really good and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much I am giving them out as gift for christmas.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent, floral and very feminine, think I can wear it every day.</li>
            <li> Sweet smell</li>
            <li> Dont care for this one as much as her Fancy Love, that&#x27;s why I got this one to try it out.</li>
            <li> I do not write reviews often but this perfume is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Not a bad aftersmell as some perfumes leave.</li>
            <li> Received in time Great price a little strong smelling for me</li>
            <li> I sprayed some on an hour ago, the scent holds up but not as strong as when I first applied it, it appears to have worn off a bit.</li>
            <li> This scent is a little more flowery than that one, but still smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely soft fragance; i like it very much when i want to smell lovely and fresh but not too sweet!!&lt;br /&gt;Really like this perfume, is okey for morning use as well, not recommended for partys, is a soft fragance okey for the morning, and for a nice dinner.</li>
            <li> The smell disappears so quickly you smell it once and</li>
            <li> This was shipped out really quick</li>
            <li> This smells great but the scent fades way too quickly almost as if it were watered down.</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Very soft, kind of sweet, but not too much.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a light, crisp fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> The bottle is heavy duty and very cute also!</li>
            <li> New in box with original packaging as well!</li>
            <li> It smells really awesome,very light, just as I needed.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect everyday perfume for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the scent..very common/generic smell.</li>
            <li> It is airy and fresh.</li>
            <li> but when you have several loving it..</li>
            <li> I thought it would be the smaller bottle because of how cheap I got it for, but it&#x27;s not, and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, along with J.S.&#x27;s other Fancy Love.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and has some green notes in it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right choice</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this one is sweet, but not so much so that it leaves my stomach turning.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast .</li>
            <li> Smell pleasant and can be used all year round.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like cleaner at first but the smell is pleasant the longer it is worn.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> The scent is very sweet, soft and very feminine , you will get lots of compliments everytime you wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll regift to someone else tho ;)</li>
            <li> the bottle is really pretty and fancy looking.</li>
            <li> well ok scent that DOES NOT LAST AT ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> FANCY LOVE AND THOSE SCENTS LAST!!</li>
            <li> It contains white musk and sandalwood with top notes of lily, apple, pear, and tuberose  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my 17 year old niece and then for myself.  </li>
            <li> Then the sandalwood shows up, tones it all down, and rounds it out nicely.</li>
            <li> and I realize this was not the original, even it was eau de parfum this fragrance did not last more than 30 minutes, a total dissapointment</li>
            <li> this perfume smells great and is slightly floral/fruity scent and is very romantic and alluring.</li>
            <li> Clean smelling and beautiful bottle, but didnt last as long as some of her other perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I had to tell you the little story because you can&#x27;t explain really that much about perfume because everyone has their own taste</li>
            <li> Its what I call an everyday perfume, It smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but she didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast</li>
            <li> It is ok but not really my taste.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so much</li>
            <li> THANKS JESSICA</li>
            <li> and I am very picky when it comes to perfumes.</li>
            <li> IT GOES AWAY FAST.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I bought myself a backup bottle and several other bottles for my sisters for christmas.</li>
            <li> ALSO THE TOP PART WHERE THE LID IS MOVES AROUND AND MY OTHER 2 PERFUMES DO NOT DO THAT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but bold, it catches attention from many people( male &amp; female).  </li>
            <li> Less is better.</li>
            <li> ; highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a pretty scent!</li>
            <li> Love the cologne disappointed that it did not have top to bottle and not in original box.</li>
            <li> It smells expensive, classy, clean, fresh and elegant.</li>
            <li> generally have fairly oily skin, but right now its still really dry from the winter, and this perfume seems to last fairly long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become pretty much the only one I wear.</li>
            <li> Well worth it for a gift or personal use.</li>
            <li> Planning on buying a few more bottles for gifts around the holidays for sister and cousins.</li>
            <li> I Love the smell of the perfume but the smell does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it last very long</li>
            <li> It is probably one of very good to have a daily casual wearing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this perfume!</li>
            <li> it smells like an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume!</li>
            <li> I typically prefer Bath and Body products but wanted to try a light perfume for a change.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last for more than half an hour</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thinking on it a little more, I&#x27;m changing my review to a four star just for the fact that I can actually stand to wear this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used this perfume during the summer time and the smell smeed to fade quickly than other Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
            <li> It comes in with a cute blue bottle and I would say it was a disappointment  because although it smells quite pleasant and girly, I remember smelling this before from other ladies.</li>
            <li> The scent lasted pretty long, as well.</li>
            <li> and definitely you will have the attention of the people because I try it on and my whole house have the smell after that</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on an inanimate object (a sweater) to see how long it would last, and it was also pretty much gone after about 1.5 hours.  </li>
            <li> but then again, I exclusively use much lighter scents such as Revert and Curve Chill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smelled like an old women, I had to wash after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not a huge fan, and I believe the people saying this perfume is light are out of their minds...</li>
            <li> This is a good daytime, casual scent.  </li>
            <li> so I think she hot with the baby weight thick!! :-)</li>
            <li> this perfume is a little stronger than the perfume I usually use, s by shakira, but it still smells good and seems to stay on well.</li>
            <li> I am not typically a perfume wearer.  </li>
            <li> but I do like the pink Fancy bottle a little better &amp; this one was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> so one should spray sparingly, it will last long ;)</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent for my 24-year-old daughter, who still likes the fruity scents that have become all too ubiquitous, but needs a more adult perfume [is anyone else tired of the fermented fruit scents?].  </li>
            <li> This has a light, delicate floral scent with some woody notes underneath it.  </li>
            <li> Quality product, soft fragrance, lasting.</li>
            <li> all perfumes cheap or expensive have long lasting power.showers are the number one thing ( clean skin) before applying perfumes,oils, body sprays</li>
            <li> Not really for an &#x27;older&#x27; woman, but from young to middle age it works.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad perfume, but its not a overwhelmingly favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> You opens with a sharp, fruity tang - you certainly get the apple and pear initially --</li>
            <li> it smells like a cheap perfume with a after tone not is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was searching for the one that could possibly be my \\&quot;significant scent\\&quot;, not something thats too common that all the other women wear.</li>
            <li> and a big long lasting size!</li>
            <li> When people say perfumes dont last long it irritates me...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting perfume this one may not be for you.</li>
            <li> and long lasting</li>
            <li> The scent does not last long.  </li>
            <li> but it appears to not last very long.</li>
            <li> But this time of year the heat is on and the air is quite dry; it might last longer in air that is not so dry.  </li>
            <li> However, it has enough complexity with the sandalwood and some other notes to wear year round, especially when the winter doldrums grind you down and you&#x27;re ready for a scent that&#x27;s a bit perky but not overly so.</li>
            <li> Some people noted that it did not hold up for long.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long time.</li>
            <li> Shortly thereafter the white floral, musk, and unidentified slightly spicy notes start to appear and bring a sophistication to the fruity bits.</li>
            <li> after that only other will smell it..</li>
            <li> Just a little is enough.</li>
            <li> I would like it to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I would like it to last a little</li>
            <li> After a few minutes the smell totally changes.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am partial to Jessica Simpson scents.</li>
            <li> This perfume is certainly not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This will vary from person to person due to body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> ed hardy is my other</li>
            <li> The Perfume seems to watered down.</li>
            <li> , SO I BELIEVED THIS PRODUCT BEEN WATERED DOWN.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it tends to fade within a few hours.</li>
            <li> It is a little stronger than I like</li>
            <li> The book is for my little brother; he has the series.</li>
            <li> I would diffidently tell my friends and family about this and it doesn&#x27;t smell  like something your grandma would wear.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t over powering or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Too, Amazon had to send me another bottle, as my first one had leaked so badly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like to buy perfumes unless I can smell it before.</li>
            <li> She is usually a &amp;#34;White Diamonds&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> not sure I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Everyday people would compliment her on it, she said!</li>
            <li> , the fruits don&#x27;t smell like they&#x27;re past their shelf life.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a heavier perfume for date nights, but its been difficult since I can&#x27;t stand such \\&quot;full\\&quot; perfumes.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 15 year old granddaughter for Christmas and my youngest daughter who is 25 wanted it really bad  </li>
            <li> These two are my favorites but this perfume is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a late Christmas/New Year gift for my aunt.</li>
            <li> has a hint of a rose/Lilly smell, to it at least to me.</li>
            <li> The dry down smell of it isn&#x27;t so bad...</li>
            <li> A little disappointed that it did not smell the same.</li>
            <li> It lasts approximately 4 hours.</li>
            <li> It is the worse smelling perfume I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it ,and for the  price  can&#x27;t  go  wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I have to give this perfume 3 stars.</li>
            <li> It was a blind buy for me.</li>
            <li> Even when I go out, I sometimes prefer this over my expensive brand name perfumes.</li>
            <li> OR IT JUST SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> So sad! ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not an unpleasant sharpness and, mercifully</li>
            <li> so maybe some persons got a bad batch</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this fragrance.</li>

I highly recommend it! Makes for an awesome Christmas gift! Any woman would love to receive a bottle of this amazing smelling perfume! It&#x27;s my absolute favorite perfume out there!!</li>
            <li> Received in time Great price a little strong smelling for me but my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this perfume! I bought this blindly after reading the reviews and wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it... But I do! It&#x27;s such a pretty scent! Clean and floral, but not overpowering. The scent lasted pretty long, as well. Would definitely rrecommend and repurchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself and love it. I have all of my perfume bottle displayed on my dresser. I ordered this because of the bottle. But, when I got it I realized I really liked it. It&#x27;s not overbearing, it&#x27;s really a light scent. I wear it to work.</li>
            <li> I love  it. I will buy again and I recommend everyone to buy  FANCY YOU For Women By JESSICA SIMPSON Eau De Perfume Spray.  It smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought a miniature version of this just to try not knowing how it would smell since the place went had no testers. It comes in with a cute blue bottle and I would say it was a disappointment  because although it smells quite pleasant and girly, I remember smelling this before from other ladies. I was searching for the one that could possibly be my \\&quot;significant scent\\&quot;, not something thats too common that all the other women wear. The smell is not too overpowering so that was good.</li>
            <li> I luv this perfume its better buying it at Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for christmas a couple of years back and I loved it so much that I bought myself a backup bottle and several other bottles for my sisters for christmas. Its what I call an everyday perfume, It smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This smells great but the scent fades way too quickly almost as if it were watered down.</li>
            <li> It smells really awesome,very light, just as I needed.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Definitely recommend.</li>

            <li> Wife liked it so give it 5 stars...happy wife happy life...cheap too...</li>
            <li> Smells great my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> When people say perfumes dont last long it irritates me...all perfumes cheap or expensive have long lasting power.showers are the number one thing ( clean skin) before applying perfumes,oils, body sprays this is how your skin absorbs the perfumes there for realeasing it through out your day.But anyhow this perfume is the best along with all her of jessicas fragrance line)  im buying more before i run out besides the cute bottles they come in.wonderful investment oh yeah its a fresh clean scent.not strong at all.not to mention after my showers before bed my husband says my skin smells soooo goood.</li>
            <li> I Love the smell of the perfume but the smell does not last very long. The Perfume seems to watered down.</li>
            <li> I order it for my sister after reading alot of reviews but she didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it last very long but I do like the pink Fancy bottle a little better &amp; this one was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes. I love the original Fancy and Fancy love. These two are my favorites but this perfume is a big disappointment. The smell was okay but the longevity of the perfume is about 2 hours. I used this perfume during the summer time and the smell smeed to fade quickly than other Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes. If you&#x27;re looking for long lasting perfume this one may not be for you.</li>
            <li> my daughter will get every perfume fragrance Jessica Simpson will produce.  She loves it!  No questions ask! I cant say nothing about this perfume since I dont wear but my daughter is all smiles.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, some people said it did not last I however still went ahead and bought it, it has a nice soft scent to it and I love smelling it in my gf, I could smell it on her all day btw so maybe some persons got a bad batch, she went to work at 7am and I saw her at 8pm and it was still a strong fragrance</li>
            <li> I got it way early...which is great!! Was browsing perfumes and decided to try this. I don&#x27;t usually like to buy perfumes unless I can smell it before. I used it for the first time today, so far so good. I like it, don&#x27;t know if I love love love it as yet. I will update as time goes by.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it so do I.</li>
            <li> She does a great job at balancing the right amount of ingredients to formulate an awesome smelling perfume!!</li>
            <li> The perfume doesn&#x27;t last . You spray it and then 1 min later nothing ! Not even an after smell. Shipment was fast I wish the perfume was authentic</li>
            <li> had to give it away.  After a few minutes the smell totally changes.</li>
            <li> My wife really love the scent!</li>
            <li> Smells good and a great deal for such a big bottle. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This was a great choice and I Loved it.. I will no share this with my Granddaughters..Lol..I loved the fast shipping..</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the scent..very common/generic smell.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. It was everything I excpeced</li>
            <li> It is ok but not really my taste. It is a little stronger than I like so I use when I&#x27;m going to the gym</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY fast shipping! Every woman should get this perfume as the smell is so amazing. New in box with original packaging as well!</li>
            <li> The prefume was for my Mom an, she loves it. The book is for my little brother; he has the series.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it ,and for the  price  can&#x27;t  go  wrong</li>
            <li> This has a light, delicate floral scent with some woody notes underneath it.  I absolutely love that it is not overbearing and just smells appealing.  Some people noted that it did not hold up for long.  I&#x27;ve never had a perfume that did.  If it did, it would probably be overwhelming from the get go.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m closing in on 50 and I did not find it too youthful for me.  (I do not think you need to smell like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume after your thirties)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I am sure I will love this as I get so many compliments on the other two Jessica Simpson perfumes that I buy, Fancy and Fancy Love.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume with gimmy chu perfume from amazon. I did not like it at all. It has a different fragrance than what you get in store. Please do not buy any perfume from amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume very much. Very soft, kind of sweet, but not too much. Lasts long time. Also like the body lotion.</li>
            <li> Sorry! Very disappointed with this fragrance. The smell disappears so quickly you smell it once and after that only other will smell it.. So sad! ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Fragrance is a bit strong so one should spray sparingly, it will last long ;)</li>
            <li> I smelled this for the first time this weekend, this is a nice fragrance.  It&#x27;s very light and not overbearing.  Can&#x27;t wait to add it to my collection!</li>
            <li> excellent product in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Bought this as a late Christmas/New Year gift for my aunt. She is usually a &amp;#34;White Diamonds&amp;#34; only type of gal, but she was very pleased with this saying it &amp;#34;has an elegant light musk to it perfect for a woman.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My wife said it was too strong but when she walks by I love it. Just a little is enough.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I received a lot of compliments. Unfornately it doesn&#x27;t last all day. It lasts approximately 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I love this scent - asked someone who was wearing it what it was and am thrilled I did. I like light, fresh scents rather than sweeter more flowery types. This one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Getting this to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and lasts quite long but the bottle&#x27;s lid was damaged when I received the perfume package.</li>
            <li> Bought several to give away as Christmas gifts.  All who received enjoyed them.  Very light scent -- not over powering.  Not really for an &#x27;older&#x27; woman, but from young to middle age it works.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Kind of Alcoholy but smells good.</li>
            <li> Got one earlier for my mom. She liked the perfume, so I got one for myself too. Very reasonably priced as compared to many stores.</li>
            <li> I love the package and the crystal bottle. Its very elegant. The scent is very nice and has some green notes in it. It is airy and fresh.</li>
            <li> Very good, the smell is really sweet and definitely you will have the attention of the people because I try it on and my whole house have the smell after that.... I like it!!! Really good to wear it every day.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a light, crisp fresh smell. It is Excellent! Would definitely recommend purchasing. The bottle is heavy duty and very cute also!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed. The smell is not overpowering. It smells light and refreshing. The size of the jar is an added bonus for the price!</li>
            <li> My wife love it and me too.</li>
            <li> I thought for being &amp;#34;JESSICA SIMPSON&#x27;S&amp;#34; the fragrance would smell good.. well it does not. it smells like a cheap perfume with a after tone not is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, she loves its and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really good and it last all day. The scent is very sweet, soft and very feminine , you will get lots of compliments everytime you wear it. So if you want great smelling perfume that is not going to break your bank, please try this one, You will not regret it. The scent not over-powering, just beautiful. I love this perfume so much I am giving them out as gift for christmas.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent, floral and very feminine, think I can wear it every day. The price is unbelieable, and the package came on time in good condition. I am very pleased with this purchase, will order more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. If you know what XOXO smells like, i think they have a similar scent.  great price too!</li>
            <li> Smells like clean laundry. Not something i would wear out, but I would spray it around my room or something.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really clean.</li>
            <li> i think this is the best perfume i bought...cuz it has really nice and attractive smell....and price is really good ...</li>
            <li> If you love Miss Dior Eau Fraiche and Lanvin Ã‰clat d&#x27;Arpege, I Fancy You is the TOP choice. It smells like the best of both. But it&#x27;s so much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;I totally love this perfume. It smells expensive, classy, clean, fresh and elegant. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Shipped in time stated....not sure I like the smell. I bought it because I thought I&#x27;d be similar to &amp;#34;Fancy Love&amp;#34; but its not. I&#x27;ll regift to someone else tho ;)</li>
            <li> It is probably one of very good to have a daily casual wearing fragrance. Very mild and pleasing, no stains</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for my 17 year old niece and then for myself.  very nice and fresh smell - I would buy again.  just as described.  and long lasting</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Nothing else to say</li>
            <li> This perfume is certainly not overpowering. It&#x27;s a wonderful and sexy fragrance with a very pleasant smell. Love it</li>
            <li> this perfume smells heavenly and I would recommend this. this perfume smells great and is slightly floral/fruity scent and is very romantic and alluring. this perfume is a little stronger than the perfume I usually use, s by shakira, but it still smells good and seems to stay on well. the bottle is really pretty and fancy looking. this size bottle, 3.4 ounce is a great bargain for the price. what else can i say it smells good and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It is my all time favorite and I get the most compliments I&#x27;ve ever gotten for perfume.  It&#x27;s cheap too.</li>
            <li> I Got this 4 my lady friend &amp; I like JS so I think she hot with the baby weight thick!! :-) anyways this smells good! !</li>
            <li> Excellent service provider. I recommend buy</li>
            <li> Not only does this perfume not last, it does not smell so nice-- it smells like an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; perfume! I absolutely love Fancy by Jessica Simpson, but this one doesn&#x27;t tickle mine AT ALL! Too, Amazon had to send me another bottle, as my first one had leaked so badly the paint was coming off the bottle and the entire boxed was soaked in it :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I still use this fragrance (layered with Bath &amp; Bodyworks lotions) &amp; I am complimented a lot!</li>
            <li> My wife bought a bottle of this and I thought she had been shopping at the bargain bin at Ross or WalMart. It actually smells pretty good. But please, ladies, no matter the perfume....go light. Less is better. Two puffs is plenty!!</li>
            <li> My friend loves Jessica Simpsons perfume. She said it has a very light but long lasting scent so perfect for her to go out or go to work wearing it. She said she recommends this perfume to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like strong scents or overpowering perfumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the smell, yet it seems to fade by the end of the day. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Its a very young fragance, i love the way it smells! I would like it to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I just got this today....has a hint of a rose/Lilly smell, to it at least to me. The bottle is cute, in design. I sprayed some on an hour ago, the scent holds up but not as strong as when I first applied it, it appears to have worn off a bit. I think \\&quot;Fancy\\&quot; (I believe her first perfume) is a better perfume. \\&quot;I Fancy You\\&quot;...is lighter, airy and is not over powering but it appears to not last very long. I&#x27;d consider it a daytime perfume/scent. Overall, not a bad perfume, but its not a overwhelmingly favorite of mine. However it still has its charm.</li>
            <li> My mother loves the bottle,and the perfume</li>
            <li> Sweet smell; highly recommend this. I use it for church or an evening out. &amp;#34;I Fancy You&amp;#34; is wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> it is a good product for this price</li>
            <li> AROMA NICE REFRESHING AND PERSISTENT</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice, light smell.  The price on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 15 year old granddaughter for Christmas and my youngest daughter who is 25 wanted it really bad  She was trying to bribe her for it Lol So it was a hit the smell was wonderful everyone loved it! I had to tell you the little story because you can&#x27;t explain really that much about perfume because everyone has their own taste but when you have several loving it..well you get the idea  lol :-) PS: My granddaughter says it stays on all day too that&#x27;s a big plus!</li>
            <li> Listen. Don&#x27;t buy this. This one stank. Sorry</li>
            <li> love it, want to buy another bottle, good price too</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am partial to Jessica Simpson scents. One of my favorite perfumes is Fancy. This scent is a little more flowery than that one, but still smells good. Not a bad aftersmell as some perfumes leave. I would definately recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good. I bought it for my mom last Christmas and she used it all up by march. Everyday people would compliment her on it, she said! So i am buying it for her again in the biggest size. And i will definitly will be buying this every Christmas for her. ITS A MUST HAVE PERFUME, FOR YOU PERFUME LOVERS! not only for the scent, but for the bottle itself! Its gorgeous, just like the girl who made it. THANKS JESSICA</li>
            <li> this was a gift which my friend loved. Smell pleasant and can be used all year round. Not strong...light and pleasant</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent for my 24-year-old daughter, who still likes the fruity scents that have become all too ubiquitous, but needs a more adult perfume [is anyone else tired of the fermented fruit scents?].  She likes it a lot.  Of course, it was my duty to test it; think of it as quality control.  This is a pleasant, unoffensive scent. The fruits are there but they have grown up.  I Fancy You opens with a sharp, fruity tang - you certainly get the apple and pear initially -- but it&#x27;s not an unpleasant sharpness and, mercifully, the fruits don&#x27;t smell like they&#x27;re past their shelf life.    Shortly thereafter the white floral, musk, and unidentified slightly spicy notes start to appear and bring a sophistication to the fruity bits. Then the sandalwood shows up, tones it all down, and rounds it out nicely. All in all, the components blend rather nicely.    It would be safe to call this a fresh, bright scent with a hint of seriousness.  It stays fairly close to the skin after drydown.    Unfortunately, the lovely fragrance seems to disappear after an hour or so.  This will vary from person to person due to body chemistry.  I sprayed it on an inanimate object (a sweater) to see how long it would last, and it was also pretty much gone after about 1.5 hours.  But this time of year the heat is on and the air is quite dry; it might last longer in air that is not so dry.  Generally this would probably be best suited for folks in their twenties or thirties.  I&#x27;m in my fifties and would consider wearing it occasionally if it were around, but I wouldn&#x27;t run out and buy it for myself at my age. Most would think of it as a spring and summer scent.  However, it has enough complexity with the sandalwood and some other notes to wear year round, especially when the winter doldrums grind you down and you&#x27;re ready for a scent that&#x27;s a bit perky but not overly so.</li>
            <li> I recieved this for christmas , I&#x27;m a big jessica simpson fan , I have the fancy that i have bought over and over again.  this smells really nice and i will probably end up repurchasing this again whenever i run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and beautiful perfume , I liked it&#x27;s color first but then I smell it mmmmm. It&#x27;s really has a beautiful scent and it isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> My wife does not like the strong smell, Jessica Simpson was just right. Great product i will purchase more for my wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to admit this smells great, but this is not the first jessica simpson I fancy you perfum I buy, and I realize this was not the original, even it was eau de parfum this fragrance did not last more than 30 minutes, a total dissapointment</li>
            <li> This was shipped out really quick and i love the smell i couldnt believe the price it was a steal</li>
            <li> Clean smelling and beautiful bottle, but didnt last as long as some of her other perfumes.  I would recommend purchasing fancy love instead of this one.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. Great price. Will get more. I would diffidently tell my friends and family about this and it doesn&#x27;t smell  like something your grandma would wear.</li>
            <li> love this perfume, and best price ever...</li>
            <li> Smells great. Just the right amount for a good price. Well worth it for a gift or personal use. Recommend</li>
            <li> Its a very young fragance, i love the way it smells! I would like it to last a little longer.this is not the best perfume but when you compare price it&#x27;s exillent choice in that price range I always buy all kind of cologne and perfume and I do believe I have knowledge of smell flavour and love to gift family and friends it&#x27;s right choice I can saat</li>
            <li> Dont care for this one as much as her Fancy Love, that&#x27;s why I got this one to try it out. I wll pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast . My lady loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I have to give this perfume 3 stars. I&#x27;ve been looking for a heavier perfume for date nights, but its been difficult since I can&#x27;t stand such \\&quot;full\\&quot; perfumes. Almost every perfume I&#x27;ve tried (that would be suitable for nights) are overly sweet, and leave me gagging. Thankfully, this one is sweet, but not so much so that it leaves my stomach turning. I&#x27;m still not a huge fan, and I believe the people saying this perfume is light are out of their minds...but then again, I exclusively use much lighter scents such as Revert and Curve Chill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking on it a little more, I&#x27;m changing my review to a four star just for the fact that I can actually stand to wear this one.&lt;br /&gt;I generally have fairly oily skin, but right now its still really dry from the winter, and this perfume seems to last fairly long.</li>
            <li> Love the cologne disappointed that it did not have top to bottle and not in original box. I don&#x27;t remember it being listed that way. Otherwise love product.</li>
            <li> this smells great, my friends all love it&lt;br /&gt;and can be worn with any outfit on any occassion.&lt;br /&gt;perfumes are really a great way to lift yourself each day.</li>
            <li> Great price, very large bottle.  It smells a little like cleaner at first but the smell is pleasant the longer it is worn.</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;m in love with this particular perfume and such a great deal on here ..best prices formy two perfumes love and luck ed hardy is my other</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I&#x27;m in LOVE  with Fancy Love and consider it my signature scent and was hesitant at first when buying this because I didn&#x27;t get a chance to find out what this smells like and I am very picky when it comes to perfumes. But I decided to take a chance and I am SO happy that I did. Fancy Love will always be my #1 scent from Jessica Simpson but this is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I CHOOSE THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT may have been tampered with!!! i never smelled this before till i got it, it has a nice scent, well ok scent that DOES NOT LAST AT ALL!!!! IT GOES AWAY FAST. I HAVE FANCY, AND FANCY LOVE AND THOSE SCENTS LAST!! ALSO THE TOP PART WHERE THE LID IS MOVES AROUND AND MY OTHER 2 PERFUMES DO NOT DO THAT, SO I BELIEVED THIS PRODUCT BEEN WATERED DOWN. OR IT JUST SUCKS!!! AND SCENT DOESNT LAST FOR NOTHING SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST perfumes, ever!! To die for scent...HIGHLY recommended! Love it, will buy it again and again!</li>
            <li> Smelled like an old women, I had to wash after using it. I am giving away.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be the smaller bottle because of how cheap I got it for, but it&#x27;s not, and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I did not like it. It was a blind buy for me. It arrived on time and it was sealed and all...but I did not like the smell of it. I do not recommend it at all. The dry down smell of it isn&#x27;t so bad...but overall, nope. It is the worse smelling perfume I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent and great price.</li>
            <li> I am not typically a perfume wearer.  I typically prefer Bath and Body products but wanted to try a light perfume for a change.  The price on Amazon was great, and the scent works really well.  It isn&#x27;t over powering or heavy.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very soft sexy smell my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought, I am huge on perfume and their smells.. It smells a bit like hairspray with a touch of musky sweetness. I bought it on a spontaneous act.. It does not last. My daughter likes so that&#x27;s all that matters in the end.. If you want my opinion, I&#x27;d save the money honestly..</li>
            <li> Perfect for my mother&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> I do not write reviews often but this perfume is my absolute favorite. It lasts all day and has a very nice scent that is not too fruity and very feminine. Its the perfect everyday perfume for such a cheap price. Even when I go out, I sometimes prefer this over my expensive brand name perfumes.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last long.  Have to spray on more than once a day.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely soft fragance; i like it very much when i want to smell lovely and fresh but not too sweet!!&lt;br /&gt;Really like this perfume, is okey for morning use as well, not recommended for partys, is a soft fragance okey for the morning, and for a nice dinner. love it!!!</li>
            <li> Quality product, soft fragrance, lasting. Refreshing too. Get many compliments &amp; shipping arrived on time. Definitely would recommend!!! Worth it, gona get 2 more as a gift.</li>
            <li> were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends .. the quality is awesome .. thank you very much</li>
            <li> This sent is by far my favorite! It&#x27;s soft but bold, it catches attention from many people( male &amp; female).  I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! Give it a try you will not be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> good product, good seller!</li>
            <li> Smells good! and a big long lasting size!</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling lots of compliments. Planning on buying a few more bottles for gifts around the holidays for sister and cousins.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived quickly, daughter loves this scent. 1 of her faves. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Wife likes and wears weekly. Arrived on time and in great shape.  Price was competitive and I am happy with the product</li>
            <li> smells great! hubby likes it!I love it will be buying again.</li>
            <li> My favorite in my collection!!!! I am always reaching for this perfume.  I have the others that are in the line or whatever, but this one is the best. It smells amazing</li>
            <li> My favorite scent ever !!!!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent of the travel size and ordered this. A little disappointed that it did not smell the same.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, along with J.S.&#x27;s other Fancy Love.  This perfume is fruity with a hint of spice, but delivered in a sophisticated way. It contains white musk and sandalwood with top notes of lily, apple, pear, and tuberose  This is a good daytime, casual scent.  The only complaint is that it tends to fade within a few hours.</li>
