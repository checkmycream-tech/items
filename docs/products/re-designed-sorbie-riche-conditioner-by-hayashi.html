            <li>Customer service with this company is superior!</li>
            <li>So, it was a great &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The best part, no animal testing :).</li>
            <li>favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>2-days prime, to my doorstep - love it!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner I have found.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is one of those deals that seems too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I have been using Trevor Sorbie products for years and love them.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is ok, but not at all like what I used to purchase from my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>It is the favorite conditioner of a friend.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for dry and unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking to find the original somewhere, if anyone has found it please let me know.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what makes this conditioner wonderful and different from the rest, but I know it works like no other for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick like it used to be and the beautiful smell is very mild and doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Best conditioner have ever found for curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li>To this day, it is a tried and true go to for its detangling, smoothing and emulsifying properties.  </li>
            <li>It was my absolute favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this conditioner for my dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a conditioner, but not worth the price if it&#x27;s not the authentic brand.</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner and this was authentic unlike others I have bought on line that were watered down or not the real thing.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my hilighted hair, yet washes out only leaving a healthy and manageable shine.</li>
            <li>Product exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Having been a hairdresser for many years I have used multiple products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sorbie for the better part of the last 25 years.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean &amp; makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li>One bottle goes a long way as it is highly concentrated, giving you more bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very managable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why most of the reviews said this stuff is watered down.</li>
            <li>I may buy it from a different place next time to see if it is better.</li>
            <li>There was a time that Sorbie ruled the planet with high quality hair-care products.  </li>
            <li>I usually pay much more at the salon.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or sticky, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Riche conditioner leaves all hair types shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I really see the   difference when I use different hair products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy it again and suggest you not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This one is a thick conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t have the right scent and it does not treat my hair the same way the true brand conditioner does.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever my hair actually got dry as if I wasn&#x27;t using conditioner at all.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve obviously changed/cheapened their formula because this is NOT the same high quality I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>I mean nothing makes my hair silky smooth and shine like Sorbie.  </li>
            <li>People are always commenting on how thick and full of body my hair is...</li>

            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have long hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was very tangly and hard to comb out.  </li>
            <li> Something is strange with this conditioner compared to other Sorbie conditioners I&#x27;ve used for the last 23 years of my life.</li>
            <li> This order that I received seemed to be a bit different in texture and quality, almost as if it were watered down alot.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying Sorbie for years and it is always very thick, almost too thick to easily get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a plain white bottle with a Trevor Sorbie sticker on it and the sticker has peeled off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands my hairdresser has reccommended, and have yet to find one that outshines Trevor Sorbie.</li>
            <li> The conditioner I received does not have the usual smell and it does not make my hair feel the same.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products over that time, but nothing, and</li>
            <li> The product I got from this company seemed to be watered down.  </li>
            <li> You just need a little to do the job well.</li>
            <li> I could not live without   Sorbie !!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is not the same consistency as what I used to get - this is very dry and thick.  </li>
            <li> Mine was so thick I had to add a little water to get the pump to start to work.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe it is not the conditioner I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> So thick I can hardly get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Those days are obviously gone as this was watered down crap.</li>
            <li> Without these items my hair is thin and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best conditioner have ever found for curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> A stylist introduced me to Sorbie Riche 20 something years ago.  To this day, it is a tried and true go to for its detangling, smoothing and emulsifying properties.  One bottle goes a long way as it is highly concentrated, giving you more bang for the buck.  The best part, no animal testing :).</li>
            <li> I have been using Trevor Sorbie products for years and love them. I especially like the conditioner. It is not heavy or sticky, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve tried other brands my hairdresser has reccommended, and have yet to find one that outshines Trevor Sorbie. It soaks into my hilighted hair, yet washes out only leaving a healthy and manageable shine. I&#x27;ve tried over 20 different products and still come back to Trevor Sorbie.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why most of the reviews said this stuff is watered down. Mine was so thick I had to add a little water to get the pump to start to work. It smells clean &amp; makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this conditioner all the time from my local hairdresser.  It was my absolute favorite conditioner.  The hairdresser said they could no longer get this product, so I turned to the internet to shop.  Unfortunately this product is not the same consistency as what I used to get - this is very dry and thick.  It definitely does not condition my hair as well as what I used to get.  The conditioner is ok, but not at all like what I used to purchase from my hairdresser.  I&#x27;m still looking to find the original somewhere, if anyone has found it please let me know.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner EVER</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Product exactly what I wanted and it arrived very quickly.  Thanks</li>

            <li> favorite shampoo! 2-days prime, to my doorstep - love it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have found. Having been a hairdresser for many years I have used multiple products. Riche conditioner leaves all hair types shiny and soft. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Trevor Sorbie Riche conditioner for years. This one is a thick conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t have the right scent and it does not treat my hair the same way the true brand conditioner does. The bottle is a plain white bottle with a Trevor Sorbie sticker on it and the sticker has peeled off in the shower. It&#x27;s okay for a conditioner, but not worth the price if it&#x27;s not the authentic brand. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have allways thought Sorbie conditioner was incredible. This order that I received seemed to be a bit different in texture and quality, almost as if it were watered down alot.  I still like it, it is very good. I may buy it from a different place next time to see if it is better.</li>
            <li> Something is strange with this conditioner compared to other Sorbie conditioners I&#x27;ve used for the last 23 years of my life.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry and unmanageable hair.  Truly.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell it in the store by us anymore. Great, great conditioner! A little goes a long way! Thank you!</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner and this was authentic unlike others I have bought on line that were watered down or not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Have used this for 20 years and it is the best. Customer service with this company is superior!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have long hair.  People are always commenting on how thick and full of body my hair is... That is because I use   Sorbie Shampoo for chemically treated hair, and Sorbie Riche Conditioner !   Without these items my hair is thin and lifeless. I really see the   difference when I use different hair products.  I could not live without   Sorbie !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been using Sorbie for the better part of the last 25 years.  They&#x27;ve obviously changed/cheapened their formula because this is NOT the same high quality I&#x27;m used to.  It&#x27;s not thick like it used to be and the beautiful smell is very mild and doesn&#x27;t last.  For the first time ever my hair actually got dry as if I wasn&#x27;t using conditioner at all.  Also, it was very tangly and hard to comb out.  I&#x27;ll never buy it again and suggest you not waste your money.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve always had compliments over my hair.  I got hooked on Sorbie 20 years ago and was mortified when I could no longer buy it locally.  I took to the internet about 10 years ago now, and found it again.  I&#x27;ve tried other products over that time, but nothing, and I mean nothing makes my hair silky smooth and shine like Sorbie.  As a bonus, I don&#x27;t have to use styling products as with Sorbie, my hair holds a curl or straightens with ease.</li>
            <li> I have used Sorbie for years and will not use anything else.  Does not leave residue in your hair.  Leaves hair very managable.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Sorbie for years and it is always very thick, almost too thick to easily get out of the bottle.  The product I got from this company seemed to be watered down.  I will try another company next time.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this conditioner for my dry, curly hair.  You just need a little to do the job well.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. It is the favorite conditioner of a friend. Now that she has 33.8 ounces of it, she&#x27;ll never need to purchase it again. So, it was a great &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; present.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what makes this conditioner wonderful and different from the rest, but I know it works like no other for me!</li>
            <li> There was a time that Sorbie ruled the planet with high quality hair-care products.  Those days are obviously gone as this was watered down crap.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair from breaking off. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
