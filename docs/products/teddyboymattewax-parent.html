            <li>Best hair product out there</li>
            <li>May the best one I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best hair products I have ever used....</li>
            <li>Up to now for medium lenght hairs the best product i&#x27;ve ever tested.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year, this has been the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>4 stars because its smells great</li>
            <li>Damn that cherry smell is great.</li>
            <li>The application of this product is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to use a bit more than you would like to get that perfect hold.</li>
            <li>I think the philosophy of the company is great and seems like the owner is a genuinely good guy.  </li>
            <li>The cherry smell to me is the best, love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Easy to restyle throughout the day though and still, one of the best pomades Ive used.</li>
            <li>Atleast you&#x27;ll smell amazing with that great do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it easily washes out, has a nice cherry medicine smell, and works great.  </li>
            <li>Amazing pomade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong that it&#x27;s overpowering my cologne and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>Just received, goes in easy and gives nice hold and texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall im glad i tried it but won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li>This pomade is, simply put, awesome as heck.</li>
            <li>It looks sleek as can be and I have already gotten many complements in just one day.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite pomades.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not wholly sold on the Matte Wax for myself yet, I would recommend it for someone who needs a lighter hold and wants to support a great company.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace my maneuver by redken since I didn&#x27;t know many of the ingredients and chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Just love the smell.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as Uppercut Matt clay but definitely better than it.</li>
            <li>This is what happens when a water-based pomade is developed that acts like a petroleum based one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great &#x27;matte shine&#x27; with a very, very nice medium hold.</li>
            <li>It smears in my hand like butter and easily runs through.</li>
            <li>I style a tapered pompadour and find it just as easy to apply as an oil based pomade.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply by dabbing a bit in your hands and rubbing them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too strong fragrance either.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Both wash out super easily and dont seem to damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washes out super easy.</li>
            <li>I thought this would work great for my medium long hair.</li>
            <li>The wax goes into the hair nicely and leaves your hair feeling natural and clean.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you have a lighter full bed of hair.</li>
            <li>decent hold, matte finish, washes out easily.</li>
            <li>This is a more natural product with ingredients you can read.</li>
            <li>This isnt like as the day goes on, no expect them right from the beginning of the day.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but so far I&#x27;d qualify it as &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>As far as the actual product, it&#x27;s good, but does not hold my hair as well as I thought it would based on it being rated a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; out of 4 on the hold scale.  </li>
            <li>Pretty smelly.  </li>
            <li>As I experiment with it more I might come back and amend this review.  </li>
            <li>The product comes off the hands nicely, a simple quick rinse and your hands feel clean again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It may work for some, since there have been some good reviews, but I recommend trying to get a sample before dishing $10+ on a small jar.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smells...can&#x27;t really describe it though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hairs get very silky and distressed.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve uploaded a few of my own for comparison against a Coke can.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t like the scent, check out the other product for something a bit more masculine-smelling...</li>
            <li>I recently got the regular teddy boy water based and do like it more-- its not that much shine compared to this.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the rather sweet cherry/mint smell of it but apart from that this is a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>The product itself is decent and works as advertised:</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, solid product for the price</li>
            <li>Top ingredients, most of them are natural, fresh and light smell, a little little oily just to give subtle shine and light.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>At the time they were one of the first matte wax&#x27;s available, I&#x27;ve tired others since my first purchase, but I&#x27;ve always regretted the purchase and now only keep Anchors in my drawer.</li>
            <li>This could also be due to the texture (very straight, fine, soft) of my hair and the fact I&#x27;m putting it in when it&#x27;s slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>It does have a very strange cherry/medicinal smell as the other reviewers have noted; the smells does dissipate rather quickly though.</li>
            <li>The product has a rich consistency, you&#x27;ll notice that a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> The matte paste is a little more difficult to pull and hold a style.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do the job for my thick asian hair...</li>
            <li> Over the day,the oil from the wax just like drips down the tips of ur hair.</li>
            <li> Well,it slightly worked.</li>
            <li> but a few stray hairs from the group are expect.</li>
            <li> but the can is very little for the cost anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s laughably small -- even for 2.5oz.</li>
            <li> Small amount to be used</li>
            <li> I like this product, however I do not LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> My thick strands and thinly sparsed hair was almost too heavy for product to hold shape after a few hours.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the scent - it is a cherry/almond scent that was a bit too artificial for me.</li>
            <li> Not perfumy, but not a pleasant smell either.  </li>
            <li> In all, the scent isn&#x27;t wholly unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still deciding on the smell, while I don&#x27;t think it smells bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I opened the box.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 4 stars because its smells great but the hold is three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is somewhere around a 5/10. You can get by with the hold but a few stray hairs from the group are expect. This isnt like as the day goes on, no expect them right from the beginning of the day. You&#x27;ll have to use a bit more than you would like to get that perfect hold. Atleast you&#x27;ll smell amazing with that great do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall im glad i tried it but won&#x27;t be ordering again. Damn that cherry smell is great.</li>
            <li> Best hair product out there</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smells...can&#x27;t really describe it though.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do the job for my thick asian hair...&lt;br /&gt;It may work for some, since there have been some good reviews, but I recommend trying to get a sample before dishing $10+ on a small jar.</li>
            <li> Just received, goes in easy and gives nice hold and texture. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty smelly.  Not perfumy, but not a pleasant smell either.  That&#x27;s a deal killer for me.</li>
            <li> This product is actually a water based pomade, despite what the label reads. This pomade is, simply put, awesome as heck. The smell is that of cherry/mint cough syrup. The application of this product is great. It smears in my hand like butter and easily runs through. I love the way have the matte product doesn&#x27;t take away your natural shine making your hair look artificial. I style a tapered pompadour and find it just as easy to apply as an oil based pomade. It looks sleek as can be and I have already gotten many complements in just one day. I recommend this to anyone who knows how to use it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite pomades.  I recently got the regular teddy boy water based and do like it more-- its not that much shine compared to this.  Both wash out super easily and dont seem to damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;back to this one-- it easily washes out, has a nice cherry medicine smell, and works great.  Now that its summer, it doesnt last all day like the brown container one.  Easy to restyle throughout the day though and still, one of the best pomades Ive used.</li>
            <li> Amazing pomade. This is what happens when a water-based pomade is developed that acts like a petroleum based one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great &#x27;matte shine&#x27; with a very, very nice medium hold. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the rather sweet cherry/mint smell of it but apart from that this is a 5 star product. May the best one I&#x27;ve tried to date. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> The product itself is decent and works as advertised: decent hold, matte finish, washes out easily. I prefer the Redken for Men Outplay that I had been using, however. It does have a very strange cherry/medicinal smell as the other reviewers have noted; the smells does dissipate rather quickly though. In all, the scent isn&#x27;t wholly unpleasant. My only complaint is the size of the container. It&#x27;s laughably small -- even for 2.5oz. I was shocked when I opened the box. The product photos here are a bit deceiving so I&#x27;ve uploaded a few of my own for comparison against a Coke can.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but so far I&#x27;d qualify it as &amp;#34;like&amp;#34;.  I think the philosophy of the company is great and seems like the owner is a genuinely good guy.  I always try to support smaller companies whenever I can.  As far as the actual product, it&#x27;s good, but does not hold my hair as well as I thought it would based on it being rated a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; out of 4 on the hold scale.  This could also be due to the texture (very straight, fine, soft) of my hair and the fact I&#x27;m putting it in when it&#x27;s slightly damp.  As I experiment with it more I might come back and amend this review.  I&#x27;m still deciding on the smell, while I don&#x27;t think it smells bad, I think it&#x27;s a scent I personally don&#x27;t care for.  I do like the texture of the product and it is not greasy at all.  While I&#x27;m not wholly sold on the Matte Wax for myself yet, I would recommend it for someone who needs a lighter hold and wants to support a great company.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used....I have turned a lot of my friends and family on to it. I like how it&#x27;s non greasy and keeps it hold all day long ...just look</li>
            <li> Smells like apple. Not too strong fragrance either. I thought this would work great for my medium long hair. Well,it slightly worked. Over the day,the oil from the wax just like drips down the tips of ur hair. But I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> Great product. I ordered this to replace my maneuver by redken since I didn&#x27;t know many of the ingredients and chemicals in it. This is a more natural product with ingredients you can read. Works greats. Smells like cherries. Washes out super easy.</li>
            <li> Top ingredients, most of them are natural, fresh and light smell, a little little oily just to give subtle shine and light. Hairs get very silky and distressed. Small amount to be used but the can is very little for the cost anyway. Up to now for medium lenght hairs the best product i&#x27;ve ever tested.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic. The texture is halfway between a lotion and a wax. Easy to apply by dabbing a bit in your hands and rubbing them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the scent - it is a cherry/almond scent that was a bit too artificial for me. That said, it might be up your alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the scent, check out the other product for something a bit more masculine-smelling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company that cares about their customers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year, this has been the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used. At the time they were one of the first matte wax&#x27;s available, I&#x27;ve tired others since my first purchase, but I&#x27;ve always regretted the purchase and now only keep Anchors in my drawer. The product has a rich consistency, you&#x27;ll notice that a little goes a long way. The wax goes into the hair nicely and leaves your hair feeling natural and clean. The product comes off the hands nicely, a simple quick rinse and your hands feel clean again.  The cherry smell to me is the best, love the way it smells.  As for the hold, I found that the drier my hair is the stronger the hold.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell. Not as strong as Uppercut Matt clay but definitely better than it.</li>
            <li> The one thing that keeps me from using it, is the smell. It&#x27;s so strong that it&#x27;s overpowering my cologne and not in a good way. If they were to make a fragrance-free version, I&#x27;d totally use it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however I do not LOVE this product. The matte paste is a little more difficult to pull and hold a style. I&#x27;ve had to finish with a spray almost every time I have used the wax. I would recommend this product if you have a lighter full bed of hair. My thick strands and thinly sparsed hair was almost too heavy for product to hold shape after a few hours. If you live in humidity, you&#x27;ll have trouble keeping loose strands in place as the product does not have the chance to set.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, solid product for the price</li>
