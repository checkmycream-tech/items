            <li> Works great on brows.  I never use the highlighter end though.</li>
            <li> Perfect brows every time! This is a colored wax style pencil that temporarily thickens existing brow hairs, and colors the lighter ones so they show up, I get a lot of compliments on how nice my brows are when I wear this, and it looks natural, and women are often surprised that I use anything at all. I used to buy them from the local drug store, but they stopped carrying them. Well, I LOVE this pencil and hope to high Heaven they never stop making it! I&#x27;m totally hooked!</li>
