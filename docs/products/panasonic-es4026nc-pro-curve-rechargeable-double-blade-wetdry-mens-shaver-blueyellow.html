            <li>It glided over my face and gave me a very good shave with no pressure and got all the hair.</li>
            <li>Panasonic makes very good waterproof shavers and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>Having owned this shaver for about a month now, I have to say it is very good.  </li>
            <li>It is best used as a maintenance shaver, from what I have experienced, to keep the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow off of the face.</li>
            <li>The razor is in excellent condition and works great.</li>
            <li>although and the battery life is also good!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give you a REALLY good price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value and a very good product.</li>
            <li>Incredible deal for a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m impressed with the price and think it&#x27;s a good backup razor.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver for the money, and it does just as good a job.</li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with it!</li>

            <li>This razor is GREAT.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great value at the sale price.</li>
            <li>Maybe not so great at list price.    </li>
            <li>The performance is great.  </li>
            <li>The performance is great.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, too.</li>
            <li>If you shave every day this razor is great.  </li>
            <li>and I am always in the market for a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>me was great.  </li>
            <li>Great razor for the price</li>
            <li>They work GREAT (a quote)</li>
            <li>It works great on my face and chest.  </li>
            <li>Works great and stay charged for 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used foil type electrics before and not been happy.</li>
            <li>This razor is a great value.</li>
            <li>He said it worked great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver for $29 but not for $79.</li>
            <li>shaver is SO SMOOTH!!!</li>
            <li>The shaver came in very handy while I was away on a missions trip.</li>
            <li>I bought the dad one for his very own.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise I found this to be the very best electric razor I have ever owned--and I have owned many in my 81 years.  </li>
            <li>For me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works perfect because I was able to keep my beard in line.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best used in the top outlet of a receptacle.  </li>
            <li>Great product and the price is exceptional.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, but very good.</li>
            <li>Charge duration good.  </li>
            <li>Fairly quite.  </li>
            <li>Shape and feel good.  </li>
            <li>Motor speed good.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this for $34 with free shipping and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product for my needs,</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver has a good weight and balance</li>
            <li>you are good to go.</li>
            <li>It irritates the skin yet does not product a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Its good for journey purposes</li>
            <li>You must have a good receptical or you will find your razor on the floor.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>However, this shaver does not give me a good shave; it misses hairs.</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice shaver for a great price.</li>
            <li>Did not do a good job on my face.</li>
            <li>- Holds a good charge</li>
            <li>Good shaver for the price...</li>
            <li>It was was so good</li>
            <li>Good value probably because of the color design.</li>
            <li>All Panasonic appliances seem to be dollar for dollar, good quality.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be fair in rating it, as I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a really good razor for years</li>
            <li>After using a Panasonic linear razor for years I thought any Panasonic product would be just as good.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and good looking.</li>
            <li>ES4026NC, I consider it a good value.  </li>
            <li>Gives a good close shave without cuts or burns.</li>
            <li>Good on my chest too.  </li>
            <li>no matter how good a deal it is.</li>
            <li>Not too good doing your beard.  </li>
            <li>Good as a spare or for travel</li>
            <li>I found it to work fairly well, but not as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>This is a good backup shaver</li>
            <li>Almost as good as a blade,no kidding.</li>
            <li>maybe this would be good for people with thinner beards?  </li>
            <li>it does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li>for the price it is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it leaves me with the equivalent of about 12 hours growth after a good close</li>
            <li>Despite my best efforts from all angles, this shaver still leaves significant stubble and missed hairs.</li>
            <li>Exceptional price</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li>very pleased with this device.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.    </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Bought this one as a backup, I&#x27;ve been using this model for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>Apart from that, I can&#x27;t say anything except that I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Mostly all plastic but works great.</li>
            <li>They would have cost me a great deal more than this razor.  </li>
            <li>My own experience was not so good.</li>
            <li>Top notch!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This shaver is pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li>My $2 schick razor does a better job!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>great product, easy to use</li>
            <li>Another positive fact, this shaver is perfect for women as well as men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good shaver that proves you don&#x27;t have to pay $100 or more to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really an amazing feat.  </li>
            <li>this one is amazing and for the price unbeatable.</li>
            <li>For the cost, along with the free shipping this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this one because it looked so nice.</li>
            <li>Wet/dry option is nice as well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for $30, but I am VERY impressed.</li>
            <li>I REALLY liked the fact that it was battery powered.  </li>
            <li>but I do, on occastion, use this one because it is kind to your face.</li>
            <li>Seems to charge up nicely too.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have the option.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
            <li>A nice close shave, closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still liked the wet/dry concept, so went looking for a replacement and found the Panasonic ES7103K.</li>
            <li>I still liked the wet/dry concept, so went looking for a replacement and found the Panasonic ES7103K.</li>
            <li>I can do the touch up in the nice warm shower 4)</li>
            <li>If I skip shaving more than 2 days it takes a while longer to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>&quot; is a nice option.</li>
            <li>The pop up trimming attachment is a good length and works ok for cleaning up the edges of my beard and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(cord would be nice).</li>
            <li>and it provides a very nice, close shave leaving my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver for the money-I have had 2 of the older style and this one is great for travel.</li>
            <li>Best for keeping face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews on how great this was and felt pretty good about the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it cleans very easily, and it has a nice feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li>and I think they make the best overall electric shavers, but this Panasonic is good.  </li>
            <li>Using a gel is best and, in a matter of days, I am getting superior results and this at a really low price.  </li>
            <li>For me best used daily, I found it doesn&#x27;t do good on a three day beard (Monday morning), but then its not a razor.</li>
            <li>Fairly close and smooth shave when blade not needed.  </li>
            <li>Probably best to shave frequently</li>
            <li>It provides a comfortable shave, and does a good job, providing you don&#x27;t let your beard grow longer than about 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>Basically I&#x27;m sticking to what I know is comfortable to use, convenient and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic Smooth Operator Men&#x27;s shaver in the 80&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working just as great as it did the first day used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of beard, it works fine for me!  </li>
            <li>Razor shaves close, very comfortable and holds a charge.</li>
            <li>It feels very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Looks cool and most of all it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>The build quality and the battery life all seemed fine, but honestly, this razor just never worked for me.  </li>
            <li>but I find my Braun 5416 works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I think that people has a fault expectation that any foil shaver will work as well if they let their beards grow more than 1-2 days.</li>
            <li>It works better for me.</li>
            <li>found it will not cut softer hair, ok on a corse beard.</li>
            <li>Better quality than Remington.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge for the better part of a week.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the design.</li>
            <li>There is no indicator light of any kind.</li>
            <li>So be sure to discharge your shaver fully before each recharge.</li>
            <li>yet I still have to go over my face many, many times to get all the hair cut.</li>
            <li>The feature wet/dry is ok ....</li>
            <li>Also, the charger could have been designed better.</li>
            <li>I have since pulled it out, cleaned and oiled it, and have found that it STILL works better than this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>It takes more work and if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a day then forget it.</li>
            <li>I must say, the cheaper Panasonics seem to be a better value, as more money doesn&#x27;t buy a better shave.  </li>
            <li>For an even better shave, use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Impressive, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was at the neck</li>
            <li>Pleased with results.</li>
            <li>I expect to use it for many years.</li>
            <li>With this Panasonic, I shaved with a blade on Sunday and used the es4026nc to stay nice and smooth all week with NO razor burn.</li>
            <li>how many times I go over it, and over it and over it.    </li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with it for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Update-I have been using the razor for about a month now and am still pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Having had many shavers in my life I&#x27;d rate this one as a \\&quot;good\\&quot; shaver.</li>
            <li>It was better than my $100 Braun.  </li>
            <li>The razor sits on top of the charger when it is plugged in.</li>
            <li>And I for one really love the cable&#x27;les wall charger.</li>
            <li>and this time i&#x27;ll spend some more money.</li>
            <li>It will tell you that the razor is connected, but nothing more.</li>
            <li>sure I could even find parts for it now.  </li>
            <li>I am sure Panasonic has moved on with a newer and improved shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try this shaver based on all the overwhelming reviews.  </li>
            <li>The most I could lose was $30 so not a lot on the line.    </li>
            <li>I will say the Braun with the built inhair trimmer is much more efficient, that is, when it&#x27;s working and has a charge to it.  </li>
            <li>And I found I needed more than being just \\&quot;wet\\&quot; using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Since that time I have used 2 more eventually wearing them out.</li>
            <li>In fact I have just ordered 3 more for gifts.    </li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t have been more on the mark.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a nice, close, comfortable shave</li>
            <li>if the shaver is not placed carefully on top of the charger, it will NOT charge, and may even fall off.</li>
            <li>It holds a good charge and is easy to clean in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Because of the cost of replacement parts, It just makes more sense to just buy it again.</li>
            <li>It works great with shaving cream, but it really shines when used with pre-shave conditioner (Lectricshave).    </li>
            <li>like most shaver there are area</li>
            <li>Overal shave as well as a more expense foil type shavers...</li>
            <li>and they have so many choices with features</li>
            <li>I pleased.</li>
            <li>and it is cheap!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gone through many.</li>
            <li>Believe me you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a better shaver at this price.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, so I became the return customer.</li>
            <li>i want more powerfull for this shaver    </li>
            <li>I have  an angular face with prominent cheek and jaw bones and a pointed chin.  </li>
            <li>will love you for it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading and happy shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to shave with it.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Dissatisfied in Grand Rapids Michigan\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It would be even better if it had one of these two features:    </li>
            <li>Having a corded power adapter (like Braun) or a simple LED battery indicator would make this a perfect product.</li>
            <li>OK I thought.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gold box deal and for $20, it is ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waited many, many years &amp; have read many, many reviews, as well as as asking friends &amp; family about which electric razor to purchase.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement for my cheapo Braun that lasted for more than 8ys but no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li>Nice, close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased my Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver after reading the reviews, and I&#x27;m certainly pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This is simply one of the best electric razors out there for the price.  </li>
            <li>The charger design could be better.  </li>
            <li>Its more like buying pain ..</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>For whatever reason not so well on 2 or more.    </li>
            <li>It worked ok for a while, but wore out also.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave stubble that has grown more</li>
            <li>I also like being able to rinse it under the tap to get out all the beard trimmings.  </li>
            <li>Work ok.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed using this shaver and would do it all over again.</li>
            <li>Shaves okay.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your bathroom electrical outlet is vertically oriented.</li>
            <li>The foils are comfortable and flex nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to my cheap old remington microscreen, this razor is excellent.</li>
            <li>The charging stand plugs into the outlet and the razor sits on top of the stand.</li>
            <li>I could see it working a lot better for that.</li>
            <li>If you like a double head, this is a great shaver!</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s better to have another standby shaver.</li>
            <li>One more thing, it has a NiCd battery, which has memory effect.</li>
            <li>see that many reviewers have said that it does give a close shave-</li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>love this item</li>
            <li>You have to sit it on top of the charger which plugs into the outlet.</li>
            <li>It is fairly lightweight, easy to hold and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The shaver is decent and a great buy for the money.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic Razor does a excellent shaving job, is very easy to use and to clean, and also is very quiet running.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and an overall great deal!</li>
            <li>The best shaver I have ever own, I was shaving with Brown and there is no comparison, this shaver is less noise and shaves a lot closer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very clean</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor on the strength of a positive Consumer Reports rating and many good comments from Amazon reviewers.</li>
            <li>When I saw this Panasonic ES4026NC offered for a great price, read the positive reviews and noted the generous free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering one.</li>
            <li>Does pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li>Though he grumbles, he uses it, and he looks pretty good to me....</li>
            <li>its pretty good i guess</li>
            <li>If you shave every day it provides a pretty good shave and the ability to go</li>
            <li>the shaver worked great and does what it says it can with even more which surprised me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>$30 for an electric shaver is a bargain - it&#x27;s easy to spend $100 or more.</li>
            <li>It gives you a   nice close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>At about 2 bucks a blade,this two prong method is much cheaper than just blades and much better than just the electric shaver (in fact its as good as blades).  </li>
            <li>just cheap shaver it is ok don&#x27;t expect any better things</li>
            <li>The grip, sound and feel of the shaver was very comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I do not find this to be a huge deal, but I do prefer the convenience of being able to use a shaver on a corded charger in case I need to shave when the shaver battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its cheap, yes, but when you have to run it over your face many times and end up sore because of it then</li>
            <li>the cheap isn&#x27;t worthwhile any longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the wet shave with a shaving gel is the best way to shave with this electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I like this shaver - works pretty good; comfortable;</li>
            <li>I tried using it with Jergens Hand Cream to ease the drag, and got wonderful results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond that, I found that the unit really does not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li>He did not feel it gives a close shave, but then he IS measuring it up against the memory of a good barber shave with a straight razor.....  </li>
            <li>What I like the most is how easy it is to clean and</li>
            <li>then you can return it easily.</li>
            <li>how many shaves you&#x27;ll get out of it - and it won&#x27;t be more than a weeks worth.  </li>
            <li>The ES4026NC is easy to maintain and recharge.</li>
            <li>Also, the way it&#x27;s manufactured allows an easy cleaning job.</li>
            <li>Although the ES4026NC is ok, it dosen&#x27;t shave as good as my old one.</li>
            <li>The pop-up edge trimmer works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>After 3 days, still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product because of positive review on Consumer Reports and the Panasonic brand (love their electronic items!).  </li>
            <li>And now it becomes a pain - not being able to get a full week of shaving.</li>
            <li>I had an older version which I liked better.  </li>
            <li>They checked it out and said it works just fine but isn&#x27;t meant to be used on women&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li>sideburn trimmer works fine, so I give it one star.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine on both counts.</li>
            <li>Well the shaver is good but as with all electronic shaver, you can almost never get a clean smooth shave especially near neck</li>
            <li>Pros: well contoured grip, comfortable shaving heads, easy rinsable cleaning, bargain price.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line: this might work on fine hair, but if you have chin-mounted tree trunks like me, forget it.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is light, thus easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This shaver does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>for one thing it does not work unless you have a fine stubble and another you can&#x27;t use it sometimes because it is cordless and is on the charger.</li>
            <li>but whatever that work fine.    </li>
            <li>It does my cheeks fine.  </li>
            <li>If the cost was $150 then the review may have been less than 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve never seen a wet/dry rechargable shaver this affordable - the value is awesome.</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to grip and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to clean.   </li>
            <li>They said it has worked fine and does a good job so far</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic single blade (paid $10 originally) which also provided a very good shave.</li>
            <li>Great for the gym, in your office desk drawer, or as a daily shaver -- if you have a light beard.</li>
            <li>Summary:  lightweight, smooth shaving heads and fairly easy to rinse clean, but</li>
            <li>The shaver is light, holds charge for 4-5 shaves, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Using it while showering makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>This shaver vs [[ASIN:B0009IK198 Braun Free Control 1775 Men&#x27;s Shaver]].</li>
            <li>I tried another economical electric razor but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied as I am with this one.  </li>
            <li>I have used this rasor for several months, works great in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great, but the actual shaver part doesn&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, and this is a cheap razor.</li>
            <li>Understandable why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>Because it is wet/dry, it&#x27;s easy to clean and since it&#x27;s rechargeable, there are no wires for him to contend with.  </li>
            <li>Since it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I just ordered another one for $25.88 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I have never used the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; razor before and really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this shaver to those with light beards.    </li>
            <li>I have a light beard.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES402 is a fantastic shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and I&#x27;ve had no problems with water getting into the unit.</li>
            <li>I also regret that there is no charge status light on the charger, either.  </li>
            <li>It is much more powerful and fancy than this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>IT IS SILKY COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li>Pros: Can use in the shower with shaving cream, easy to clean    Cons:</li>
            <li>If you shave daily (even on the weekends), this shaver will do a great job.  </li>
            <li>This could be a great gift the only problem is the charging.</li>
            <li>Wanted a shaver that would give a close, smooth shave and that could be rinsed off for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light weight and cheap, but it seems to miss those hairs that have grown out and are curved over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy them every year until they are no longer available.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Battery indicator light    of    Corded power charger    </li>
            <li>This Panasonic Wet/Dry fits my needs for a smooth shave and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy clean under running water.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Each free delivery order was received within three days.  </li>
            <li>It feels sturdy, not like some cheap shavers that are just plastic.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Just like the last one, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in my hand and aesthetically, has a sporty look.</li>
            <li>His father liked it so much, he began using it.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a cheap razor 35$ ish</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It does an OK job of shaving, but not as good as the Panasonic three blade, 13,000 rpm linear speed models, such the 8109s.</li>
            <li>but this Panasonic delivers a far superior shave for literaly 1/10 the price.</li>
            <li>He needed something rechargeable and all that good stuff that you need when far from home and needing a shave.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco SensoTouch was far superior in its ability to cut close and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Work fine with me and compare to my Braun, it is cleaner and better and first of all.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard which is electric razor friendly.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a perfect purchase if you&#x27;re new to shaving or an occasional shaver</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Believe all tho positive reviews, this razor is excellent as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>He has been pretty pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Close shave, maintains charge, unique charger.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money we paid for it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that the foil shaver works best for my beard.</li>
            <li>Over time this $20 razor will save me significant bucks.  </li>
            <li>so this is a replacement with a much higher rpm for better efficiency.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, and comes completely as advertised.</li>
            <li>Another positive is how very light this shaver is.  </li>
            <li>but when I need a really clean shave</li>
            <li>I also like the ability to rinse  the shaver clean.  </li>
            <li>It shaves not as clean as the Norelco one it replaced.</li>
            <li>This is very old battery technology, the kind that has a \\&quot;memory\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to a pretty decent razor, it&#x27;ll get your skin pretty smooth pretty easily, and of course is a wet/dry razor which is always great.    </li>
            <li>This shaver is a good value and adequate for general use.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t give the full clean shave</li>
            <li>- Wet shave - shaving cream with an electric shaver is a great shave.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer on this shaver is excellent; in addition it can be used for sideburns, but also for cleaning up around the back of the neck and for trimming body hair in general.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on light, non-course hair that isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy, so I can&#x27;t talk for those who are, but it gave me a great a shave.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good value for money, as one would expect from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Overall, while there is room for lots of improvement, it is a fairly good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>But if I am shaving before I go out at night and therefore don&#x27;t have my full beard</li>
            <li>for\\&quot; is true here.</li>
            <li>Plan ahead for a full battery&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but good enough!</li>
            <li>It is light weight, quiet, and does an excellent job even when the charge is getting low.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge fairly well, but there is no indicator on the razor that the battery is running low.  </li>
            <li>We get the \\&quot;convenience\\&quot; of cordless shavers that ironically don&#x27;t work with cords, just to have the cheap batteries die out in about a years worth of time.  </li>
            <li>A true wet/dry shaver; something I always wanted - a shaver I could use in the shower, as well as out.</li>
            <li>it takes 8 hours for a full recharge.</li>
            <li>If I let it go a full day, it can&#x27;t shave the hairs.  </li>
            <li>This is still true.  </li>
            <li>This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well..</li>
            <li>This one is also so good that I purchased a back up for trips.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it (much better than the ones with spiral blades).</li>
            <li>but actually it&#x27;s just as good as the Braun I replaced.</li>
            <li>This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well.</li>
            <li>i.e. not that close but not bad).</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive razor, it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>Hello, this does better than my Norelco - nearly blade closeness!!!</li>
            <li>but I find it more effective on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I found that this shaver was an OK first cut, followed by a little touch up in the shower with the blade worked great.  </li>
            <li>30 bucks is what you pay for a large pack of traditional blades -- great value.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic rarely disappoints, and this shaver certainly has satisfied me in every way.</li>
            <li>This razor works great when shaving every day or every other day.</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning, the top pops right off and it can be rinsed for an easy clean.  </li>
            <li>The shaver has essentially two heads instead of the three, and it makes shaving under the nose really easy and more accurately with a three blade shaver.</li>
            <li>It works well for shaving quickly without the water and shave gel.  </li>
            <li>The battery tends to lose its charge quickly.  </li>
            <li>After that it charges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Best shaver to get at such a low price!  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to spend more than $40 bucks on a razor, but still desire a decent, quick shaving method, get this razor.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Easy and comfortable to hold, the shaver holds a charge very well, is quiet, and shaves nice and close.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and the first time he tried to use it he got two huge nicks in his neck.</li>
            <li>With a normal amount of stubble it was much better.</li>
            <li>I paid $20.95 with free shipping for my first one.</li>
            <li>otherwise he likes it very much!</li>
            <li>My other razors didn&#x27;t shave as close, but were maybe better at catching all the hairs.</li>
            <li>Since there are only 2 foil cutters, this razor works best on short hairs -- maybe one or two days worth of beard/moustache growth.</li>
            <li>But I liked the idea of the electric, so I then began reading reviews of other shavers to consider buying a better one.</li>
            <li>Not as close a shave as a blade, but gives a good shave, works well, lasts a long time on a charge, and is well built.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m thankfully done w/ it, and I have found most of my chin pretty smooth after running over it w/ the normal razor head after shaving the beard off.</li>
            <li>It does a good job if you shave every day, but if you miss a day or have some stray long whiskers, it&#x27;s not gonna get them.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you something, this things shaves as good as the more expensive electric shavers and just almost as good as a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is ok but trust me you need to use a manual shaver to get a clean shave!</li>
            <li>so I am satisfied with the performance of this newly attained electronic equipment.</li>
            <li>I despise having these huge eyesores on my countertop, ala Braun&#x27;s self cleaning pods, something that also doesn&#x27;t easily fit anywhere in a normal sized bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I bought the previous model (ES4026) about 5 years ago when I just started shaving and it was a great razor.  </li>
            <li>It works VERY well, cleans so easily, you can use it in the shower, comes with recharger.</li>
            <li>Strong and fast.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that because the shave is much closer than my previous electrics, I can easily shave every 2 days rather than every day.</li>
            <li>She is delighted, turns out to be the exact same shaver she has!</li>
            <li>It comes with everything you need; it&#x27;s easy to use and gentle on the face.</li>
            <li>* Very easy to clean, and because its meant for wet usage, it can be easily rinsed as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This new one holds a charge for more than 10 days worth of shaves for me.</li>
            <li>Great for travel as it&#x27;s pretty small and easy to stowe.  </li>
            <li>Rinsed off my face and took the head off the razor and held it under hot water to clean and ran water over the head and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>This is a great little electric razor for those who do not have a think beard.</li>
            <li>This is a great little razor.</li>
            <li>It was light, quiet, easy to clean, held a charge for 5 days, and shaved quickly through a weekend&#x27;s worth of beard.</li>
            <li>either way it helps tremendously being that my faciar hair grows pretty quick.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I own.  </li>
            <li>For under $30 its worth a try with alot of shavers for well over $200 you can buy alot of thease to try out.</li>
            <li>But even on smooth expanses, such as my neck and cheeks, the Panasonic missed many  hairs.</li>
            <li>I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to fix</li>
            <li>the shaver proves to be ineffective.</li>
            <li>every time i use it i condemn it and wish i had bought a different kind.</li>
            <li>stick to your old one if it still works, it is definitely better than this one.    </li>
            <li>NOT EVEN WORTH THE REDUCED PRICE.  </li>
            <li>And, no I do not work for Panasonic or Amazon or a dealer, IT IS THAT EXCITING</li>
            <li>The shaver works great - this makes my 3rd or 4th Panasonic shaver and by far the cheapest one I&#x27;ve owned yet.  </li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to review products, but felt compelled to share my thoughts on this shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The shaver shaves close and is quiet, which were my most important considerations.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure the red light goes on when re-charging or it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>I will keep it handy for short trips or for an emergency trim..</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 year old son who just started shaving and only has some peach fuzz, but he said it dosen&#x27;t work that great.  </li>
            <li>Not a very close shave but good for days when no time for a razor.</li>
            <li>But it worth the price I paid for it (35$).</li>
            <li>fast shipping and overall a good deal.</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed very positive so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other panasonic shavers that did work better, BUT cost much-much more.</li>
            <li>It gets points for being usable in the shower, good battery life and having a pretty decent trimmer, but even at that it barely musters a two-star rating.</li>
            <li>It delivered an extremely close shave, which was rather surprising because of my course hair.</li>
            <li>But not as good as other razors</li>
            <li>The charger plugs right into the outlet</li>
            <li>I picked this up right before Christmas on sale.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver right here on Amazon in June 2009.</li>
            <li>While I liked the wet dry capability of the Norelco, they didn&#x27;t do a particularly good job delivering a close shave.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s kind of funny that some of the same companies spending fortunes telling us how \\&quot;green\\&quot; they are have pricing policies for replacement parts that encourage us to throw stuff away and buy new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are usually great at performing their main task (shaving) but if you are not careful, you may be surprised running out of battery before you are done shaving.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a very large space on your bathroom outlet, you will have to find another place to charge the unit.  </li>
            <li>- Dry shave - comfortable and not too many passes needed for \\&quot;close as blades</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, charges quickly, and shaves as well as my old Norelcos and the fancy Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>The first day I got it I wanted to test it out right there</li>
            <li>but we are back to using disposable shavers with much more success.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean which is also a big plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively quiet, fits the hand well, cuts close, and is easy to clean.   </li>
            <li>Not because they break, but because at this price, it&#x27;s more economical to replace the entire shaver than it is to buy replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Accustomed to a Norelco, I quickly learned that I had to abandon the rotational method for straight strokes.  </li>
            <li>I found it very easy to make a selection for the item I wanted and was extremely satisfied with the way my purchase was handled, especially in being informed several times of the stage the process was at.</li>
            <li>Other than this aspect, it&#x27;s really quite good.</li>
            <li>Good little shaver for the money to take on trips.  </li>
            <li>The problem is, as I am sure many of you know, it costs nearly as much for just one replacement part as it does to buy a whole new razor, let alone multiple parts.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get a new shaver and when it got to my house</li>
            <li>Not only was the deal with Amason easy and quick...</li>
            <li>Compared to many other razors, it was very economical for him to try out.</li>
            <li>The RPM&#x27;s are high on this shaver and enables it to give a nice, close shave without hurting the facial skin.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t one of the high RPM shavers or triple-floating head shavers in the current generation, but it is just as effective.</li>
            <li>The trimmer part is better (overall) but also for getting left over neck hairs (much better than the Brauns trimmer on this job).</li>
            <li>Even if one uses the blade, one will have to run it thru multiple times if the beard is more than a 2 couple days.</li>
            <li>The magic key for a close shave is to shave every day and this shaver delivers that after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this shaver here on Amazon I knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li>Speaking for myself, I think this is a nice extra shaver to have around, but for my beard I want, need, and now own another, beefier model for everyday use (8109s).</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>and I find using it wet does a pretty nice job.</li>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>My first wet/dry shaver, would give it a 5 stars report but the&lt;br</li>
            <li>It offers a smooth shave with no irretation.</li>
            <li>sometimes i am standing there for 10 or more minutes if i want all facial hair gone</li>
            <li>I make sure that I recharge it on the same day of the week.    </li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband for Christmas and the first time he used it</li>
            <li>So, anyone want to buy a gently used shaver?!  </li>
            <li>- I could tell from the first cut that it wasn&#x27;t for me.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Further problems were that the razor could not hold enough charge to do more than 6-7 shaves.</li>
            <li>I had owned a first generation Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>First, it was delivered within the time frame promised.</li>
            <li>Well, this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver</li>
            <li>It may hurt some people at first, but not me.</li>
            <li>finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this shaver and its well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor ever.</li>
            <li>It works OK if you have smaller hair.</li>
            <li>razor fits nicely in my hand; angle of cutting heads works well; works best with shaving lather, but not necessary day to day.  </li>
            <li>But a rotary shaver is too big to get into many of the areas where I want to shave.  </li>
            <li>Work very well!</li>
            <li>Not the best razor, but the battery holds its charge, gets the job done, and isn&#x27;t too expensive.  </li>
            <li>The one downfall is the charger mount is a direct fit to outlet.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought for my grandson who had just started shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have a Braun battery operated 17 dollar shaver which work ten times better.</li>
            <li>The first electric razor I bought lasted 20 years.</li>
            <li>It has a close shave and accommodates my face pretty well even the first time.</li>
            <li>But, it does not give a close shave no matter how many times I go back and forth over areas.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li>Ok/ inexpensive ,charges quickly seems to work better wet with soap .I</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES4026NC Men&#x27;s Shaver fits my requirements very well, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>The reviews for this shaver seem to be all over the place - some real high 4-5 stars, and some blistering 1 stars.</li>
            <li>My results with this shaver are much more favorable - very capable of wet AND dry shaving; it&#x27;s going on three weeks on one charger; cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li>My results with this shaver are much more favorable - very capable of wet AND dry shaving; it&#x27;s going on three weeks on one charger; cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li>First the positive: It is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like about the shaver is the bright yellow trim.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think I like it better than my last shaver, a Braun for which I paid over twice as much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much easier and more efficient to do a quick wet shave with a Gillette Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver is cheaper than buying blades for my expensive Norelco, and gives me as good or better shave.    </li>
            <li>I get as good a shave now as I did with my much more expensive Brauns.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been very please with it&#x27;s performance for what I paid, but now the price has more than doubled.</li>
            <li>The performance depends heavily on how long you wait to shave    ONE day - excellent - compares very favorably with norelco rotary that sells for four times as much.  </li>
            <li>Has nice features and works fine as long as you haven&#x27;t let your whiskers grow too long.</li>
            <li>This product came very adorable, working very well but for less than two months.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the positive - here are the negatives.  </li>
            <li>This is the first wet/dry razor that I have had and it does this very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an 8 week disposable razor than a long term morning friend.</li>
            <li>While there is a noticeable difference in the speed of the razor (mostly noticeable by the decreased volume of the motor), it works great for daily shaving.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets purchasing it and would highly suggest for anyone to purchase this shaver especially if your looking for a good one with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I am a woman and the exact same shaver is available in a ladies&#x27; version in mauve, a color I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>It is important that you use it regularly though as the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>My skin is also fairly sensitive and can get irritated quickly.</li>
            <li>It works better on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up easily under the shower head, and the battery holds a charge through several shaves.</li>
            <li>Remington could be repaired easily and cheaply back in the day.</li>
            <li>In fact, this unit is one of the more comfortable electrics I have used compared to more expensive Norelco rotary, Braun and older Panasonic models.</li>
            <li>First let me state that the shaver&#x27;s colors are nice, blue &amp; yellow.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Braun 760cc last week to replace my Panasonic and the new Braun 760cc which costs more than $100 doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my $19.99 Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Lastly, due to the light weight and the small size, it is easy to shave around beard growth, that is, if you&#x27;re sculpting you&#x27;re own beard.    </li>
            <li>This razor is much slower and less effective.  </li>
            <li>Trouble free and easy to use.</li>
            <li>* Provides nice smooth shave in both wet and dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found you get the most lubrication and closest shave using a gel such as Edge, but a dry shave is almost as close and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love the wet shaving feature which I find considerably better than dry</li>
            <li>I would say that those who liked it must have just a little peach fuzz or something.  </li>
            <li>The shaver I say needs to be a little bit more powerful</li>
            <li>The Braun was better but wasn&#x27;t a true wet dry model and after a few years using it I started to get many more in grown hairs then normal.</li>
            <li>My first impression of this shaver was wow!!</li>
            <li>it has a neat yellow racing track on the shaver molding which looks nice and the shaver makes a buzzing sound and a little boy would like that- he could believe he was shaving just like Dad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my problem is i dont get clean shave as the reviews state,when i used it some area of my face is clean while other ares still have hair.i</li>
            <li>I finish the shave by using some after shave lotion or gel like Nivea to smooth out my facial skin.</li>
            <li>You do not get the really close shave.  </li>
            <li>It really got the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m letting my son decide if this is something he wants to use or not...</li>
            <li>This seemed to be a reasonably priced unit to try.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother than it ever was with the Norelco or Braun.</li>
            <li>it is a much closer shave.      </li>
            <li>Does more than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>I must note that I have a light beard and shave once daily.   </li>
            <li>and a couple I really want to forget.</li>
            <li>(and i don&#x27;t have that much).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with its (wet) performance.  </li>
            <li>it really does not work (for ME) out of the shower.</li>
            <li>But, using it with my face lathered with soap, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Not a problem, I just got into the habit of plugging it in every Sunday, ready to go Monday.</li>
            <li>I have purchased two of these because I like them so much.</li>
            <li>and I ended up having to use a straight edge to finish the job.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>My husband asked me to say he really loves this shaver.  </li>
            <li>On one of them the screen broke by falling off the seat, otherwise they are very reliable.    </li>
            <li>This one seems to shave really close for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps the more expensive razor in Panasonic&#x27;s lineup are better at catching long hairs, but I&#x27;m assuming they all use the same general shave head, so aren&#x27;t any better at this.</li>
            <li>They really seem to like them.</li>
            <li>You will wind up with a really close,smooth face and your boss(your wife)</li>
            <li>The replacement costs of the foil nearly as much as the shaver itself.</li>
            <li>Plus, as a bonus, the trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t hold the machine very well).</li>
            <li>I do not like using this product in the shower, it pulls my skin too much.  </li>
            <li>I found it very convenient to just deal with Amazon and not the seller.</li>
            <li>I still give it 5 stars because for the price and relative performance coupled with it being water proof it works fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>Very durable and dependable.</li>
            <li>that two days very well - you need a rotary shaver for that.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about shavers, but his dislike of this shaver was</li>
            <li>This shaver is not efficient, even for light facial hair.</li>
            <li>Been using this razor for a decade and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s holding up very well.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want to spend much money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Well, for a $[...] buck shaver, I don&#x27;t think we can expect much.</li>
            <li>Now that I own it, here are a few observations that I hope will be helpful:    </li>
            <li>I spent a few more bucks and just got the Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve, far superior.</li>
            <li>bought this Panasonic ES4026, because my old electric shaver died, and I saw this on SALE.&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I mean, the price is good, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge a long time and easy to use.</li>
            <li>(I had one Panasonic Linear shaver which was on it&#x27;s original blades when it quit after five years of daily use).     </li>
            <li>Had the razor for several years and liked the fact you could use it wet, a first in it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d really like the wet shave in the shower, but I find I&#x27;m more comfortable with a dry shave in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li>The ES4026 looks and feels like a shaver better suited for a 17 year old with new facial hair to cut on.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a reliable and very useful hair removal tool; highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you need a nice travel shaver, larger and more sturdy than the tiny little travel shavers, and would like to shaver in the shower, this is it.</li>
            <li>If you need a nice travel shaver, larger and more sturdy than the tiny little travel shavers, and would like to shaver in the shower, this is it.</li>
            <li>This shaver is waterproof and ok in the shower, but it still functions better on a stiff dry beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 2012:  </li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it every morning over last 2 years with no single problem, refer it to anyone for this model AAA+++</li>
            <li>At the moment I have not used it while wet, but the functions for dry have proven as good as it said it would be.</li>
            <li>I do have to run the shaver a couple times through spots, but thats usually normal for many other shavers I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Now, after 4 months, they barely hold 2 days worth of a charge.    </li>
            <li>The first one is 16 years old</li>
            <li>The whole process would take longer than using a normal non electric shaving blade.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad shaver</li>
            <li>I was a little upset about the product because consumer reports gave it such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to every one who needs a new electric razor!</li>
            <li>Less cables the better.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these from Amazon to replaced my older Panasonic ES728 because its battery does not hold charge anymore.</li>
            <li>Even after going over my face numerous times, the razor left many whiskers untouched.</li>
            <li>I have an older Panasonic that cost closer to 100 bucks.  </li>
            <li>I stuck with it and have been using it as my main razor now.</li>
            <li>it looks sporty and contemporary    </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased, till the next generation comes along.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>for what i paid for it, it does the job decently.</li>
            <li>In the past, with an Electric Razor it would take nearly 2x as long, and still not get a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this shaver and its well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I have had several electric razors,Norelco triple heads and a Braun foil one most recently.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver does a decent job and quit burning my skin after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, it holds a decent charge for over a week.</li>
            <li>I tried this razor for a couple of weeks and could not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>The razor is attractive enough and solid, but it just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough to go out in public.</li>
            <li>I purchased the shaver because of the high rating it got in consumer reports.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the price is so high now</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to every one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>It works fine as a wet shaver in and out of the shower</li>
            <li>Having said that, my latest Braun&#x27;s battery once again, ironically, died out after a little over a year.  </li>
            <li>Might be a little challenging for some.  </li>
            <li>This pricing structure is deliberate so as to assure a steady supply of repeat customers for new product.</li>
            <li>Gives clean, close shave both dry or in the shower.</li>
            <li>The shave is quick and easy both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>if let I my beard grow more than a couple days as it lacks the third blade that my Braun has to catch the long stubbles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra $54 for a circular head razor.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one and get something better.</li>
            <li>All in all, a much better everyday</li>
            <li>All in all, a much better everyday shaver.    </li>
            <li>Not sure how it stacks up to more expensive electrics but for the price they are perfect for teenage boys.</li>
            <li>It only works well for me with one day&#x27;s worth of beard growth.</li>
            <li>I normally use a 5 blade \\&quot;sensor\\&quot; hand held razor</li>
            <li>TWO days - good - may leave a wild hair or two and takes a few extra passes to get close  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor but won&#x27;t last (unless you&#x27;re young enough to think 4 years is a long time).</li>
            <li>I needed a new electric razor and while searching for one in Amazon, I came across the Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver and while the low price made me hesitate, I figured that I had little to lose if I wasn&#x27;t happy.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how close the wet shave was with this electric razor, and also surprised about how little skin irritation I experienced (virtually none).  </li>
            <li>As some wall sockets lay on their side, your shaver may be on its side pointing left or right when it&#x27;s recharging, instead of up as would normally expect.</li>
            <li>(also wet or dry is nice.)</li>
            <li>After a few shaves, I was so pleased, that I ordered another Panasonic ES4026NC for my son, who has a heavier beard than mine, and has never found a dry electric shaver adequate for his beard.</li>
            <li>Also, if the charger doesn&#x27;t fit tightly into you outlet, the whole assembly (shaver and charger) will end-up on the floor.</li>
            <li>Does not work well on fine hair and has to be repeated several times on coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>and even if it only lasts half as long as my last razor it will still be a very good deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Might be a good shaver for beginners with soft beards but not for those who have shaved for years and have tough beards.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s not late June and the shaver started making a really loud squeeking sound and the shaving block was moving super slow.</li>
            <li>&quot; a new razor</li>
            <li>It is cheaper to buy a new one then replace the metal screen and blade.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new PanasonicShaver.  </li>
            <li>when it was new.  </li>
            <li>it as soon as i have a new one.</li>
            <li>I got a fancy new shaver for Christmas a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now I am using the Panasonic ES4026NC and waiting for the replacement parts to get here for my new</li>
            <li>Battery runs out after 6 shaves (this was a brand new unit).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a new Panasonic (I&#x27;m sold on the brand)</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know where to get a new battery</li>
            <li>kinda bummed i got a brand new braun instead of 30$ for new blade.</li>
            <li>I bought this Panasonic shaver based on the reviews on Amazon and was greatly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as a standard dry shaver and it kept missing hairs.  </li>
            <li>it  easily folds back in when you use it, so you have to be careful and not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>So I recommend that you use this as a wet shave only with shaving cream and you will love it.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use, and it provides a much closer shave than I possible without using a blade.  </li>
            <li>First off let me state, I have Parkinson&#x27;s and normal blade shaving has taken on An Ancient Chinese Custom of slitting ones throat, ears not to be excluded.</li>
            <li>Please note that the charging stand requires enough space above the outlet to allow the razor to fit.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a capable razor for some men, if your beard is particularly thick, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done two shaves (the first being very long since I had a ton of beard growth) and so far it seems like it has enough juice in it for 1 or 2 more regular 3-5 minute shaves.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is due to the fine beard I have, but my old Norelco never had that problem.</li>
            <li>There are sections that do get a close shave, but the neckline is difficult and I feel like it takes a long time to get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>I had a cheaper Panasonic razor that worked much better and have gone back to that one while I await a new, more expensive Norelco.</li>
            <li>I tried shaving my very fine leg hairs with the fully charged shaver and hardly any hairs were shaved.  </li>
            <li>old son likes to use this when he&#x27;s un a hurry before school!  </li>
            <li>For me, not having to shave everyday makes up for any complaint I would have about short battery life or the charger not being the best (since it is a wall cradle rather than a cord).     </li>
            <li>Considering that most shavers already cost upwards of $50, some up to $250 (unbelievable), it&#x27;s, well, quite a scam.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely not one to use for the seasoned face.</li>
            <li>If you are questioning your first venture into electric razors or you are a veteran, this razor shaves closer than a blade.</li>
            <li>After the first three uses it is still no match for a regular razor</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would like, but that may just be typical of electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The shaver is very quiet and it tends to cut pretty close.  </li>
            <li>This thing seems pretty solid.  </li>
            <li>the only fault with this razor is it has trouble with longer hairs, and has a short battery life...is good for about 5 shaves and then needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>This particular model is his favorite and hard to get in the stores.</li>
            <li>The design of this shaver is extremely functional with an ideal cutting area that&#x27;s easy to maneuver around your face whether you&#x27;re trimming a beard, shaving around a beard, or just shaving your entire face.  </li>
            <li>It is relatively inexpensive, yet performs much the same as some of the very pricey, very upscale products.  </li>
            <li>Recharge time is 8 hours for a full charge but enough of a partial charge to get one more shave out of it takes much less time.  </li>
            <li>Maybe its meant for more mature whiskers, not sure.</li>
            <li>Extending that by just a minute more cuts it down to 6 days; 2 minutes extra minute 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>Including two different Wet Dry Norelco/Philips \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; models and most recently a Braun 5775.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty; charges well; just doesn&#x27;t seem to shave closely and has a problem with longer hairs that are lying flat.  </li>
            <li>The shaving head is a little smaller than my previous razor, but the wet/dry option is great.</li>
            <li>The wet shaving works better than dry shaving if you follow the directions of foaming it with soap or shaving cream.</li>
            <li>OK - for the same price as a replacement blade/foil for my previous shaver, the decision to buy the Panasonic Pro Curve was a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>It is adequate as a back up shaver only, perhaps for your gym bag.</li>
            <li>But it does fit tightly and has not fell out of outlet, had it for a year now,(knock on wood).</li>
            <li>It turned out to be barely usable and time consuming to get even close to a decent shave.      </li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard and it does a decent job, but I have some really fine hairs on my neck</li>
            <li>I have an average beard- not real heavy or light.</li>
            <li>I am forced to replace my old ES728 because this thing costs less than the replacement foil/cutter and plus more $$ cost to replace the old battery (assuming that it is even available from Panasonic).</li>
            <li>WHILE BATHING,IT HAS LONG BATTERY LIFE,  AND IT IS VERY REASONABLY PRICED.   </li>
            <li>I check it out with Consumer report and found that it had a very high rating even with its low price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be an expensive paperweight after 3 years when the battery worn out and it is not eco friendly to throw away a perfectly good shaver because the company does not provide typical battery repair service that Norelco would.</li>
            <li>After just two months, though, the cutting capabilities greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li>I priced out replacement blades and screen and was a bit surprised to see the price was about the same as buying the whole unit again.  </li>
            <li>only gripe is that the charger isn&#x27;t very sensibly designed - it mounts the shaver directly into the socket.</li>
            <li>I believe the Braun gives a tiny bit (but not too much) closer shave.    </li>
            <li>Overall I would really have to give this match a tie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>(foam-type, not gel) and rinse the shaver frequently.  </li>
            <li>not waste</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised that a cord did not come with this unit.  </li>
            <li>It cannot completely remove the hairs in and around the neck.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband and he seems to like it so far...</li>
            <li>the only thing that he had to say negatively was that the pop out trimmer should have had a better angle on it instead of coming straight out...</li>
            <li>The only real downside I can find is that IT SUCKS if you have any kind of beard (especially w/ coarse hair)</li>
            <li>This product was completely ineffective in shaving my face.</li>
            <li>I paid 3 times as much for a razor that does just about the same.</li>
            <li>So far, no problems.</li>
            <li>I pulled out my old Panasonic and it still worked.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a whole different article.    </li>
            <li>Obviously, it works for some but really doesn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>such, I can&#x27;t really recommend this.  </li>
            <li>It takes about a week for your skin to completely get used to the change from a blade.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of usage, it always left much more stubble than my former Norelco or current Braun models (those aren&#x27;t wet/dry).  </li>
            <li>and WOW am</li>
            <li>If I miss a day, I have to shave with a razor (or my old Remington shaver).</li>
            <li>This razor shaves really close (I use regular Barbasol shaving cream.)</li>
            <li>but i will see how it goes for a whole week and then make a final decision.</li>
            <li>It should show a green light when fully charged but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>so that was a BONUS as far as I was concerned...</li>
            <li>Upon Reading the User Instructions, I was surprised to read that it is recommended to use shave foam.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to redo my neck with my Mach 3 frequently.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed that I frequently have whiskers that have been completely missed by the razor.  </li>
            <li>Bought this shaver rather than a replacement shaver head for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>I use it wet and it gives me a faster shave than my old electric shaver and afterward my face feels as smooth as it did when I used a blade razor -- only no razor burn.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>After using this one, I realize the blade on my old one dulled out a bit.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and keep it short</li>
            <li>My 5 year old Reminton gives a far closer shave.</li>
            <li>Got it for the 16 year old son and he loves it,</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard any complains so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m showing my age, but my old beat up</li>
            <li>but I could see how a more expensive shaver might be worth it.</li>
            <li>Not only did it not shave my beard (which is not a tough beard)</li>
            <li>This was evident shaving either dry or with lather</li>
            <li>The trimmer side will usually pick up those whiskers but not always easily either.</li>
            <li>When hairs are longer and tend to not get in the tiny holes of the foil as easily, this razor lacks a trimming type of cutter between the foils which I had on a previous Panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to touch up with a blade, and every few days I have to use a blade to get everything really clean.    </li>
            <li>I mainly use it for touch ups after a regular blade shave.</li>
            <li>This was my first Panasonic shaver and I&#x27;m definitely sold on them for the future.</li>
            <li>Small manufacturing gripe - the foil release buttons on the side can get stuck if you push them in too far, keeping the foil from reattaching securely.</li>
            <li>Decent charge time and battery usage (about the same as a Norelco rotary shaver).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This shaver rated high on Consumer Reports for performing well and its low cost.</li>
            <li>Overall:    I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it is a smooth shave dry, have not tried wet.</li>
            <li>It was a nice little shaver, but not cut out for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It was a nice little shaver, but not cut out for everyday use.</li>
            <li>But my Norelco finally died and I did not want to spend over $100 for a new one.  </li>
            <li>But the new shaver you have to use cleaning fluid</li>
            <li>The batteries are about shot in this Panasonic and it could definitely use new blades.</li>
            <li>decided to buy another one instead of purchasing replacement blades, for it was just about the same price as of the new razor.  </li>
            <li>But I soon discovered it loses a lot of its effectiveness very quick.</li>
            <li>One thing I will add is that it is MUCH better as a wet dry shaver with shaving foam in the shower than a dry shave.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it dry and had an even more difficult time using it wet.  </li>
            <li>It would charge erratically, not getting a full charge even overnight, barely charging enough for a single day&#x27;s shave, until finally</li>
            <li>However the good old blade made it look very bad and besides that it was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>The ES4026 gives as good a shave as the ES8077, and the price is AT LEAST $70 LESS!  </li>
            <li>At this moment I have major skin burns and cuts on my chin.</li>
            <li>The only difference here is that wet shaving will go quicker if you do it right, but it will still sting as always.  </li>
            <li>I have a very light beard and the shaver leaves a lot behind.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, I personally really like the small compact recharger on this shaver.  </li>
            <li>If I try too hard to get those areas as baby smooth as the rest of my face, I do get some razor burn.</li>
            <li>If it does come back I highly recommend this to beard and mustache owners as a second shaver for the close areas.  </li>
            <li>I used it mainly as a wet/semi-wet shaver and it is easy to clean with just water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d not buy any expensive Panasonic shavers like the linear, vortex or arc lines because they do not offer battery replacement and they tend to lose charge in a few years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, holds a long charge and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>As I travel constantly on business, I have nearly worn out one of these units (5 years usage,)</li>
            <li>There is no recharging cord,  only a plug adapter that fits directly in your wall socket.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a Norelco three head electric razor that was over ten years old.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I had to compare this to was a 20 year old electric...</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor for my 94 year old Father who has recently had a stroke.</li>
            <li>The only use I would recommend it for, is as a play toy shaver for your 5 year old son -</li>
            <li>- I just have to manipulate the release button to pop it back out - but it does keep the shaver from working correctly until it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li>I never spent a penny on replacement parts for</li>
            <li>Barely cut my hair.</li>
            <li>It misses hairs and takes twice the time to shave as my old one taking the Linear out of their line was a big mistake...</li>
            <li>The only thing that baffles me is why the red light for charging, doesn&#x27;t turn green when fully charged.</li>
            <li>Now after using for about a month, I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I give it an extra star above the average for (what seems so far like) completely safe wet shaving for that low price.</li>
            <li>but it cannot be ny worse than this one) for sure.  </li>
            <li>If you wait longer than a day to shave, it doesn&#x27;t work well at all and leaves a lot of hairs behind no matter how many times you go over them.</li>
            <li>I just did a dry shave for the first time (since I was running late this morning and didn&#x27;t have time to use it in the shower) and the shave is much more like a typical electric razor (</li>
            <li>I truly get just as close as a blade, with just a few passes, except in some areas under my jaw and right on the jaw line.</li>
            <li>Not much to say on the positive side to balance this out since it simply does not work.</li>
            <li>My beard is coarse and wiry, with medium thickness and with 2 days growth this unit gave a comfortable if not super close shave (I use it dry).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never created a review for any previous Amazon purchase; this is my first.    </li>
            <li>I also never had trouble with the battery, even when weak after not charging gave a good shave.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t really recommend one over the other.</li>
            <li>so that is a bit odd but even with that option there is still significant post razor burn even when using it wet.</li>
            <li>Boy, he was surprised that it shaved like a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>My last electric was one of the expensive Panasonic Linear razors and while I really liked that razor</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see or feel a big difference between the Panasonic&#x27;s double head vs the Braun single head.    </li>
            <li>As beard hairs get longer and less stubbly, they sometimes have difficulty entering the foil to be cut, and then its necessary to use the trimmer first to shorten the hairs in question.  </li>
            <li>Takes 3 times as long to shave compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li>Being in my early 60&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been shaving a long time.</li>
            <li>Since I always need to trim my sideburns and beard, this product really lets me down on this.</li>
            <li>However, the battery dies down without much notice.</li>
            <li>first, it didn&#x27;t cut any hairs at all, so he tried to push it a little firmer on his skin and it totally tore into his skin.</li>
            <li>I get a terrific shave in the shower with a little shampoo smeared on my face first.</li>
            <li>The blades tends to go dull quickly.  </li>
            <li>For people with thin/regular beards or more moderate growth who shave every single day (twice?), the Pro Curve would probably do a serviceable job, but it&#x27;s not a good match for me.</li>
            <li>but I live at a military academy</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, I was originally going to give it 3 stars, but knocked it down 1 for dying on me less than a year after purchase.</li>
            <li>So, I was originally going to give it 3 stars, but knocked it down 1 for dying on me less than a year after purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter and has much less vibration than the Braun.</li>
            <li>The flip up feature is too small to do any amount of long whisker shaving and the main doesn&#x27;t do the job very well on longer growth.</li>
            <li>especially the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>Stay away from this model and consider something a little more expensive, it is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>It has done an admiral job, although I found that I get a much closer shave using it dry vs. wet.</li>
            <li>It shaves as close as the old Panasonic, but the double heads cause me to miss single whiskers.  </li>
            <li>It performs well wet or dry and holds a charge much the same as my Norelco did.  </li>
            <li>Not long hairs but a lot of tiny short hairs that won&#x27;t cut no matter</li>
            <li>I use this electric shaver after i use schick or gillette blades which seem to have trouble with certain areas of my face especially around my lips.  </li>

            <li> Panasonic makes very good waterproof shavers and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> Having owned this shaver for about a month now, I have to say it is very good.  </li>
            <li> It is best used as a maintenance shaver, from what I have experienced, to keep the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow off of the face.</li>
            <li> The razor is in excellent condition and works great.</li>
            <li> although and the battery life is also good!  </li>

            <li> This razor is GREAT.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great value at the sale price.</li>
            <li> Maybe not so great at list price.    </li>
            <li> The performance is great.  </li>
            <li> The performance is great.  </li>
            <li> The price is great, too.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day this razor is great.  </li>
            <li> and I am always in the market for a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> me was great.  </li>
            <li> Great razor for the price</li>
            <li> They work GREAT (a quote)</li>
            <li> It works great on my face and chest.  </li>
            <li> Works great and stay charged for 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used foil type electrics before and not been happy.</li>
            <li> This razor is a great value.</li>
            <li> He said it worked great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver for $29 but not for $79.</li>
            <li> shaver is SO SMOOTH!!!</li>
            <li> The shaver came in very handy while I was away on a missions trip.</li>
            <li> I bought the dad one for his very own.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise I found this to be the very best electric razor I have ever owned--and I have owned many in my 81 years.  </li>
            <li> For me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works perfect because I was able to keep my beard in line.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best used in the top outlet of a receptacle.  </li>
            <li> Great product and the price is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, but very good.</li>
            <li> Charge duration good.  </li>
            <li> Fairly quite.  </li>
            <li> Shape and feel good.  </li>
            <li> Motor speed good.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for $34 with free shipping and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good product for my needs,</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has a good weight and balance</li>
            <li> you are good to go.</li>
            <li> It irritates the skin yet does not product a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Its good for journey purposes</li>
            <li> You must have a good receptical or you will find your razor on the floor.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> However, this shaver does not give me a good shave; it misses hairs.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice shaver for a great price.</li>
            <li> Did not do a good job on my face.</li>
            <li> - Holds a good charge</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the price...</li>
            <li> It was was so good</li>
            <li> Good value probably because of the color design.</li>
            <li> All Panasonic appliances seem to be dollar for dollar, good quality.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be fair in rating it, as I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a really good razor for years</li>
            <li> After using a Panasonic linear razor for years I thought any Panasonic product would be just as good.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and good looking.</li>
            <li> ES4026NC, I consider it a good value.  </li>
            <li> Gives a good close shave without cuts or burns.</li>
            <li> Good on my chest too.  </li>
            <li> no matter how good a deal it is.</li>
            <li> Not too good doing your beard.  </li>
            <li> Good as a spare or for travel</li>
            <li> I found it to work fairly well, but not as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> This is a good backup shaver</li>
            <li> Almost as good as a blade,no kidding.</li>
            <li> maybe this would be good for people with thinner beards?  </li>
            <li> it does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li> for the price it is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it leaves me with the equivalent of about 12 hours growth after a good close</li>
            <li> Despite my best efforts from all angles, this shaver still leaves significant stubble and missed hairs.</li>
            <li> Exceptional price</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.    </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this one as a backup, I&#x27;ve been using this model for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> Apart from that, I can&#x27;t say anything except that I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Mostly all plastic but works great.</li>
            <li> They would have cost me a great deal more than this razor.  </li>
            <li> My own experience was not so good.</li>
            <li> Top notch!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This shaver is pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li> My $2 schick razor does a better job!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> great product, easy to use</li>
            <li> Another positive fact, this shaver is perfect for women as well as men.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very good shaver that proves you don&#x27;t have to pay $100 or more to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an amazing feat.  </li>
            <li> this one is amazing and for the price unbeatable.</li>
            <li> For the cost, along with the free shipping this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> The battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this one because it looked so nice.</li>
            <li> Wet/dry option is nice as well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for $30, but I am VERY impressed.</li>
            <li> I REALLY liked the fact that it was battery powered.  </li>
            <li> but I do, on occastion, use this one because it is kind to your face.</li>
            <li> Seems to charge up nicely too.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have the option.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest...</li>
            <li> A nice close shave, closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still liked the wet/dry concept, so went looking for a replacement and found the Panasonic ES7103K.</li>
            <li> I still liked the wet/dry concept, so went looking for a replacement and found the Panasonic ES7103K.</li>
            <li> I can do the touch up in the nice warm shower 4)</li>
            <li> If I skip shaving more than 2 days it takes a while longer to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> &quot; is a nice option.</li>
            <li> The pop up trimming attachment is a good length and works ok for cleaning up the edges of my beard and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (cord would be nice).</li>
            <li> and it provides a very nice, close shave leaving my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the money-I have had 2 of the older style and this one is great for travel.</li>
            <li> Best for keeping face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on how great this was and felt pretty good about the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it cleans very easily, and it has a nice feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li> and I think they make the best overall electric shavers, but this Panasonic is good.  </li>
            <li> Using a gel is best and, in a matter of days, I am getting superior results and this at a really low price.  </li>
            <li> For me best used daily, I found it doesn&#x27;t do good on a three day beard (Monday morning), but then its not a razor.</li>
            <li> Fairly close and smooth shave when blade not needed.  </li>
            <li> Probably best to shave frequently</li>
            <li> It provides a comfortable shave, and does a good job, providing you don&#x27;t let your beard grow longer than about 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> Basically I&#x27;m sticking to what I know is comfortable to use, convenient and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic Smooth Operator Men&#x27;s shaver in the 80&#x27;s and loved it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working just as great as it did the first day used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of beard, it works fine for me!  </li>
            <li> Razor shaves close, very comfortable and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> It feels very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Looks cool and most of all it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> The build quality and the battery life all seemed fine, but honestly, this razor just never worked for me.  </li>
            <li> but I find my Braun 5416 works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I think that people has a fault expectation that any foil shaver will work as well if they let their beards grow more than 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> It works better for me.</li>
            <li> found it will not cut softer hair, ok on a corse beard.</li>
            <li> Better quality than Remington.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for the better part of a week.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the design.</li>
            <li> There is no indicator light of any kind.</li>
            <li> So be sure to discharge your shaver fully before each recharge.</li>
            <li> yet I still have to go over my face many, many times to get all the hair cut.</li>
            <li> The feature wet/dry is ok ....</li>
            <li> Also, the charger could have been designed better.</li>
            <li> I have since pulled it out, cleaned and oiled it, and have found that it STILL works better than this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It takes more work and if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a day then forget it.</li>
            <li> I must say, the cheaper Panasonics seem to be a better value, as more money doesn&#x27;t buy a better shave.  </li>
            <li> For an even better shave, use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Impressive, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was at the neck</li>
            <li> Pleased with results.</li>
            <li> I expect to use it for many years.</li>
            <li> With this Panasonic, I shaved with a blade on Sunday and used the es4026nc to stay nice and smooth all week with NO razor burn.</li>
            <li> how many times I go over it, and over it and over it.    </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with it for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Update-I have been using the razor for about a month now and am still pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Having had many shavers in my life I&#x27;d rate this one as a \\&quot;good\\&quot; shaver.</li>
            <li> It was better than my $100 Braun.  </li>
            <li> The razor sits on top of the charger when it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> And I for one really love the cable&#x27;les wall charger.</li>
            <li> and this time i&#x27;ll spend some more money.</li>
            <li> It will tell you that the razor is connected, but nothing more.</li>
            <li> sure I could even find parts for it now.  </li>
            <li> I am sure Panasonic has moved on with a newer and improved shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shaver based on all the overwhelming reviews.  </li>
            <li> The most I could lose was $30 so not a lot on the line.    </li>
            <li> I will say the Braun with the built inhair trimmer is much more efficient, that is, when it&#x27;s working and has a charge to it.  </li>
            <li> And I found I needed more than being just \\&quot;wet\\&quot; using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Since that time I have used 2 more eventually wearing them out.</li>
            <li> In fact I have just ordered 3 more for gifts.    </li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t have been more on the mark.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a nice, close, comfortable shave</li>
            <li> if the shaver is not placed carefully on top of the charger, it will NOT charge, and may even fall off.</li>
            <li> It holds a good charge and is easy to clean in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Because of the cost of replacement parts, It just makes more sense to just buy it again.</li>
            <li> It works great with shaving cream, but it really shines when used with pre-shave conditioner (Lectricshave).    </li>
            <li> like most shaver there are area</li>
            <li> Overal shave as well as a more expense foil type shavers...</li>
            <li> and they have so many choices with features</li>
            <li> I pleased.</li>
            <li> and it is cheap!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone through many.</li>
            <li> Believe me you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a better shaver at this price.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, so I became the return customer.</li>
            <li> i want more powerfull for this shaver    </li>
            <li> I have  an angular face with prominent cheek and jaw bones and a pointed chin.  </li>
            <li> will love you for it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading and happy shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Dissatisfied in Grand Rapids Michigan\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It would be even better if it had one of these two features:    </li>
            <li> Having a corded power adapter (like Braun) or a simple LED battery indicator would make this a perfect product.</li>
            <li> OK I thought.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gold box deal and for $20, it is ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited many, many years &amp; have read many, many reviews, as well as as asking friends &amp; family about which electric razor to purchase.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my cheapo Braun that lasted for more than 8ys but no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> Nice, close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver after reading the reviews, and I&#x27;m certainly pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is simply one of the best electric razors out there for the price.  </li>
            <li> The charger design could be better.  </li>
            <li> Its more like buying pain ..</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> For whatever reason not so well on 2 or more.    </li>
            <li> It worked ok for a while, but wore out also.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave stubble that has grown more</li>
            <li> I also like being able to rinse it under the tap to get out all the beard trimmings.  </li>
            <li> Work ok.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using this shaver and would do it all over again.</li>
            <li> Shaves okay.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your bathroom electrical outlet is vertically oriented.</li>
            <li> The foils are comfortable and flex nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to my cheap old remington microscreen, this razor is excellent.</li>
            <li> The charging stand plugs into the outlet and the razor sits on top of the stand.</li>
            <li> I could see it working a lot better for that.</li>
            <li> If you like a double head, this is a great shaver!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s better to have another standby shaver.</li>
            <li> One more thing, it has a NiCd battery, which has memory effect.</li>
            <li> see that many reviewers have said that it does give a close shave-</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> love this item</li>
            <li> You have to sit it on top of the charger which plugs into the outlet.</li>
            <li> It is fairly lightweight, easy to hold and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The shaver is decent and a great buy for the money.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic Razor does a excellent shaving job, is very easy to use and to clean, and also is very quiet running.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and an overall great deal!</li>
            <li> The best shaver I have ever own, I was shaving with Brown and there is no comparison, this shaver is less noise and shaves a lot closer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very clean</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on the strength of a positive Consumer Reports rating and many good comments from Amazon reviewers.</li>
            <li> When I saw this Panasonic ES4026NC offered for a great price, read the positive reviews and noted the generous free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering one.</li>
            <li> Does pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li> Though he grumbles, he uses it, and he looks pretty good to me....</li>
            <li> its pretty good i guess</li>
            <li> If you shave every day it provides a pretty good shave and the ability to go</li>
            <li> the shaver worked great and does what it says it can with even more which surprised me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> $30 for an electric shaver is a bargain - it&#x27;s easy to spend $100 or more.</li>
            <li> It gives you a   nice close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> At about 2 bucks a blade,this two prong method is much cheaper than just blades and much better than just the electric shaver (in fact its as good as blades).  </li>
            <li> just cheap shaver it is ok don&#x27;t expect any better things</li>
            <li> The grip, sound and feel of the shaver was very comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I do not find this to be a huge deal, but I do prefer the convenience of being able to use a shaver on a corded charger in case I need to shave when the shaver battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its cheap, yes, but when you have to run it over your face many times and end up sore because of it then</li>
            <li> the cheap isn&#x27;t worthwhile any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the wet shave with a shaving gel is the best way to shave with this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I like this shaver - works pretty good; comfortable;</li>
            <li> I tried using it with Jergens Hand Cream to ease the drag, and got wonderful results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond that, I found that the unit really does not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li> He did not feel it gives a close shave, but then he IS measuring it up against the memory of a good barber shave with a straight razor.....  </li>
            <li> What I like the most is how easy it is to clean and</li>
            <li> then you can return it easily.</li>
            <li> how many shaves you&#x27;ll get out of it - and it won&#x27;t be more than a weeks worth.  </li>
            <li> The ES4026NC is easy to maintain and recharge.</li>
            <li> Also, the way it&#x27;s manufactured allows an easy cleaning job.</li>
            <li> Although the ES4026NC is ok, it dosen&#x27;t shave as good as my old one.</li>
            <li> The pop-up edge trimmer works well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> After 3 days, still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product because of positive review on Consumer Reports and the Panasonic brand (love their electronic items!).  </li>
            <li> And now it becomes a pain - not being able to get a full week of shaving.</li>
            <li> I had an older version which I liked better.  </li>
            <li> They checked it out and said it works just fine but isn&#x27;t meant to be used on women&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li> sideburn trimmer works fine, so I give it one star.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine on both counts.</li>
            <li> Well the shaver is good but as with all electronic shaver, you can almost never get a clean smooth shave especially near neck</li>
            <li> Pros: well contoured grip, comfortable shaving heads, easy rinsable cleaning, bargain price.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line: this might work on fine hair, but if you have chin-mounted tree trunks like me, forget it.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is light, thus easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> for one thing it does not work unless you have a fine stubble and another you can&#x27;t use it sometimes because it is cordless and is on the charger.</li>
            <li> but whatever that work fine.    </li>
            <li> It does my cheeks fine.  </li>
            <li> If the cost was $150 then the review may have been less than 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve never seen a wet/dry rechargable shaver this affordable - the value is awesome.</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to grip and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to clean.   </li>
            <li> They said it has worked fine and does a good job so far</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic single blade (paid $10 originally) which also provided a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Great for the gym, in your office desk drawer, or as a daily shaver -- if you have a light beard.</li>
            <li> Summary:  lightweight, smooth shaving heads and fairly easy to rinse clean, but</li>
            <li> The shaver is light, holds charge for 4-5 shaves, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Using it while showering makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> This shaver vs [[ASIN:B0009IK198 Braun Free Control 1775 Men&#x27;s Shaver]].</li>
            <li> I tried another economical electric razor but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied as I am with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have used this rasor for several months, works great in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, but the actual shaver part doesn&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and this is a cheap razor.</li>
            <li> Understandable why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Because it is wet/dry, it&#x27;s easy to clean and since it&#x27;s rechargeable, there are no wires for him to contend with.  </li>
            <li> Since it was so cheap</li>
            <li> I just ordered another one for $25.88 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have never used the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; razor before and really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this shaver to those with light beards.    </li>
            <li> I have a light beard.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES402 is a fantastic shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and I&#x27;ve had no problems with water getting into the unit.</li>
            <li> I also regret that there is no charge status light on the charger, either.  </li>
            <li> It is much more powerful and fancy than this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> IT IS SILKY COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> Pros: Can use in the shower with shaving cream, easy to clean    Cons:</li>
            <li> If you shave daily (even on the weekends), this shaver will do a great job.  </li>
            <li> This could be a great gift the only problem is the charging.</li>
            <li> Wanted a shaver that would give a close, smooth shave and that could be rinsed off for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight and cheap, but it seems to miss those hairs that have grown out and are curved over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy them every year until they are no longer available.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Battery indicator light    of    Corded power charger    </li>
            <li> This Panasonic Wet/Dry fits my needs for a smooth shave and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy clean under running water.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Each free delivery order was received within three days.  </li>
            <li> It feels sturdy, not like some cheap shavers that are just plastic.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just like the last one, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in my hand and aesthetically, has a sporty look.</li>
            <li> His father liked it so much, he began using it.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a cheap razor 35$ ish</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It does an OK job of shaving, but not as good as the Panasonic three blade, 13,000 rpm linear speed models, such the 8109s.</li>
            <li> but this Panasonic delivers a far superior shave for literaly 1/10 the price.</li>
            <li> He needed something rechargeable and all that good stuff that you need when far from home and needing a shave.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco SensoTouch was far superior in its ability to cut close and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Work fine with me and compare to my Braun, it is cleaner and better and first of all.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard which is electric razor friendly.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a perfect purchase if you&#x27;re new to shaving or an occasional shaver</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Believe all tho positive reviews, this razor is excellent as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> He has been pretty pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, maintains charge, unique charger.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money we paid for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the foil shaver works best for my beard.</li>
            <li> Over time this $20 razor will save me significant bucks.  </li>
            <li> so this is a replacement with a much higher rpm for better efficiency.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, and comes completely as advertised.</li>
            <li> Another positive is how very light this shaver is.  </li>
            <li> but when I need a really clean shave</li>
            <li> I also like the ability to rinse  the shaver clean.  </li>
            <li> It shaves not as clean as the Norelco one it replaced.</li>
            <li> This is very old battery technology, the kind that has a \\&quot;memory\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to a pretty decent razor, it&#x27;ll get your skin pretty smooth pretty easily, and of course is a wet/dry razor which is always great.    </li>
            <li> This shaver is a good value and adequate for general use.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t give the full clean shave</li>
            <li> - Wet shave - shaving cream with an electric shaver is a great shave.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on this shaver is excellent; in addition it can be used for sideburns, but also for cleaning up around the back of the neck and for trimming body hair in general.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good on light, non-course hair that isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy, so I can&#x27;t talk for those who are, but it gave me a great a shave.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good value for money, as one would expect from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Overall, while there is room for lots of improvement, it is a fairly good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> But if I am shaving before I go out at night and therefore don&#x27;t have my full beard</li>
            <li> for\\&quot; is true here.</li>
            <li> Plan ahead for a full battery&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but good enough!</li>
            <li> It is light weight, quiet, and does an excellent job even when the charge is getting low.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge fairly well, but there is no indicator on the razor that the battery is running low.  </li>
            <li> We get the \\&quot;convenience\\&quot; of cordless shavers that ironically don&#x27;t work with cords, just to have the cheap batteries die out in about a years worth of time.  </li>
            <li> A true wet/dry shaver; something I always wanted - a shaver I could use in the shower, as well as out.</li>
            <li> it takes 8 hours for a full recharge.</li>
            <li> If I let it go a full day, it can&#x27;t shave the hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is still true.  </li>
            <li> This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well..</li>
            <li> This one is also so good that I purchased a back up for trips.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it (much better than the ones with spiral blades).</li>
            <li> but actually it&#x27;s just as good as the Braun I replaced.</li>
            <li> This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well.</li>
            <li> i.e. not that close but not bad).</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive razor, it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> Hello, this does better than my Norelco - nearly blade closeness!!!</li>
            <li> but I find it more effective on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I found that this shaver was an OK first cut, followed by a little touch up in the shower with the blade worked great.  </li>
            <li> 30 bucks is what you pay for a large pack of traditional blades -- great value.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic rarely disappoints, and this shaver certainly has satisfied me in every way.</li>
            <li> This razor works great when shaving every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning, the top pops right off and it can be rinsed for an easy clean.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has essentially two heads instead of the three, and it makes shaving under the nose really easy and more accurately with a three blade shaver.</li>
            <li> It works well for shaving quickly without the water and shave gel.  </li>
            <li> The battery tends to lose its charge quickly.  </li>
            <li> After that it charges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Best shaver to get at such a low price!  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to spend more than $40 bucks on a razor, but still desire a decent, quick shaving method, get this razor.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to hold, the shaver holds a charge very well, is quiet, and shaves nice and close.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and the first time he tried to use it he got two huge nicks in his neck.</li>
            <li> With a normal amount of stubble it was much better.</li>
            <li> I paid $20.95 with free shipping for my first one.</li>
            <li> otherwise he likes it very much!</li>
            <li> My other razors didn&#x27;t shave as close, but were maybe better at catching all the hairs.</li>
            <li> Since there are only 2 foil cutters, this razor works best on short hairs -- maybe one or two days worth of beard/moustache growth.</li>
            <li> But I liked the idea of the electric, so I then began reading reviews of other shavers to consider buying a better one.</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as a blade, but gives a good shave, works well, lasts a long time on a charge, and is well built.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m thankfully done w/ it, and I have found most of my chin pretty smooth after running over it w/ the normal razor head after shaving the beard off.</li>
            <li> It does a good job if you shave every day, but if you miss a day or have some stray long whiskers, it&#x27;s not gonna get them.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you something, this things shaves as good as the more expensive electric shavers and just almost as good as a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is ok but trust me you need to use a manual shaver to get a clean shave!</li>
            <li> so I am satisfied with the performance of this newly attained electronic equipment.</li>
            <li> I despise having these huge eyesores on my countertop, ala Braun&#x27;s self cleaning pods, something that also doesn&#x27;t easily fit anywhere in a normal sized bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I bought the previous model (ES4026) about 5 years ago when I just started shaving and it was a great razor.  </li>
            <li> It works VERY well, cleans so easily, you can use it in the shower, comes with recharger.</li>
            <li> Strong and fast.</li>
            <li> The great thing is that because the shave is much closer than my previous electrics, I can easily shave every 2 days rather than every day.</li>
            <li> She is delighted, turns out to be the exact same shaver she has!</li>
            <li> It comes with everything you need; it&#x27;s easy to use and gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> * Very easy to clean, and because its meant for wet usage, it can be easily rinsed as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This new one holds a charge for more than 10 days worth of shaves for me.</li>
            <li> Great for travel as it&#x27;s pretty small and easy to stowe.  </li>
            <li> Rinsed off my face and took the head off the razor and held it under hot water to clean and ran water over the head and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little electric razor for those who do not have a think beard.</li>
            <li> This is a great little razor.</li>
            <li> It was light, quiet, easy to clean, held a charge for 5 days, and shaved quickly through a weekend&#x27;s worth of beard.</li>
            <li> either way it helps tremendously being that my faciar hair grows pretty quick.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I own.  </li>
            <li> For under $30 its worth a try with alot of shavers for well over $200 you can buy alot of thease to try out.</li>
            <li> But even on smooth expanses, such as my neck and cheeks, the Panasonic missed many  hairs.</li>
            <li> I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to fix</li>
            <li> the shaver proves to be ineffective.</li>
            <li> every time i use it i condemn it and wish i had bought a different kind.</li>
            <li> stick to your old one if it still works, it is definitely better than this one.    </li>
            <li> NOT EVEN WORTH THE REDUCED PRICE.  </li>
            <li> And, no I do not work for Panasonic or Amazon or a dealer, IT IS THAT EXCITING</li>
            <li> The shaver works great - this makes my 3rd or 4th Panasonic shaver and by far the cheapest one I&#x27;ve owned yet.  </li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to review products, but felt compelled to share my thoughts on this shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The shaver shaves close and is quiet, which were my most important considerations.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure the red light goes on when re-charging or it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> I will keep it handy for short trips or for an emergency trim..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old son who just started shaving and only has some peach fuzz, but he said it dosen&#x27;t work that great.  </li>
            <li> Not a very close shave but good for days when no time for a razor.</li>
            <li> But it worth the price I paid for it (35$).</li>
            <li> fast shipping and overall a good deal.</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed very positive so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other panasonic shavers that did work better, BUT cost much-much more.</li>
            <li> It gets points for being usable in the shower, good battery life and having a pretty decent trimmer, but even at that it barely musters a two-star rating.</li>
            <li> It delivered an extremely close shave, which was rather surprising because of my course hair.</li>
            <li> But not as good as other razors</li>
            <li> The charger plugs right into the outlet</li>
            <li> I picked this up right before Christmas on sale.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver right here on Amazon in June 2009.</li>
            <li> While I liked the wet dry capability of the Norelco, they didn&#x27;t do a particularly good job delivering a close shave.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s kind of funny that some of the same companies spending fortunes telling us how \\&quot;green\\&quot; they are have pricing policies for replacement parts that encourage us to throw stuff away and buy new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are usually great at performing their main task (shaving) but if you are not careful, you may be surprised running out of battery before you are done shaving.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a very large space on your bathroom outlet, you will have to find another place to charge the unit.  </li>
            <li> - Dry shave - comfortable and not too many passes needed for \\&quot;close as blades</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, charges quickly, and shaves as well as my old Norelcos and the fancy Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The first day I got it I wanted to test it out right there</li>
            <li> but we are back to using disposable shavers with much more success.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean which is also a big plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively quiet, fits the hand well, cuts close, and is easy to clean.   </li>
            <li> Not because they break, but because at this price, it&#x27;s more economical to replace the entire shaver than it is to buy replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Accustomed to a Norelco, I quickly learned that I had to abandon the rotational method for straight strokes.  </li>
            <li> I found it very easy to make a selection for the item I wanted and was extremely satisfied with the way my purchase was handled, especially in being informed several times of the stage the process was at.</li>
            <li> Other than this aspect, it&#x27;s really quite good.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver for the money to take on trips.  </li>
            <li> The problem is, as I am sure many of you know, it costs nearly as much for just one replacement part as it does to buy a whole new razor, let alone multiple parts.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a new shaver and when it got to my house</li>
            <li> Not only was the deal with Amason easy and quick...</li>
            <li> Compared to many other razors, it was very economical for him to try out.</li>
            <li> The RPM&#x27;s are high on this shaver and enables it to give a nice, close shave without hurting the facial skin.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t one of the high RPM shavers or triple-floating head shavers in the current generation, but it is just as effective.</li>
            <li> The trimmer part is better (overall) but also for getting left over neck hairs (much better than the Brauns trimmer on this job).</li>
            <li> Even if one uses the blade, one will have to run it thru multiple times if the beard is more than a 2 couple days.</li>
            <li> The magic key for a close shave is to shave every day and this shaver delivers that after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this shaver here on Amazon I knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li> Speaking for myself, I think this is a nice extra shaver to have around, but for my beard I want, need, and now own another, beefier model for everyday use (8109s).</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> and I find using it wet does a pretty nice job.</li>
            <li> First</li>
            <li> My first wet/dry shaver, would give it a 5 stars report but the&lt;br</li>
            <li> It offers a smooth shave with no irretation.</li>
            <li> sometimes i am standing there for 10 or more minutes if i want all facial hair gone</li>
            <li> I make sure that I recharge it on the same day of the week.    </li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband for Christmas and the first time he used it</li>
            <li> So, anyone want to buy a gently used shaver?!  </li>
            <li> - I could tell from the first cut that it wasn&#x27;t for me.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Further problems were that the razor could not hold enough charge to do more than 6-7 shaves.</li>
            <li> I had owned a first generation Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> First, it was delivered within the time frame promised.</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver</li>
            <li> It may hurt some people at first, but not me.</li>
            <li> finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this shaver and its well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor ever.</li>
            <li> It works OK if you have smaller hair.</li>
            <li> razor fits nicely in my hand; angle of cutting heads works well; works best with shaving lather, but not necessary day to day.  </li>
            <li> But a rotary shaver is too big to get into many of the areas where I want to shave.  </li>
            <li> Work very well!</li>
            <li> Not the best razor, but the battery holds its charge, gets the job done, and isn&#x27;t too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The one downfall is the charger mount is a direct fit to outlet.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought for my grandson who had just started shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have a Braun battery operated 17 dollar shaver which work ten times better.</li>
            <li> The first electric razor I bought lasted 20 years.</li>
            <li> It has a close shave and accommodates my face pretty well even the first time.</li>
            <li> But, it does not give a close shave no matter how many times I go back and forth over areas.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Ok/ inexpensive ,charges quickly seems to work better wet with soap .I</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES4026NC Men&#x27;s Shaver fits my requirements very well, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> The reviews for this shaver seem to be all over the place - some real high 4-5 stars, and some blistering 1 stars.</li>
            <li> My results with this shaver are much more favorable - very capable of wet AND dry shaving; it&#x27;s going on three weeks on one charger; cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> My results with this shaver are much more favorable - very capable of wet AND dry shaving; it&#x27;s going on three weeks on one charger; cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> First the positive: It is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like about the shaver is the bright yellow trim.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think I like it better than my last shaver, a Braun for which I paid over twice as much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much easier and more efficient to do a quick wet shave with a Gillette Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is cheaper than buying blades for my expensive Norelco, and gives me as good or better shave.    </li>
            <li> I get as good a shave now as I did with my much more expensive Brauns.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve been very please with it&#x27;s performance for what I paid, but now the price has more than doubled.</li>
            <li> The performance depends heavily on how long you wait to shave    ONE day - excellent - compares very favorably with norelco rotary that sells for four times as much.  </li>
            <li> Has nice features and works fine as long as you haven&#x27;t let your whiskers grow too long.</li>
            <li> This product came very adorable, working very well but for less than two months.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the positive - here are the negatives.  </li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry razor that I have had and it does this very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of an 8 week disposable razor than a long term morning friend.</li>
            <li> While there is a noticeable difference in the speed of the razor (mostly noticeable by the decreased volume of the motor), it works great for daily shaving.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets purchasing it and would highly suggest for anyone to purchase this shaver especially if your looking for a good one with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and the exact same shaver is available in a ladies&#x27; version in mauve, a color I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> It is important that you use it regularly though as the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> My skin is also fairly sensitive and can get irritated quickly.</li>
            <li> It works better on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up easily under the shower head, and the battery holds a charge through several shaves.</li>
            <li> Remington could be repaired easily and cheaply back in the day.</li>
            <li> In fact, this unit is one of the more comfortable electrics I have used compared to more expensive Norelco rotary, Braun and older Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> First let me state that the shaver&#x27;s colors are nice, blue &amp; yellow.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Braun 760cc last week to replace my Panasonic and the new Braun 760cc which costs more than $100 doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my $19.99 Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Lastly, due to the light weight and the small size, it is easy to shave around beard growth, that is, if you&#x27;re sculpting you&#x27;re own beard.    </li>
            <li> This razor is much slower and less effective.  </li>
            <li> Trouble free and easy to use.</li>
            <li> * Provides nice smooth shave in both wet and dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found you get the most lubrication and closest shave using a gel such as Edge, but a dry shave is almost as close and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love the wet shaving feature which I find considerably better than dry</li>
            <li> I would say that those who liked it must have just a little peach fuzz or something.  </li>
            <li> The shaver I say needs to be a little bit more powerful</li>
            <li> The Braun was better but wasn&#x27;t a true wet dry model and after a few years using it I started to get many more in grown hairs then normal.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this shaver was wow!!</li>
            <li> it has a neat yellow racing track on the shaver molding which looks nice and the shaver makes a buzzing sound and a little boy would like that- he could believe he was shaving just like Dad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my problem is i dont get clean shave as the reviews state,when i used it some area of my face is clean while other ares still have hair.i</li>
            <li> I finish the shave by using some after shave lotion or gel like Nivea to smooth out my facial skin.</li>
            <li> You do not get the really close shave.  </li>
            <li> It really got the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m letting my son decide if this is something he wants to use or not...</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a reasonably priced unit to try.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother than it ever was with the Norelco or Braun.</li>
            <li> it is a much closer shave.      </li>
            <li> Does more than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> I must note that I have a light beard and shave once daily.   </li>
            <li> and a couple I really want to forget.</li>
            <li> (and i don&#x27;t have that much).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with its (wet) performance.  </li>
            <li> it really does not work (for ME) out of the shower.</li>
            <li> But, using it with my face lathered with soap, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Not a problem, I just got into the habit of plugging it in every Sunday, ready to go Monday.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these because I like them so much.</li>
            <li> and I ended up having to use a straight edge to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to say he really loves this shaver.  </li>
            <li> On one of them the screen broke by falling off the seat, otherwise they are very reliable.    </li>
            <li> This one seems to shave really close for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps the more expensive razor in Panasonic&#x27;s lineup are better at catching long hairs, but I&#x27;m assuming they all use the same general shave head, so aren&#x27;t any better at this.</li>
            <li> They really seem to like them.</li>
            <li> You will wind up with a really close,smooth face and your boss(your wife)</li>
            <li> The replacement costs of the foil nearly as much as the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> Plus, as a bonus, the trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t hold the machine very well).</li>
            <li> I do not like using this product in the shower, it pulls my skin too much.  </li>
            <li> I found it very convenient to just deal with Amazon and not the seller.</li>
            <li> I still give it 5 stars because for the price and relative performance coupled with it being water proof it works fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> Very durable and dependable.</li>
            <li> that two days very well - you need a rotary shaver for that.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about shavers, but his dislike of this shaver was</li>
            <li> This shaver is not efficient, even for light facial hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for a decade and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s holding up very well.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want to spend much money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well, for a $[...] buck shaver, I don&#x27;t think we can expect much.</li>
            <li> Now that I own it, here are a few observations that I hope will be helpful:    </li>
            <li> I spent a few more bucks and just got the Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve, far superior.</li>
            <li> bought this Panasonic ES4026, because my old electric shaver died, and I saw this on SALE.&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I mean, the price is good, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge a long time and easy to use.</li>
            <li> (I had one Panasonic Linear shaver which was on it&#x27;s original blades when it quit after five years of daily use).     </li>
            <li> Had the razor for several years and liked the fact you could use it wet, a first in it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d really like the wet shave in the shower, but I find I&#x27;m more comfortable with a dry shave in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> The ES4026 looks and feels like a shaver better suited for a 17 year old with new facial hair to cut on.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a reliable and very useful hair removal tool; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you need a nice travel shaver, larger and more sturdy than the tiny little travel shavers, and would like to shaver in the shower, this is it.</li>
            <li> If you need a nice travel shaver, larger and more sturdy than the tiny little travel shavers, and would like to shaver in the shower, this is it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is waterproof and ok in the shower, but it still functions better on a stiff dry beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 2012:  </li>
            <li> I love it and have been using it every morning over last 2 years with no single problem, refer it to anyone for this model AAA+++</li>
            <li> At the moment I have not used it while wet, but the functions for dry have proven as good as it said it would be.</li>
            <li> I do have to run the shaver a couple times through spots, but thats usually normal for many other shavers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Now, after 4 months, they barely hold 2 days worth of a charge.    </li>
            <li> The first one is 16 years old</li>
            <li> The whole process would take longer than using a normal non electric shaving blade.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad shaver</li>
            <li> I was a little upset about the product because consumer reports gave it such good reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to every one who needs a new electric razor!</li>
            <li> Less cables the better.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these from Amazon to replaced my older Panasonic ES728 because its battery does not hold charge anymore.</li>
            <li> Even after going over my face numerous times, the razor left many whiskers untouched.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic that cost closer to 100 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I stuck with it and have been using it as my main razor now.</li>
            <li> it looks sporty and contemporary    </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased, till the next generation comes along.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> for what i paid for it, it does the job decently.</li>
            <li> In the past, with an Electric Razor it would take nearly 2x as long, and still not get a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this shaver and its well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I have had several electric razors,Norelco triple heads and a Braun foil one most recently.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver does a decent job and quit burning my skin after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, it holds a decent charge for over a week.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor for a couple of weeks and could not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> The razor is attractive enough and solid, but it just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough to go out in public.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver because of the high rating it got in consumer reports.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the price is so high now</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to every one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> It works fine as a wet shaver in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> Having said that, my latest Braun&#x27;s battery once again, ironically, died out after a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> Might be a little challenging for some.  </li>
            <li> This pricing structure is deliberate so as to assure a steady supply of repeat customers for new product.</li>
            <li> Gives clean, close shave both dry or in the shower.</li>
            <li> The shave is quick and easy both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> if let I my beard grow more than a couple days as it lacks the third blade that my Braun has to catch the long stubbles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra $54 for a circular head razor.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one and get something better.</li>
            <li> All in all, a much better everyday</li>
            <li> All in all, a much better everyday shaver.    </li>
            <li> Not sure how it stacks up to more expensive electrics but for the price they are perfect for teenage boys.</li>
            <li> It only works well for me with one day&#x27;s worth of beard growth.</li>
            <li> I normally use a 5 blade \\&quot;sensor\\&quot; hand held razor</li>
            <li> TWO days - good - may leave a wild hair or two and takes a few extra passes to get close  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor but won&#x27;t last (unless you&#x27;re young enough to think 4 years is a long time).</li>
            <li> I needed a new electric razor and while searching for one in Amazon, I came across the Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver and while the low price made me hesitate, I figured that I had little to lose if I wasn&#x27;t happy.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how close the wet shave was with this electric razor, and also surprised about how little skin irritation I experienced (virtually none).  </li>
            <li> As some wall sockets lay on their side, your shaver may be on its side pointing left or right when it&#x27;s recharging, instead of up as would normally expect.</li>
            <li> (also wet or dry is nice.)</li>
            <li> After a few shaves, I was so pleased, that I ordered another Panasonic ES4026NC for my son, who has a heavier beard than mine, and has never found a dry electric shaver adequate for his beard.</li>
            <li> Also, if the charger doesn&#x27;t fit tightly into you outlet, the whole assembly (shaver and charger) will end-up on the floor.</li>
            <li> Does not work well on fine hair and has to be repeated several times on coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> and even if it only lasts half as long as my last razor it will still be a very good deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Might be a good shaver for beginners with soft beards but not for those who have shaved for years and have tough beards.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not late June and the shaver started making a really loud squeeking sound and the shaving block was moving super slow.</li>
            <li> &quot; a new razor</li>
            <li> It is cheaper to buy a new one then replace the metal screen and blade.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new PanasonicShaver.  </li>
            <li> when it was new.  </li>
            <li> it as soon as i have a new one.</li>
            <li> I got a fancy new shaver for Christmas a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now I am using the Panasonic ES4026NC and waiting for the replacement parts to get here for my new</li>
            <li> Battery runs out after 6 shaves (this was a brand new unit).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a new Panasonic (I&#x27;m sold on the brand)</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know where to get a new battery</li>
            <li> kinda bummed i got a brand new braun instead of 30$ for new blade.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver based on the reviews on Amazon and was greatly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as a standard dry shaver and it kept missing hairs.  </li>
            <li> it  easily folds back in when you use it, so you have to be careful and not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> So I recommend that you use this as a wet shave only with shaving cream and you will love it.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use, and it provides a much closer shave than I possible without using a blade.  </li>
            <li> First off let me state, I have Parkinson&#x27;s and normal blade shaving has taken on An Ancient Chinese Custom of slitting ones throat, ears not to be excluded.</li>
            <li> Please note that the charging stand requires enough space above the outlet to allow the razor to fit.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a capable razor for some men, if your beard is particularly thick, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done two shaves (the first being very long since I had a ton of beard growth) and so far it seems like it has enough juice in it for 1 or 2 more regular 3-5 minute shaves.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is due to the fine beard I have, but my old Norelco never had that problem.</li>
            <li> There are sections that do get a close shave, but the neckline is difficult and I feel like it takes a long time to get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper Panasonic razor that worked much better and have gone back to that one while I await a new, more expensive Norelco.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving my very fine leg hairs with the fully charged shaver and hardly any hairs were shaved.  </li>
            <li> old son likes to use this when he&#x27;s un a hurry before school!  </li>
            <li> For me, not having to shave everyday makes up for any complaint I would have about short battery life or the charger not being the best (since it is a wall cradle rather than a cord).     </li>
            <li> Considering that most shavers already cost upwards of $50, some up to $250 (unbelievable), it&#x27;s, well, quite a scam.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely not one to use for the seasoned face.</li>
            <li> If you are questioning your first venture into electric razors or you are a veteran, this razor shaves closer than a blade.</li>
            <li> After the first three uses it is still no match for a regular razor</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would like, but that may just be typical of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The shaver is very quiet and it tends to cut pretty close.  </li>
            <li> This thing seems pretty solid.  </li>
            <li> the only fault with this razor is it has trouble with longer hairs, and has a short battery life...is good for about 5 shaves and then needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> This particular model is his favorite and hard to get in the stores.</li>
            <li> The design of this shaver is extremely functional with an ideal cutting area that&#x27;s easy to maneuver around your face whether you&#x27;re trimming a beard, shaving around a beard, or just shaving your entire face.  </li>
            <li> It is relatively inexpensive, yet performs much the same as some of the very pricey, very upscale products.  </li>
            <li> Recharge time is 8 hours for a full charge but enough of a partial charge to get one more shave out of it takes much less time.  </li>
            <li> Maybe its meant for more mature whiskers, not sure.</li>
            <li> Extending that by just a minute more cuts it down to 6 days; 2 minutes extra minute 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Including two different Wet Dry Norelco/Philips \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; models and most recently a Braun 5775.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty; charges well; just doesn&#x27;t seem to shave closely and has a problem with longer hairs that are lying flat.  </li>
            <li> The shaving head is a little smaller than my previous razor, but the wet/dry option is great.</li>
            <li> The wet shaving works better than dry shaving if you follow the directions of foaming it with soap or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> OK - for the same price as a replacement blade/foil for my previous shaver, the decision to buy the Panasonic Pro Curve was a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> It is adequate as a back up shaver only, perhaps for your gym bag.</li>
            <li> But it does fit tightly and has not fell out of outlet, had it for a year now,(knock on wood).</li>
            <li> It turned out to be barely usable and time consuming to get even close to a decent shave.      </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and it does a decent job, but I have some really fine hairs on my neck</li>
            <li> I have an average beard- not real heavy or light.</li>
            <li> I am forced to replace my old ES728 because this thing costs less than the replacement foil/cutter and plus more $$ cost to replace the old battery (assuming that it is even available from Panasonic).</li>
            <li> WHILE BATHING,IT HAS LONG BATTERY LIFE,  AND IT IS VERY REASONABLY PRICED.   </li>
            <li> I check it out with Consumer report and found that it had a very high rating even with its low price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d be an expensive paperweight after 3 years when the battery worn out and it is not eco friendly to throw away a perfectly good shaver because the company does not provide typical battery repair service that Norelco would.</li>
            <li> After just two months, though, the cutting capabilities greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li> I priced out replacement blades and screen and was a bit surprised to see the price was about the same as buying the whole unit again.  </li>
            <li> only gripe is that the charger isn&#x27;t very sensibly designed - it mounts the shaver directly into the socket.</li>
            <li> I believe the Braun gives a tiny bit (but not too much) closer shave.    </li>
            <li> Overall I would really have to give this match a tie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and gives me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> (foam-type, not gel) and rinse the shaver frequently.  </li>
            <li> not waste</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that a cord did not come with this unit.  </li>
            <li> It cannot completely remove the hairs in and around the neck.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he seems to like it so far...</li>
            <li> the only thing that he had to say negatively was that the pop out trimmer should have had a better angle on it instead of coming straight out...</li>
            <li> The only real downside I can find is that IT SUCKS if you have any kind of beard (especially w/ coarse hair)</li>
            <li> This product was completely ineffective in shaving my face.</li>
            <li> I paid 3 times as much for a razor that does just about the same.</li>
            <li> So far, no problems.</li>
            <li> I pulled out my old Panasonic and it still worked.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a whole different article.    </li>
            <li> Obviously, it works for some but really doesn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> such, I can&#x27;t really recommend this.  </li>
            <li> It takes about a week for your skin to completely get used to the change from a blade.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of usage, it always left much more stubble than my former Norelco or current Braun models (those aren&#x27;t wet/dry).  </li>
            <li> and WOW am</li>
            <li> If I miss a day, I have to shave with a razor (or my old Remington shaver).</li>
            <li> This razor shaves really close (I use regular Barbasol shaving cream.)</li>
            <li> but i will see how it goes for a whole week and then make a final decision.</li>
            <li> It should show a green light when fully charged but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so that was a BONUS as far as I was concerned...</li>
            <li> Upon Reading the User Instructions, I was surprised to read that it is recommended to use shave foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to redo my neck with my Mach 3 frequently.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that I frequently have whiskers that have been completely missed by the razor.  </li>
            <li> Bought this shaver rather than a replacement shaver head for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I use it wet and it gives me a faster shave than my old electric shaver and afterward my face feels as smooth as it did when I used a blade razor -- only no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> After using this one, I realize the blade on my old one dulled out a bit.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and keep it short</li>
            <li> My 5 year old Reminton gives a far closer shave.</li>
            <li> Got it for the 16 year old son and he loves it,</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard any complains so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m showing my age, but my old beat up</li>
            <li> but I could see how a more expensive shaver might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not shave my beard (which is not a tough beard)</li>
            <li> This was evident shaving either dry or with lather</li>
            <li> The trimmer side will usually pick up those whiskers but not always easily either.</li>
            <li> When hairs are longer and tend to not get in the tiny holes of the foil as easily, this razor lacks a trimming type of cutter between the foils which I had on a previous Panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to touch up with a blade, and every few days I have to use a blade to get everything really clean.    </li>
            <li> I mainly use it for touch ups after a regular blade shave.</li>
            <li> This was my first Panasonic shaver and I&#x27;m definitely sold on them for the future.</li>
            <li> Small manufacturing gripe - the foil release buttons on the side can get stuck if you push them in too far, keeping the foil from reattaching securely.</li>
            <li> Decent charge time and battery usage (about the same as a Norelco rotary shaver).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This shaver rated high on Consumer Reports for performing well and its low cost.</li>
            <li> Overall:    I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it is a smooth shave dry, have not tried wet.</li>
            <li> It was a nice little shaver, but not cut out for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It was a nice little shaver, but not cut out for everyday use.</li>
            <li> But my Norelco finally died and I did not want to spend over $100 for a new one.  </li>
            <li> But the new shaver you have to use cleaning fluid</li>
            <li> The batteries are about shot in this Panasonic and it could definitely use new blades.</li>
            <li> decided to buy another one instead of purchasing replacement blades, for it was just about the same price as of the new razor.  </li>
            <li> But I soon discovered it loses a lot of its effectiveness very quick.</li>
            <li> One thing I will add is that it is MUCH better as a wet dry shaver with shaving foam in the shower than a dry shave.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it dry and had an even more difficult time using it wet.  </li>
            <li> It would charge erratically, not getting a full charge even overnight, barely charging enough for a single day&#x27;s shave, until finally</li>
            <li> However the good old blade made it look very bad and besides that it was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> The ES4026 gives as good a shave as the ES8077, and the price is AT LEAST $70 LESS!  </li>
            <li> At this moment I have major skin burns and cuts on my chin.</li>
            <li> The only difference here is that wet shaving will go quicker if you do it right, but it will still sting as always.  </li>
            <li> I have a very light beard and the shaver leaves a lot behind.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, I personally really like the small compact recharger on this shaver.  </li>
            <li> If I try too hard to get those areas as baby smooth as the rest of my face, I do get some razor burn.</li>
            <li> If it does come back I highly recommend this to beard and mustache owners as a second shaver for the close areas.  </li>
            <li> I used it mainly as a wet/semi-wet shaver and it is easy to clean with just water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d not buy any expensive Panasonic shavers like the linear, vortex or arc lines because they do not offer battery replacement and they tend to lose charge in a few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, holds a long charge and gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> As I travel constantly on business, I have nearly worn out one of these units (5 years usage,)</li>
            <li> There is no recharging cord,  only a plug adapter that fits directly in your wall socket.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Norelco three head electric razor that was over ten years old.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I had to compare this to was a 20 year old electric...</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my 94 year old Father who has recently had a stroke.</li>
            <li> The only use I would recommend it for, is as a play toy shaver for your 5 year old son -</li>
            <li> - I just have to manipulate the release button to pop it back out - but it does keep the shaver from working correctly until it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li> I never spent a penny on replacement parts for</li>
            <li> Barely cut my hair.</li>
            <li> It misses hairs and takes twice the time to shave as my old one taking the Linear out of their line was a big mistake...</li>
            <li> The only thing that baffles me is why the red light for charging, doesn&#x27;t turn green when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Now after using for about a month, I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I give it an extra star above the average for (what seems so far like) completely safe wet shaving for that low price.</li>
            <li> but it cannot be ny worse than this one) for sure.  </li>
            <li> If you wait longer than a day to shave, it doesn&#x27;t work well at all and leaves a lot of hairs behind no matter how many times you go over them.</li>
            <li> I just did a dry shave for the first time (since I was running late this morning and didn&#x27;t have time to use it in the shower) and the shave is much more like a typical electric razor (</li>
            <li> I truly get just as close as a blade, with just a few passes, except in some areas under my jaw and right on the jaw line.</li>
            <li> Not much to say on the positive side to balance this out since it simply does not work.</li>
            <li> My beard is coarse and wiry, with medium thickness and with 2 days growth this unit gave a comfortable if not super close shave (I use it dry).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never created a review for any previous Amazon purchase; this is my first.    </li>
            <li> I also never had trouble with the battery, even when weak after not charging gave a good shave.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t really recommend one over the other.</li>
            <li> so that is a bit odd but even with that option there is still significant post razor burn even when using it wet.</li>
            <li> Boy, he was surprised that it shaved like a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> My last electric was one of the expensive Panasonic Linear razors and while I really liked that razor</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see or feel a big difference between the Panasonic&#x27;s double head vs the Braun single head.    </li>
            <li> As beard hairs get longer and less stubbly, they sometimes have difficulty entering the foil to be cut, and then its necessary to use the trimmer first to shorten the hairs in question.  </li>
            <li> Takes 3 times as long to shave compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li> Being in my early 60&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been shaving a long time.</li>
            <li> Since I always need to trim my sideburns and beard, this product really lets me down on this.</li>
            <li> However, the battery dies down without much notice.</li>
            <li> first, it didn&#x27;t cut any hairs at all, so he tried to push it a little firmer on his skin and it totally tore into his skin.</li>
            <li> I get a terrific shave in the shower with a little shampoo smeared on my face first.</li>
            <li> The blades tends to go dull quickly.  </li>
            <li> For people with thin/regular beards or more moderate growth who shave every single day (twice?), the Pro Curve would probably do a serviceable job, but it&#x27;s not a good match for me.</li>
            <li> but I live at a military academy</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, I was originally going to give it 3 stars, but knocked it down 1 for dying on me less than a year after purchase.</li>
            <li> So, I was originally going to give it 3 stars, but knocked it down 1 for dying on me less than a year after purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter and has much less vibration than the Braun.</li>
            <li> The flip up feature is too small to do any amount of long whisker shaving and the main doesn&#x27;t do the job very well on longer growth.</li>
            <li> especially the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> Stay away from this model and consider something a little more expensive, it is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> It has done an admiral job, although I found that I get a much closer shave using it dry vs. wet.</li>
            <li> It shaves as close as the old Panasonic, but the double heads cause me to miss single whiskers.  </li>
            <li> It performs well wet or dry and holds a charge much the same as my Norelco did.  </li>
            <li> Not long hairs but a lot of tiny short hairs that won&#x27;t cut no matter</li>
            <li> I use this electric shaver after i use schick or gillette blades which seem to have trouble with certain areas of my face especially around my lips.  </li>
            <li> The advantages were several: 1) Warm and dry using the electric shaver, no rude cold water splash in the morning 2) regular blades last for a long, long time when used for touch up 3)</li>
            <li> The only issue I have (a minor one) is that the pop up trimmer is not very wide.</li>
            <li> It is very basic compared to my old Braun (no pivoting head, can&#x27;t use it while plugged in) but other than that it shaves just as well.  </li>
            <li> The other models I have owned had wider trimmers -- useful for shaving under the jaw bone and lower on the neck where the hair may not stick up stiffly for the regular blades.    </li>
            <li> it has just started to get weak on a full charge</li>
            <li> Easy to clean,my only complaint is thar it tends to leave a few of the longer whiskers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted quite a long time and maintained solid performance overall.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li> It gives a decently close shave with just a few passes.</li>
            <li> I found this unit to be a little large and as such harder to manuver.  </li>
            <li> I have had only Braun shavers for the past 15 or so years and finally dropped my last one on the concrete floor in the garage.  </li>
            <li> Whereas my previous Noreclo and Braun shavers sometimes developed a hole in their foils after awhile, I have never had similar issues with these shavers.  </li>
            <li> If other shavers of this general design aggravate your face, this won&#x27;t be any different.</li>
            <li> Had to go over it several times and had to use the trimmer to get some of the long hairs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> 6 days I used it dry with a little pre-shave lotion and it was pretty hard to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> Have bought two of them so far and plan to buy another for use down the road.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick and quick growth.  </li>
            <li> The ES4026 is so reasonbly priced that when the blades go dull in about 12-18 months, I&#x27;ll just buy a new shaver rather than pay the roughly $40 for a new foil and blades</li>
            <li> Hard to complain too much as I paid only $30,</li>
            <li> I had roughly 4 days worth of growth and the shaver had a really hard time with it.</li>
            <li> Shaving dry, it always left stray whiskers standing that I had to cut with the side</li>
            <li> Just put enought on your face to barely cover it and don&#x27;t over due it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the more expensive Panasonic wet &amp; dry shavers...for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t think other expensive brand works better than this....</li>
            <li> I am surprised how little this shaver costs.</li>
            <li> Since it was about time to replace the foil and cutting block on my Braun which would&#x27;ve cost me more money, I decided to try this shaver out instead.    </li>
            <li> But think about it, as an example, if this shaver held enough to do 7 3-5 minute shaves, for an average of 4 minutes, a total of 28 minutes of shaving time per charge cycle.</li>
            <li> I never tried the shaver wet because to me you might as well use a traditional blade razor.  </li>
            <li> This model takes a  long time to recharge.    </li>
            <li> I would also caution you to not go too long between shaves, otherwise it will hurt.  </li>
            <li> It misses hair that is even the slightest bit long.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the side panel help you on your long beard.</li>
            <li> I use the sideburn trimmer to rake across my face and neck to cut those long hairs.     </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after experiencing a cardiac \\&quot;event\\&quot; and it was recommended to move to an electric.  </li>
            <li> When I called the service center I was instructed to send it to Texas to subsequently receive a reconditioned model.</li>
            <li> Inadequate performance for long bear growth or course beard hair.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that this Benfini shaver appears to be the Panasonic ES4026NC with some minor cosmetic changes.</li>
            <li> It takes twice as long as my $19 Remington XT100</li>
            <li> My Remington rotary shavers are a few years old</li>
            <li> This is my second one; the first one worked for at least 3 years with no problems until the battery stopped recharging (which is typical).  </li>
            <li> I just shaved with it a little while ago and it took me 20 minutes, most of the battery life, mind you, and I still have stray hairs all over which I need to get with a regular razor, or play that little game where I find and then pluck them out.    </li>
            <li> It actually takes me less time to shave with this Panasonic ES4026 than with a regular razor and shave cream.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet unlike my other razor that you probably should wear hearing protection to use.</li>
            <li> it works with other hair types, but definately not coarse hair.</li>
            <li> After a few days I will see various long hairs in different places on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This shaver has quiet operation, blade is sharp.</li>
            <li> Other more expensive shavers have had the 3rd row of cutting blades that work on the longer whiskers - this one only has two rows and if you&#x27;ve got more than a day&#x27;s growth, it has a hard time capturing the stubble.  </li>
            <li> You can use it as a dry shaver</li>
            <li> I tried the shaver dry</li>
            <li> If your plan is to shave dry, you might as well get another brand of shaver.      </li>
            <li> I tried it dry</li>
            <li> I shave dry, without gels, shaving cream etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried gel, cream, and dry.  </li>
            <li> I shave dry and the battery needs recharging once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly dry</li>
            <li> I used a blade razor for years and switched to an  electric dry shaver about 15 years ago because my face just couldn&#x27;t take the burning and abrasion of the razor blade, sometimes having to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it dry, with some \\&quot;pre-shave&#x27;, and with shave gel.</li>
            <li> but i disliked its performace and order a different one later on</li>
            <li> I have had the 4025 for a few years now, which is the same unit before it went with the yellow.  </li>
            <li> only complaint was the missed ocassional kooky neck hair (used trimmer) and now know why the shave would take a while 4 yr old blade.</li>
            <li> The charger base is about the size of a wall adapter, plugs directly into the outlet, and the shaver sits directly on top of the charger, so</li>
            <li> This shaves partially not removing all the hairs and results with little scratchs on the face.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty tough beard and if I let it grow a couple of days</li>
            <li> Had to go back and do the neckline using my conventional rajor.</li>
            <li> My father has a single blade Panasonic that worked</li>
            <li> I say slowly mainly due to the fact that the trimmer was so weak it couldn&#x27;t really cut through my beards coarse</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS NO BETTER THAN MY OLD REMINGTON.  </li>
            <li> the first one i bought about 5 years ago and recently broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Except for a few little &#x27;red patches&#x27; the first few days-- which is totally normal, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be Beat, would say especially for the price, but seriously - CANNOT BE BEAT!</li>
            <li> I have tried it both wet and dry, and I prefer dry.</li>
            <li> It made cutting/grinding noises, but needed multiple passes, where I had to push down to get it to shave.  </li>
            <li> that I finally decided, yeah, put some thoughts down from someone who has had it, and is moving on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for the price (around $30 at the time of purchase) it&#x27;s almost impossible to find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker, just a bit odd and different.  </li>
            <li> It is rechargeable and it works wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it wet and tried it dry but must confess I haven&#x27;t shaved with it for 20 consecutive days using soap as recommended by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I like that it can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> Wet Dry capability along with the closest shave to a blade I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric</li>
            <li> It was far too harsh for dry shaving, and was incapable of handling a slightly over 1 days growth.</li>
            <li> It was far too harsh for dry shaving, and was incapable of handling a slightly over 1 days growth.</li>
            <li> The unit is rated for wet or dry use, but beware.  </li>
            <li> I shave dry, don&#x27;t know how it works as a wet shaver.    </li>
            <li> Last time he only got a small nick.</li>
            <li> I came across this Panasonic ES4026NC Wet Dry Shaver on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a wet and dry shaver.</li>
            <li> He wanted something for a wet and dry shave.</li>
            <li> Razor works well in wet and dry situations.</li>
            <li> Our other ones have long sinced died.</li>
            <li> Since I tend to go unshaven for a few days, this can leave me in the lurch when I go to shave and the only indication that the battery is low is when I put the razor to my face and the motor bogs down.  </li>
            <li> Also if you are used to any kind of rotary, you will probably find this very awkward to handle by comparison.</li>
            <li> Neck and chin a little extra work needed.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as close as the blade, it just took a little extra work.</li>
            <li> So I could really only do a little bit at a time and then had to recover from the discomfort/pain.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda tough for this razor (or any electric) to give me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> and then also wet.  </li>
            <li> They gave me a mailing address for their authorized repair center, Turnpike Appliances.  </li>
            <li> This center is just about 2 miles from my house.  </li>
            <li> It can be used when wet</li>
            <li> For some reason it bothers him when his whiskers get to rough.</li>
            <li> Then I wet the razor head</li>
            <li> I tried it as a wet shaver</li>
            <li> and I tried it wet.</li>
            <li> After a week of use I have nothing but praise to say, In fact I am ordering another to put on the shelf when the foil iand blade are ruined do to my heavy facial hair.</li>
            <li> i only shave every few days and this thing just can&#x27;t handle stubble.</li>
            <li> i will destroy(!)</li>
            <li> Only used a few times, but it seems to shave well.  </li>
            <li> Have not used it &#x27;wet&#x27; though.</li>
            <li> the shave is quite rough</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well as a wet shaver; the foil screen becomes clogged with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> and it works well with a blade while your face is wet and covered with foam/gel and the battery</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver doesn&#x27;t perform as expected.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Even then, the shave is not very close.</li>
            <li> The initial charge takes a few hours.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the charger design.e shaver battery is dead.      </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet yet.</li>
            <li> This means a lot of time wasted on running the razor over the same spot repeatedly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trouble if that&#x27;s in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li> Again, I hate shaving, and quite frankly I look better with a couple days of growth, so I only shave once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse facial hair and this shaver</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get a decent cut with this machine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its my hair or the machine is not strong enough but this does not work for me.</li>
            <li> It is not worth a single star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> so it is not very useful if you travel overseas.  </li>
            <li> At first I was scared to put the shaver under running water, but so far, nothing bad.  </li>
            <li> For these reasons, I can not give it five stars, but it comes close (less close if used as a dry shaver).</li>
            <li> The double head at least for me makes getting at the mustache area somewhat awkward and requires a little more attention.</li>
            <li> The electric motor sounds run down after only a few shaves</li>
            <li> I have to use a Remington razor made for tough stuff normally</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and I find it easier to use the trimmer than other electrics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that the screen holes are very small, only fractionally larger than my (admittedly thick) facial hair.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 2 weeks and have only charged it breifly after receiving it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other electric razors who&#x27;s power cables always seem to die before the shaver does, this one comes with a wall charger.  </li>
            <li> Most disappointed given the Panasonic name &amp; history, product was returned for refund--hoping no glitches on that with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Having to replace this shaver twice a year wipes out any cost advantage it may have over other models.</li>
            <li> Other shavers do   not shave as close around my chin and jaw bone structure.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day and use a razor every other day.</li>
            <li> I have hadmainly due to poorness with 2-3 day beards.</li>
            <li> I usually use the trimmer to get the big hairs and the buzzer to get close.  </li>
            <li> I use it about every other day and charge it once every 3 or 4 days for an hour.</li>
            <li> Why they didn&#x27;t just use a cord like every other shaver out there, we&#x27;ll never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a tired Panasonic wet/dry razor that needed a new foil and cutter blades.  </li>
            <li> Using it exclusively in dry mode means that you&#x27;re missing the intent of the Panasonic shaver line.</li>
            <li> If your the type of person who shaves everyday this razor does its job if your like me and only shave a few times a week</li>
            <li> The heads do not float which I think also makes it a little harder to use.    </li>
            <li> I used it in the shower as instructed, shaving half my face with the panasonic and tho other with a 4 blade razor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but getting a clean shave with any electronic shaver is impossible and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> It took about 15 minutes to shave my face and it still left behind long whiskers and missed patches.  </li>
            <li> My only negative...</li>
            <li> the negative is that it simply doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave.  </li>
            <li> this shaver is not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this as i thought it would be quite convenient to have an electric razor to speed up the whole tedious process of shaving.</li>
            <li> The shave was well below average for closeness and comfort.  </li>
            <li> The charger plugs directly into the outlet and the shaver must sit on top of the base in order to charge - poor</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT ready for everyday</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT ready for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I thought I would love the plug-in charging base as it saves counter space.</li>
            <li> hair w/ out a million short passes, and also because it pulled at at least half the hairs it did catch/cut.</li>
            <li> Also, the batteries are just NiCads (to keep the cost down).  </li>
            <li> and they just seem to lay down.    </li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered 2 at the $20 and pennies price to have a backup when the heads wear down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll climb down off my soapbox now.</li>
            <li> Buy some other razor !  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is an issue with this particular product or with electric shavers in general, but it does a bad job if you have slightly longer hair.</li>
            <li> The charging time is supposedly 8 hours vs the less than 30 minutes for the Braun.</li>
            <li> Cost less $ than Braun.  </li>
            <li> B000VKV28S Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> B000VKV28S Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> My previous Panasonic shaver I have used for 10 years.</li>
            <li> I was used to with my previous razor.</li>
            <li> The shaving quality can not compete with my previous Braun shaver unless you use some shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver a year and a half ago and paid $29.</li>
            <li> It stays in its charging station until you need it, so there are no wires to mess with.</li>
            <li> It does well with flat areas i.e., moustache, chin, and cheeks, but fails around the neck (my co-workers thought I was going for a European look).</li>
            <li> It gets into the tight spots</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, after having it less than a year, the shaver will not charge and I have to throw it away at an electronic waste</li>
            <li> this shaver doesn&#x27;t shave and you have to shave it for 8 hours to sue it a little.</li>
            <li> you have to keep scratching it against your skin to shave a little.  </li>
            <li> hour charge is a little bothersome.</li>
            <li> i just shaved and thought it&#x27;s time to write a one star review for this little piece of *</li>
            <li> I got this neat little razor from my mother in law for Xmas.</li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts a little over a week or so for me</li>
            <li> I tried using my dual blade Remington and Braun shavers but end up wacking something that didn&#x27;t need trimming and regretting not using this little beauty to do the job.</li>
            <li> Just a dab will do and wet the blades before shaving and let me tell you, for this price, it ROCKS!!!</li>
            <li> For reference I need to shave everyday (regardless of the shaver).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t waste postage on sending this to them and that they were nearby.</li>
            <li> Wasted Money getting this unit.</li>
            <li> Heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> It does patchy work and is not smooth.</li>
            <li> However, this shaver forces you to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a man of few words</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It does have trouble with longer neck hairs</li>
            <li> Get a heavy duty one if you want to shave once a week.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of having a beard when I bought this razor and just spent 20-30 min+ slowly shaving it off w/ this thing.    </li>
            <li> am not happy and the only reason i dont return it is because of the distance i am.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the biggest waste of time</li>
            <li> I have to go over my neck area several times, often irritating or nicking the skin.</li>
            <li> But if you want to play heavy duty, you may search for triple heads products.</li>
            <li> They can shave everyday if they want and dont have to worry about razors and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The way I see it, when I have to go over my face with a regular razor after I&#x27;ve used an electric razor, the razor become unnecessary.</li>
            <li> No cord for shaving when the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> Might as well donate your money to a charity as waste it buying this razor.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cut your beard.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really any worse than other shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with this useless wet dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I do NOT want to have to go through that again, and if I grow a beard again at any point while I have this, I would really rather use a disposable or even a pair of garden shears as the easier and less painful option to this.</li>
            <li> If I waited even a few hours past 24, then blades could not handle the longer whiskers.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this quality of shave holds up as the blades dull a little bit.</li>
            <li> but it has been used A LOT over the past two years</li>
            <li> Since my father is not able to shave the responsibility falls to me or my brother.  </li>
            <li> I also attempted to shave wet as the manufacturer recommended, but this was even worse.  </li>
            <li> This is my fifth Panasonic wet/dry shaver in the past 22 years.  </li>
            <li> Also, I recommend using this shaver in wet mode with a THIN layer of shave cream</li>
            <li> I wet my face and then put a thin layer of Barbasol Shaving cream over my face.</li>
            <li> I  am not sure if it was my type of beard or what, but it didnt shave anything.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how come</li>
            <li> failed to order in the replacement foil/blades in and the foil has big holes in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just too much internal gap between the blades and the foil to get even a vaguely close shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look no more this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have had an electric shaver in the past-</li>
            <li> usually use one</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do my neck at all and only does the chin mediocre.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ve returned the razor &amp; am back to my $5 disposable!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it can be charged on 220-volt outlet.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a Benfini Salons shaver this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> I decided to replace it with this razor as opposed to a more expensive model after reading the reviews and I will say that I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works well in the shower, small, lightweight, convenient.</li>
            <li> (so do I on occasion when I get lazy).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not pleased with the charging style.</li>
            <li> When the battery runs down I put it in the charger base when I leave for work and its ready when I get home</li>
            <li> thought, at first that was annoying, but ive gotten use to it.</li>
            <li> The timmer gets clogged easily and the battery life is miserable, unless it&#x27;s just me not knowing how to probably charge machinery...</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> This Shaver sucks.</li>
            <li> The instructions say give the razor at least one month for your beard to adjust.  </li>
            <li> Seems to hold its charge for at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair growth and</li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t let the stubble get thick.</li>
            <li> I am no mountain man with a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> He complains that its slow to shave with and hurts.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who has a thick beard, and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> The foil is thick</li>
            <li> This razor is slow.  </li>
            <li> No matter what I tried those small hairs just won&#x27;t get cut!    </li>
            <li> I mean, you feel it vibrate, so you know it&#x27;s working,</li>
            <li> I broke it while on vacation due to careless packing.</li>
            <li> Wait for Black Friday or Christmas!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.    </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the 2 blade system versus three but took the plunge anyhow.  </li>
            <li> He used a while and complained that it did a poor job.  </li>
            <li> Not good even for every day shave.</li>
            <li> Even after just a few days of growth, I found it unable to shave my beard sufficiently.</li>
            <li> The only disappointing part is that it can not be used corded; once no battery charge, you are stuck!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how disappointed and annoyed I&#x27;ve been with the shavers on the market and the companies making them.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is the worst foil shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, I can&#x27;t get a close shave using it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The shave head works poorly, but really, the worst part of this product is the trimmer.</li>
            <li> but the cut ... is really really poor.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it with shaving cream but still got poor results.  </li>
            <li> This item is not great.</li>
            <li> If I miss a day of shaving, then the problem is worse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a terrible scam, really.  </li>
            <li> This razor is the worse one I have ever owned, (ES4026 Panasonic).  </li>
            <li> I would rather not think of how poorly this would work if I had curly hair.</li>
            <li> i should have listened to the other bad reviews</li>
            <li> but this is getting ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> It is not marked on the charging base.</li>
            <li> Have to work real hard to get a shave at all.</li>
            <li> this is by far the worst shaver i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Terrible customer service and rude man at repair center.  </li>
            <li> I bought it in may 2010 and since i have recieve it i only used it twice because i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried it twice already Dry and Wet(with Shaving Gel), and both shaves have been very painful.</li>
            <li> Sorry that I chose this one...</li>
            <li> My husband just wanted a shaver, nothing expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was on sale for $20 and was not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> It sticks out at a 90 degree angle which makes it difficult for me to position the shaver to use it.</li>
            <li> My beard, unfortunately, is like iron.</li>
            <li> It shaves well (if not perfectly), and can be cleaned with water.</li>
            <li> I bought one and after a year or two it failed after water got into case</li>
            <li> the side-shaver is useless because of the way it is designed.</li>
            <li> I will sadly put the Panasonic ES4026NC.  </li>
            <li> take it in for expensive service.  </li>
            <li> Another pile of crap I have wasted money on.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver because of its price.</li>
            <li> Get it - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the tearing or cutting that some reviewers describe.</li>
            <li> THREE days - USELESS - you might as well go rub your face on the driveway until your beard wears off.</li>
            <li> Someone decided be weird and steal it from work, so I bought this one a couple of months ago.  </li>
            <li> Within months of purchasing, the charging dock failed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that the quality wouldn&#x27;t be there</li>
            <li> It shaves as well as the expensive one.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for an uncomfortable and stubbly shave, this is the product.  </li>
            <li> and that thet dont have replacement foil/blades (wrong on both)</li>
            <li> I would not recommend unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and so the shaver misses hairs and also cuts very poorly.</li>
            <li> And it is very poor at picking up the whiskers that grow at angle close to your face.  </li>
            <li> Instead of being an adapter type with a cord the Panasonic charger is a small base.  </li>
            <li> It does do that, but it it awkward to place and remove the shaver -- requires 2 hands.  </li>
            <li> Much to my disappointment, the razor did not do the job AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Cons: misses longer hairs, pop-up trimmer is uncomfortable, awkward charging base.</li>
            <li> and I was very uncomfortable until I stopped using the razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a wall receptacle type of charger (no cord)making it impossible to shave with a cord.</li>
            <li> Not a successful gift and the teenager was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how bad it is.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that the seller was bad because I didn&#x27;t even attempt to return it and give them a chance to fix but point of story....</li>
            <li> This is used as a travel razor, it isn&#x27;t bad, but it is louder than the Braun my husband uses at home.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t use soap on my face as a lubricant, it was borderline painful to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked how close it shaved that I went out and bought one.  </li>
            <li> A very disappointing buy.</li>
            <li> He spoke to me as though I was a blithering idiot.  </li>
            <li> Rather have a cord charge than a mounting base charger.  </li>
            <li> it is sooo annoying.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> I received this shaver for my birthday, and I really hate it.</li>
            <li> The cutting power is pathetic, I didnt think that is was fully charged the 1st time using.</li>
            <li> The shaver sits in the base, with the base plugged into a wall outlet.  </li>
            <li> The shaver cannot be used while it is charging since its sitting in the base against a wall outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric shaver, and hate the rotary head style.</li>
            <li> Now the bad: This thing leaves hair all over my face!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> , I was very disappointed in this shaver&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed user</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> The worst shaver I have ever used,</li>
            <li> Horrible Shave.</li>
            <li> , this is the worst shave I have had.</li>
            <li> This is the worst electric razor I ever bought.  </li>
            <li> This is without question the worst shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> IT GIVES A TERRIBLE SHAVE.  </li>
            <li> BUT the charging system is the WORST I&#x27;ve ever seen...</li>
            <li> This was the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This review mainly goes with the subject. This shaver vs [[ASIN:B0009IK198 Braun Free Control 1775 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]. For reference I need to shave everyday (regardless of the shaver). My beard hair for coarseness is on the medium/light side.    I&#x27;ll start with the Panasonic&#x27;s advantages. It&#x27;s much quieter and has much less vibration than the Braun. It appears to shave somewhat better on my neck area than the Braun, but still is not perfect. The trimmer part is better (overall) but also for getting left over neck hairs (much better than the Brauns trimmer on this job). The battery life seems about the same. I can&#x27;t really see or feel a big difference between the Panasonic&#x27;s double head vs the Braun single head.    Now for the disadvantages vs the Braun. The double head at least for me makes getting at the mustache area somewhat awkward and requires a little more attention. The charging time is supposedly 8 hours vs the less than 30 minutes for the Braun. You can&#x27;t charge the Panasonic while shaving. I believe the Braun gives a tiny bit (but not too much) closer shave.    Overall I would really have to give this match a tie. The disadvantages/advantages of each sum out to the same so I couldn&#x27;t really recommend one over the other. I did however pick up the Panasonic for $30 shipped which gives it a price advantage.</li>
            <li> this shaver doesn&#x27;t shave and you have to shave it for 8 hours to sue it a little. every two days you have to change the blade. you have to keep scratching it against your skin to shave a little.  DONT BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about three weeks now.  I realize that it takes some time to \\&quot;train\\&quot; a new razor but this is getting ridiculous!  Sorry that I chose this one...</li>
            <li> This razor exceeded my expectations. It is very quiet unlike my other razor that you probably should wear hearing protection to use. The shave is quick and easy both wet and dry. I have a light beard which is electric razor friendly.    Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from Amazon to replaced my older Panasonic ES728 because its battery does not hold charge anymore. I am surprised how little this shaver costs. It works fine as a wet shaver in and out of the shower and it&#x27;s quiet because of the counter directional blades. You can shave it with shaving cream and just wash it under the faucet. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than my ES728 and it takes 8 hrs. to charge vs. 1 hr. My ES728 is also induction charged so no external power terminals to get rusted out. You can use it as a dry shaver but I find my Braun 5416 works a lot better. I finish the shave by using some after shave lotion or gel like Nivea to smooth out my facial skin. It also does not work well if let I my beard grow more than a couple days as it lacks the third blade that my Braun has to catch the long stubbles. I think that people has a fault expectation that any foil shaver will work as well if they let their beards grow more than 1-2 days. Even if one uses the blade, one will have to run it thru multiple times if the beard is more than a 2 couple days. The magic key for a close shave is to shave every day and this shaver delivers that after 2-3 weeks. I used it mainly as a wet/semi-wet shaver and it is easy to clean with just water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d not buy any expensive Panasonic shavers like the linear, vortex or arc lines because they do not offer battery replacement and they tend to lose charge in a few years. They&#x27;d be an expensive paperweight after 3 years when the battery worn out and it is not eco friendly to throw away a perfectly good shaver because the company does not provide typical battery repair service that Norelco would. I am forced to replace my old ES728 because this thing costs less than the replacement foil/cutter and plus more $$ cost to replace the old battery (assuming that it is even available from Panasonic).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic ES4026NC Men&#x27;s Shaver for a Christmas gift.  The guy who received it said that it is a great razor.  He is very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> My husband just wanted a shaver, nothing expensive so I ordered this one because it looked so nice. Boy, he was surprised that it shaved like a more expensive one. It works VERY well, cleans so easily, you can use it in the shower, comes with recharger. Great product and the price is exceptional.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of this shaver. I have tried it both wet and dry, and I prefer dry. It works better for me. What I like the most is how easy it is to clean and the fact that it&#x27;s water-proof. Very good ergonomics. Overall, good value for money, as one would expect from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I own.  The shaver is decent and a great buy for the money.  Great for travel as it&#x27;s pretty small and easy to stowe.  Wet/dry option is nice as well.</li>
            <li> As I travel constantly on business, I have nearly worn out one of these units (5 years usage,) so I ordered another as backup. Excellent shaver. Gives clean, close shave both dry or in the shower. Top notch!</li>
            <li> Fanatastic electric Razor. Strong and fast. Recommend for everybody. Work fine with me and compare to my Braun, it is cleaner and better and first of all. Cheaper.</li>
            <li> Got the product in a timely manner, but it does not perform well.  No close shaves!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok/ inexpensive ,charges quickly seems to work better wet with soap .I found it will not cut softer hair, ok on a corse beard.For under $30 its worth a try with alot of shavers for well over $200 you can buy alot of thease to try out.</li>
            <li> The worst shaver I have ever used, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I bought this when it was on sale for $20 and was not impressed at all.  The shaver misses a lot of hairs and does not cut close at all.  I read that it takes some time to get used to the shaver but after over a month no change.  I never tried the shaver wet because to me you might as well use a traditional blade razor.  Stay away from this model and consider something a little more expensive, it is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver for those days when I don&#x27;t use my regular razor (Mach 3).  It works well for shaving quickly without the water and shave gel.  I tried another economical electric razor but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied as I am with this one.  This is my second Panasonic shaver over the years and find their product reliable and well made for the price.</li>
            <li> Got it for a teenager thinking it would work will with a fare amount of facial hair.  Does not work well on fine hair and has to be repeated several times on coarse hair.  Not a successful gift and the teenager was very disappointed.  It is now in the back of the bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> do not buy this unless u like throwing away money.  i should have listened to the other bad reviews</li>
            <li> First let me state that the shaver&#x27;s colors are nice, blue &amp; yellow.  That&#x27;s the positive - here are the negatives.  Unless you have a very large space on your bathroom outlet, you will have to find another place to charge the unit.  The charger plugs directly into the outlet and the shaver must sit on top of the base in order to charge - poor design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the shaving.  I tried shaving my very fine leg hairs with the fully charged shaver and hardly any hairs were shaved.  I am a woman and the exact same shaver is available in a ladies&#x27; version in mauve, a color I didn&#x27;t like. I tried the shaver dry and then also wet.  Neither option produced anything resembling a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a shaver to shave hair and not just pretend to do so, try another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I called Panasonic thinking that perhaps my unit was defective. They gave me a mailing address for their authorized repair center, Turnpike Appliances.  This center is just about 2 miles from my house.  Drove there.  They checked it out and said it works just fine but isn&#x27;t meant to be used on women&#x27;s legs.  Women&#x27;s hair is not the same a men&#x27;s hair.  I found this a ludicrous explanation.  I am stuck with this useless wet dry shaver.  Do not buy this shaver.  I cannot understand the glowing reviews submitted by some folks -- that was why I though my unit was defective.  Terrible customer service and rude man at repair center.  He spoke to me as though I was a blithering idiot.  Grateful I didn&#x27;t waste postage on sending this to them and that they were nearby.</li>
            <li> The blades tends to go dull quickly.  You do not get the really close shave.  The battery tends to lose its charge quickly.  It is cheaper to buy a new one then replace the metal screen and blade.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for Dad.  He used a while and complained that it did a poor job.  i returned it to the company.</li>
            <li> This product came very adorable, working very well but for less than two months. It just stopped working and I couldn&#x27;t understand why.</li>
            <li> Unit Die after 2nd charge -Battery Die - I researched and it show that this model battery has reach it end life. Wasted Money getting this unit.</li>
            <li> Does pretty good for me.  Heavy beard.  Charge duration good.  Fairly close and smooth shave when blade not needed.  Fairly quite.  Shape and feel good.  Motor speed good.  Neck and chin a little extra work needed.  Trimmer acceptable.  Better quality than Remington.  Cost less $ than Braun.  Rather have a cord charge than a mounting base charger.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor. Razor shaves close, very comfortable and holds a charge. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Takes 3 times as long to shave compared to my old one.  Takes forever to get hair into the screen and for it to actually cut it.  Go to the store and buy one then you can return it easily.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this device. I purchased it over two years ago and it is still working and the blades have not dulled at all. I don&#x27;t use it every time I shave but it has been used A LOT over the past two years and it&#x27;s still working just as great as it did the first day used.</li>
            <li> Had this razor a month. No problems. Holds a charge for the better part of a week.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for $30, but I am VERY impressed. In fact, I think I like it better than my last shaver, a Braun for which I paid over twice as much. It&#x27;s quiet and gives me a very close shave. I don&#x27;t know is how it will hold up because I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, but so far so good. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the position of the trimmer when engaged. It sticks out at a 90 degree angle which makes it difficult for me to position the shaver to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in desperation while traveling.  I could not get this to shave one whisker.  It&#x27;s really an amazing feat.  Do Not Buy This Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn trimmer works fine, so I give it one star.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on the strength of a positive Consumer Reports rating and many good comments from Amazon reviewers. My own experience was not so good. Even after going over my face numerous times, the razor left many whiskers untouched. It was especially unsatisfactory around the lips. But even on smooth expanses, such as my neck and cheeks, the Panasonic missed many  hairs.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this shaver here on Amazon I knew I had to have it. I love the colors and the design. It&#x27;s a great looking shaver.  Now that I own it, here are a few observations that I hope will be helpful:    Pros:  Quiet. Light weight, easy to grip and comfortable in the hand. The shaver has essentially two heads instead of the three, and it makes shaving under the nose really easy and more accurately with a three blade shaver. Does not give you razor burn.    Cons: Not the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever get.  There is no indicator light of any kind. Thus,  you&#x27;ll have to learn from personal experience how many shaves you&#x27;ll get out of it - and it won&#x27;t be more than a weeks worth.  Of course everyone&#x27;s beard is different, and thus some will need to shave longer than others.  There is no recharging cord,  only a plug adapter that fits directly in your wall socket.  As some wall sockets lay on their side, your shaver may be on its side pointing left or right when it&#x27;s recharging, instead of up as would normally expect. Not a deal breaker, just a bit odd and different.  Nickel cadmium batteries. This is very old battery technology, the kind that has a \\&quot;memory\\&quot;. So be sure to discharge your shaver fully before each recharge. Newer models have batteries that recharge in one hour and have no memory effect issues. This model takes a  long time to recharge.    Summary:    An inexpensive, lightweight model shaver.  Great for the gym, in your office desk drawer, or as a daily shaver -- if you have a light beard. It does an OK job of shaving, but not as good as the Panasonic three blade, 13,000 rpm linear speed models, such the 8109s. Speaking for myself, I think this is a nice extra shaver to have around, but for my beard I want, need, and now own another, beefier model for everyday use (8109s).</li>
            <li> I bought this for $34 with free shipping and I am very happy with it. It is a great bargain! It shaves close and is very quiet. Consumers Reports rated it number 3 in their test. But its price was well below the number 1 and 2 shaver. And I see it is now for under $30. Such a deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the money-I have had 2 of the older style and this one is great for travel.</li>
            <li> It is rechargeable and it works wet or dry. Thus the two stars... but the accolades end there. I don&#x27;t have thick hair growth and yet I still have to go over my face many, many times to get all the hair cut. It does patchy work and is not smooth. Its cheap, yes, but when you have to run it over your face many times and end up sore because of it then the cheap isn&#x27;t worthwhile any longer. Look elsewhere and save yourself the frustration.</li>
            <li> my husband hates this</li>
            <li> This shaver does not work!  Since my father is not able to shave the responsibility falls to me or my brother.  We thought electric would be the way to go to avoid accidents with blades but we are back to using disposable shavers with much more success. We have tried on multiple occasions to use this shaver without removing any hair so we have given up.  Not much to say on the positive side to balance this out since it simply does not work.</li>
            <li> After using a rotary type razor for over 50 years I decided to give this product a try.  I check it out with Consumer report and found that it had a very high rating even with its low price. I wasn&#x27;t dissappointed, in fact it&#x27;s the best razor I ever owned. Don&#x27;t let the color stated keep you from buying this product, it is sporty but not gaudy.  I use it in the shower with lather and in the car when traveling.  Holds a charge a long time and easy to use.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]] Looks pretty; charges well; just doesn&#x27;t seem to shave closely and has a problem with longer hairs that are lying flat.  I&#x27;ve tried it wet and tried it dry but must confess I haven&#x27;t shaved with it for 20 consecutive days using soap as recommended by the manufacturer.  I would have done that but when I need a really clean shave it&#x27;s so much easier and more efficient to do a quick wet shave with a Gillette Mach 3 razor. (I don&#x27;t have any shares of Gillette.)</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get a decent cut with this machine.  The feature wet/dry is ok .... but the cut ... is really really poor.  I wouldnt recommend this product.  Hernan Rodriguez.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this shaver was wow!! It really got the job done. It delivered an extremely close shave, which was rather surprising because of my course hair. It is easy to clean which is also a big plus. But I soon discovered it loses a lot of its effectiveness very quick. I have been left with patches of hair untouched after numerous go overs. Also, the charger could have been designed better. It is bulky and does not sit in the electrical outlet well when the shaver is attached. It can be used when wet but I find it more effective on dry skin. Overall, while there is room for lots of improvement, it is a fairly good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  We saw it was a best buy from Consumer Reports.  The price was great.  My husband does not think it works well if he does not shave every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to take on a trip to India.  I REALLY liked the fact that it was battery powered.  This part of the shaver works well; the battery holds it&#x27;s charge well.  Other than that, I was very disappointed in this shaver&#x27;s performance.  Shaving dry, it always left stray whiskers standing that I had to cut with the side burn trimmer.  I also attempted to shave wet as the manufacturer recommended, but this was even worse.  Shaving wet nearly doubled the time it took for me to shave and again left stray whiskers.  I purchased this to replace a Norelco three head electric razor that was over ten years old.  I have since pulled it out, cleaned and oiled it, and have found that it STILL works better than this Panasonic.  I have returned the Panasonic to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry razor that I have had and it does this very well.  However, this shaver forces you to shave everyday. If you have a weekend stubble it just can&#x27;t handle it.  Personally I don&#x27;t always like to shave on the weekends and this forces me to use a regular blade on Monday mornings.  I am going to look for something else.</li>
            <li> I have used this rasor for several months, works great in or out of the shower. Works with shaving cream. I would recommend this. I would not hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a good value and adequate for general use.  I can&#x27;t seem to get that close a shave below my jaw-line, but otherwise it works well.  I would also caution you to not go too long between shaves, otherwise it will hurt.  All in all, a good product for my needs, but I could see how a more expensive shaver might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware: I purchased this for my teen son and it doesn&#x27;t work like I thought it would. The trimmer works great, but the actual shaver part doesn&#x27;t cut at all. He will stick with the disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I needed a new electric razor and while searching for one in Amazon, I came across the Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver and while the low price made me hesitate, I figured that I had little to lose if I wasn&#x27;t happy.  To my surprise I found this to be the very best electric razor I have ever owned--and I have owned many in my 81 years.  This Panasonic Razor does a excellent shaving job, is very easy to use and to clean, and also is very quiet running.  Obviously I am very very happy with my purchase and I recommend it to every one who needs a new electric razor! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a great little electric razor for those who do not have a think beard. My beard, unfortunately, is like iron. I have to use a Remington razor made for tough stuff normally but I do, on occastion, use this one because it is kind to your face. It takes more work and if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a day then forget it. But if I am shaving before I go out at night and therefore don&#x27;t have my full beard then it works.</li>
            <li> The only thing I had to compare this to was a 20 year old electric... this one is amazing and for the price unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This is my fifth Panasonic wet/dry shaver in the past 22 years.  Prior to that, I had used a Remington, Sunbeam, and a Norelco, with none of those brands giving anything close to a satisfactory shave. After using Panasonic&#x27;s wet/dry shavers, I refuse to use anything else.  I purchased this one after my Panasonic ES8077 ($100) quit after almost two years (it leaked water into the housing and shorted out).  I must say, the cheaper Panasonics seem to be a better value, as more money doesn&#x27;t buy a better shave.  The ES4026 gives as good a shave as the ES8077, and the price is AT LEAST $70 LESS!  I had a Panasonic single blade (paid $10 originally) which also provided a very good shave. The ES4026 is so reasonbly priced that when the blades go dull in about 12-18 months, I&#x27;ll just buy a new shaver rather than pay the roughly $40 for a new foil and blades (I had one Panasonic Linear shaver which was on it&#x27;s original blades when it quit after five years of daily use).     Also, I recommend using this shaver in wet mode with a THIN layer of shave cream (foam-type, not gel) and rinse the shaver frequently.  For an even better shave, use in the shower.  Using it exclusively in dry mode means that you&#x27;re missing the intent of the Panasonic shaver line. If your plan is to shave dry, you might as well get another brand of shaver.      As for Amazon, I geve them a top-notch rating as well, both on price and shipping speed.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great. No issues whatsoever. I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars if it cost $50...but at $20 it was the cheapest one out and it does the job. I mainly use it for touch ups after a regular blade shave. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Pros: price and wet/dry operation.    Cons: it doesn&#x27;t shave well.  As others have commented - you have to shave daily for this thing to even have a chance....even then it seems there are hairs that it just won&#x27;t shave.  I either have to go over and over the same area (and sometimes that doesn&#x27;t work) or pull out another razor to finish the job.  This is only the 3rd razor I&#x27;ve owned in 20+ years of shaving and I can&#x27;t believe how bad it is.  The saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; is true here.</li>
            <li> This electric razor does not shave anything, it just makes a lot of noise. I sent it back the same day I received it.You get what you pay for, and this is a cheap razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first electric razor. It works well, except for on longer hair. It is best used as a maintenance shaver, from what I have experienced, to keep the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow off of the face. I don&#x27;t know how well it would work on hair such as a mustache or a beard. Best for keeping face clean and smooth. Definitely not for legs or areas with longer hair. I would go with some electric clippers if that&#x27;s the reason you are seeking this type of product.</li>
            <li> Believe all tho positive reviews, this razor is excellent as a wet shaver. I used it in the shower as instructed, shaving half my face with the panasonic and tho other with a 4 blade razor. Excellent result for my face not being use to the electric shave. Upper lip was closer then the blade! Impressive, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was at the neck it wasn&#x27;t as close as the blade, it just took a little extra work. I have owned Norelco&#x27;s and the best Brauns but this Panasonic delivers a far superior shave for literaly 1/10 the price. Great razor! I think I&#x27;ll buy another in case they discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the circular heads from now on.  This razor is much slower and less effective.  It&#x27;s worth the extra $54 for a circular head razor.  But I&#x27;m impressed with the price and think it&#x27;s a good backup razor.  IT&#x27;s very good for the non circular heads.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave properly. Leaves clumps of stubble on face. Have to work real hard to get a shave at all. Understandable why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty tough beard and if I let it grow a couple of days it&#x27;s kinda tough for this razor (or any electric) to give me a very close shave. However, if I shave every day it does well. I like that it can be used wet or dry and I find using it wet does a pretty nice job. Seems to charge up nicely too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my 94 year old Father who has recently had a stroke. For some reason it bothers him when his whiskers get to rough. With this razor, he can sit and rub it around his face to his hearts content. Because it is wet/dry, it&#x27;s easy to clean and since it&#x27;s rechargeable, there are no wires for him to contend with.  Compared to many other razors, it was very economical for him to try out. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.    Ron P</li>
            <li> Shaves well, the battery could last longer...I&#x27;ve found that the wet shave with a shaving gel is the best way to shave with this electric razor.  the only fault with this razor is it has trouble with longer hairs, and has a short battery life...is good for about 5 shaves and then needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I have never had a wet/dry shaver before. But my Norelco finally died and I did not want to spend over $100 for a new one.  So i found this one on Amazon and for the price I thought I would give it a try.  I have had it now for 8 days.  First 6 days I used it dry with a little pre-shave lotion and it was pretty hard to get a decent shave.  Had to go over it several times and had to use the trimmer to get some of the long hairs. So yesterday I tried it this way.  I wet my face and then put a thin layer of Barbasol Shaving cream over my face. Then I wet the razor head and it was so different.  It glided over my face and gave me a very good shave with no pressure and got all the hair. Rinsed off my face and took the head off the razor and held it under hot water to clean and ran water over the head and that&#x27;s it. So I recommend that you use this as a wet shave only with shaving cream and you will love it.  I have got in the habit now of putting it on the charger after every use or every two uses for the best performance.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my father as a Christmas gift.  He has been pretty pleased with it.  He&#x27;s a man of few words so that&#x27;s about all I got out of him about it.</li>
            <li> Incredible deal for a great shaver.  Have bought two of them so far and plan to buy another for use down the road.  GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I havent fully used it yet cause im charging it but it was the fastest shipment ive ever made. it came in one day</li>
            <li> Has been a great shaver for me.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on how great this was and felt pretty good about the purchase.  It turned out to be barely usable and time consuming to get even close to a decent shave.      I would say that those who liked it must have just a little peach fuzz or something.  It took about 15 minutes to shave my face and it still left behind long whiskers and missed patches.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one and get something better.</li>
            <li> Unit works well. Charge lasts about a week. Pleased with results. A very attractive price tag.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver based on the reviews on Amazon and was greatly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as a standard dry shaver and it kept missing hairs.  I tried it as a wet shaver and I tried it with shaving cream but still got poor results.  I ending up buying another shaver 2 weeks after buying the Panasonic because it was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after having it less than a year, the shaver will not charge and I have to throw it away at an electronic waste center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste you&#x27;re money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver.  It&#x27;s relatively quiet, fits the hand well, cuts close, and is easy to clean.   The wet/dry feature means it can be used in the shower if desired.  Recharge time is 8 hours for a full charge but enough of a partial charge to get one more shave out of it takes much less time.  I like everything about it except the yellow color.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a bargain for the money. It shaves well (if not perfectly), and can be cleaned with water. And it&#x27;s rechargeable</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that a cord did not come with this unit.  I see now that there is a picture showing how this shaver is supposed to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver when it is turned on is very quiet.  The unit is rather small and the blades on top are smaller than usually heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m letting my son decide if this is something he wants to use or not...</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as a blade, but gives a good shave, works well, lasts a long time on a charge, and is well built. The shaver has a good weight and balance and I find it easier to use the trimmer than other electrics I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;m liking this shaver and use it daily for 6 months now, including when traveling. I expect to use it for many years. I thought I&#x27;d really like the wet shave in the shower, but I find I&#x27;m more comfortable with a dry shave in front of the mirror. Its nice to have the option. I&#x27;d recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Horrible Shave. Have been using electric for 10+ years, this is the worst shave I have had. 3 day growth? Forget about it.    Going back to my 3 head circular Norelco</li>
            <li> Never owned, nor used an electric shaver before. This seemed to be a reasonably priced unit to try. Basically wanted to use it to touch up later in the day and for its pop-up trimmer to get the hairs under my nose that the razor misses. Seems to work fine on both counts.</li>
            <li> I had been using the norelco \\&quot;cool-skin\\&quot; w/d razor, but rotary heads don&#x27;t work well for me. With this Panasonic, I shaved with a blade on Sunday and used the es4026nc to stay nice and smooth all week with NO razor burn. I&#x27;m going to get my girl a ladies model for her legs and underarms.          http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001209OO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor for over twenty years so I thought maybe technology has improved and I would give this one a try, what a mistake!    First the positive: It is inexpensive. It is fairly lightweight, easy to hold and charges quickly. The trimmer piece works sort of.    Now the bad: This thing leaves hair all over my face! Not long hairs but a lot of tiny short hairs that won&#x27;t cut no matter how many times I go over it, and over it and over it.    I tried it dry and I tried it wet. With shaving cream and without. No matter what I tried those small hairs just won&#x27;t get cut!    This is the last electric razor I will ever try. I will stick to the Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> the shaver worked great and does what it says it can with even more which surprised me. A very great buy</li>
            <li> My first wet/dry shaver, would give it a 5 stars report but the&lt;br /&gt;8 hour charge is a little bothersome. Plan ahead for a full battery&lt;br /&gt;and you are good to go. Amazon, delivery was perfect!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. i bought it for my father who resides in a nursing home. aides tried it and i tried it. it&#x27;s a toy</li>
            <li> Shaving capability / closeness of shave - 2 stars  Shaver motor/power - 2 stars  Convenience - 1 star  This shaver has a wall receptacle type of charger (no cord)making it impossible to shave with a cord. The shaver died after seven months.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new PanasonicShaver.  This particular model is his favorite and hard to get in the stores.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver - works pretty good; comfortable; great value (at about $30-$35).  I bought one and after a year or two it failed after water got into case (I use it in the shower).  Disappointing, but still I liked it enough to buy another.  Hopefully it will last a bit longer.  Works best for whiskers on face &amp; cheeks; some shortcomings on neck.  I sometimes back it up with a Norelco triple-header.</li>
            <li> My 16 yr. old son likes to use this when he&#x27;s un a hurry before school!  It&#x27;s not as close as a razor, but good enough!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous electric shavers over the years. Including two different Wet Dry Norelco/Philips \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; models and most recently a Braun 5775. While I liked the wet dry capability of the Norelco, they didn&#x27;t do a particularly good job delivering a close shave. The Braun was better but wasn&#x27;t a true wet dry model and after a few years using it I started to get many more in grown hairs then normal. Since it was about time to replace the foil and cutting block on my Braun which would&#x27;ve cost me more money, I decided to try this shaver out instead.    All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with it for the price. Of all the shavers I&#x27;ve used, when used regularly with shaving foam in the shower, this is the closest to a blade shave of all of them. My skin is much smoother than it ever was with the Norelco or Braun. It is important that you use it regularly though as the first time I tried it I had roughly 4 days worth of growth and the shaver had a really hard time with it. With a normal amount of stubble it was much better. It does have trouble with longer neck hairs but it&#x27;s not really any worse than other shavers I&#x27;ve used. The great thing is that because the shave is much closer than my previous electrics, I can easily shave every 2 days rather than every day. With that amount of stubble, the Panasonic has no problems except for the occasional neck hair that it misses.  As for battery life, I can&#x27;t report yet. It is a NiCad battery so remember not to charge it until it starts to lose power. I&#x27;ve done two shaves (the first being very long since I had a ton of beard growth) and so far it seems like it has enough juice in it for 1 or 2 more regular 3-5 minute shaves. For me, not having to shave everyday makes up for any complaint I would have about short battery life or the charger not being the best (since it is a wall cradle rather than a cord).     All in all I&#x27;m pleased. This was my first Panasonic shaver and I&#x27;m definitely sold on them for the future. Wet Dry capability along with the closest shave to a blade I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric make this a winner in my book.    Update-I have been using the razor for about a month now and am still pleased with it. In retrospect I probably would have gone with the model one level up but I&#x27;m still pleased with this. One thing I will add is that it is MUCH better as a wet dry shaver with shaving foam in the shower than a dry shave. I just did a dry shave for the first time (since I was running late this morning and didn&#x27;t have time to use it in the shower) and the shave is much more like a typical electric razor (i.e. not that close but not bad). In the shower with foam it is a much closer shave.      Second Update-Well, it&#x27;s not late June and the shaver started making a really loud squeeking sound and the shaving block was moving super slow. Since it was so cheap I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to fix so I threw it away and finally decided that since I was already using shaving cream in the shower, I may as well just use a blade rather than investing in another electric shaver. Unless you&#x27;re like some of the folks here and have medical conditions that prohibit you from using a blade for risk of accidental cuts, I&#x27;d skip this one and just use a blade.</li>
            <li> This item is not great. It&#x27;s not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. My husband has gone back to using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over two months now. Being in my early 60&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been shaving a long time. Having had many shavers in my life I&#x27;d rate this one as a \\&quot;good\\&quot; shaver. I&#x27;ve had other panasonic shavers that did work better, BUT cost much-much more. For me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use, and it provides a much closer shave than I possible without using a blade.  I am impressed.  The cost is another plus factor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it !   This is the worst electric razor I ever bought.  It misses hair that is even the slightest bit long.  It irritates the skin yet does not product a good shave.  Buy some other razor !  I am throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Love it! I paid $20.95 with free shipping for my first one. I just ordered another one for $25.88 with free shipping. If I could find them at the lower price again, I would order 6 and give them as gifts.     Close shave, maintains charge, unique charger. This shaver is cheaper than buying blades for my expensive Norelco, and gives me as good or better shave.    Jim</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month and it is great.  Does more than I expected for the price.  I have never used the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; razor before and really enjoy it.  Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Not only was the deal with Amason easy and quick... the product was as described and wonderful. I was faceing a costly replacement on foil and blades on an exspencive braum, when i some how fell across a review of this shaver. It is so afordable I couldn&#x27;t lose. After a week of use I have nothing but praise to say, In fact I am ordering another to put on the shelf when the foil iand blade are ruined do to my heavy facial hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its my hair or the machine is not strong enough but this does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was a little upset about the product because consumer reports gave it such good reviews.  I  am not sure if it was my type of beard or what, but it didnt shave anything.  Mayne it works with other hair types, but definately not coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Well the shaver is good but as with all electronic shaver, you can almost never get a clean smooth shave especially near neck the shaver proves to be ineffective. It cannot completely remove the hairs in and around the neck. Overall the product is ok but trust me you need to use a manual shaver to get a clean shave! Its good for journey purposes although and the battery life is also good!  I would recommend this product but getting a clean shave with any electronic shaver is impossible and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun fan for years but their price increases have left me out of their market. When I saw this Panasonic ES4026NC offered for a great price, read the positive reviews and noted the generous free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering one. I&#x27;ve known Panasonic to be a quality product company.    The shaver performs well and is a baregain. I am very pleased. I shave dry, without gels, shaving cream etc. I get as good a shave now as I did with my much more expensive Brauns. I must note that I have a light beard and shave once daily.   I recommend this shaver to those with light beards.    Dave K.</li>
            <li> The razor is attractive enough and solid, but it just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough to go out in public. I had a cheaper Panasonic razor that worked much better and have gone back to that one while I await a new, more expensive Norelco. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he seems to like it so far... the only thing that he had to say negatively was that the pop out trimmer should have had a better angle on it instead of coming straight out... otherwise he likes it very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using foil shavers for about 20 years and have used Braun &amp; Panasonic exclusively. This Panasonic shaver is the worst foil shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, I can&#x27;t get a close shave using it wet or dry. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> As some of reviewers said, it works well with short beard. I&#x27;m doing my shaving every day now. Get a heavy duty one if you want to shave once a week. Don&#x27;t expect the side panel help you on your long beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to a pretty decent razor, it&#x27;ll get your skin pretty smooth pretty easily, and of course is a wet/dry razor which is always great.    The only real downside I can find is that IT SUCKS if you have any kind of beard (especially w/ coarse hair) I made the mistake of having a beard when I bought this razor and just spent 20-30 min+ slowly shaving it off w/ this thing.    I say slowly mainly due to the fact that the trimmer was so weak it couldn&#x27;t really cut through my beards coarse hair w/ out a million short passes, and also because it pulled at at least half the hairs it did catch/cut. So I could really only do a little bit at a time and then had to recover from the discomfort/pain.    While I&#x27;m thankfully done w/ it, and I have found most of my chin pretty smooth after running over it w/ the normal razor head after shaving the beard off. I do NOT want to have to go through that again, and if I grow a beard again at any point while I have this, I would really rather use a disposable or even a pair of garden shears as the easier and less painful option to this.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have owned: 1 norelco-4 Remingtons- 1 Wall- and a couple I really want to forget. the Panasonic cuts close and holds a charge well. I&#x27;d buy it again. (also wet or dry is nice.)</li>
            <li> I have a light beard. This is without question the worst shaver I have ever used. The only use I would recommend it for, is as a play toy shaver for your 5 year old son - it has a neat yellow racing track on the shaver molding which looks nice and the shaver makes a buzzing sound and a little boy would like that- he could believe he was shaving just like Dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe that Panasonic would put their brand name on this piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;If there was a zero star ranking, it would get ZERO. It is not worth a single star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you know.</li>
            <li> This razor (Panasonic ES4026NC) was the best electric razor I ever had... when it was new.  It was light, quiet, easy to clean, held a charge for 5 days, and shaved quickly through a weekend&#x27;s worth of beard. It was better than my $100 Braun.  Plus, it was $20 after the $10 mail in rebate.    After just two months, though, the cutting capabilities greatly diminished.  It made cutting/grinding noises, but needed multiple passes, where I had to push down to get it to shave.  As everyone knows, multiple passes and pushing lead to skin irritation.  It feels like the cutter is not as flush to the microscreen as it used to be.  I tried reinserting the blades, but no difference.  Also, the batteries are just NiCads (to keep the cost down).  Now, after 4 months, they barely hold 2 days worth of a charge.    Overall: just skip this one.  It&#x27;s more of an 8 week disposable razor than a long term morning friend.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES402 is a fantastic shaver for the price. It offers a smooth shave with no irretation. It takes a couple shaves for the razor and the face to adapt, but after that it is perfect. The only draw back is the charging system. The razor sits on top of the charger when it is plugged in. You must have a good receptical or you will find your razor on the floor.</li>
            <li> This product was completely ineffective in shaving my face. In addition after I finished shaving I was left with cuts all over my face and a lot of remaining rubble that the shaver did not cut. [[ASIN:B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]]</li>
            <li> Good little shaver for the money to take on trips.  It needs charging often.</li>
            <li> I have read alot of review on this item so i decided to purchase it.  I bought it in may 2010 and since i have recieve it i only used it twice because i am very disappointed. my problem is i dont get clean shave as the reviews state,when i used it some area of my face is clean while other ares still have hair.i am not happy and the only reason i dont return it is because of the distance i am.  Very disappointed user</li>
            <li> Pros: well contoured grip, comfortable shaving heads, easy rinsable cleaning, bargain price.  Cons: misses longer hairs, pop-up trimmer is uncomfortable, awkward charging base.</li>
            <li> Looks cool and most of all it works fairly well.  I paid 3 times as much for a razor that does just about the same. And I for one really love the cable&#x27;les wall charger. Less cables the better.  I dig this.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver! It is light weight, quiet, and does an excellent job even when the charge is getting low. The charger plugs right into the outlet so no cords are in the way.  Definitely worth the money we paid for it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t work out why this shaver wasn&#x27;t making any headway on even quite short stubble. Then I realized that the screen holes are very small, only fractionally larger than my (admittedly thick) facial hair.    Bottom line: this might work on fine hair, but if you have chin-mounted tree trunks like me, forget it.</li>
            <li> i just shaved and thought it&#x27;s time to write a one star review for this little piece of ****. this is by far the worst shaver i have ever used. it is sooo annoying. i only shave every few days and this thing just can&#x27;t handle stubble. and it takes forever. sometimes i am standing there for 10 or more minutes if i want all facial hair gone (and i don&#x27;t have that much). it&#x27;s ridiculous.    the side-shaver is useless because of the way it is designed. it  easily folds back in when you use it, so you have to be careful and not apply too much pressure. why why why did they do this. what did they think!?    every time i use it i condemn it and wish i had bought a different kind. shame on panasonic for putting this on the market. stick to your old one if it still works, it is definitely better than this one.    i will destroy(!) it as soon as i have a new one. and this time i&#x27;ll spend some more money. and i&#x27;m done with panasonic. ugh</li>
            <li> The timmer gets clogged easily and the battery life is miserable, unless it&#x27;s just me not knowing how to probably charge machinery...</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS NO BETTER THAN MY OLD REMINGTON.  IT GIVES A TERRIBLE SHAVE.  I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.  NOT EVEN WORTH THE REDUCED PRICE.  DON&#x27;T BUY IT.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace the razor I was using and cost a fortune. I wanted one that didn&#x27;t cost a lot since that would defeat the purpose of not spending the money on the replacement blades. I waited several months before writing this review.    I like the ergonomic design. It feels very comfortable in my hand. It is easy to clean and I&#x27;ve had no problems with water getting into the unit. I don&#x27;t have any battery problems. I make sure that I recharge it on the same day of the week.    Now the downside. I&#x27;m not sure that the foil shaver works best for my beard. Not all the hairs on my face end up being cut. After a few days I will see various long hairs in different places on my face and neck. If I miss a day of shaving, then the problem is worse. I have tried different shaving methods to see if I could resolve the problem, without luck. I use the sideburn trimmer to rake across my face and neck to cut those long hairs.     It may just be my beard type that doesn&#x27;t work well with this razor. If it wasn&#x27;t for this problem, I would recommend the shaver. However, if I had to do it all over again, I would not purchase a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product! I bought it for my husband for Christmas and the first time he used it, it cut his face up all over and his face burned with razor burn for 2 days and is still hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it didn&#x27;t cut any hairs at all, so he tried to push it a little firmer on his skin and it totally tore into his skin. He looks like he was attacked by a bear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for several years now; it shaves as well as any foil razor I&#x27;ve used, and I like that it&#x27;s a wet/dry razor.  I also like that it cleans very easily, and it has a nice feel in the hand.  My two disappointments relate to its battery.  It holds a charge fairly well, but there is no indicator on the razor that the battery is running low.  Since I tend to go unshaven for a few days, this can leave me in the lurch when I go to shave and the only indication that the battery is low is when I put the razor to my face and the motor bogs down.  I also regret that there is no charge status light on the charger, either.  It will tell you that the razor is connected, but nothing more.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this if you do not want to have rash on your face.  I am not sure how come this has 4 star review rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a $120 Braun whose blade and foil replacements cost about the same as this entire shaver.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with its (wet) performance.  I even dropped the unit once in the shower, and after putting the foil and blades back in place, it still works.    Small manufacturing gripe - the foil release buttons on the side can get stuck if you push them in too far, keeping the foil from reattaching securely. Not a big deal if it happens - I just have to manipulate the release button to pop it back out - but it does keep the shaver from working correctly until it&#x27;s fixed.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times, but it seems to shave well.  Probably best to shave frequently...don&#x27;t let the stubble get thick.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a good close shave. I&#x27;ve used it for the past 2 weeks and have only charged it breifly after receiving it. So far, no problems.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver until a couple of years ago.  I got a fancy new shaver for Christmas a couple of years ago.  It is much more powerful and fancy than this Panasonic.  But the new shaver you have to use cleaning fluid and you HAVE to replace the blades and the foil over the blades.  That runs the operating cost up a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I failed to order in the replacement foil/blades in and the foil has big holes in it.  Hurt like hell to save with it.&lt;br /&gt;So I pulled out my old Panasonic and it still worked.  It got me to thinking...I never spent a penny on replacement parts for it.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I could even find parts for it now.  I am sure Panasonic has moved on with a newer and improved shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Right now I am using the Panasonic ES4026NC and waiting for the replacement parts to get here for my new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Then I will sadly put the Panasonic ES4026NC.  If I was you I would check out, here on Amazon, what the current update to this shaver is.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is a little smaller than my previous razor, but the wet/dry option is great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver.  I bought it for him for Christmas and it was a great deal.  Also, it was 1/2 the price on Amazon.com than from Panasonic&#x27;s website!  What a great deal!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this shaver, as I was looking for something different than the traditional Norelco rotary razors. It is well made, sounds like it has a well-built motor, and is submersible.  However, this shaver does not give me a good shave; it misses hairs. Maybe this is due to the fine beard I have, but my old Norelco never had that problem. Also, if I have more than a day&#x27;s growth, this shaver is useless.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I hate shaving.  I think it&#x27;s the biggest waste of time a man (or a woman) has in his life.  Having said that, unless you&#x27;re hairless, it&#x27;s usually inevitable and at some point you have to breakdown and do it.    I can&#x27;t say enough how disappointed and annoyed I&#x27;ve been with the shavers on the market and the companies making them.  Let&#x27;s be honest...it&#x27;s a terrible scam, really.  We get the \\&quot;convenience\\&quot; of cordless shavers that ironically don&#x27;t work with cords, just to have the cheap batteries die out in about a years worth of time.  Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves; this is on purpose, so we either a) buy another shaver or b) take it in for expensive service.  Considering that most shavers already cost upwards of $50, some up to $250 (unbelievable), it&#x27;s, well, quite a scam.  Why we keep buying into it and not take a stand I&#x27;m not sure but that&#x27;s a whole different article.    Having said that, my latest Braun&#x27;s battery once again, ironically, died out after a little over a year.  I decided to try this shaver based on all the overwhelming reviews.  I was a little skeptical about the 2 blade system versus three but took the plunge anyhow.  The most I could lose was $30 so not a lot on the line.    My conclusion is that it must depend how often you shave.  Again, I hate shaving, and quite frankly I look better with a couple days of growth, so I only shave once or twice a week.  If you&#x27;re like me, this probably isn&#x27;t the shaver for you since it simply can&#x27;t get hair off your face efficiently once it&#x27;s grown out a bit.  I just shaved with it a little while ago and it took me 20 minutes, most of the battery life, mind you, and I still have stray hairs all over which I need to get with a regular razor, or play that little game where I find and then pluck them out.    Perhaps if you shave daily this might be the \\&quot;dream\\&quot; shaver, especially because of the price.  If you don&#x27;t, though, you get what you pay for here.  I will say the Braun with the built inhair trimmer is much more efficient, that is, when it&#x27;s working and has a charge to it.  On the positive side, I personally really like the small compact recharger on this shaver.  I despise having these huge eyesores on my countertop, ala Braun&#x27;s self cleaning pods, something that also doesn&#x27;t easily fit anywhere in a normal sized bathroom.  Another positive is how very light this shaver is.  Highly impressive!  Lastly, due to the light weight and the small size, it is easy to shave around beard growth, that is, if you&#x27;re sculpting you&#x27;re own beard.    Overall, I&#x27;m giving this shaver a so-so review.  Obviously, it works for some but really doesn&#x27;t for me.  So, anyone want to buy a gently used shaver?!  I&#x27;ll give you a REALLY good price!</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; when I purchased this shaver.  I have an older Panasonic that cost closer to 100 bucks.  It&#x27;s lasted quite a long time and maintained solid performance overall.  The ES4026 looks and feels like a shaver better suited for a 17 year old with new facial hair to cut on.  I have thick, coarse facial hair and this shaver just didn&#x27;t do the job - I could tell from the first cut that it wasn&#x27;t for me.      Overall, not a bad shaver but I&#x27;ll keep it in mind for my son to use when he turns 16.....it&#x27;s definitely not one to use for the seasoned face.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this shaver seem to be all over the place - some real high 4-5 stars, and some blistering 1 stars. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year, been debating whether or not I should write up a review, and it wasn&#x27;t until it crapped out that I finally decided, yeah, put some thoughts down from someone who has had it, and is moving on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having a number of electric shavers over the years, I saw this on sale at Best Buy for $20. A true wet/dry shaver; something I always wanted - a shaver I could use in the shower, as well as out. Well, I have to say, it really does not work (for ME) out of the shower. And I found I needed more than being just \\&quot;wet\\&quot; using it in the shower. If I didn&#x27;t use soap on my face as a lubricant, it was borderline painful to use in the shower. But, using it with my face lathered with soap, it worked very well. A nice close shave, closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the close shave could only be obtained if I shaved EVERY DAY at the SAME TIME. If I waited even a few hours past 24, then blades could not handle the longer whiskers. I would end up using a double edge razor to get the substantial amount of whiskers left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further problems were that the razor could not hold enough charge to do more than 6-7 shaves. Not a problem, I just got into the habit of plugging it in every Sunday, ready to go Monday. But think about it, as an example, if this shaver held enough to do 7 3-5 minute shaves, for an average of 4 minutes, a total of 28 minutes of shaving time per charge cycle. Extending that by just a minute more cuts it down to 6 days; 2 minutes extra minute 4-5 days. And now it becomes a pain - not being able to get a full week of shaving. And any vacation you HAVE TO bring the charger. A pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, either the razor stopped taking a charge, or the charger stopped charging. It would charge erratically, not getting a full charge even overnight, barely charging enough for a single day&#x27;s shave, until finally, it would not take a charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what did I learn from my experience? It was a nice little shaver, but not cut out for everyday use. It was far too harsh for dry shaving, and was incapable of handling a slightly over 1 days growth. I still liked the wet/dry concept, so went looking for a replacement and found the Panasonic ES7103K. [[ASIN:B000VKV28S Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black]] My results with this shaver are much more favorable - very capable of wet AND dry shaving; it&#x27;s going on three weeks on one charger; cleans up nicely. All in all, a much better everyday shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was originally going to give it 3 stars, but knocked it down 1 for dying on me less than a year after purchase. If you need a nice travel shaver, larger and more sturdy than the tiny little travel shavers, and would like to shaver in the shower, this is it. Definitely NOT ready for everyday use.charge anymore.    So, what did I learn from my experience? It was a nice little shaver, but not cut out for everyday use.

            <li> Unlike other electric razors who&#x27;s power cables always seem to die before the shaver does, this one comes with a wall charger.  (it sits on a cradle while plugged in)      I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this razor by a friend in Dallas about 20 years ago.  I was so shocked how close it shaved that I went out and bought one.  Since that time I have used 2 more eventually wearing them out. After the last one I tried 2 different razors at a discount and  they were so pour  in their comfort and performance I immediately ordered another Panasonic (upgraded) from Amazon for about $22.00.  If you are questioning your first venture into electric razors or you are a veteran, this razor shaves closer than a blade. Let me repeat, IT SHAVES CLOSER THAN A BLADE,  IT IS SILKY COMFORTABLE, IT HAS A USEABLE TRIMMER,  IT CAN BE USED WHILE BATHING,IT HAS LONG BATTERY LIFE,  AND IT IS VERY REASONABLY PRICED.   In fact I have just ordered 3 more for gifts.    And, no I do not work for Panasonic or Amazon or a dealer, IT IS THAT EXCITING A PRODUCT, you want to share it..    Red Bernard</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after experiencing a cardiac \\&quot;event\\&quot; and it was recommended to move to an electric.  As a predominantly \\&quot;shower shaver\\&quot;, a wet/dry was my shaver of choice.  After researching and reading reviews on numerous options I decided on the ES4026NC.  I had owned a first generation Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  I considered price, features, and ergonomics. First, it was delivered within the time frame promised. The shaver itself is light, thus easy to handle. Its ergonomic shape is well balanced. The shave is close with no irrition. The ES4026NC is easy to maintain and recharge. For the cost, along with the free shipping this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> This shaver rated high on Consumer Reports for performing well and its low cost. They couldn&#x27;t have been more on the mark. Excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is pretty impressive.  At first I was scared to put the shaver under running water, but so far, nothing bad.  I do have to run the shaver a couple times through spots, but thats usually normal for many other shavers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these because I like them so much. One for travel and one for home. Very cheap, but very good.</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job just fine.  Good buy for the price.  My only negative...it takes 8 hours for a full recharge.</li>
            <li> The unit is rated for wet or dry use, but beware.  The charger hole in the bottom is NOT waterproof.  This means you can use it with shaving cream or gel, and rinse the head, but don&#x27;t take it into the shower and let it get rained upon, and definitely don&#x27;t immerse it in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, I found that the unit really does not give a good shave.  If I hit the edge of my mustache, the unit will tug or pull hairs as it strains.  When staying clean-shaven, this will not get any closer than \\&quot;5 O&#x27;Clock Shadow\\&quot;.  As in, if I use a 3-blade disposable, then use the Panasonic at end of day, the Panasonic won&#x27;t get any closer.  I&#x27;ve tried gel, cream, and dry.  I&#x27;ve tried going different directions, different angles, etc.  There&#x27;s just too much internal gap between the blades and the foil to get even a vaguely close shave with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, I can&#x27;t really recommend this.  I mean, the price is good, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these for me and as gift. After using one for couple of days, returned the second one. Not good even for every day shave.</li>
            <li> Pros: Can use in the shower with shaving cream, easy to clean    Cons: Battery runs out after 6 shaves (this was a brand new unit). It does well with flat areas i.e., moustache, chin, and cheeks, but fails around the neck (my co-workers thought I was going for a European look). I have to go over my neck area several times, often irritating or nicking the skin. I thought using shaving cream would help, but it actually makes the blades slip. Despite my best efforts from all angles, this shaver still leaves significant stubble and missed hairs. My $2 schick razor does a better job! I have another more expensive panasonic shaver and it has the same problem. If you&#x27;re looking for left-over stubble, go for this shaver.  If you want a closer shave, look elsewhere, if not, for another brand.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great - this makes my 3rd or 4th Panasonic shaver and by far the cheapest one I&#x27;ve owned yet.  Other more expensive shavers have had the 3rd row of cutting blades that work on the longer whiskers - this one only has two rows and if you&#x27;ve got more than a day&#x27;s growth, it has a hard time capturing the stubble.  Such was the case Sunday morning trying to shave for church; I had not shaved since Friday morning and I ended up having to use a straight edge to finish the job.  If you shave daily (even on the weekends), this shaver will do a great job.  As they say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I used this 3 times and then put it in the drawer as a backup.  Took it out a year later and it won&#x27;t even charge.  Another pile of crap I have wasted money on.  It doesn&#x27;t cut that well either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like electric razors, I figured I&#x27;d try a wed/dry one and it works well.  I have to shave every day or two, it doesn&#x27;t work well for longer growth. It takes about a week for your skin to completely get used to the change from a blade. I stuck with it and have been using it as my main razor now. I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars, but the rating doesn&#x27;t allow for 1/2&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first electric shaver and I seem to like it. I had one problem with this shaver it didn&#x27;t give the full clean shave I thought it would. The product is silent and the price is a bargain. The trimmer works perfect because I was able to keep my beard in line. The shaver I say needs to be a little bit more powerful but maybe it depends on the thickness of a persons hair as well. If you are looking for a nice shaver for a great price. Look no more this is the one. This could be a great gift the only problem is the charging. The first day I got it I wanted to test it out right there but I had to wait 8 hours for it to charge!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a nice, close, comfortable shave BUT the charging system is the WORST I&#x27;ve ever seen... if the shaver is not placed carefully on top of the charger, it will NOT charge, and may even fall off. Also, if the charger doesn&#x27;t fit tightly into you outlet, the whole assembly (shaver and charger) will end-up on the floor.</li>
            <li> This Shaver sucks. Did not do a good job on my face. Barely cut my hair. I guess it works in the shower, but then again... it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of positive review on Consumer Reports and the Panasonic brand (love their electronic items!).  Wanted a shaver that would give a close, smooth shave and that could be rinsed off for cleaning.  Summary:  lightweight, smooth shaving heads and fairly easy to rinse clean, but the negative is that it simply doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave.  After several weeks of usage, it always left much more stubble than my former Norelco or current Braun models (those aren&#x27;t wet/dry).  This was evident shaving either dry or with lather/wet.  Most disappointed given the Panasonic name &amp; history, product was returned for refund--hoping no glitches on that with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time i bought this shaver (over about 4 years).  I have a very thick and quick growth.  This shaver is probably the closest to a razor that I have found.  It holds a good charge and is easy to clean in the shower.  The only reason I replace it, is for another one of the same.  Because of the cost of replacement parts, It just makes more sense to just buy it again.</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to review products, but felt compelled to share my thoughts on this shaver. This is my first experience with a \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It works great with shaving cream, but it really shines when used with pre-shave conditioner (Lectricshave).    Pros:    - Cost! 30 bucks is what you pay for a large pack of traditional blades -- great value.  - Holds a good charge - I&#x27;m typing this from a hotel room. I didn&#x27;t even bring my charger. After 3 days, still going strong.  - Wet shave - shaving cream with an electric shaver is a great shave.  - Dry shave - comfortable and not too many passes needed for \\&quot;close as blades shave\\&quot;  - Looks - it looks sporty and contemporary    Cons:    - Charger - I thought I would love the plug-in charging base as it saves counter space. It does do that, but it it awkward to place and remove the shaver -- requires 2 hands.  - Drying - this is probably just me, but I feel compelled to leave the shaver disassembled when drying it out after a cleaning.    Overall:    I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to say he really loves this shaver.  That&#x27;s not like him so I guess it means something!</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great value at $30.  It&#x27;s quiet, holds a long charge and gives a really close shave.  I love it and highly recommend it.  Have not used it &#x27;wet&#x27; though.</li>
            <li> this shaver is not worth a penny. for one thing it does not work unless you have a fine stubble and another you can&#x27;t use it sometimes because it is cordless and is on the charger. such a crummy device over all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to hold it against this shaver since all the rest of the electric shavers is the same for me, but this shaver is another that makes my skin bleed. I was hopeful about the lines of it being hypoallergenic but no luck towards my problem. If other shavers of this general design aggravate your face, this won&#x27;t be any different. The only difference here is that wet shaving will go quicker if you do it right, but it will still sting as always.  The wet shaving works better than dry shaving if you follow the directions of foaming it with soap or shaving cream. I would continue using this shaver if it wasn&#x27;t for the bleeding and stinging. I give it an extra star above the average for (what seems so far like) completely safe wet shaving for that low price.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver for my birthday, and I really hate it. The shave head works poorly, but really, the worst part of this product is the trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t do anything! I mean, you feel it vibrate, so you know it&#x27;s working, but it&#x27;s the only clue you have. It combs your facial hair instead of shaving it. Since I always need to trim my sideburns and beard, this product really lets me down on this.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the price...like most shaver there are area were they don&#x27;t do a great job. Overal shave as well as a more expense foil type shavers...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic cordless shaver for years, but \\&quot;it&#x27;s time had come.\\&quot;    I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a new Panasonic (I&#x27;m sold on the brand) and they have so many choices with features I don&#x27;t understand.    I decided to take a chance and WOW am I pleased. Truly a great value.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Panasonic razor I have bought. The first one is 16 years old and I still use it. I often have one in my car for shaving before an appointment. On one of them the screen broke by falling off the seat, otherwise they are very reliable.    This new one holds a charge for more than 10 days worth of shaves for me. It was was so good I gave one to a friend.    I shave dry, don&#x27;t know how it works as a wet shaver.    The only issue I have (a minor one) is that the pop up trimmer is not very wide. The other models I have owned had wider trimmers -- useful for shaving under the jaw bone and lower on the neck where the hair may not stick up stiffly for the regular blades.    I would recommend this one. Good value probably because of the color design.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s review of the purchase.  Brand name encouraged me to purchase this shaver.  All Panasonic appliances seem to be dollar for dollar, good quality.  The RPM&#x27;s are high on this shaver and enables it to give a nice, close shave without hurting the facial skin.  Also, the way it&#x27;s manufactured allows an easy cleaning job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of beard, it works fine for me!  I got this one almost 2 years now, it still works great!  and it is cheap!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad, who is 91.  He did not feel it gives a close shave, but then he IS measuring it up against the memory of a good barber shave with a straight razor.....  I can&#x27;t be fair in rating it, as I don&#x27;t use it.  Though he grumbles, he uses it, and he looks pretty good to me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are excellent shavers.  This is my second one; the first one worked for at least 3 years with no problems until the battery stopped recharging (which is typical).  Whereas my previous Noreclo and Braun shavers sometimes developed a hole in their foils after awhile, I have never had similar issues with these shavers.  Also, the curved design makes under-the-chin shaving easier.  As beard hairs get longer and less stubbly, they sometimes have difficulty entering the foil to be cut, and then its necessary to use the trimmer first to shorten the hairs in question.  The trimmer on this shaver is excellent; in addition it can be used for sideburns, but also for cleaning up around the back of the neck and for trimming body hair in general.  Overall this is a reliable and very useful hair removal tool; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a really good razor for years and I&#x27;ve gone through many. Each one seems to have one problem or another. This one seems to shave really close for an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight and cheap, but it seems to miss those hairs that have grown out and are curved over. So I use the pop-up trimmer which seems to work well to snip them off. Other than this aspect, it&#x27;s really quite good. My other razors didn&#x27;t shave as close, but were maybe better at catching all the hairs. I&#x27;d rather have a close shave, and have to go back and catch the hairs it&#x27;s missed. Perhaps the more expensive razor in Panasonic&#x27;s lineup are better at catching long hairs, but I&#x27;m assuming they all use the same general shave head, so aren&#x27;t any better at this. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased, till the next generation comes along.</li>
            <li> After six months of use, the battery is already shot.  Having to replace this shaver twice a year wipes out any cost advantage it may have over other models.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver because of the high rating it got in consumer reports.  I am no mountain man with a thick beard.  But this shaver just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to do the job.  I find myself having to shave 2X a day.  If I let it go a full day, it can&#x27;t shave the hairs.  If I miss a day, I have to shave with a razor (or my old Remington shaver).</li>
            <li> Decent product. Does what it says it will do. Works in water and with shaving cream. Super easy to clean. It may hurt some people at first, but not me. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> After using a Panasonic linear razor for years I thought any Panasonic product would be just as good. WRONG!!! Although the ES4026NC is ok, it dosen&#x27;t shave as good as my old one. It misses hairs and takes twice the time to shave as my old one taking the Linear out of their line was a big mistake...</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes very good waterproof shavers and this one is no exception.It is lightweight and good looking.It gives you a   nice close shave and is easy to clean.Just put it under running tap water.  The only drawback is it dosen&#x27;t have worldwide voltage so it is not very useful if you travel overseas.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver because of its price.Believe me you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a better shaver at this price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver back in 2009 for $23.95.  That means the price has over tripled!!!  Wait for Black Friday or Christmas!!! lol.</li>
            <li> This shaver actually the second one that I bought. the first one i bought about 5 years ago and recently broken. Since I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, so I became the return customer. But if you want to play heavy duty, you may search for triple heads products.</li>
            <li> i want more powerfull for this shaver    but whatever that work fine.    easy to use, easy to clean.   y recommend this.</li>
            <li> After about a month of shaving with the Panasonic ES4026NC, I consider it a good value.  The shaver shaves close and is quiet, which were my most important considerations.  I have  an angular face with prominent cheek and jaw bones and a pointed chin.  Other shavers do   not shave as close around my chin and jaw bone structure.  I also like the ability to rinse  the shaver clean.  The only thing I do not like about the shaver is the bright yellow trim.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and the first time he tried to use it he got two huge nicks in his neck. He complains that its slow to shave with and hurts. He keeps trying to use it though. Last time he only got a small nick. A very disappointing buy.</li>
            <li> I had never before had an electric razor that was designed for use in the shower and with shaving soap.  I always used a blade razor.  I was very surprised at how close the wet shave was with this electric razor, and also surprised about how little skin irritation I experienced (virtually none).  The shaver is light, holds charge for 4-5 shaves, and is easy to clean.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these for my teenage boys for Christmas. They really seem to like them. They can shave everyday if they want and dont have to worry about razors and shaving cream. Plus they can use them in the shower and cleaning is simple. Not sure how it stacks up to more expensive electrics but for the price they are perfect for teenage boys.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who has a thick beard, and he loves it.  It stays in its charging station until you need it, so there are no wires to mess with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade guy all my life (30+ years of shaving).  I&#x27;ve heard that electric never gets as close as a blade.  This is still true.  I found that this shaver was an OK first cut, followed by a little touch up in the shower with the blade worked great.  The advantages were several: 1) Warm and dry using the electric shaver, no rude cold water splash in the morning 2) regular blades last for a long, long time when used for touch up 3) I can do the touch up in the nice warm shower 4) At about 2 bucks a blade,this two prong method is much cheaper than just blades and much better than just the electric shaver (in fact its as good as blades).  This shaver is waterproof and ok in the shower, but it still functions better on a stiff dry beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 2012:  The battery has rapidly declined in the last two months.  Now I need to keep it on the charger daily rather than charging it once every 5 days or so.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd ES4026NC Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve bought in 3 years. Not because they break, but because at this price, it&#x27;s more economical to replace the entire shaver than it is to buy replacement blades. It provides a comfortable shave, and does a good job, providing you don&#x27;t let your beard grow longer than about 2 or 3 days. I&#x27;ll continue to buy them every year until they are no longer available.</li>
            <li> I got this neat little razor from my mother in law for Xmas. I came across this Panasonic ES4026NC Wet Dry Shaver on Amazon. Let me tell you something, this things shaves as good as the more expensive electric shavers and just almost as good as a straight razor. This razor shaves really close (I use regular Barbasol shaving cream.) Just put enought on your face to barely cover it and don&#x27;t over due it. Just a dab will do and wet the blades before shaving and let me tell you, for this price, it ROCKS!!! You will wind up with a really close,smooth face and your boss(your wife) will love you for it. Also, it keeps a charge a loooong time and shaves about 7 times before it needs recharging. Also, use creams and not jels for shaving. Shaving cream is the best. Thanks for reading and happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Although the product works in the shower- the shave is quite rough especially the first few uses.  It recommends only using shave foam not gel so that is a bit odd but even with that option there is still significant post razor burn even when using it wet. After the first three uses it is still no match for a regular razor but i will see how it goes for a whole week and then make a final decision.</li>
            <li> I grow a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 5 o&#x27;clock when I shave with a regular razor. My skin is also fairly sensitive and can get irritated quickly. This razor is GREAT. I&#x27;ve already suggested it and had another buddy of mine buy it as well. It keeps my face smooth and bump free. Using it while showering makes a HUGE difference. The shave is smoother. It is very easy to clean and an overall great deal!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.Easy to clean,my only complaint is thar it tends to leave a few of the longer whiskers.</li>
            <li> The best shaver I have ever own, I was shaving with Brown and there is no comparison, this shaver is less noise and shaves a lot closer. The only objection is the battery charging time and not being cord cordless as the Brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a year now. I use it as a preliminary shave to save wear on my Gillette Fusion blades. The blades last for six months now instead of two. Over time this $20 razor will save me significant bucks.  The Panasonic doesn&#x27;t shave that close but it gets rid of 90% of the beard. It&#x27;s fast and pleasant to use. I shave dry and the battery needs recharging once every two weeks. You have to make sure the red light goes on when re-charging or it won&#x27;t charge. It should show a green light when fully charged but doesn&#x27;t. I also take it camping with me so I don&#x27;t nick myself when shaving without a mirror.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a Norelco rotary-head shaver. Doesn&#x27;t work well as a wet shaver; the foil screen becomes clogged with shaving cream. Might be a good shaver for beginners with soft beards but not for those who have shaved for years and have tough beards. I will probably use this shaver only when I travel.</li>
            <li> This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well..I will keep it handy for short trips or for an emergency trim..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic wet/dry for years and it works well with a blade while your face is wet and covered with foam/gel and the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more so this is a replacement with a much higher rpm for better efficiency.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my Braun shaver after I lost the charger. Feels cheap. It is very quiet but I guess that also makes me feel like it is not doing the job. Any hairs longer than a day or two growth does not get touched. Just not doing the trick for me.  Wish I would have stuck with the Braun brand.</li>
            <li> This is my second shaver of this model. Had a older Panasonic wet and dry that lasted until the battery wore out. This one is also so good that I purchased a back up for trips. For the money it is a great buy!!</li>
            <li> I have use this product Panasonic ES4026NC Shaver for three weeks. The rechargeable battery last longer than I thought. I only charge once when I got it at the begging and it&#x27;s been three weeks I have not charge for second time yet. My previous Panasonic shaver I have used for 10 years. I like this brand.</li>
            <li> for what i paid for it, it does the job decently. i have to use the trimmer on my hard-to-reach neck hairs thought, at first that was annoying, but ive gotten use to it. ..i also wish it had a cord..its pretty good i guess</li>
            <li> Since there are only 2 foil cutters, this razor works best on short hairs -- maybe one or two days worth of beard/moustache growth. This razor works great when shaving every day or every other day. When hairs are longer and tend to not get in the tiny holes of the foil as easily, this razor lacks a trimming type of cutter between the foils which I had on a previous Panasonic electric razor. Yes, you can use the trimmer on the backside and then resume regular shaving, but that&#x27;s a 2-step process versus the 1-step I was used to with my previous razor.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic wet/dry ES4026NC has never charged for me.  I&#x27;ve never been able to shave with it.  When I called the service center I was instructed to send it to Texas to subsequently receive a reconditioned model. I&#x27;ve never created a review for any previous Amazon purchase; this is my first.    \\&quot;Dissatisfied in Grand Rapids Michigan\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It would be even better if it had one of these two features:    Battery indicator light    of    Corded power charger    This is my 3rd Panasonic electric shaver.  They are usually great at performing their main task (shaving) but if you are not careful, you may be surprised running out of battery before you are done shaving. Having a corded power adapter (like Braun) or a simple LED battery indicator would make this a perfect product.</li>
            <li> Bought this one as a backup, I&#x27;ve been using this model for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> I have had an electric shaver in the past- usually use one while traveling- just seems easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Panasonic ES4026, because my old electric shaver died, and I saw this on SALE.&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!! what a Surprise!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize it was a Wet/Dry Shaver before I got it home- so that was a BONUS as far as I was concerned...Upon Reading the User Instructions, I was surprised to read that it is recommended to use shave foam. OK I thought. and WOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is SO SMOOTH!!! It actually takes me less time to shave with this Panasonic ES4026 than with a regular razor and shave cream.  In the past, with an Electric Razor it would take nearly 2x as long, and still not get a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for a few little &#x27;red patches&#x27; the first few days-- which is totally normal, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot be Beat, would say especially for the price, but seriously - CANNOT BE BEAT!</li>
            <li> These are an excellent shaver. I have one and gave one as a gift. Trouble free and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the more expensive Panasonic wet &amp; dry shavers...for over 15 years. This is the best shaver for the money, and it does just as good a job.</li>
            <li> if you are an every day shave man then this Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve is fro you. I use it in the shower each day. Grear shave remember to use some shower jell.[[ASIN:B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably gone through 4-5 of these shavers.  I use it daily in the shower with Dove soap. I have an average beard- not real heavy or light. Gives a good close shave without cuts or burns. If I skip shaving more than 2 days it takes a while longer to get a good shave.  Keep it on the charger when not in use and it always has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gold box deal and for $20, it is ok.  It does my cheeks fine.  It doesn&#x27;t do my neck at all and only does the chin mediocre.  I mostly use it dry and had an even more difficult time using it wet.  I&#x27;ve had to redo my neck with my Mach 3 frequently.  It&#x27;s good on light, non-course hair that isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive razor, it&#x27;s not bad.  I have been using it for about a month now and I have noticed that I frequently have whiskers that have been completely missed by the razor.  There are sections that do get a close shave, but the neckline is difficult and I feel like it takes a long time to get a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver rather than a replacement shaver head for my old Norelco. The shaver performs well, is simple to use, and does it all for minimum expense. Panasonic rarely disappoints, and this shaver certainly has satisfied me in every way.</li>
            <li> It shaves not as clean as the Norelco one it replaced. The surface is not big enough?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited many, many years &amp; have read many, many reviews, as well as as asking friends &amp; family about which electric razor to purchase. After several recommendations I chose this razor. Much to my disappointment, the razor did not do the job AT ALL. Not only did it not shave my beard (which is not a tough beard) it CUT me! Needless to say I&#x27;ve returned the razor &amp; am back to my $5 disposable!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver doesn&#x27;t perform as expected. This shaves partially not removing all the hairs and results with little scratchs on the face.</li>
            <li> The manafacturer tells the consumer to wait several weeks to become accustomed to this razor, however the blades of this shaver tore up my neck and I was very uncomfortable until I stopped using the razor.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my cheapo Braun that lasted for more than 8ys but no longer held a charge. What a POS this is starting with the adapter to charge. Who came up with this design? No indicator for fully charged or not. The cutting power is pathetic, I didnt think that is was fully charged the 1st time using. After a few weeks, tore the foil because I need to apply so much pressure to get a \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave. The replacement costs of the foil nearly as much as the shaver itself. No thanks. I spent a few more bucks and just got the Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve, far superior.</li>
            <li> First off let me state, I have Parkinson&#x27;s and normal blade shaving has taken on An Ancient Chinese Custom of slitting ones throat, ears not to be excluded. I had a Remmington Foil Head shaver, a Christmas gift. I tried using it with Jergens Hand Cream to ease the drag, and got wonderful results. Cleaning the shaver under water, finished that. This Panasonic Wet/Dry fits my needs for a smooth shave and it&#x27;s easy clean under running water. The only thing that baffles me is why the red light for charging, doesn&#x27;t turn green when fully charged.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this razor, BUT!  I am having a hard time getting a close shave.  I have a very light beard and the shaver leaves a lot behind.  The instructions say give the razor at least one month for your beard to adjust.  I am close to the one month.  I use it mostly dry and they suggest shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would like, but that may just be typical of electric shavers.</li>
            <li> OK - for the same price as a replacement blade/foil for my previous shaver, the decision to buy the Panasonic Pro Curve was a no-brainer. Now after using for about a month, I have no regrets. Nice, close, comfortable shave. If the cost was $150 then the review may have been less than 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve never seen a wet/dry rechargable shaver this affordable - the value is awesome. Plus, as a bonus, the trimmer works very well. Why are you wasting your time reading all these reviews? Get it - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The machine works as advertised. The only thing that you might want to change is the bag that comes with it (it doesn&#x27;t hold the machine very well). Apart from that, I can&#x27;t say anything except that I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I only use it on infrequently.  It is not as close as a razor but I did not expect it to be.  Seems to hold its charge for at least a couple of weeks. I had an older version which I liked better.  I found this unit to be a little large and as such harder to manuver.  I don&#x27;t think I would like this unit if I used it every day.  The heads do not float which I think also makes it a little harder to use.    I purchased this model because I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The shaving quality can not compete with my previous Braun shaver unless you use some shaving gel. I got it for under $15; so, excellent value. The only disappointing part is that it can not be used corded; once no battery charge, you are stuck!</li>
            <li> This is a great little razor. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t tear up my neck. Doesn&#x27;t work as well wet(for me).</li>
            <li> This shaver misses a lot of hairs on each pass, so you must go over each area several times. Even then, the shave is not very close. As a comparison, my Braun travel shaver cuts closer and quicker. The problem may just be the size and shape of the foil holes.  Hard to complain too much as I paid only $30, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  It is adequate as a back up shaver only, perhaps for your gym bag.</li>
            <li> i though that this item would work for me but i disliked its performace and order a different one later on</li>
            <li> What a terrific shaver! I used a blade razor for years and switched to an  electric dry shaver about 15 years ago because my face just couldn&#x27;t take the burning and abrasion of the razor blade, sometimes having to shave twice a day. I purchased my Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver after reading the reviews, and I&#x27;m certainly pleased with it. I use it wet and it gives me a faster shave than my old electric shaver and afterward my face feels as smooth as it did when I used a blade razor -- only no razor burn. After a few shaves, I was so pleased, that I ordered another Panasonic ES4026NC for my son, who has a heavier beard than mine, and has never found a dry electric shaver adequate for his beard.</li>
            <li> I use this electric shaver after i use schick or gillette blades which seem to have trouble with certain areas of my face especially around my lips.  Charge lasts numerous shaves. I do not like using this product in the shower, it pulls my skin too much.  It works better on dry skin.  Good on my chest too.  I don&#x27;t know why the price is so high now, I paid about $40.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great value at the sale price. Maybe not so great at list price.    My beard is coarse and wiry, with medium thickness and with 2 days growth this unit gave a comfortable if not super close shave (I use it dry).  But I have yet to find an electric that shaves as close as a blade.  It does require several passes to get all of the hairs so the 3 minute shave time turns into about 5 or 6 which eats into the already short battery life.    I have not experienced any of the tearing or cutting that some reviewers describe. In fact, this unit is one of the more comfortable electrics I have used compared to more expensive Norelco rotary, Braun and older Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> I picked this up right before Christmas on sale. While I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a capable razor for some men, if your beard is particularly thick, look elsewhere. Even after just a few days of growth, I found it unable to shave my beard sufficiently. The way I see it, when I have to go over my face with a regular razor after I&#x27;ve used an electric razor, the razor become unnecessary. For people with thin/regular beards or more moderate growth who shave every single day (twice?), the Pro Curve would probably do a serviceable job, but it&#x27;s not a good match for me. It gets points for being usable in the shower, good battery life and having a pretty decent trimmer, but even at that it barely musters a two-star rating.</li>
            <li> This is simply one of the best electric razors out there for the price.  It is relatively inexpensive, yet performs much the same as some of the very pricey, very upscale products.  Up until now, I&#x27;ve always used a Norelco rotary head razor.  After my last one started wearing out (needed battery and blades) it seemed easier to just replace it altogether.  I saw the Panasonic and bought it and it has been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the box?&lt;br /&gt;* Shaver&lt;br /&gt;* Charger&lt;br /&gt;* Carrying bag&lt;br /&gt;* Instruction manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the shaver for about a month and it provides a very nice, close shave leaving my skin smooth.  It performs well wet or dry and holds a charge much the same as my Norelco did.  The initial charge takes a few hours.  After that it charges fairly quickly.  The battery charge lasts a little over a week or so for me (I shave once, occasionally twice, each day).  When the battery runs down I put it in the charger base when I leave for work and its ready when I get home again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it dry, with some \\&quot;pre-shave&#x27;, and with shave gel. It performs well in all applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;* Provides nice smooth shave in both wet and dry applications.&lt;br /&gt;* Decent charge time and battery usage (about the same as a Norelco rotary shaver).&lt;br /&gt;* Very easy to clean, and because its meant for wet usage, it can be easily rinsed as well.&lt;br /&gt;* Exceptional price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;* The charger design could be better.  Instead of being an adapter type with a cord the Panasonic charger is a small base.  The shaver sits in the base, with the base plugged into a wall outlet.  This means:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The shaver cannot be used while it is charging since its sitting in the base against a wall outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  You must plug the charger into the upper outlet on a receptacle to avoid obstructing access to the lower receptacle on your wall outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I do not find this to be a huge deal, but I do prefer the convenience of being able to use a shaver on a corded charger in case I need to shave when the shaver battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this shaver and its well worth the price.  The performance is great.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the charger design.e shaver battery is dead.      Overall, I really like this shaver and its well worth the price.  The performance is great.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the charger design.</li>
            <li> The only thing that happened with this electric razor was I got razor burn on my neck.  No hair was cut at all!!!</li>
            <li> This panasonic shaver is the best shaver i&#x27;ve ever owned. I like that it is a wet and dry shaver. I would highly recommend it to every one.  Bill V.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a nice job.  It isn&#x27;t one of the high RPM shavers or triple-floating head shavers in the current generation, but it is just as effective.</li>
            <li> We have had this one for over 6 years and it still works.  Our other ones have long sinced died.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this as i thought it would be quite convenient to have an electric razor to speed up the whole tedious process of shaving. To my dismay, the blades just do not shave anything on my face no matter what. I resorted to using the edger blade to shave. The whole process would take longer than using a normal non electric shaving blade.</li>
            <li> Pros.  Ergonomic design. Quite operation.  Easy clean up with soap and water.  Cons.  No cord for shaving when the battery is dead.  Inadequate performance for long bear growth or course beard hair.  If you shave daily and don&#x27;t have course beard hair this shaver will likely be a keeper.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to make a selection for the item I wanted and was extremely satisfied with the way my purchase was handled, especially in being informed several times of the stage the process was at. I have since returned to amazon for another purchase.I found it very convenient to just deal with Amazon and not the seller.</li>
            <li> Best shaver to get at such a low price!  The design of this shaver is extremely functional with an ideal cutting area that&#x27;s easy to maneuver around your face whether you&#x27;re trimming a beard, shaving around a beard, or just shaving your entire face.  Easy and comfortable to hold, the shaver holds a charge very well, is quiet, and shaves nice and close.  The Panasonic line offers the option of a wet shave, including shaving with a foam or gel.  I&#x27;ve found you get the most lubrication and closest shave using a gel such as Edge, but a dry shave is almost as close and smooth.  The pop-up edge trimmer works well and is easy to use.  The charger base is about the size of a wall adapter, plugs directly into the outlet, and the shaver sits directly on top of the charger, so it&#x27;s best used in the top outlet of a receptacle.  I think you&#x27;ll be very happy with the choice of this shaver.  The price and quality can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I have tried it twice already Dry and Wet(with Shaving Gel), and both shaves have been very painful. At this moment I have major skin burns and cuts on my chin. Had to go back and do the neckline using my conventional rajor. Its more like buying pain .. no matter how good a deal it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and inexpensive.  Not too good doing your beard.  Good as a spare or for travel but I&#x27;m not sure if it can be charged on 220-volt outlet.  It is not marked on the charging base.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a Benfini Salons shaver this past Christmas. I had never used an electric shaver before, but always wanted to try one. I found it to work fairly well, but not as close as a blade. But I liked the idea of the electric, so I then began reading reviews of other shavers to consider buying a better one. I discovered that this Benfini shaver appears to be the Panasonic ES4026NC with some minor cosmetic changes. In reading about the Panasonic, I learned that it could be used in the shower, which the instructions for the Benfini version did not mention. Wow! I get a terrific shave in the shower with a little shampoo smeared on my face first. I truly get just as close as a blade, with just a few passes, except in some areas under my jaw and right on the jaw line. If I try too hard to get those areas as baby smooth as the rest of my face, I do get some razor burn. For these reasons, I can not give it five stars, but it comes close (less close if used as a dry shaver). It cleans up easily under the shower head, and the battery holds a charge through several shaves. The price is great, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for about 4 months. I use it every other day and use a razor every other day. Don&#x27;t ask. :)    It only works well for me with one day&#x27;s worth of beard growth. For whatever reason not so well on 2 or more.    I still give it 5 stars because for the price and relative performance coupled with it being water proof it works fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor ever. I was in dire need of one so I am satisfied with the performance of this newly attained electronic equipment. At the moment I have not used it while wet, but the functions for dry have proven as good as it said it would be. It leaves my skin very clean but I live at a military academy so it behooves me to follow through with a regular bladed razor to get the closest shave ever. either way it helps tremendously being that my faciar hair grows pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I only have this 3 weeks so maybe it is premature. But not as good as other razors I have hadmainly due to poorness with 2-3 day beards. Tried in shower with shaving cream and did not work well</li>
            <li> Has nice features and works fine as long as you haven&#x27;t let your whiskers grow too long. The flip up feature is too small to do any amount of long whisker shaving and the main doesn&#x27;t do the job very well on longer growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is an issue with this particular product or with electric shavers in general, but it does a bad job if you have slightly longer hair. It works OK if you have smaller hair. I wouldn&#x27;t bother wasting your money on it. Best thing to do is find a buddy who has an electric shaver and see if he&#x27;ll let you test it out. If you like how it works on your face you can buy one just like it. Otherwise, stick with regular razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old son who just started shaving and only has some peach fuzz, but he said it dosen&#x27;t work that great.  Maybe its meant for more mature whiskers, not sure.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for several months - and it is a hassle to shave, it misses hairs and takes forever. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This razor is the worse one I have ever owned, (ES4026 Panasonic).  I also had an el cheapo Panasonic prior to this one.  It worked ok for a while, but wore out also.  Anyway, I am trying another brand now.  (Another el cheapo but it cannot be ny worse than this one) for sure.  Branded</li>
            <li> My father has a single blade Panasonic that worked so well I decided to purchase this one.    I have a very heavy beard and it does a decent job, but I have some really fine hairs on my neck and they just seem to lay down.    I find myself having to touch up with a blade, and every few days I have to use a blade to get everything really clean.    It works, but it has not eliminated having to shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> The performance depends heavily on how long you wait to shave    ONE day - excellent - compares very favorably with norelco rotary that sells for four times as much.  If you shave every day this razor is great.  TWO days - good - may leave a wild hair or two and takes a few extra passes to get close  THREE days - USELESS - you might as well go rub your face on the driveway until your beard wears off. This razor won&#x27;t touch any hairs longer than about 1/16\\&quot;</li>
            <li> razor fits nicely in my hand; angle of cutting heads works well; works best with shaving lather, but not necessary day to day.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with the processing time.  This is the second item that I ordered through Amazon. Each free delivery order was received within three days.  The razor is in excellent condition and works great.</li>
            <li> If your the type of person who shaves everyday this razor does its job if your like me and only shave a few times a week it just wont cut  hairs longer than daily stubble</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers since I was 16 yo and I am always in the market for a great shaver.  I purchased this shaver as a back up, just in case.  Having owned this shaver for about a month now, I have to say it is very good.  The shaver is very quiet and it tends to cut pretty close.  It feels sturdy, not like some cheap shavers that are just plastic.  This thing seems pretty solid.  I was pleasantly surprised with this shaver.  I&#x27;m still somewhat of a Braun guy and I think they make the best overall electric shavers, but this Panasonic is good.  And for the price (around $30 at the time of purchase) it&#x27;s almost impossible to find a better deal.</li>
            <li> This is a good backup shaver but we all know you can&#x27;t beat a razor!</li>
            <li> blades  don&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li> The shaver came in very handy while I was away on a missions trip. Very durable and dependable. I only had to recharge it once. The grip, sound and feel of the shaver was very comfortable. It is also easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet yet. I have no regrets purchasing it and would highly suggest for anyone to purchase this shaver especially if your looking for a good one with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and I need a slim electric razor with a trimmer to trim my beard and shave the areas where I don&#x27;t want the beard to be.  The Panasonic ES4026NC Men&#x27;s Shaver fits my requirements very well, and the price is right.  It doesn&#x27;t shave stubble that has grown more that two days very well - you need a rotary shaver for that.  But a rotary shaver is too big to get into many of the areas where I want to shave.  I bought it from Amazon, and their service in getting it too me was great.  Also I like reading their user reviews to help me select the product that fits my needs.</li>
            <li> My friend had been looking for a replacement for her perfect wet/dry shaver. Department stores told her they no longer carry the shaver. I decided I would do a  search and I found this. She is delighted, turns out to be the exact same shaver she has! Another positive fact, this shaver is perfect for women as well as men.</li>
            <li> I have had only Braun shavers for the past 15 or so years and finally dropped my last one on the concrete floor in the garage.  With the prospect spending over $100 for a similar Braun unit, I started searching Amazon and came across this model.  The reviews seemed very positive so I decided to give it a try.  It is very basic compared to my old Braun (no pivoting head, can&#x27;t use it while plugged in) but other than that it shaves just as well.  I also like being able to rinse it under the tap to get out all the beard trimmings.  I priced out replacement blades and screen and was a bit surprised to see the price was about the same as buying the whole unit again.  When the time comes to replace those parts I will just buy another shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good shaver that proves you don&#x27;t have to pay $100 or more to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> My last electric was one of the expensive Panasonic Linear razors and while I really liked that razor it died after about 3 years of use. I decided to replace it with this razor as opposed to a more expensive model after reading the reviews and I will say that I have not been disappointed. While there is a noticeable difference in the speed of the razor (mostly noticeable by the decreased volume of the motor), it works great for daily shaving. I am hoping this quality of shave holds up as the blades dull a little bit. Works well in the shower, small, lightweight, convenient. Great razor for the price and even if it only lasts half as long as my last razor it will still be a very good deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver for my husband.He wanted something for a wet and dry shave.I don&#x27;t know much about shavers, but his dislike of this shaver was bad!!!It may work for some ,but not for him.</li>
            <li> I have had several electric razors,Norelco triple heads and a Braun foil one most recently. This razor puts them to shame.Almost as good as a blade,no kidding. This razor rocks!</li>
            <li> This shaver is not efficient, even for light facial hair. It takes twice as long as my $19 Remington XT100</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for a decade and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price. Work very well! Bought  2 for teens. They work GREAT (a quote) Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it (much better than the ones with spiral blades). The only issue is the recharger takes up space in the bathroom...other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have had the 4025 for a few years now, which is the same unit before it went with the yellow.  I have been using this in addition to another electric.  It gets into the tight spots the larger head can&#x27;t without doing damage to my mustache or beard.  While you do have to plan ahead to keep it charged and it won&#x27;t cut the longer hairs, it takes care of the short stubble and doesn&#x27;t leave you with razor burn.  It&#x27;s holding up very well.  I bought a second one, since it was cheaper than the replacement blades and screens, but ended up giving that one to my son.  I finally bought the replacement parts since it appears this is not currently in production.  If it does come back I highly recommend this to beard and mustache owners as a second shaver for the close areas.  I tried using my dual blade Remington and Braun shavers but end up wacking something that didn&#x27;t need trimming and regretting not using this little beauty to do the job.</li>
            <li> Not the best razor, but the battery holds its charge, gets the job done, and isn&#x27;t too expensive.  Decent product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last too long. Work ok. Not a very close shave but good for days when no time for a razor.</li>
            <li> Accustomed to a Norelco, I quickly learned that I had to abandon the rotational method for straight strokes.  Using a gel is best and, in a matter of days, I am getting superior results and this at a really low price.  I wish I had ordered 2 at the $20 and pennies price to have a backup when the heads wear down.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using this shaver and would do it all over again. Very satisfied, and comes completely as advertised. Wish I would have gotten it sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought the previous model (ES4026) about 5 years ago when I just started shaving and it was a great razor.  I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy, so I can&#x27;t talk for those who are, but it gave me a great a shave.  Someone decided be weird and steal it from work, so I bought this one a couple of months ago.  After using this one, I realize the blade on my old one dulled out a bit. Just like the last one, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this one.  It works great on my face and chest.  I usually use the trimmer to get the big hairs and the buzzer to get close.  As far as cleaning, the top pops right off and it can be rinsed for an easy clean.  I use it about every other day and charge it once every 3 or 4 days for an hour. It&#x27;s definitely a perfect purchase if you&#x27;re new to shaving or an occasional shaver and you don&#x27;t want to spend much money.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a new shaver and when it got to my house IT WAS BROKE. It held a charge for the for one shave and never recharged again. I was so pissed off that I threw it away. I can&#x27;t say that the seller was bad because I didn&#x27;t even attempt to return it and give them a chance to fix but point of story....GARBAGE. Do not buy this razer</li>
            <li> If you shave every day it provides a pretty good shave and the ability to go \\&quot;wet\\&quot; is a nice option. If you wait longer than a day to shave, it doesn&#x27;t work well at all and leaves a lot of hairs behind no matter how many times you go over them.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Within months of purchasing, the charging dock failed. Fortunately, I had another charging dock from a razor that had broken prior. While it does work, it doesn&#x27;t do it well. I have straight hair and keep it short but even then the razor still leaves a lot of hairs untouched. This means a lot of time wasted on running the razor over the same spot repeatedly. I would rather not think of how poorly this would work if I had curly hair. Definitely do not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> just cheap shaver it is ok don&#x27;t expect any better things</li>
            <li> Works great and stay charged for 5 or 6 days.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver does a decent job and quit burning my skin after about 2 weeks. The electric motor sounds run down after only a few shaves and I would recommend leaving it plugged in after use.</li>
            <li> Shaves okay.  There is no charging cord.  Instead, the charger plugs into an outlet and the shaver must be inserted into charger.  Might be a little challenging for some.  Make sure your bathroom electrical outlet is vertically oriented.</li>
            <li> $30 for an electric shaver is a bargain - it&#x27;s easy to spend $100 or more. I was skeptical that the quality wouldn&#x27;t be there but actually it&#x27;s just as good as the Braun I replaced. I love the wet shaving feature which I find considerably better than dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the charger isn&#x27;t very sensibly designed - it mounts the shaver directly into the socket. This is problem in standard US sockets where the female side is vertical so the shaver falls out. Why they didn&#x27;t just use a cord like every other shaver out there, we&#x27;ll never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My Remington rotary shavers are a few years old so I thought I&#x27;d try something new. I&#x27;ve used foil type electrics before and not been happy. This was the worst. If you don&#x27;t shave every day this is not the shaver for you in as it has difficulty with longer stubble. Also if you are used to any kind of rotary, you will probably find this very awkward to handle by comparison. My 5 year old Reminton gives a far closer shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is a great value. It gives a decently close shave with just a few passes. The foils are comfortable and flex nicely. The pop up trimming attachment is a good length and works ok for cleaning up the edges of my beard and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my cheap old remington microscreen, this razor is excellent. It fits comfortably in my hand and aesthetically, has a sporty look. The battery life is amazing. Out of the box, it holds a decent charge for over a week. Please note that the charging stand requires enough space above the outlet to allow the razor to fit. The charging stand plugs into the outlet and the razor sits on top of the stand. I would have preferred a corded method, but this is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend more than $40 bucks on a razor, but still desire a decent, quick shaving method, get this razor. It&#x27;s a great value and a very good product. I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well. There&#x27;s always some beard left. and the trimmer is just literally a trimmer! But it worth the price I paid for it (35$).</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a nephew in the service stationed overseas.  He needed something rechargeable and all that good stuff that you need when far from home and needing a shave.  He said it worked great and he still uses it.  I&#x27;d buy it again,</li>
            <li> Got it for the 16 year old son and he loves it, (so do I on occasion when I get lazy). I have sensitive skin and it is a smooth shave dry, have not tried wet. The one downfall is the charger mount is a direct fit to outlet. (cord would be nice). But it does fit tightly and has not fell out of outlet, had it for a year now,(knock on wood).</li>
            <li> I have purchase three of these razors.  The first one I bought for my grandson who had just started shaving.  His father liked it so much, he began using it.  I bought the dad one for his very own.  I haven&#x27;t heard any complains so far.</li>
            <li> The build quality and the battery life all seemed fine, but honestly, this razor just never worked for me.  It tended to pull my hair and leave razor burn.  maybe this would be good for people with thinner beards?  Maybe I&#x27;ll try this on my head when it&#x27;s time to go that route.  I could see it working a lot better for that.</li>
            <li> Might as well donate your money to a charity as waste it buying this razor.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cut your beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this from amazon a couple of years ago. Decided to throw it out at last today. The foil is thick and so the shaver misses hairs and also cuts very poorly. I have a Braun battery operated 17 dollar shaver which work ten times better.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver right here on Amazon in June 2009. It has done an admiral job, although I found that I get a much closer shave using it dry vs. wet. The issue for me is one of longevity. The first electric razor I bought lasted 20 years. The next lasted 10 years. This one is wearing out rapidly after just 4. Maybe I&#x27;m showing my age, but my old beat up Remington could be repaired easily and cheaply back in the day. The batteries are about shot in this Panasonic and it could definitely use new blades. The problem is, as I am sure many of you know, it costs nearly as much for just one replacement part as it does to buy a whole new razor, let alone multiple parts. This pricing structure is deliberate so as to assure a steady supply of repeat customers for new product. I think it&#x27;s kind of funny that some of the same companies spending fortunes telling us how \\&quot;green\\&quot; they are have pricing policies for replacement parts that encourage us to throw stuff away and buy new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll climb down off my soapbox now. Bottom line: It&#x27;s a good razor but won&#x27;t last (unless you&#x27;re young enough to think 4 years is a long time).</li>
            <li> Razor works well in wet and dry situations. Mostly all plastic but works great. I would recommend product to all.</li>
            <li> used this razor for a year or so.  it does a good job for the price. decided to buy another one instead of purchasing replacement blades, for it was just about the same price as of the new razor.  for the price it is a good deal.  fast shipping and overall a good deal.</li>
            <li> battery will not take a charge.  I did like it when it worked.  Don&#x27;t know where to get a new battery</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for $19.99 4 years ago. I guess the battery is dying and fully charged battery seems to last only one week now. I bought a Braun 760cc last week to replace my Panasonic and the new Braun 760cc which costs more than $100 doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my $19.99 Panasonic. I wish I could buy another Panasonic for $19.99...</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a gift three years ago. I broke it while on vacation due to careless packing. I am purchasing this unit again because I like it. Basically I&#x27;m sticking to what I know is comfortable to use, convenient and gives a good shave. In the three years I owned this model I have \\&quot;NO\\&quot; complaints what so ever. I also never had trouble with the battery, even when weak after not charging gave a good shave. For me best used daily, I found it doesn&#x27;t do good on a three day beard (Monday morning), but then its not a razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric shaver, and hate the rotary head style. I had a Panasonic Smooth Operator Men&#x27;s shaver in the 80&#x27;s and loved it.  It finally gave out after three years or so.  I thought I would give Panasonic another try, but they only seem to have these double head shavers.  It shaves as close as the old Panasonic, but the double heads cause me to miss single whiskers.  After a day ot two, I will find one lone whisker approaching the 1/4 to 1/3 inch length.  This is my only gripe about the double head system.  If you like a double head, this is a great shaver!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered promptly and what a surprise.  I have a tired Panasonic wet/dry razor that needed a new foil and cutter blades.  They would have cost me a great deal more than this razor.  It shaves as well as the expensive one.  It&#x27;s light, charges quickly, and shaves as well as my old Norelcos and the fancy Panasonic.  You can&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> I used the razor for one week, the instructions tell you to give it 30 days.  The shave was well below average for closeness and comfort.  If you are looking for an uncomfortable and stubbly shave, this is the product.  I have sent the razor back to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver has quiet operation, blade is sharp. It has a close shave and accommodates my face pretty well even the first time. An 8 hour charge will give me 7 shaves. However, the battery dies down without much notice. It&#x27;s a trouble if that&#x27;s in the middle of a shave. So it&#x27;s better to have another standby shaver. Also, since the you need to put the shaver on the charger, you can&#x27;t do anything until the charge is finished. One more thing, it has a NiCd battery, which has memory effect. The number of shave is going to decrease over time. Well, for a $[...] buck shaver, I don&#x27;t think we can expect much. We may buy another one two years from now if this product still exists.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. They said it has worked fine and does a good job so far</li>
            <li> This is used as a travel razor, it isn&#x27;t bad, but it is louder than the Braun my husband uses at home.</li>
            <li> It comes with everything you need; it&#x27;s easy to use and gentle on the face. But, it does not give a close shave no matter how many times I go back and forth over areas. I feel like it leaves me with the equivalent of about 12 hours growth after a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that many reviewers have said that it does give a close shave- It must depend on what you&#x27;re used to. This was my first experience with an electric shaver. I normally use a 5 blade \\&quot;sensor\\&quot; hand held razor so maybe my idea of a close shave is different from what you look for in an electric model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This razor is slow.  And it is very poor at picking up the whiskers that grow at angle close to your face.  The trimmer side will usually pick up those whiskers but not always easily either. So between using both I can get a half decent shave in 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got this razor as a gift in 2008 currently 2012 it has just started to get weak on a full charge so it was time to replace and review. I thought this was a cheap razor 35$ ish and that thet dont have replacement foil/blades (wrong on both) 4 years n I never replaced blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am not a daily electric shaver but maybe 3 a week. only complaint was the missed ocassional kooky neck hair (used trimmer) and now know why the shave would take a while 4 yr old blade. kinda bummed i got a brand new braun instead of 30$ for new blade.</li>
            <li> Had the razor for several years and liked the fact you could use it wet, a first in it&#x27;s time. However the good old blade made it look very bad and besides that it was a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago and use it every day and it works prefect. love this item and i don&#x27;t think other expensive brand works better than this....</li>
            <li> I love it and have been using it every morning over last 2 years with no single problem, refer it to anyone for this model AAA+++</li>
            <li> Hello, this does better than my Norelco - nearly blade closeness!!! Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> The shaver seems to have problems. It seems to pull hairs and hurts. I would not recommend unfortunately. Philips Norelco SensoTouch was far superior in its ability to cut close and feel comfortable. Recharging was easier before too with Norelco.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver a year and a half ago and paid $29. It&#x27;s now priced at $79. Who are they kidding? It&#x27;s a great shaver for $29 but not for $79. It does a good job if you shave every day, but if you miss a day or have some stray long whiskers, it&#x27;s not gonna get them. You have to use the trimmer. I&#x27;m also not pleased with the charging style. You have to sit it on top of the charger which plugs into the outlet. No chord means no use while charging. And, if it dies in the middle of a shave, you are SOL. Overall, I&#x27;ve been very please with it&#x27;s performance for what I paid, but now the price has more than doubled. I cannot recommend this razor at that price.</li>
            <li> great product, easy to use</li>
            <li> I tried this razor for a couple of weeks and could not get a decent shave. I used gel but that didn&#x27;t help. I finished shaving every morning with a regular type razor.</li>
