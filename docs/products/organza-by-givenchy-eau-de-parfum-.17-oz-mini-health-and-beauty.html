            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>The site was a ripoff (as were many).</li>
            <li>Have bought many times before.</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I Love, Love,Love it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear many perfumes, because they are too flowery or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This perfume in one of my favorite scents!1</li>
            <li>and I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Love to keep a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; of all my favorite fragrances on my dresser--not for use, just for display \\&quot;cause</li>
            <li>they are cute.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, but it is just so darn strong, so, just a drop or two will do it.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and vendor shipped to my home very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell and always get compliments on the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality fast shipping, high recommend</li>
            <li>i loved this, its so little and warming, her form its so practical to her use and her fragance its so intoxicating in good form</li>
            <li>Thought everything I ordered was free shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li>Please,please inform me when it is available again.</li>
            <li>Of course, the &#x27;gotcha&#x27; was that shoppers couldn&#x27;t get free shipping on &#x27;everything&#x27; if they used the 20% coupon.</li>
            <li>I like fragrances with a light spice in it.  </li>
            <li>Very intriguing scent.</li>
            <li>Smells delicious - however, a little too pricey for me!  </li>
            <li>When I received the package, I was excited.</li>
            <li>It is expensive, comes in a very attractive bottle, makes a nice gift.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see they sell small mini of this fabulous fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I really love perfumes and I&#x27;m collecting quite a few that develop beautifully on me; but it&#x27;s definitely hit or miss.  </li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>First, they sent out two, deceptive emails regarding their &#x27;savings&#x27;.</li>
            <li>first, rather than the largest size which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and this was my first time buying a fragrance on-line.</li>
            <li>I hadn´t use that parfum in a while, it is exactly as I remembered it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very disappointed...it smells like Fly-spray.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>never use this...Don&#x27;t think this is the real Givenchy.</li>
            <li>It  would definitely appeal to those who like a rich,  long-lasting&#x27; adult-like fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Also, I often develop one of the minor &amp;#34;notes&amp;#34;  (as listed by the perfume house) as the strong &amp;#34;top note.&amp;#34;  It keeps my collecting interesting and unpredictable.</li>
            <li>the small was nice</li>
            <li>Not as much as my regular Chanel No.5, but it sure runs a close second.</li>
            <li>One offered free shipping on everything, while the other offered 20% off all purchases.</li>
            <li>new Orgq&lt;</li>
            <li>A very classy perfume.</li>
            <li>Paid more than I wanted for something so small.  </li>
            <li>Givenchy perfumes are my all time favorite&#x27;s, and I have quite a few of their different perfumes.  </li>
            <li>the small one was so easy to carry with me on my vacation..............</li>
            <li>The amount received is very small and does not last long, so as good as it smells, probably not a great deal economically, but good perfume usually isn&#x27;t inexpensive!</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t a spray and you can barely shake the perfume out</li>
            <li>This fragrance almost has a faint smell of gardenia about it---but very light.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was.  Thought everything I ordered was free shipping and handling.  Paid more than I wanted for something so small.  Should have went to store here.</li>

            <li> This is an incredible scent on any woman. It has a soft subtle smell that is sensuous.</li>
            <li> good service and price</li>
            <li> The best smelling Parfum ever, very light. Stays with you for about two hours</li>
            <li> I love this. Its so hard to find. Please,please inform me when it is available again. Try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is light and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this fragrance for a relative off FragranceNet on Black Friday. The site was a ripoff (as were many). First, they sent out two, deceptive emails regarding their &#x27;savings&#x27;. One offered free shipping on everything, while the other offered 20% off all purchases. Happy to get these discounts, I went over to make the gift purchase! Of course, the &#x27;gotcha&#x27; was that shoppers couldn&#x27;t get free shipping on &#x27;everything&#x27; if they used the 20% coupon. Didn&#x27;t find this out until checkout. I probably won&#x27;t bother with them again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it! I knew it was going to be small. But I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be close to the size of a Lego peice. Vey disappointed!  And it doesn&#x27;t smell like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Great price. Have bought many times before. Will buy again. This fragrance is the one I get compliments on all the time</li>
            <li> Once again, not totally successful with my chemistry.  Of course this is why I&#x27;m trying samples whenever I can.  I really love perfumes and I&#x27;m collecting quite a few that develop beautifully on me; but it&#x27;s definitely hit or miss.  Also, I often develop one of the minor &amp;#34;notes&amp;#34;  (as listed by the perfume house) as the strong &amp;#34;top note.&amp;#34;  It keeps my collecting interesting and unpredictable.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my miniature collection. I love the shape of the bottle.  I have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> M&lt;br /&gt;T&#x27;y&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M&#x27;y new Orgq&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITSEEMED À LITTLE WEAK OR WATERD DOWN.  OR DOESN,t gavé thé portant y</li>
            <li> I caught the scent of this on a woman at an event I went to last year. Asked her what it was and searched it down. I Love, Love,Love it.  Not as much as my regular Chanel No.5, but it sure runs a close second. Very intriguing scent.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see they sell small mini of this fabulous fragrance.  I can&#x27;t wear many perfumes, because they are too flowery or overwhelming.  I like fragrances with a light spice in it.  This is a very classy and delicious smelling perfume</li>
            <li> I have loved and used this perfume for years. This is not the same. Very disappointed...it smells like Fly-spray.&lt;br /&gt;Will never use this...Don&#x27;t think this is the real Givenchy. Will be contacting Amazon about this horrible&lt;br /&gt;experience. I was looking forward to having this perfume that I loved. Luckily, because of some bad reviews&lt;br /&gt;and not knowing which online company at Amazon was selling the real thing, I decided to try the smallest test&lt;br /&gt;size first, rather than the largest size which is what I wanted. BUYER BEWARE this does not seem to be the REAL&lt;br /&gt;FRAGRANCE FROM GIVENCHY. I had gone to Macys and Sephora and neither had this in, so I went to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon and this was my first time buying a fragrance on-line. Never again. 1 star as one can&#x27;t give it less to post</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Very good quality fast shipping, high recommend</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, but it is just so darn strong, so, just a drop or two will do it.</li>
            <li> I hadn´t use that parfum in a while, it is exactly as I remembered it. Kind of cute de mini size.</li>

            <li> i loved this, its so little and warming, her form its so practical to her use and her fragance its so intoxicating in good form</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a sample of this perfume to see if it smelled good on my body. Scent is very nice</li>
            <li> Looks so much smaller than I thought. Smell is somehow diluted.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and I love it!  Not an overpowering scent.  Arrived when expected.  Great experience &amp; product!</li>
            <li> the bottle was so much larger than I expected so I was very pleasantly surprised...........the small one was so easy to carry with me on my vacation..............loved both of them!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and vendor shipped to my home very quickly.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t a spray and you can barely shake the perfume out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disappointing....but I keep it in my travel bag for when I leave home</li>
            <li> When I received the package, I was excited. This perfume in one of my favorite scents!1 People walk by and always asked what I scent I&#x27;m  wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to everyone. A very classy perfume.</li>
            <li> the small was nice what is the next size and price</li>
            <li> This is a spring, summer scent and I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> So little than my expects</li>
            <li> Love to keep a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; of all my favorite fragrances on my dresser--not for use, just for display \\&quot;cause they are cute.  This fragrance almost has a faint smell of gardenia about it---but very light.  Givenchy perfumes are my all time favorite&#x27;s, and I have quite a few of their different perfumes.  Great seller&#x27;s--thank you!</li>
