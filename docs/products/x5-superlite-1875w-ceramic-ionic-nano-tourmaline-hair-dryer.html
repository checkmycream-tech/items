            <li>Best for price and performance.</li>
            <li>Best hair dryer ever.</li>
            <li>I bought this well over a year ago and it works brilliantly.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer...</li>
            <li>update: have used the dryer every day for over a year, and it still works great with no problems.</li>
            <li>Love it, best I&#x27;ve had..</li>
            <li>Excellent dryer - does not get too hot, but perfectly dries the hair.</li>
            <li>and hopefully that will be good for her.</li>
            <li>They loved the units, but could not in good conscience continue to sell them.</li>
            <li>Otherwise an excellent hair dryer that fit my criteria.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using this dryer every day for a week - don&#x27;t know about the ceramic &amp; tourmaline features but am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Good for any type hair, but great for curly hair, or fine hair that needs protection from overblowing.</li>
            <li>i love it!  </li>
            <li>You WILL love it!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be so glad you purchased this!</li>
            <li>nice and</li>
            <li>nice that I bought One for my daughter-</li>
            <li>This dryer doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair and dries it quickly and beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this hair dryer for 3 years and its still going strong!</li>
            <li>dryer is very light</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The best part is how quiet it is!</li>
            <li>Definitely the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one to keep at my parents house when I visit - that&#x27;s how great this is!</li>
            <li>My hair is in much better condition after using it as well.</li>
            <li>After going on a trip with a friend she fell in love with it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>They are very light weight but do a very good job at drying with different drying levels to choose from.</li>
            <li>So I love that I am free from that aggravation now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to walk out the door quickly, would be happy with the performance of this dryer.</li>
            <li>Love my new blow dryer, works great and hair drys so much faster!</li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair with a extensions.</li>
            <li>Extremely light, reliable and longevity.  </li>
            <li>Has to be light.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this costly hair dryer because it was professional grade, light weight, and had a seemly good WARRANTY.</li>
            <li>In any case, it does more than a good enough job for home use.</li>
            <li>It is super light for it&#x27;s size and the buttons are easy to reach.</li>
            <li>this has long cord so great for hairstylist.</li>
            <li>and so then the reality is that as long as the hair dryer works you are in great shape...if you have a problem you might as well throw it away as there is no way to get it repaired...</li>
            <li>with several heat settings it is perfect to dry my mom&amp;#34;s hair (she is 101) and do a quick job on my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent hairdryer for professional or personal use.  </li>
            <li>The coolest temp setting is great to use after my hair is dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever own, dries my thick hair super fast</li>
            <li>Actually, my old one came out warm</li>
            <li>and I just want to cool off.  </li>
            <li>I disagree because a light hair dryer was EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super light and fast.</li>
            <li>Got three hot, warm, cool and three different blow intensity options as well.</li>
            <li>I have searching for the right hair dryer with a diffuser for my thin curly hair, I&#x27;ve found the perfect answer.</li>
            <li>very light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a nice diffuser and a few buttons: one for heat setting (hot, warm, cool) and fan setting (low, med, high).</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the dryer and recommend it.</li>
            <li>nice and lightweight your arm is not tired out when hair is finally dry.  </li>
            <li>so I am not sure if it&#x27;s good for styling yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 1875&#x27;s light weight &amp; smaller plug is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I really like all of the features and color because its sort of beige and blends in with the bathroom decor but the ion doesn&#x27;t turn off.  </li>
            <li>Since I wash my hair every day,  I am very picky about the hair dryer I buy.</li>
            <li>I really like this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to a speedier, quieter, lighter-weight blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>It replaced an old big box store one that had seen better</li>
            <li>This would get a full 5 stars but it&#x27;s really big.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particular about protecting my ears and a lot of high end hair dryers</li>
            <li>I tried the compact version with all the exact same features, but it did not produce the same smooth and shiny results.</li>
            <li>so I paid a little more bucks to prevent the damage.</li>
            <li>This dyer is so quiet and leaves my  hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use the high and cool button and it really does come out cool, not warm like my old one.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just itching to buy something new since I haven&#x27;t had to buy any hair care tools in over 5 years.</li>
            <li>, I expected it to be a salon quality for the price, but I actually got a better one at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>so it looks a little bit cheap</li>
            <li>So far the rocker buttons don&#x27;t seem to be a problem (getting in the way or accidentally switching off).</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s so much easier to hold than my last one.</li>
            <li>However, it feels as though its a cheap plastic material and a few times I&#x27;ve dropped it and cringed in anticipation of a crack, but it hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li>are really loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it almost every day the past 6 years and it dries very quickly and is not so loud.</li>
            <li>For now it seems that it does dry them without as much frizz.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 90-yr old Grandma because her dryer was just too big for her to handle.</li>
            <li>I only used this hair dryer for drying purpose so far</li>
            <li>Needed a dryer with power in low/warm settings and knew the 1200w travel version had a little more speed in low than other dryers its size.</li>
            <li>It does not dry it faster but that just might be my hair and the settings I use and something I&#x27;ll always deal with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was not as good as my less expensive one</li>
            <li>note, some people may be wary because its SO light that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a professional hair dryer.</li>

            <li> But it works very well to tame my unruly frizz and even give me some shine.</li>
            <li> Like professional size with an extra long cord which get&#x27;s trapped on my cabinet pulls.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> Plus it cost at least a third less on Amazon than at the beauty supply near me.</li>
            <li> however...the company that makes them is absolutely NEVER available and will NEVER call you back...</li>
            <li> have 3A curls and wanted something that would dry them faster and with less frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair (all the way down my back) and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a difference in styling my hair and reduced the time by half.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half the bearings gave out and had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> only complaint about the hair dryer is the way the cord is attached; the cord tends to get twisted and you have to untwist it every now and then.</li>
            <li> and I had to hold the cold shot button the entire time.</li>
            <li> but I am sad to retire this dryer.</li>
            <li> ugly &amp; too expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was ugly yellowish bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very light weight and quiet. this has long cord so great for hairstylist.</li>
            <li> Finally! I have searching for the right hair dryer with a diffuser for my thin curly hair, I&#x27;ve found the perfect answer. This dryer doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair and dries it quickly and beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love my new blow dryer, works great and hair drys so much faster!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 90-yr old Grandma because her dryer was just too big for her to handle. She tried this one but even though it was lightweight, it was still too big size-wise. I ordered the travel foldable one for her and hopefully that will be good for her.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer...probably the best one on the market...however...the company that makes them is absolutely NEVER available and will NEVER call you back...the fax number provided on the box is no longer in service and so then the reality is that as long as the hair dryer works you are in great shape...if you have a problem you might as well throw it away as there is no way to get it repaired...warranty or not. (the company that manufactures the hair dryer) are not going to be reachable.  That is the way they run their business.  They make the dryer and sell the dryer...and provide a 48 month warranty...but they do not allow you to use it as you cannot get in touch with them....EVER!!! I spoke with two salon&#x27;s that used to sell them that discontinued doing so just because of that reason.  They loved the units, but could not in good conscience continue to sell them.</li>
            <li> Have been using this dryer every day for a week - don&#x27;t know about the ceramic &amp; tourmaline features but am very satisfied with the results. Needed a dryer with power in low/warm settings and knew the 1200w travel version had a little more speed in low than other dryers its size. The 1875&#x27;s light weight &amp; smaller plug is a bonus. So far the rocker buttons don&#x27;t seem to be a problem (getting in the way or accidentally switching off). The instructions mention this dryer is for household use only. 6/23/13 update: have used the dryer every day for over a year, and it still works great with no problems.</li>
            <li> i love it!  with several heat settings it is perfect to dry my mom&amp;#34;s hair (she is 101) and do a quick job on my own hair.  nice and lightweight your arm is not tired out when hair is finally dry.  best hair dryer ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer since 2007 and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve used it almost every day the past 6 years and it dries very quickly and is not so loud. I&#x27;m saving up for the Harry Josh Pro hair dryer (it&#x27;s $300!!) but I am sad to retire this dryer. It still works so well.  I&#x27;ll probably keep it as a back up, I&#x27;m just itching to buy something new since I haven&#x27;t had to buy any hair care tools in over 5 years. I think I deserve it.</li>
            <li> Excellent hairdryer for professional or personal use.  Extremely light, reliable and longevity.  Best for price and performance. Beat all brand names in use.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer. It replaced an old big box store one that had seen better days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3A curls and wanted something that would dry them faster and with less frizz. For now it seems that it does dry them without as much frizz. It does not dry it faster but that just might be my hair and the settings I use and something I&#x27;ll always deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice diffuser and a few buttons: one for heat setting (hot, warm, cool) and fan setting (low, med, high). I use the high and cool button and it really does come out cool, not warm like my old one. Actually, my old one came out warm and I had to hold the cold shot button the entire time. So I love that I am free from that aggravation now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very light so it&#x27;s so much easier to hold than my last one. However, it feels as though its a cheap plastic material and a few times I&#x27;ve dropped it and cringed in anticipation of a crack, but it hasn&#x27;t happened. So I&#x27;m relieved it seems to be sturdy. Overall I am pleased with the dryer and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer ever. I have fine thinning hair with a extensions. This dyer is so quiet and leaves my  hair super soft and shiny. Wish it had bought it yrs ago.</li>
            <li> I really like all of the features and color because its sort of beige and blends in with the bathroom decor but the ion doesn&#x27;t turn off.  My hair is also noticeably frizzier since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I&#x27;m on the look out once again...</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware! I purchased this costly hair dryer because it was professional grade, light weight, and had a seemly good WARRANTY. However, it malfunctioned in a scary way arced at the top of the cord. Causing a burn to the hand and almost my HAIR! Since that time I have placed Several calls to the CEO Sean Miles @ (310) 527-7477 he simply does not answer his phone!!  Finally, I received a return call from Alina she requested that I mail the x5 Superlite  along with a $15.00 check cover WARRANTY to Lilique  14335 South Denker Ave Gardenia CA  90247 which I&#x27;ve done. I have again made several attempts to call to no Avail....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hair dryer for 3 years and its still going strong! Since I wash my hair every day,  I am very picky about the hair dryer I buy. This is what I was looking for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Has to be light.  I don&#x27;t want to hold a brick in my hand while I&#x27;m drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. Has to be quiet.  I&#x27;m particular about protecting my ears and a lot of high end hair dryers are really loud. (I bought a Solano and returned it because it was too loud).&lt;br /&gt;3. Has to be ceramic ionic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the hair dryer is the way the cord is attached; the cord tends to get twisted and you have to untwist it every now and then. Otherwise an excellent hair dryer that fit my criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, some people may be wary because its SO light that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a professional hair dryer. I disagree because a light hair dryer was EXACTLY what I was looking for. In any case, it does more than a good enough job for home use.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for over a year and my daughter decided she wanted one for Christmas so bought this same one for her.  They are very light weight but do a very good job at drying with different drying levels to choose from.</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer.  The coolest temp setting is great to use after my hair is dry and I just want to cool off.  It&#x27;s really quiet too; which helps with drying my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I only used this hair dryer for drying purpose so far so I am not sure if it&#x27;s good for styling yet.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super light and fast. Got three hot, warm, cool and three different blow intensity options as well. I care about my hair condition a lot so I paid a little more bucks to prevent the damage. One downside about this product is that the concentrator or so called \\&quot;point top?\\&quot; are plastic so it looks a little bit cheap but on the other hand it makes its weight lighter than other product;)</li>
            <li> Love it, best I&#x27;ve had..nice and light.&lt;br /&gt;So nice that I bought One for my daughter- and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to a speedier, quieter, lighter-weight blow dryer.  It was not as good as my less expensive one and frankly I think it is quieter because there is not enough power.  Just didn&#x27;t get the job done-so back it went.</li>
            <li> I bought this well over a year ago and it works brilliantly. It&#x27;s the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever own, dries my thick hair super fast and  has all the features I like.  Plus it cost at least a third less on Amazon than at the beauty supply near me.</li>
            <li> My dryer recently stopped working for no reason. I contacted the company both by email and by phone and basically if you cannot find your receipt they will not help you at all. I have only had the dryer for about two years. I think a dryer that is this costly should work for longer than 2 years.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this hair dryer. It&#x27;s made a difference in styling my hair and reduced the time by half.</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer - does not get too hot, but perfectly dries the hair. The best part is how quiet it is!</li>
            <li> Pros: light&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ugly &amp; too expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this hair dryer, the body color didn&#x27;t look like in the picture. It was ugly yellowish bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I expected it to be a salon quality for the price, but I actually got a better one at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Get it.  You WILL love it!  Good for any type hair, but great for curly hair, or fine hair that needs protection from overblowing.</li>
            <li> If you wait till it&#x27;s on sale you&#x27;ll be so glad you purchased this! Definitely the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very thick and long hair (all the way down my back) and before this hairdryer it used to take me about 15 minutes to blow-dry my hair. With this it takes me about 6. I bought a second one to keep at my parents house when I visit - that&#x27;s how great this is!</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer wanting a lighter weight, quicker drying, dryer and I got it! My hair is in much better condition after using it as well. After going on a trip with a friend she fell in love with it so I&#x27;m buying her one for her birthday. Anyone who wants to walk out the door quickly, would be happy with the performance of this dryer. Yes, it is expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> This would get a full 5 stars but it&#x27;s really big. Like professional size with an extra long cord which get&#x27;s trapped on my cabinet pulls. But it works very well to tame my unruly frizz and even give me some shine. I tried the compact version with all the exact same features, but it did not produce the same smooth and shiny results. This wont travel well... unless you never use a carry-on bag anyway. It is super light for it&#x27;s size and the buttons are easy to reach. I love it.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half the bearings gave out and had to be replaced.</li>
