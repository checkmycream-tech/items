            <li>The company has my money and now I&#x27;m supposed to sit patiently, pay my amazon bill, and wait for them to fill the order (no date in the lovely note, but she mentioned the samples).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my face look.</li>

            <li>Shipped fast , great product.</li>

            <li>I may buy more products.</li>
            <li>Nice clean feeling without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>Obagi skin care has kept my skin in pretty good shape for a senior citizen.</li>
            <li>I am so excited because I am seeing results!  </li>
            <li>My skin is clean!</li>
            <li>This Obagi cleaning is the best, leaves my skin clean just as if I just got a facial done.</li>
            <li>This is my first Obagi product and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I think this product would be a great fit for people with normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Like all the other Obagi products it is superb.</li>
            <li>Good for older skin.</li>
            <li>The Obagi C line of products are great - keeps my early-aging face more smooth and will even take off waterproof mascara with my nightly wash, eliminating the extra step for eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li>I was using Perricone, which is a fine product, but this made a difference on the way my skin felt.  </li>
            <li>This Obagi RX C-cleansing gel works very effectively, leaving my skin feeling clean and soft without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can tell a huge differnce in my skin when I use my Obagi.</li>
            <li>Great results but trying to locate even extra strength Obagi!</li>
            <li>AND MY SKIN FELT SMOOTH AND REFRESHED.  </li>
            <li>They go above and beyond to make the customer happy.</li>
            <li>The vitamin c helps protect against free radicals that age your skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect cleanser--not harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it in combination with obagi spf 30 sunscreen, OZ naturals Vitamin C serum as well as a dermatoligically tested, oil free moisturizer</li>
            <li>Great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Face feels clean.</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>Product as pictured, packaging was great and came before the expected delivary date.</li>
            <li>Tried and true cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t full either.</li>
            <li>My face stays hydrated and feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The facial cleanser is a lightly scented gel that effectively cleans your face without over drying or stripping it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a quality effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so fresh, and cleans all my makeup off.</li>
            <li>this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that Amazon offers this product line.</li>
            <li>All the Obagi products are worth it.</li>
            <li>just tried this product last night, and woke up to nice feeling skin this morning.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin and has a mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it was great, second time product was tampered with and only 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean soft and fresh!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, followed by a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Im African American with oily skin and it works great.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase this at the doctor&#x27;s office and when I saw that Amazon had it and for a lower price, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>have used so many products and not seeing any results.i finally found my skin cream</li>
            <li>THE FIRST WEEK</li>
            <li>My face is definitely softer and smoother after using this product consistently for more than 6mths.</li>
            <li>Lathers good, rinses well, doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out.</li>
            <li>The products will clean then clear.</li>
            <li>Removes all dirt, makeup and excess oil very gently but very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>fast shipment from Seller</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is a gentle way to keep your skin exfoliated.</li>
            <li>My face is much cleaner, since using this product.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY, FOR ME, WASN&#x27;T CLEANING</li>
            <li>washes off make up really well and gentle on the face.  </li>
            <li>And customer support was very accommodating.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and not dry after using this.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Saves me time from going to the dermatologist and its fast and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I have been using Obagi 15 years and the real suits have been CLEARANCE skin.</li>
            <li>Very dissaponited.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleanser that really cleanses your face.  </li>
            <li>This facial cleansing product really makes my face feel clean and helps my skin absorb my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It effectively removes dirt, grime and make-up and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth without leaving behind a film or any residue.</li>
            <li>i usually use the regular obagi cleanser but wanted to try the c and works great so far after 3 wks</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I think my expectations were too high for this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend any obagi products.</li>
            <li>This product cleans my face very well and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper through amazon than at my dermatologist which is approx $80 for the exact same product.</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly but was obviously not new.</li>
            <li>Second time order for this product - First time</li>
            <li>lasts long time worth buying</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle after recently moving from the Lab Series for Men cleaner.  </li>
            <li>That said, I totally dropped the ball when I ordered a non-milky cleanser knowing that my skin tends to be dry (and I also live in a very high elevation, which makes it a bit more dry).  </li>
            <li>Just a dab in the palm of your clean hand is enough, so the bottle lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear too.</li>
            <li>I did not research it because I thought Obagi would use all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not harsh.  </li>
            <li>That more than made up for the shoddy way of doing business.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After 3 weeks I can say I won&#x27;t be going back to the Lab product, I can really feel and see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 years old</li>
            <li>and I still fight adult acne...</li>
            <li>A small amount spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>40 years young and definitely can tell that this system is helping fight my early signs of aging.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this product it clearly said &amp;#34;only two left in stock order now&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It evidently was not closed properly or had been opened previously.</li>
            <li>It cleansed my face with no dry feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is my first Obagi product and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I think this product would be a great fit for people with normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Like all the other Obagi products it is superb.</li>
            <li> Good for older skin.</li>
            <li> The Obagi C line of products are great - keeps my early-aging face more smooth and will even take off waterproof mascara with my nightly wash, eliminating the extra step for eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I was using Perricone, which is a fine product, but this made a difference on the way my skin felt.  </li>
            <li> This Obagi RX C-cleansing gel works very effectively, leaving my skin feeling clean and soft without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can tell a huge differnce in my skin when I use my Obagi.</li>
            <li> Great results but trying to locate even extra strength Obagi!</li>
            <li> AND MY SKIN FELT SMOOTH AND REFRESHED.  </li>
            <li> They go above and beyond to make the customer happy.</li>
            <li> The vitamin c helps protect against free radicals that age your skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleanser--not harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it in combination with obagi spf 30 sunscreen, OZ naturals Vitamin C serum as well as a dermatoligically tested, oil free moisturizer</li>
            <li> Great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean.</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> Product as pictured, packaging was great and came before the expected delivary date.</li>
            <li> Tried and true cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t full either.</li>
            <li> My face stays hydrated and feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser is a lightly scented gel that effectively cleans your face without over drying or stripping it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a quality effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so fresh, and cleans all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that Amazon offers this product line.</li>
            <li> All the Obagi products are worth it.</li>
            <li> just tried this product last night, and woke up to nice feeling skin this morning.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin and has a mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it was great, second time product was tampered with and only 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean soft and fresh!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, followed by a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Im African American with oily skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase this at the doctor&#x27;s office and when I saw that Amazon had it and for a lower price, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> have used so many products and not seeing any results.i finally found my skin cream</li>
            <li> THE FIRST WEEK</li>
            <li> My face is definitely softer and smoother after using this product consistently for more than 6mths.</li>
            <li> Lathers good, rinses well, doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out.</li>
            <li> The products will clean then clear.</li>
            <li> Removes all dirt, makeup and excess oil very gently but very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> fast shipment from Seller</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is a gentle way to keep your skin exfoliated.</li>
            <li> My face is much cleaner, since using this product.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY, FOR ME, WASN&#x27;T CLEANING</li>
            <li> washes off make up really well and gentle on the face.  </li>
            <li> And customer support was very accommodating.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and not dry after using this.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Saves me time from going to the dermatologist and its fast and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi 15 years and the real suits have been CLEARANCE skin.</li>
            <li> Very dissaponited.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser that really cleanses your face.  </li>
            <li> This facial cleansing product really makes my face feel clean and helps my skin absorb my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It effectively removes dirt, grime and make-up and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth without leaving behind a film or any residue.</li>
            <li> i usually use the regular obagi cleanser but wanted to try the c and works great so far after 3 wks</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I think my expectations were too high for this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any obagi products.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my face very well and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper through amazon than at my dermatologist which is approx $80 for the exact same product.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly but was obviously not new.</li>
            <li> Second time order for this product - First time</li>
            <li> lasts long time worth buying</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle after recently moving from the Lab Series for Men cleaner.  </li>
            <li> That said, I totally dropped the ball when I ordered a non-milky cleanser knowing that my skin tends to be dry (and I also live in a very high elevation, which makes it a bit more dry).  </li>
            <li> Just a dab in the palm of your clean hand is enough, so the bottle lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear too.</li>
            <li> I did not research it because I thought Obagi would use all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not harsh.  </li>
            <li> That more than made up for the shoddy way of doing business.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After 3 weeks I can say I won&#x27;t be going back to the Lab product, I can really feel and see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 years old</li>
            <li> and I still fight adult acne...</li>
            <li> A small amount spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> 40 years young and definitely can tell that this system is helping fight my early signs of aging.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product it clearly said &amp;#34;only two left in stock order now&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It evidently was not closed properly or had been opened previously.</li>
            <li> It cleansed my face with no dry feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> It cleans my face very thoroughly, and only a small amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> I found myself using this product for about six months w/ the same dark scars and the same breakouts.</li>
            <li> Used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li> Questionable tampering of original product.</li>
            <li> This product does not make my face feel dry even during the winter weather.</li>
            <li> but I would still have breakouts which left dark marks</li>
            <li> Your skin feels soft not stripped and dried out!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like a lot of other cleansers</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts at least one year because you need a tiny amount to wash your entire face.  </li>
            <li> Takes at least a month to see results ,especially if you have clogged and big pores.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on microder, lazer, and phofacial treatment (1,200 each)</li>
            <li> One of the few products that actually makes me feel like it removed all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> citrus like- has a pink color and reminds me of the consistency and smell of a femine wash.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear all year round!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> She recommended this and two other obagi products.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> this product is above and beyond all the other products I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> THE 2ND WEEK, I STARTED NOTICING SOME SMALL BREAKOUTS AND CLOGGING OF MY PORES.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used this product but one day I made a mistake and tried other products that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Decided to give it a try after my dermatologist put me on some of their other products (which has had a life changing effect on my face!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seal outside of bottle broken and not an inner seal like all other obagi products come with.</li>
            <li> time i used it i literally felt pain as i washed my money down the sink</li>
            <li> Keeps the acne down and removes waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even do half of the job.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but it works so well.</li>
            <li> I live in Houston where the climate can range from extreme humidity in the summer to cold and rainy in the winter</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is legit.</li>
            <li> Also works well if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> Obagi is not a popular product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these and no more redness!</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi before from a skin specialist and I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep paying their ridiculous prices.  </li>
            <li> I recomend this product to anybody that is tired of spending money</li>
            <li> she is the one the encouraged me to get all the expensive treatment.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to not do anything.</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> I hate it because it has all the synthetic parabens in it.  </li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>
            <li> However, I am very disappointed in the Obagi-C cleansing gel and exfoliating day lotion.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent service. Product feels good. Will need to use longer for performance</li>
            <li> Love this product as part of my morning ritual</li>
            <li> Great price and lasts a long time. Keeps skin clear too.</li>
            <li> Used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I keep Obagi C Cleansing Gel in my shower and use it daily.  A small amount spreads easily.  I use it on more than my face.  Jane</li>
            <li> excellent product as most Obage products are. I have been using these products for over a year and I highly recommend them. The c-cleansing gel is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for a couple of years now. Perfect with a facial brush. fast shipment from Seller</li>
            <li> Obagi is not a popular product. I never personally never heard of it until I seen this lady with glowing skin! I asked her what she uses for her skin, and she said all I use is Obagi. I love this wash! it&#x27;s so fresh, and cleans all my makeup off. It has Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;and I got the product in a very good timely matter.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi. Im African American with oily skin and it works great. Im so happy I found it online for a way cheaper price. Great seller and product was packaged great!</li>
            <li> Great system for my oil and acne prone skin. 40 years young and definitely can tell that this system is helping fight my early signs of aging.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser.  You only need a small amount and it lasts for a long time.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like a lot of other cleansers tend to do.  This is a great product!!  I use it with the toner and the exfoliating day lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my first Obagi product and I was very pleased. It cleansed my face with no dry feeling afterwards. I have ordered three more products and hope they are as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Obagi skin care has kept my skin in pretty good shape for a senior citizen.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist -- saw improvements in my skin texture and color over time!</li>
            <li> Best face wash for gentle cleansing and polished skin. Vitamin C is a gentle way to keep your skin exfoliated.</li>
            <li> Second time order for this product - First time it was great, second time product was tampered with and only 3/4 full.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> My favorite face cleanser.  Smells deliciously citrusy and removes all my makeup.  Another great Obagi product!</li>
            <li> Product as pictured, packaging was great and came before the expected delivary date. I used Obagi Nu-Derm before this and needed a break from that. This is a good replacement. no issues from acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I really really love it. It is the perfect cleanser for my normal to oil skin. I am very happy.I adore it</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly but was obviously not new. The bottle was not sealed and 1/4 of the gel had already been used.</li>
            <li> Love it, not drying.  I thought I had rosacea, but aesthetician indicted it was the cleanser I was using.  She recommended this and two other obagi products.  I&#x27;ve been using these and no more redness!</li>
            <li> After wonderful recommendations from friends, I had high hopes of being able to use this product. However, I am very disappointed in the Obagi-C cleansing gel and exfoliating day lotion.  It  caused a burning sensation and rash on my face.</li>
            <li> Use it every day, can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I was using Perricone, which is a fine product, but this made a difference on the way my skin felt.  love it!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, love everything about obagi! It keeps my skin clear all year round!! Everyone should try it!!!</li>
            <li> Tried and true cleanser.  I&#x27;ve tried several and always come back to Obagi.  It is, simply, the best!</li>
            <li> This facial cleansing product really makes my face feel clean and helps my skin absorb my moisturizer. It also gives my make up a nice even tone.</li>
            <li> I swear by this face wash. It is a little pricey, but it works so well. My face stays hydrated and feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I think my expectations were too high for this product. I live in Houston where the climate can range from extreme humidity in the summer to cold and rainy in the winter so I&#x27;m not a meteorologist w/ avid knowlege of weather terms but lets say theres a lot of precipitation in the air lol. Anyway, this aggravates my oily, ance prone skin and adds to the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using this product it reduced the oily skin shine I used to have but I would still have breakouts which left dark marks and I though the C line would help brighten those but in my case it didnt. I found myself using this product for about six months w/ the same dark scars and the same breakouts.</li>
            <li> The Obagi C. Cleansing Gel had leaked out of the container and into the box.  It evidently was not closed properly or had been opened previously.</li>
            <li> My face is much cleaner, since using this product.</li>
            <li> lasts long time worth buying</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is legit. Wasn&#x27;t sealed. Smelled different. Dried my skin out. Have used obagi for a while now. It wasn&#x27;t full either.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I am 51, I have used this product for 8 years and would never consider using anything else. No one can guess my age...why switch!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I AM GLAD THAT AMAZON HAS IT!!!</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love that this product makes my skin feel squeaky-clean.  That said, I totally dropped the ball when I ordered a non-milky cleanser knowing that my skin tends to be dry (and I also live in a very high elevation, which makes it a bit more dry).  I think this product would be a great fit for people with normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts at least one year because you need a tiny amount to wash your entire face.  I use it with the entire Obagi C line and like their products with the exception of the night cream that has a undesirable smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleansing gel for about 2 years and I am sticking with it. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thouroughly cleans, even stubborn eyeliner and mascara without drying my skin. A little goes a long way! Highly recommend any obagi products.</li>
            <li> my sister introduced this face wash to me for acne and i love it, it doesnt make you look washed out.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Obagi I have gotten so many compliments on my skin. I love seeing results .I have used so many products and not seeing any results.i finally found my skin cream and I love it</li>
            <li> Great results but trying to locate even extra strength Obagi!</li>
            <li> this product is above and beyond all the other products I have tried in the past.  Like all the other Obagi products it is superb.</li>
            <li> HEARD A LOT ABOUT OBAGI PRODUCTS AND THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THIS A TRY.  THE FIRST WEEK IT SEEMED QUITE NICE AND MY SKIN FELT SMOOTH AND REFRESHED.  THE 2ND WEEK, I STARTED NOTICING SOME SMALL BREAKOUTS AND CLOGGING OF MY PORES.  SEEMS IT REALLY, FOR ME, WASN&#x27;T CLEANING AS WELL AS I THOUGHT.  SENT IT BACK.  I HAVE COMBINATION SKIN AND IT SAID THIS WAS FOR COMBINATION OR ALL SKIN TYPES.  FOR ME THIS DIDN&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li> washes off make up really well and gentle on the face.  One bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obagi products for many years and decided to give Obagi C a try and I&#x27;m sold! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I hate it because it has all the synthetic parabens in it.  I did not research it because I thought Obagi would use all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it. Been using for more than 10years.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, the feel, the vitamin C. I use this with my Clarisonic Mia and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Use with the lotion too and the vitamin-c serum! Yum!</li>
            <li> Great cleansing gel.  It works great and feels good on your skin.  Not harsh.  I will definitely buy it agin!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> The product is great. And customer support was very accommodating. They go above and beyond to make the customer happy.</li>
            <li> Love obagi products. cleanses good, helps with minimizing breakouts and exfoliates well. i usually use the regular obagi cleanser but wanted to try the c and works great so far after 3 wks</li>
            <li> This cleanser has changed the way my face looks. My skin is clean! It totally removes all traces of my foundation. My skin feels clean and not dry after using this. My face no longer breaks out.</li>
            <li> Great for all ages. The vitamin c helps protect against free radicals that age your skin. Your skin feels soft not stripped and dried out!  Removes all dirt, makeup and excess oil very gently but very thoroughly.  Highly recommend this product for anyone who wants a quality effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> The best face wash. Lathers good, rinses well, doesn&#x27;t leave your face dried out. Also works well if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean soft and fresh! Obagi product???!!! love it! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used the Obaji-C cleanser and serum for a couple of years now.  The facial cleanser is a lightly scented gel that effectively cleans your face without over drying or stripping it.  It effectively removes dirt, grime and make-up and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth without leaving behind a film or any residue.</li>
            <li> Great product for great price!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product it clearly said &amp;#34;only two left in stock order now&amp;#34;.  I did just that.  I received one bottle, not two and a hand written note saying...&amp;#34;Sorry out of stock.  I just ordered more Obagi C Cleansing Gel.  I will send the second one out to you as soon as I get it.  Hope you like all the samples&amp;#34;.  Yes the samples more than made up for the fact that I needed two bottles, ordered two bottles, paid for two bottles and instead I received one bottle with a lovely note and some great samples.  That more than made up for the shoddy way of doing business.  The company has my money and now I&#x27;m supposed to sit patiently, pay my amazon bill, and wait for them to fill the order (no date in the lovely note, but she mentioned the samples).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a refund for the product not received and I will never do business with this company again.  Don&#x27;t advertise what you don&#x27;t have and then try to use my money while I wait for you to fill my order by &amp;#34;god knows when&amp;#34;.  Your stocking issues are not my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REFUND</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on microder, lazer, and phofacial treatment (1,200 each) this is worth the money. I have chronic melasma (so my dermatologist said) she is the one the encouraged me to get all the expensive treatment. This Obagi cleaning is the best, leaves my skin clean just as if I just got a facial done. Great investement. I recomend this product to anybody that is tired of spending money</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser at a great price.  I normally purchase this at the doctor&#x27;s office and when I saw that Amazon had it and for a lower price, I was excited.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The product came on time without any problems I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a year and I love the way it makes my face look. It was an excellent price also</li>
            <li> Saves me time from going to the dermatologist and its fast and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more of the Obagi products online</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used this product but one day I made a mistake and tried other products that are cheaper. Bad idea! Didn&#x27;t even do half of the job. I went back to this product in a heartbeat! Now I can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> Not as good as advertised.  Been using for a couple of months and no difference.  Too expensive to not do anything.</li>
            <li> Love my Obagi C been using it for years, it is the best ever!</li>
            <li> I am pleased that Amazon offers this product line. I have been using Obagi 15 years and the real suits have been CLEARANCE skin. This is a acne BUSTER line!! Keep in mind... The products will clean then clear. Takes at least a month to see results ,especially if you have clogged and big pores. Leaves skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised by this product.  It cleans my face very thoroughly, and only a small amount is needed.  This product does not make my face feel dry even during the winter weather.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser twice a day.  Just a dab in the palm of your clean hand is enough, so the bottle lasts quite a long time.  It&#x27;s a great value for the price.  It is very gentle on the skin and has a mild fragrance.  I would highly recommend it, followed by a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the obagi cleansers for over 3 years now and have always been satisfied with them. It took me years and years to find a cleanser that works well with my skin and I&#x27;m very happy I finally found it. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT MY SKIN LOOKS SENSATIONAL</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  A facial care doctor only uses Obagi  products.  If he recommends it it is great</li>
            <li> One of the few products that actually makes me feel like it removed all of my makeup. I Love it!</li>
            <li> All the Obagi products are worth it. Very good for your skin. I trust this product.</li>
            <li> Seal outside of bottle broken and not an inner seal like all other obagi products come with. Product is not at all citrus like- has a pink color and reminds me of the consistency and smell of a femine wash. Very dissaponited. Questionable tampering of original product.</li>
            <li> The Obagi C line of products are great - keeps my early-aging face more smooth and will even take off waterproof mascara with my nightly wash, eliminating the extra step for eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> Perfect cleanser--not harsh on your skin.  It goes great with the Clarisonic--lathers up well.  It is my favorite cleanser to date.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge differnce in my skin when I use my Obagi. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast , great product.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle after recently moving from the Lab Series for Men cleaner.  Decided to give it a try after my dermatologist put me on some of their other products (which has had a life changing effect on my face!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks I can say I won&#x27;t be going back to the Lab product, I can really feel and see the difference.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> expensive and it did nothing&lt;br /&gt;no brightening, no toning nothing.&lt;br /&gt;each time i used it i literally felt pain as i washed my money down the sink</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try Obagi!  I am 49 years old and I still fight adult acne... This face wash has been so amazing and I use the Obagi C day cream as well...I am also noticing that my skin looks and feels smoother and brighter!  I am so excited because I am seeing results!  So far I love it!</li>
            <li> Face feels clean. Has helped with breakouts too. Good for older skin. Helps with repairing and minimizing some sun damage.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi before from a skin specialist and I stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep paying their ridiculous prices.  I was amazed at how inexpensive it is on Amazon.  My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and still love it. Keeps the acne down and removes waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> just tried this product last night, and woke up to nice feeling skin this morning.  I may buy more products.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing gel that I had try.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin super clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;If you like french products you should try this one and you will see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This Obagi RX C-cleansing gel works very effectively, leaving my skin feeling clean and soft without drying my skin.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser that really cleanses your face.  I have used it for some time and will continue. I love the way it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling without drying my skin. Has vitamin C which I hope will help.</li>
            <li> This is a fabu face cleansing gel. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue to do so. Does not dry out my skin and it cleanses all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> This product cleans my face very well and leaves it feeling soft.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and have noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My face is definitely softer and smoother after using this product consistently for more than 6mths. So much cheaper through amazon than at my dermatologist which is approx $80 for the exact same product. I have combination skin and occasionally get breakouts. My skin has never been more beautiful. I use it in combination with obagi spf 30 sunscreen, OZ naturals Vitamin C serum as well as a dermatoligically tested, oil free moisturizer</li>
