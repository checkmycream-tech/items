            <li>I have had so much fun mixing and matching!</li>
            <li>I like the nail powder stuff because it is easy to use and fun.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was lucky.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item and it came really quick.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, items came as described.  </li>
            <li>Everything came nicely packaged but the only thing is that you don&#x27;t get the plastic containers that&#x27;s pictured</li>
            <li>Im not a professional but im pretty good at it.</li>
            <li>I received the right product just as specified.</li>
            <li>Theres enough of each one to do a full set and maybe more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great combination of colors and textures although I wish there was a little more red</li>
            <li>Great of the small price.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it and would def buy again</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors and shapes you get too.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly what the picture showed.</li>
            <li>to chunky I rated it three because it was most likely my fault</li>
            <li>First off this took 5 weeks to get to me.</li>
            <li>Many colors and different textures.</li>
            <li>I also like how it makes my nails pretty.  </li>
            <li>love ..not much of the product that is my only complain about it</li>
            <li>It came really fast within 3 days of shipping..</li>
            <li>Very on trend.</li>
            <li>but I looked on Ebay and saw that I payed WAY TOO MUCH for this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>this &amp; everyone said they got it fast.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I would consider this a good sample of a lot of different glitters, and crushed shells.  </li>
            <li>and they fixed it right away.  </li>
            <li>The acrylic powders Are a shallow container that looks like it would be filled more</li>
            <li>But other then that I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>If you plan to use this for the tip of arcylic nails, you will not have enough product to use for one full set of nails.</li>
            <li>The color s are very vibrant when mixed with the right color textured .  </li>
            <li>Wow they come in a acrylic case and there was crushed shell that i wanting most...</li>
            <li>but they are kind of small!</li>
            <li>I was trying out new products</li>
            <li>I specially like the glitter dust and the crushed shells.</li>
            <li>So  now i need to go looking for a clear box to hold all these 60 colors</li>
            <li>I really like the variety of all the different kinds of glitter included.</li>
            <li>Item not as described complete lie.</li>
            <li>Mom doesn&#x27;t like the mess she has to clean though.  </li>
            <li>The only thing they do not come in a nice tray as seen above,they&#x27;re loose little containers.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad, but you also only get less than a table spoon of each product.</li>
            <li>No crushed shell.</li>
            <li>Some are full and some are less than half and really not enough to use for much.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I got this product, because I&#x27;ve read so many bad reviews on other glitter products from different sellers, but these glitters are great, I&#x27;ve used at least one of each to test them</li>
            <li>The presentation is also very nice, they come in a hard plastic box and 12 small containers in each box, almost all tightly closed but</li>

            <li> each little round container is a screw top lid compared to other glitters I&#x27;ve bought (where the lid can just pop off and make a mess).</li>
            <li> Although there was a few glitters that the lid wasn&#x27;t completely screwed on</li>
            <li> The containers are a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Second off this did not come with crushed shell.</li>
            <li> this set also comes with larger glitter, confetti, and crushed shells.  </li>
            <li> this products came earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> The only bad this is two of the little glitters where open which made a mess other than that love it!</li>
            <li> but the box they came is was smaller than the phone case i ordered and the glitter containers are really small almost a one time use only.</li>
            <li> and they are all individual little plastic circles with the colors inside,</li>
            <li> it came really fast just a few days!!!</li>
            <li> Got it Friday when it expected delivery date was this coming Monday.</li>
            <li> It says crushed shell</li>
            <li> There is enough to make a few sets.</li>
            <li> a few of the hexagon glitter containers(but only a few hexagons were out of place).</li>
            <li> The combos are endless!</li>
            <li> There was small glitter, large glitter, color powder, caviar beads &amp; some weird cotton like powder that I have never seen before &amp; dont know the name of or how its even used.</li>
            <li> The delivery took a little time, but&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> There are no plastic cases included to hold all the little tub&#x27;s like in the picture&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and they spilled a little.</li>
            <li> The containers are small ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find polish colors to match because of the greenish tint.</li>
            <li> Some complained about it being thrown in a package.</li>
            <li> I read nasty comments about this seller right AFTER I placed my order (my mistake).  </li>
            <li> none was broken...</li>
            <li> I had an issue with part of the bundle and contacted Crazy Cart</li>
            <li> sorry!</li>
            <li> but this stuff was awful to try and use as decor. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because now I dont think i need it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I just received my package today and I love it! It came really fast within 3 days of shipping.. Got it Friday when it expected delivery date was this coming Monday. Everything came nicely packaged but the only thing is that you don&#x27;t get the plastic containers that&#x27;s pictured instead you get these cardboard boxes. Overall I love it and would def buy again</li>
            <li> Love it and u can work easy with it..love ..not much of the product that is my only complain about it</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy cheaper and better. I absolutely love the variety and I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes glitter and sparkles</li>
            <li> i like the variety and i like glitter its self but the box they came is was smaller than the phone case i ordered and the glitter containers are really small almost a one time use only. I can not say i am disapointe because it is still a good deal but next time i will look for larger supply.</li>

            <li> The shell&#x27;s I wanted are NOT here. There are no plastic cases included to hold all the little tub&#x27;s like in the picture&#x27;s. Some are full and some are less than half and really not enough to use for much. I&#x27;m feeling a bit duped.</li>
            <li> They are on point with the product. The only thing they do not come in a nice tray as seen above,they&#x27;re loose little containers. Very on trend.</li>

The containers might be small but for the price, it&#x27;s a great deal!! And the shipping was also very fast. I am very happy with his product.</li>
            <li> I love doing acylic nails. Im not a professional but im pretty good at it. I used glitter for the very first time when I got these and it came out awsome! Very easy application of the glitter. I love all the different colors and shapes you get too. great product definitly!</li>
            <li> The glitters are a great kit! Theres enough of each one to do a full set and maybe more. What I love best about it is the way it is packaged - each little round container is a screw top lid compared to other glitters I&#x27;ve bought (where the lid can just pop off and make a mess). It&#x27;s a great combination of colors and textures although I wish there was a little more red</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what the picture showed. I really like the variety of all the different kinds of glitter included. Although there was a few glitters that the lid wasn&#x27;t completely screwed on and they spilled a little. But other then that I am satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Where do I start? Big glitter, glitter dust, shells, beads and somrthing like a iridescent glitter of all kinds of color. I would have given five stars but I looked on Ebay and saw that I payed WAY TOO MUCH for this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> to chunky I rated it three because it was most likely my fault I was trying out new products it was how it was described just not my style.</li>
            <li> I read nasty comments about this seller right AFTER I placed my order (my mistake).  People complaining they received something different.  I received the right product just as specified. I guess I was lucky.  Crushed shells and caviar is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened but I didn&#x27;t get these when I ordered them. I kept hoping they will show up but they still haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I have given up hope they will show and I don&#x27;t know if I will order them again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;0(</li>
            <li> The containers are a lot smaller than I expected. The color choices are great but the glitter products have a greenish tint to the color. It&#x27;s hard to find polish colors to match because of the greenish tint.</li>
            <li> Wow they come in a acrylic case and there was crushed shell that i wanting most... i really satisfied...none was broken...</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, but didn&#x27;t have the glitz. NOW I DO! i CAN NOW DO WHAT EVERY BODY IT WEARING.</li>
            <li> This product i love! The variety is awesome although they are small i wish they were bigger i def would pay the price for bigger product! They are worth it! Im going to order 3 more!!!</li>
            <li> They all loved it and used some to decorate their own nails the way they like it . They were so happy to decorate their nails they wanted it to be for themselves.</li>
            <li> First off this took 5 weeks to get to me. I read all the reviews before I purchased this &amp; everyone said they got it fast. Second off this did not come with crushed shell. There was small glitter, large glitter, color powder, caviar beads &amp; some weird cotton like powder that I have never seen before &amp; dont know the name of or how its even used. It says crushed shell but there is none!</li>
            <li> Item not as described complete lie. No crushed shell. Rather upset.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and it came really quick.  I love the variety thats included in this bundled.  I had an issue with part of the bundle and contacted Crazy Cart and they fixed it right away.  The glass bead and glitter mixes are very nice with vibrant colors. this set also comes with larger glitter, confetti, and crushed shells.  Great of the small price.</li>
            <li> This was a great assortment of nail decorations..Many colors and different textures. I can not wait to try them all</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. On the picture it looks like the glitter is compacted in a nice arcylic container, but it&#x27;s not. When I received this package, there was glitter everywhere and one of the circle containers was cracked. It&#x27;s very cheap, this is something you can get at the dollar store. The price is not bad, but you also only get less than a table spoon of each product. If you plan to use this for the tip of arcylic nails, you will not have enough product to use for one full set of nails.</li>
            <li> I used it as an inlay design on acrylic nails and it works great. Great for nail technicians. Try them.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and she loved them, it goes well with the drill and the dyer. And a great add to the starter kit.</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, items came as described.  This is what you want if you just want to try out different styles.  I would consider this a good sample of a lot of different glitters, and crushed shells.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Was excited to get the product because it looked like something i can use. I ordered this the 13th of February was supposed to get it the ending of march. Never got it now its almost the ending of april and still nothing.  Very disappointed because now I dont think i need it.</li>
            <li> My kids and wife love this product.  The color s are very vibrant when mixed with the right color textured .  The price is reasonable.  Will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and I love the color selection and knowing that I won&#x27;t have a ton of glitter that I will never get through</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave this product 4 stars is because it does not come in a plastic holding case.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in  a cardboard box and they are all individual little plastic circles with the colors inside, So  now i need to go looking for a clear box to hold all these 60 colors in.&lt;br /&gt;I paid 15 dollars for a card board box and glitter powder.. a plastic case would have been a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the product is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl and she seems to love it, so I assume it is good. Sorry I can not be more helpful.</li>
            <li> Very happy about this kit. It arrived fast. Some complained about it being thrown in a package. Ya it was but everything was there and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. The acrylic powders Are a shallow container that looks like it would be filled more but it&#x27;s not. There is enough to make a few sets. overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> this products came earlier than expected! Great and nice products! but they are kind of small! But i will buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the nail powder stuff because it is easy to use and fun.  I also like how it makes my nails pretty.  Mom doesn&#x27;t like the mess she has to clean though.  haha</li>
            <li> The combos are endless! I have had so much fun mixing and matching! The containers are small ones but you don&#x27;t need much to make your nails look awesome! Will order again when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Best choice eva good with gel</li>
