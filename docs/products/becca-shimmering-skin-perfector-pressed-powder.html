            <li>This shimmer is beautiful, but after two days of owning it it crumbled into a million pieces after being in my purse</li>
            <li>The hype on this product is undeserving it is super pigmented as stated,but their are sparkles!!!!</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t understand the hype of the product since the staying powder is not that great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anything exceptionally great.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a nice summer glow.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great, and my products did not arrive damaged.</li>
            <li>Beautiful product it gives a nice glow...love it!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>not in a oily or greasy kind of way it&#x27;s so beautiful.</li>
            <li>This highlighter is gorgeous on all skin tones, it even provides you with a bit of a bronzer look as well.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it love it!</li>
            <li>Opal is a amazing color on all skin tones, I am of a darker complexion and this looks soooo amazing on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>but if you do love this product  it arrives perfect fresh and intact .I</li>
            <li>By far one of the best highlighters</li>
            <li>,it gives you a nice glow,love it love</li>
            <li>ehhh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a highlighter you should go with Watt&#x27;s Up by Benefit as that works MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>lovely sheen</li>
            <li>I saw this product used in a YouTube video by Jacklyn Hill and it truly is lovely on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I have this in my life.</li>
            <li>but my Mom loved it so much I gave it to her.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin</li>
            <li>Smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have many highlighters and even though everyone seems to love this one I really did not.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer a sheerer more sophisticated  highlighter that can be used more universally such as Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s highlighter .</li>
            <li>just found it to be alittle thicker and lay on the top of my skin too much and</li>
            <li>Was shipped fast and really love this</li>
            <li>It is super shimmery</li>
            <li>: If you are pale, go for Moonstone is gorgeous too!</li>
            <li>I would definitely make sure you pair this with a bronzed look!</li>
            <li>this is such an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Such a warm combination for a highlighter.</li>
            <li>If you by chance have a heavy hand, it may be best to really watch it when using this product as it is very pigmented, and because of that has so many uses above being just a highlighter.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good as long as we don&#x27;t put too much on the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li>Amazing product, it literally blends like a dream, it&#x27;s extremely pigmented and creamy, and works well with so many different colored complexions.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refined very buttery, yes buttery!</li>
            <li>But, mine has no cracks and is brand new fresh out of Becca packaging.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>More of a shimmery gold then other highlighters I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>So lucky to find this for only 27$</li>
            <li>I love the color but when it arrived it was in its original box and looked new but was crumbled, this may seem small to such a large company</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, soft shimmer without sparkle, in a neural color bound to work with all shades.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a stippling brush because it digs into the products, and this powder is so soft its almost creamy.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin shimmer but doesn&#x27;t stay on long and doesn&#x27;t really show in photos.</li>

            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> Mine came to be broken in tiny pieces, therefore, I returned it.</li>
            <li> You need to use a very little amount, if not, it looks like caked.</li>
            <li> so I had to put it in a small container</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I received this today, I opened it and it was completely broken inside!</li>

            <li> Mine came to be broken in tiny pieces, therefore, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I got it for me but my Mom loved it so much I gave it to her.  It is super shimmery so it&#x27;s good as long as we don&#x27;t put too much on the face. Will purchase this item again.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately my product came with a crack in it, which caused the whole thing to crumble and crack into pieces within a few days of having it. It doesn&#x27;t stay all day when I apply it on. It&#x27;s a pretty color however I don&#x27;t understand the hype of the product since the staying powder is not that great.</li>
            <li> I was expecting for this highlighter to blend easier with my skin.  You need to use a very little amount, if not, it looks like caked.</li>
            <li> I freakin LOVE this highlighter!!!! Its sooooooo perfect!!! Iv seen many video reviews on it &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait to get my hands on it!!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!</li>

            <li> Absolutely beautiful! Perfect for a nice summer glow. I would definitely make sure you pair this with a bronzed look!</li>
            <li> Just got mine in the mail yesterday. Shipping was pretty fast. Color is so beautiful! This product is amazing! So lucky to find this for only 27$ so I had to purchase. Was a little worried about damages or cracks when getting it in the mail after reading some of these reviews. But, mine has no cracks and is brand new fresh out of Becca packaging. Would definitely recommend this for anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;-Vanessa</li>
            <li> It is the perfect highlight. Not too shimmery. I highly recommend this item to anyone. I have light skin and it does not make me look like a disco ball.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! By far one of the best highlighters I ever try!&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you are pale, go for Moonstone is gorgeous too!</li>
            <li> beautiful color - i&#x27;ve received so many compliments this week!!!  saw this on the Makeup Geek you tube video.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, soft shimmer without sparkle, in a neural color bound to work with all shades.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I received this today, I opened it and it was completely broken inside! Making it not possible to use at all!  I want my money back!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Very beautiful highlight. More of a shimmery gold then other highlighters I&#x27;ve used. Such a warm combination for a highlighter. You have to try it to see what all the hype is about. not as big as I imagined which I prefer.</li>
            <li> This highlighter is the best highlighter ever! Hands down! Opal is a amazing color on all skin tones, I am of a darker complexion and this looks soooo amazing on my cheekbones. It almost gives you that wet look, but not in a oily or greasy kind of way it&#x27;s so beautiful. It does have the slightest shimmer in it but not glitter specks that you can literally pluck off your face. It&#x27;s very refined very buttery, yes buttery! Smooth to the touch. The best brush to apply this is with the sigma tapered highlighting brush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a stippling brush because it digs into the products, and this powder is so soft its almost creamy. Shipping was great, and my products did not arrive damaged. Please go and treat yourself to this you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I saw this product used in a YouTube video by Jacklyn Hill and it truly is lovely on the skin. Not glittery, just subtle enough to provide a glow.</li>
            <li> If you are searching for in-within glow or out of the world glow, this is it ! . You wont&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> This shimmer is beautiful, but after two days of owning it it crumbled into a million pieces after being in my purse</li>
            <li> Beautiful product it gives a nice glow...love it!</li>
            <li> I have many highlighters and even though everyone seems to love this one I really did not.It is not the one I reach for but if you do love this product  it arrives perfect fresh and intact .I just found it to be alittle thicker and lay on the top of my skin too much and sinceI Iam over forty I think I prefer a sheerer more sophisticated  highlighter that can be used more universally such as Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s highlighter .</li>
            <li> Was shipped fast and really love this,it gives you a nice glow,love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> Best highlighter ever!</li>
            <li> The hype on this product is undeserving it is super pigmented as stated,but their are sparkles!!!! If you hate sparkels watch out</li>
            <li> Amazing product, it literally blends like a dream, it&#x27;s extremely pigmented and creamy, and works well with so many different colored complexions. If you by chance have a heavy hand, it may be best to really watch it when using this product as it is very pigmented, and because of that has so many uses above being just a highlighter.

            <li> this is such an amazing product.  I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments&lt;br /&gt;I got it on time before valentines day. Seriously so flawless. I&#x27;m so glad I have this in my life.</li>
            <li> I love the color but when it arrived it was in its original box and looked new but was crumbled, this may seem small to such a large company so I didn&#x27;t complain but it spilled out every time I open it so I had to put it in a small container</li>
