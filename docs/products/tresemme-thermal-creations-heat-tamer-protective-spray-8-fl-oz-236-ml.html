            <li>AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>I used to just use Tresemme Thermal Creations Curl Activator Spray by itself to form curls, but decided it&#x27;s probably best to get some heat protection.    </li>
            <li>and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Her hair isn&#x27;t always the best when it comes to holding in curls or straightening.</li>
            <li>This works great for her!</li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>excellent price for quality product...</li>
            <li>Great smell!</li>
            <li>I am impressed!</li>
            <li>so although the product may awesome never got to experience it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel and smell great!</li>

            <li>Smells so good!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It protects the hair, leaving an awesome shine without a tacky, oily or sticky finish!!!</li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair</li>
            <li>I resolved this by picking up an aluminum mister I saw at the container store, which has worked perfectly for me (although some reviewers seem to have had issues).</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my 4b hair!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>However, this one has a pleasant smell and it softens and detangles too!</li>
            <li>Very good product</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>

            <li>Great product and smells good!!!</li>
            <li>Does its job perfectly and smells great.</li>
            <li>The bottle provides great instructions on the best way to apply...follow them.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>So I bought it and loved it!</li>

            <li>This is great to use before using a curling iron or straightener, helps protect the heat from damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>I use this as well before curling my hair and it works great on it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must-have in your beauty supplies</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>so Im happy</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great spray, and it protects without weighting or dirtying your hair</li>

            <li>It smells great, too.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the product is great.</li>
            <li>After she did it, she curled it for me and it looked great</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue either, which is great since I wash my hair every 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that i can keep my hair in great condition with this.</li>
            <li>This works great to protect my hair when i put the curling iron to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This item is good for the price you pay</li>

            <li>Good smell also.</li>
            <li>Works good for any heating tool or blow dryer......</li>
            <li>Hello good deal, I bought mine at Walmart for $3.98.</li>
            <li>look good</li>
            <li>product smells good</li>
            <li>Besides that, its a good product.</li>
            <li>Cheap wonderful product!</li>
            <li>it is a good product that makes your hair feel</li>
            <li>the shape and design of the bottle and spray nozzle are somewhat add to get a good hold on.</li>
            <li>fact, I bought this after a lot of research online, and I made a good decision on this indeed!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I started using this a year ago and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>It smells SOOOO good</li>
            <li>I feel like i&#x27;m doing something good for my hair</li>
            <li>but I think those that seem to like it will soon discover that their hair isn&#x27;t in as good condition as they though it was and probably is fried when all is said and done.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and nice-smelling, which is perfect because flat-ironing and blow-drying cause a burned smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works really good</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, protects my hair, and oh my god makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>or I would have incredible static and fried ends.</li>
            <li>BOTTOM LINE - a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>so I guess its good.</li>
            <li>good good</li>
            <li>Really a good protection of heat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its good but im rating it</li>

            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>good service, and</li>
            <li>If there are better products out there, I&#x27;ll never find out as this works perfectly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells awesome and makes my hair nice and smooth when I am done.  </li>
            <li>super happy!</li>

            <li>My first sprits and straighten was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Something of which wasn&#x27;t very appealing, honestly.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this again for sure!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Also, the pieces in the front of my hair never curl, so I tried spraying a bit more in the front before I use my curler, and it made them hold the curl!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for something better for my hair!</li>
            <li>My husband and kids love how it makes my hair smell too!</li>
            <li>I end up getting more all over my hands than I do on my hair!  </li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, the mist has great coverage, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all.</li>
            <li>As you can see from my main profile picture I try my best to protect my hair from heat styling and for the most part it does look great when I style it myself - and I&#x27;m not even a hair stylist connoisseur.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and gives my hair a lovely shine!</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy, color-treated hair and this spray works so great when I combine it with my anti-frizz serum and use my straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I can use this for heat free styling like my sock bun as well as heat styling to protect and give silky shine.</li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is really light.</li>
            <li>BUY THIS AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing...</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and gives my hair a nice shine after heat styling.</li>
            <li>I like this product as a heat spray, but I don&#x27;t see any amazing results with it.</li>
            <li>This spray is so amazing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just letting everybody know that this product is totally amazing.</li>
            <li>so my hair can stay protected while still looking amazing.</li>
            <li>Feels light while giving hair great protection.  </li>
            <li>Hasa nice scent too.</li>
            <li>It keeps it straight, protected, healthy-looking, and gives it a great shine too!</li>
            <li>It also smells SOOOO good :)</li>
            <li>Smell nice , does the work .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell really nice.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s more than a good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather smell my own burnt hair than walk around smelling like this for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Also, this is priced a good $3+ more than purchasing from Target, Ulta, or Walmart.  </li>

            <li>I have no experience with heat and shine sprays, so I can&#x27;t compare them to others or even evaluate it on its own merits.</li>
            <li>If you want a good protective spray ION makes a much better one than this.  </li>
            <li>I took a flyer on this product since the reviews were mostly good, and was pleased to discover this spray</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and is not sticky like some thermal protector sprays.</li>

            <li>Smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li>My fine textured hair was shiny, but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of products specifically for straightening my hair and this combo (gel &amp; protective spray) is by far the best I have come across.</li>
            <li>but it smells great and gives me a sense of worth knowing that I AM protecting my hair.</li>
            <li>and this is the best BY FAR.</li>
            <li>I liked the seller (PharmaSave) even more.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is necessarily comfortable to use positioning wise</li>
            <li>and it smells nice :)</li>
            <li>This has been protecting my hair for years, it also have a really nice refreshing smell.</li>

            <li>This is by far the best heat protectant spray around.</li>

            <li>Super easy to use, smells so good, and has lasted me almost six months now!</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant - much more feminine than those cologne-types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Overall, if your looking for an effective heat protectant at a wonderful price</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of the great Amazon reviews and because it was a lot more economical than what they sell in salons.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and I&#x27;m assuming it must be good for my hair, LOL.</li>
            <li>A light mist from about 6-8 inches from the hair is the best way to go, and works very well.</li>
            <li>Nice, light spray in a handy pump.  </li>
            <li>I know, not that smart, but it sure smells good!</li>
            <li>At first I loved it cause it smelled good, but through out the day, I noticed my hair started becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li>Great product and keeps my hair from looking damaged after using hot tools.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, not flowery, but just a clean kind of smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it is very light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.it is very light and non sticky</li>
            <li>It also smells pleasant and fresh.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s kind of fine in texture.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice, fine mist of product.</li>
            <li>That is huge for me!  </li>
            <li>love this brand ..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use Tresemme for my hair care needs.</li>
            <li>I also use it at night as a setting spray if I&#x27;m going to roll my hair up in a sock bun to preserve my silky smooth blow out and give me a nice flip out on the ends.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use this on the ends my hair doesn&#x27;t come out with any flip to it, just more of a wimpy bend.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not any better than Pantene.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the magic is</li>
            <li>and I have to say I do kinda love it.</li>
            <li>When I curled my hair after spraying this product, my hair looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Then I just use my trusted tresemme and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s livelier and feels better.  </li>
            <li>Even when I don&#x27;t need a heat protectant, I use it because it makes my hair just better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the design of the spray trigger.</li>
            <li>However, there are better out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too pleased with this product.   </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I have more hair than most people.  </li>
            <li>Way better than Tresemee.</li>
            <li>This stuff has kept the ends looking healthy and has prevented my hair from drying out or ever smelling burnt when using heating tools.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells great and left my hair smelling wonderfully throughout the whole day.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I made this purchase and will be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on it.</li>
            <li>claim to love it, but it just made my hair feel so sticky and look poofy.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>My hair instantly felt sleek and healthy, smells awesome too!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and like how it doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair or make it feel sticky.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works great....wish it smelled better....</li>
            <li>I love all of their products because they work as advertised.</li>
            <li>When I received this product I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li>if you used to style your hair with heat you had better to buy it, it will protect your hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light and doesnt leave my hair feeling greasy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I don’t think that I’ll be using this product again as I’m looking for something a bit more versatile.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>It helps prevent more hair breakage.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Rather it&#x27;s for my real hair or weave lol.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrant it has.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I don&#x27;t use heat very often and when I do I use really great tools to help prevent damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it is protecting my hair either.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>have it on sale for a even better price</li>
            <li>so just be sure to look out for that</li>
            <li>Great product as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it..</li>
            <li>But I still used it because I figured it was better than no protectant at all.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t saturate hair like most sprays</li>
            <li>but I found myself using this one more and more for just that.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>but, All in all..it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Protected my hair from the heat while not making it oily :)</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Many of the products that I have tried before (and have tried MANY)</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve used the Chi Iron Guard 44....not any more.  </li>
            <li>If I use more then hair is oily for the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to just use it on the ends of my hair, or give it to someone with better hair than I have.  </li>
            <li>how many months it&#x27;s going to take to dissipate from the carpeting.</li>
            <li>I love this heat protectant.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this product I was using organic root stimulator&#x27;s olive oil protection serum, but this is so much better and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>love this product and defenatley will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this heat tamer</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>nothing over the top about product</li>
            <li>Better than Chi heat protectant for sure.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my hair feel great after use.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s lightweight and has a lovely scent to it too.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This spray made my hair look more shiny, even when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find the Get Sleek spray in the stores in my area anymore</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m just going to list what I love about it :)</li>
            <li>If you are going to buy I would look for the best price for only one bottle.</li>
            <li>I also used the TRESemme Thermal Creations Volumising Mousse too, but this was much better.</li>
            <li>is not a fault of the prodcut, but more the packaging.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the spray bottle itself as well.</li>
            <li>like the way the top was designed because liquid leaked when I packed it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>The thing that I love about it is that it&#x27;s affordable</li>
            <li>and I think my hair is better protected at home then in the salon.</li>
            <li>There have been many times that people ask me if I went to the salon to get my hair done and the answer is -</li>
            <li>I am trying to do more grown-up hairstyles</li>
            <li>The product smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I found that my hair breaks off much more after use, han it did without this &#x27;thermal protection&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this product are great, however, I tried it and didn&#x27;t care so much for it.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t go well on my brazilian hair but works okay on my hair</li>
            <li>When it comes to my hair, I want better performance.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t renew my prime because I seem to end up spending more...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I use it without any heat sometimes because I love the feel of my hair with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it really protects the hair well.</li>

            <li>I am in love with this product; there is nothing better on the market to protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I love using this for blow-drying, straightening, curling,</li>
            <li>Love the smell..</li>
            <li>Sprays easily, love the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells ok</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product, and will be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Made my hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but maybe I am just not a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; person after all</li>
            <li>Not very expensive and yet I feel like it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more very soon!!!!</li>
            <li>However, it is very hot where I live and this spray does an excellent job of keeping away frizz.  </li>
            <li>normally use pureshine Brilliant Blowout, a keratin product that leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>smells great and isn&#x27;t sticky like my high end hair products.</li>
            <li>Makes my dry, color treated hair silky, good smelling and looking great.</li>
            <li>It works really well and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally care for this brand because of the scent of their products but this one is great.</li>
            <li>First, it smells good.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>This hair spray is pretty good because it protects my hair when I&#x27;m straightening it and reduces my split ends, which is all I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using this product, I had read good reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle is fantastic at getting a very fine mist on my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it is cheaply made and breaks easily!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep using it!</li>
            <li>easy squirt bottle top.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle it comes in, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best heat tamer I&#x27;ve ever used and smells FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and makes my hair feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>I also love that it sprays out as a fine mist</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is very good</li>
            <li>Need a better nozzle to lightly spray hair.</li>
            <li>My hair just felt light, smooth, and most of all healthy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it with a straightener or blow dryer, but I love how smooth it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, it also minimizes my hair from becoming frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It protects, leaves your hair soft, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and shiny my hair feels after I spray with this - then proceed to straighten or curl.</li>
            <li>and it makes it smooth and keeps my hair looking healthy and not oily.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and the bottle is a good size.</li>
            <li>This smells good and works really well.</li>
            <li>This worked good and was reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do and smells really nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>a good product thanks tresemme</li>
            <li>It really smells good.</li>
            <li>Until I find the right kind of curlers to set my hair in overnight</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good, and doesn&#x27;t cause any build up, I no longer have anymore split ends!</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair more manageable, it is a unique product that helps the hair and not damaged it.  </li>
            <li>Full marks for that!</li>
            <li>But all-in-all, DEFINITELY worth it!:)</li>
            <li>Other than that it is the best heat protector!</li>
            <li>and I can proudly say that this product has kept me completely split end free since.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, it goes on light, it gives my hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use with the trigger nozzle.</li>
            <li>I have clean healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and was not damaged</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to lug around in a bag</li>
            <li>and I can easily straighten my hair without any worry of it burning.  </li>
            <li>it works great with thick hair great product</li>
            <li>Easy to comb through &amp; not sticky.</li>
            <li>Spray is to strong coming up</li>
            <li>What I really admired most about this product was how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li>product has a strong, feminine scent that somewhat lingers on the user.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a good reliable product, that will&lt;br /&gt;- protect your hair from sizzle when using high heat irons</li>
            <li>and I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>This one is really good as a thermal protectant and my hair not only feels super smooth, but also smells good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with high level of customer service and with the product!    </li>
            <li>This product works great, my hair looks healthy even after I flat iron it now.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and my hair hasn&#x27;t been burned to a crisp</li>
            <li>Sometimes after you straighten your hair, there might be a smell, but after using this your hair will smell really nice even after applying so much pressure and heat onto it!</li>
            <li>I love it soo much and it make my haire look fresh and healthy and its have agood and nice smell for your haire.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, I have wavy, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is fine, easier than going to the grocery store to buy on Amazon</li>
            <li>As for just using before I blowdry, I think it is fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s prise fine.</li>
            <li>of this being said, if you have a one step process, shake the bottle before using, and don’t over spray, the product seems to work fine as a heat protectant and it makes the hair feel “silky.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for anyone using heat daily on their hair whether they are using curling irons or hot air blower.  </li>
            <li>The spray is so fine</li>
            <li>Used it, works fine</li>
            <li>Came quickly and just as described!</li>
            <li>SMells so good and makes hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Works well, smells good, makes my hair soft too!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a drugstore product buyer and for good reason.  </li>
            <li>This makes this product less than ideal for touching up or adjusting with heat styling tools.</li>
            <li>Super light and not sticky like so many hair products.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, and the price is super cheap!</li>
            <li>I have never used such an easy great product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, it is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, and it even has a nice gentle smell to it - nothing too strong.</li>
            <li>My hair is a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li>Light feeling in hair.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and I feel that it works just as nicely in comparison to the Nexus version which is twice as much.</li>
            <li>Honestly this stuff hasn&#x27;t only protected my hair from heat, but makes my hair look so much more healthy.</li>
            <li>so I really need some kind of protection on it if I want it to grow without breakage.    </li>
            <li>I purchase both the &#x27;smooth&#x27; heat protector and this Tresemme&#x27; tamer protector.  </li>
            <li>but I must say given the fact that their spray is so fantastic I might have to try their line of shampoos and conditioners as well.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try it because it has such great reviews and people</li>
            <li>Works very well, nice smell.</li>
            <li>okay makes your hair oily after a day though not crazy oily but noticeable</li>
            <li>The bottle size seemed to fit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, it moisturizes my hair and it has a comfortable smell.</li>
            <li>It is light and it protects my hair, but it did not add any shine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be using this product again, if you already use some kind of leave in serum or oils you don&#x27;t really need this.</li>
            <li>Light weight and sprays evenly.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit off putting for me, but my friends enjoy the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only heat protectant I use, seems to work great</li>
            <li>You get your money worth but it just wish more came in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>The hair are silky , light and not stick together&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>this is a great product when using heat stylers regularly on your hair.  </li>
            <li>It greatly improves the overall appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s available on Amazon</li>
            <li>leaves my hair silky and smooth after curling or drying.</li>
            <li>&quot; I thought that was a nice bonus, but didn&#x27;t think much of it since it&#x27;s a heat protective spray.    </li>
            <li>after I using this stuff, my hair look smooth and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second order.. GREAT.</li>
            <li>Use a light spray only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling light, nourished and protected.</li>
            <li>For example, if you have flat-ironed your hair and want to curl the ends but have the kind of hair that curls when wet, this would not be a good option for the task at hand.</li>
            <li>This is really good for those who love styling their hair with curler and waver like me, as it can protect your hair from being damaged because of the heat coming from such hairstyling tools.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny and is a good heat protectant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to immediately curl or straighten my hair after using, and my hair comes out sleek and shiny, which is a good enough sign to me that it&#x27;s being protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing super special.</li>
            <li>Works great to product my very fine hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>( shipping was SUPER fast) and I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>ORDERING ONE MORE RIGHT NOW!!!!❤</li>
            <li>I have fine, bleached hair and this left my hair feeling amazing!</li>
            <li>I use this before I flat iron my hair and my daughter uses it before she blow drys, either way you choose to use it, it Provides great protection.</li>
            <li>Great heat protection for blow drying and flat ironing and</li>
            <li>If you routinely use hot curlers or curling iron on your hair, this is great for protecting it from the heat damage and helps to keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is second day after using this product the hair are still fresh and beautiful , don;t have to do anything</li>
            <li>I wanted something more to it, like redkin&#x27;s hot sets or iron shape/</li>
            <li>and I was really excited.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using a heat protectant, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I still say if you can avoid using hot irons, blow dryers, etc you&#x27;re better off.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it because i got this waver for my hair and thought i should get a protectant spray for the heat,</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>And she is pretty pleased with the spray.</li>
            <li>but it is completely worth buying it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was not expensive.</li>
            <li>Its as if the product actually absorbed the heat!</li>
            <li>It is a great heat protectant and does not leave any kind of sticky or hard residue on your hair.</li>
            <li>Makes ur hair feel soft and smells AMAZING</li>
            <li>It is relatively cheap, lasts a long time, and smells soo good.</li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves my hair so healthy and shiny when my hair is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>The packaging has not proven great for travel, as no matter how carefully packed, the bottle has leaked, albeit into the freezer bag</li>
            <li>To be fair, the hair looks great the first day, but definitely needs to be washed next morning...</li>
            <li>I want my hair straight and safe.</li>
            <li>and itll last me a fair while...  for the price, and its effectablility i give it a five.</li>
            <li>It does give a nice shiny appearance after straightening, but I just don&#x27;t think its worth the price, especially since there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hair stylist and use this every day on my own hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at my local Target store after hearing good reviews about it online.</li>
            <li>The smell is overly sweet and gives me headaches.</li>
            <li>I expect a full refund</li>
            <li>Overall really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to name, &amp; it helps protect my hair from the heat..</li>
            <li>My husband always comments on how nice it smells when I use it, and I completely agree.</li>
            <li>I use a couple sprays around my head when I&#x27;m ready to start styling, pick up the top layers and spray a bit underneath, and run my fingers through my hair to distribute.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again, considering the great smell, effective product, and low price.</li>
            <li>This works really well on my Daughters hair it helps control the frizz and makes it more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I can&#x27;t travel away from home or spend a night without it.</li>
            <li>Only a good smell and silky hair.</li>
            <li>and I can already see this bottle will last me a good couple of months.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>I love this product for both natural hair and virgin extensions!!!</li>
            <li>Okay so I have very FINE BLONDE hair, dyed, and straightened/curled/whathaveyou every day.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to spray on my hair, wish hairspray had the same kind of trigger.</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair had a beautiful bounce and shine to it after I finished flat ironing my wavy hair straight.  </li>
            <li>You can also use it with other products and it works just as great.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome prduct and i seriously recommend it.</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li>protects the hair, doesn&#x27;t leave it silky and amazing but it works well enough and is cheap.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more soft and smooth than it ever has before.</li>
            <li>quick tip...</li>
            <li>Luckily, it was wrapped in a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>Whatever mild smell this has wears away after a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good, but I don&#x27;t really smell it throughout the day or anything, if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many different heat sprays and I love this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally curly and frizzes up very easily.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has a pleasant smell, makes my hair even softer, and best of all it seems to tame by thick, extremely fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my long fair feel smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>Not only does my hair now have the best protection from my hot tools, but I only wash my hair every 3 or so days and this stuff really keeps it smelling great even on the 3rd day!</li>
            <li>My hair is baby soft and very fine</li>
            <li>new containers have a better mechanism to lock.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY buy this product: inexpensive, lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s the perfect product for any hair!!</li>
            <li>I really feel like it protect my hair, leave it shiny, and it helps the iron slide easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I really like the lock/unlock feature of the pump (now it won&#x27;t accidentally spray in my travel bags).</li>
            <li>Okay so I actually love this product, HOWEVER, I only used it a few time and the top broke!!</li>
            <li>After I used this product for the first time I was amazed!</li>
            <li>I really like how it finely mists your hair.</li>
            <li>It does its job, smells great and leaves my hair a little softer.</li>
            <li>If I have more time with testing other heat-protectant sprays, I could easily give this four or five stars!</li>
            <li>She saw them at a local store and stocked up, and she decided to show me how amazing it was.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and always available, I found my at Walgreens for $4.99.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and my hair felt really silky after curling it.</li>
            <li>I feel this is the kind of product that will work differently on everyone.</li>
            <li>The spray comes out in a wide mist so gives good coverage on my hair.</li>
            <li>I am always trying different protectors and have had my way with fairly nice sprays.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on the recommendation of my sister, who knows far more about hair care than I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a shopper that looks for what I want, but also offers the most for the cheapest</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrant smell that last all day!</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>I used it before blow-drying and was happy with the way it left my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>one smelled better nd left my hair smooth, not with this one though.</li>
            <li>LOVE HOW SOFT AND SHINY</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite heat protectant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The price is fabulous, deals all over the place on it depending on where you buy, and I truly doubt that the various salon type brands at quadruple the price are any better.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple different heat protectants, and haven&#x27;t found one I&#x27;ve liked until now.</li>
            <li>not only does it help protect my hair, but it leaves it feeling super soft and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a new shampoo I was trying, but I&#x27;ve tried it with more than one shampoo/conditioner now and the effect has stayed.</li>
            <li>safe, when it is not tightly braided.</li>
            <li>I use it before flat ironing and sometimes before blowdrying, and it seems to keep my hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this product on Amazon because it has really saved my hair from damage!</li>
            <li>works pretty well and priced adequately.</li>
            <li>Whatever scent there is fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>and before I flat iron it and my hair always comes out nice and shiny .</li>
            <li>If you put just the right amount, then you can&#x27;t see anything in your hair.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning, unroll my sock and have smooth pretty hair, ready to go.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, this product leaves my hair feeling silky smooth, and it even smells good after putting the iron through it a few times!</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m so happy I bought this because it really left my hair super silky when I flat iron it.  </li>
            <li>suppose that might be considered a good thing if you are solely thinking about protecting your hair from heat, but in my opinion it is not worth having this stuff cover and stick to every surface it comes in contact with.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny but as long as I don&#x27;t over spray it, it gives my hair a nice sheen</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li>Unlike Brilliant Blowout, Tresemme doesn&#x27;t require that you blow dry before flat ironing.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily or heavy and it really cuts down on static and gives your hair a great shine!</li>
            <li>The spray is pretty good, however, what I do is do about three spritzes on my palm and comb it through the bottom half of my damp hair, just right before blow-drying.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t sticky on my hair, had a nice smell and still allowed me to style, straighten, curl, blow dry...</li>
            <li>Offers good heat protection, isn&#x27;t sticky, and leaves a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Then again my hair gets frizzy easily, and is sensitive</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>However, it is a good product non the less.</li>
            <li>Normally when I ran the iron over my hair, my hair was burning hot and I had to wait for it to cool down before touching it to be able to run it through again.</li>
            <li>Wow not sure why so many good reviews for this.</li>
            <li>Nice shine, feels cool and nice not sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>That said, the layers don&#x27;t show very much.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell very much.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like the smell but as long as its doing its job its ok!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve tried something other than Brilliant Blowout and both times were disasters.</li>
            <li>But I did use it before I started blow drying and my hair was super super soft.</li>
            <li>The scent of this one is not at all overpowering, but really nice (like a subtle perfume)  when you put it on and then soon it mostly disappears.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well this helps my hair :p</li>
            <li>The style holds much better throughout the day and I get home with my hair looking the way it did when I left the house in the morning!</li>
            <li>Spray it on and then use your hot tools.</li>
            <li>I will have to compare the prices to see which one would be a better deal as they both have the same results.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product but make sure you don&#x27;t overspray because your hair will get sticky.</li>
            <li>I first read about it on a makeup blog or something and tried it out...</li>
            <li>Hair has grown so much!</li>
            <li>When I first started using a hair straightener</li>
            <li>i also think that when i straighten my hair using this, it keeps the style much longer!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The only reason that i give it four stars is that the spray top doesn&#x27;t always spray even and seems to get stuck a bit at first.</li>
            <li>I first read about it on a makeup blog or something and tried it out...</li>
            <li>First I broke the sprayer trying to get it to work.  </li>
            <li>I bought this exact bottle in stores for $4 in Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>Again, I love it and totally recommend it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why all these people are complaining about the smell its not even noticeable unless you are smelling your hair, which, why are you smelling your hair in the first place?</li>
            <li>This seems to do the same job but for a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She complimented me on how much healthier my hair was, and she couldn&#x27;t find any trace of heat damage!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a product like this</li>
            <li>First off, I always read reviews before I buy things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try using a bit more of the spray next time around.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product several times and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It actually tames my flyaways and keeps my hair smooth all day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this one rated higher than the rest.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one with such an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to use with</li>
            <li>I do know I am not going to risk damaging otherwise perfectly healthy hair by brutalizing it with this stuff on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty neutral.</li>
            <li>And it works really well!</li>
            <li>protection is all what this item is really do !</li>
            <li>This is the first heat protectant I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Believe it or not, the results were with my first use and has continued to improve weekly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>A must have for anyone who styles their hair with hot tools.</li>
            <li>The product itself is pretty great, especially for someone with hair as long as mine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soooo smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This is the first time using this product.</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what it is intended for: my hair is undamaged and in tact after using heat on it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several heat protection sprays but this has found its place among my top 3 favorites.</li>
            <li>Protects my hair from my hot air brush and curling iron...</li>
            <li>My hair was pretty detangled already</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like this product will show immediate and evident results.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I am actually paying more ordering it on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive or half-filled like some products are.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nozzle can be tricky because there is a little button that kind of turns it off if you need to travel with it or have children near your stuff, but the button is right where you&#x27;d put your hand to grab the nozzle and you can easily move it to the off position.</li>
            <li>But as far as the product is concerned, it is really great especially for people having long, straight, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Never flat iron or blow dry my hair without it, holy grail! &amp; great price</li>
            <li>Super duper lightweight spray that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, smells fantastic, really does make a difference with heat damage</li>
            <li>I know lots of other people think it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight longer and is so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li>It left it really soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>My favorite thermal heat protective spray, ive used this spray for a long while now it never fails i have noticed the difference in my hair since i started using it</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice and makes your hair feel soft wtihout the sticky gritty feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair soft and smooth, and very manageable.</li>
            <li>the product serves its purpose, my hair definitely feels different and it was really good for the price.</li>
            <li>It smells OK, a little cheap and fruity like pretty much all the hair care stuff on the shelves these days</li>
            <li>My hair is normally really dry and crisp due to the dyeing and curling I did before, so, I cut it leaving it nice and healthy, but just couldn&#x27;t resist curling again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product has positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything positive.  </li>
            <li>I recently just purchased the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener (which I love) and wanted a new spray to go with it.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I added too much to the ends of my hair the first time, but I&#x27;m not giving up.</li>
            <li>Probably better for those wanting ultra straight, flat hair.</li>
            <li>, it makes my hair feel nice and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle sprays out a fine mist that lightly coats my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Great clean scent...works well for long lasting flat iron hair...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s says its just a heat tamer, but it made my hair super soft and it holds the style.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my hair feel super soft.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to distribute it evenly with a comb and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>hair feels super soft after using&lt;br /&gt;-Love</li>
            <li>Even after months and months of curling, my hair is still super soft an shiny.</li>
            <li>figured since my hair tangles easily and that I might decide to straighten my hair occasionally, that I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my hair is dry, I can&#x27;t tell it is on my hair at all, which I love.  </li>
            <li>Those usualy have strong smell and leave residue to the point that I have to wash my hair same day to relieve it of all of that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps protect from heat, but it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Although I would strongly recommend, you buy this at your local Walgreens..</li>
            <li>so it was great to see her have a different perspective due to me using this spray!</li>
            <li>This product worked so amazingly that after I sprayed it on and went over it with the iron, my hair was straight and not hot to the touch!</li>
            <li>they certainly wouldn&#x27;t publish it so I am using a F. Scott Fitzgerald approach and stipulate &#x27;don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that I might be speaking from pure inexperience.....</li>
            <li>Serves the purpose and extremely easy to apply ..5 sprays for mid length hair is just fine , should last for atleast 30 sessions.</li>
            <li>Great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews here on Amazon, I decided this product was cheap enough to take the risk of purchasing.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I recently decided to style with heat.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier and I don&#x27;t have any more dry ends!</li>
            <li>I feel such a huge difference in my hair when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>I think the Tresemme Runway collection Get Sleek Polish works much better, although you have to be careful not to use too much.  </li>
            <li>It helps maintain it&#x27;s natural shine, soft feeling, and smooth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell a difference really.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It protect my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this heat tamer spray.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very brittle and I do not feel this spray protects my hair at all.</li>
            <li>However I was really suprised by this product.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, my hair looks and feels much healthier</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get split ends as much.  </li>
            <li>Absolute must have if you use any heat tools.</li>
            <li>If I really said in the review how it affected me</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t anything much.</li>
            <li>on the bottle to see how much you&#x27;re getting for your money.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice (reminiscent of a conditioner I had as a child, actually) and it really doesn&#x27;t leave the hair to have a residue.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>and this really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I really havent had any problems with it</li>
            <li>my wife really likes this stuff</li>
            <li>Too much and my hair an feel sticky sometimes with the heat here.</li>
            <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li>to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sprayer head distributes the product very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>but I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks TRESemme&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The lady said my hair was very damaged, and she could tell it was from heat damage.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair look greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spritz it on before any heat treatment and feel like it really is making a difference.</li>
            <li>I bought this item at my local drug store since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>It really helps to protect my hair from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave it a 4 star because it cost too much online..</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the built-in knob (not pictured) to turn the sprayer off.  </li>
            <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li>This stuff really protects your hair.</li>
            <li>That is really unusual for Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>The product works very well and my 16 yr&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li>daughter is the real judge.  </li>
            <li>also did not feel this did much in humidity.</li>
            <li>I use this on my very uncontrolled, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this spray.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this not only because it protects her hair but because it gives her the light weight feel and shine in her hair</li>
            <li>and she can straighten it fast and loves the smell when she is spraying it in her hair</li>
            <li>It works like a heat protector, but i leaves my hair dull/opaque and that&#x27;s a problem because i don&#x27;t use it very often</li>
            <li>She took her liberties though and cut way too much off</li>
            <li>I applied it to my hair when it was still damp and cannot say I like it much.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really linger after your hair is done.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend using it.</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of this spray.  </li>
            <li>Tresemme enriches my hair, makes it look flowely and looks naturally straight or curly or whatever.</li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel, didn&#x27;t have as much body.</li>
            <li>FYI - Much cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li>The nozzle works really well, and the product lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I really like the pump spray.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says, which is protect your hair from heat.  </li>
            <li>I have had one bottle for about 3 years, you don&#x27;t need to spray much.</li>
            <li>and it really does protect it because my hair is not damaged at all.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spray it on every section but lightly cover my entire head and then use the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t use too much at once.</li>
            <li>It really does protect your hair from all hairdryers, curling irons and straight irons.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my hair does not break off as much when using a straightener.</li>
            <li>, I guess it depends on what you are doing to your hair, and how much protection you need.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li>and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I noticed on the bottle it says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s a fantastic tool for instantly transforming all hair textures, enhancing strands&#x27; flexibility to reform and hold</li>
            <li>After using it I find it&#x27;s much, much easier to form curls</li>
            <li>, the smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I used to straighten my hair by using the hair straightener, it really harmful to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast too.</li>
            <li>I really love it and will be buying a few more so that I never run low.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really hurt for that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it works</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much, but I suppose it works well..</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it is really protecting my hair from heat damage as I still get split ends</li>
            <li>Maybe it prevented heat damage, but our heads were not left with a silky, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Tresemme went straight in the trash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a hair product snob, so I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li>Then I do my ironing, or go straight to styling products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li>This one sprays really well</li>
            <li>no matter how much I put in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and it really helps hold my curls.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Once I spray it on, my hair will always be straight even if I leave the curling iron in for longer than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>This arrived earlier then i expected which was good.</li>
            <li>Will be trying something more natural next time.</li>
            <li>I primarily only use this before I blow dry/ straighten my hair, but it keeps my hair silky, soft, and healthy.</li>
            <li>Helps make my hair really soft and makes it so that my hair gets straight without using super high heat on my iron.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily and does exactly what I expected, so five stars for that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first bottle of this, which I bought because I needed a heat protectant to use with a new curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product along with a new (hot tools) curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I sort of retired TRESemme products once I started to buy natural products for my extremely curly hair, however my roommate allowed me to use hers and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Now, my problem first is that I was in walmart and saw pretty much the exact same spray for $4.99.</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky like most other heat protectors do.</li>
            <li>It works better than most products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I have very coarse curly hair</li>
            <li>when flat ironing, curling etc and my hair always feels silky smooth and protected without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>I had been using a different product earlier, which was pretty decent, but wanted to try something better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, not expensive, but a very professional hair treatment</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those with very curly hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I have long, foofy, porous hair, and apply much more to the older hair near the ends.</li>
            <li>And I only used it when I was flatironing my hair on special occasion.  </li>
            <li>Also, I use a bit on dry hair before I straight iron, and it makes the iron run really smoothly over my hair.</li>
            <li>I then blow dry my hair and so far I would say it is just okay</li>
            <li>This worked really well on my sisters very course and very naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle is full when you open the package.</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair very smooth &amp; shiny when used with a blow dryer &amp; round brush.</li>
            <li>What it comes down to, once i adjusted to the way this (and frankly most...)</li>
            <li>Love this heat protective spray it don&#x27;t weight your hair down at all</li>
            <li>It does what it says and it does not not leave a sticky feeling to hair or weigh it down, like most heat protectants do.</li>
            <li>I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t be as drying as spraynet when I need to touch up the curl which is more fragile than usual styles and falls out easily.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a while back based on the great reviews and low cost in comparison to other heat proctectants.</li>
            <li>Immediately applied Brilliant Blowout, blow dried, flat ironed and my hair was back to silky.</li>
            <li>I bought it solely as a heat protectant, but I sometimes even use it when I&#x27;m not blow drying or flat ironing because it leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This really makes your hair both straight &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>, I especially don&#x27;t recommend it for people with more oily hair (obviously)</li>
            <li>and I like it much better than a similar product that I purchased at a local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to use it multiple times with a lot still left over.</li>
            <li>Quick fix especially if you are in a hurry!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But supposedly Not Your Mother&#x27;s heat spray is decent</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market, albeit more expensive.</li>
            <li>Use it with my curling - save my hair from high temperature.</li>
            <li>use high heat to style my hair and always worried about now burning it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell like a product as is a very light spray onto the hair that doesn&#x27;t cause it to be heavy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think drugstore products are in any way comparable to high end products and this is a prime example.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I guess my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing, and not like all the other gross smelling hair products.</li>
            <li>Not ready to give up since other reviews were really good.</li>
            <li>I never got to use this product as the top on the bottle broke and the liquid completely soaked the other contents and box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products and many seem to leave my hair a little oily, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is heavily hi-lighted and my hair really cannot afford too much styling.  </li>
            <li>This product is great because it works with dry and wet hair, flat irons and blow dryiers.</li>
            <li>It makes my straight hair sleek and soft, not greasy and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>my mom even asked me ur hair is this straight and soft from blow drying?</li>
            <li>Hair is soft, straight</li>
            <li>I have always wanted the sleek, straight, soft hair I would always see.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s soft and ready to comb.</li>
            <li>a few times I&#x27;ve had to press it more than once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a few months now, and I love how silky it keeps my hair.</li>
            <li>She said that normally they would recommend me a salon brand heat protectant since I was in a salon, but she told me about Tresemme&#x27;s Heat Tamer spray.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed my hair being \\&quot;protected\\&quot; any more than with my usual hair serums.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times before blow drying or styling and it works ok.</li>
            <li>Today I did only because I was attempting to recreate that salon fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Since using it I have also bought it for a few friends or family members who are really enjoying it also.</li>
            <li>More like a few times a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this few times and its ok, I feel like it leaves a film on my hair.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it has completely dried on your hair before using styling irons.</li>
            <li>This is the first thermal product I have used that actually got me soft,sleek hair that stayed straight all day.</li>
            <li>Great for casual wear with the sun.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it, it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; spray, it feels like water, which was a concern I had, my hair is already thick</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that didn&#x27;t stink like many products do and one that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy, this product fits all of those with a pretty low price!</li>
            <li>Both of these products, the spray part - not only didn&#x27;t spray the product but fell to pieces right before my eyes on the counter.  </li>
            <li>I saw so many sucky reviews I was inspired because their not true!</li>
            <li>basically if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, effective heat protectant that you can use both before you blow dry and before you curl or straighten, definitely buy this little guy!</li>
            <li>It smells great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny rather than stiff like some of the more expensive ones I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to protect my hair as I blow dry it everyday and it looks pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>and they immediately sent me new bottle along with apologies.</li>
            <li>my new 3-barrel waver curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My new fav leave in heat protectand when I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I am not a type of person that runs out to buy every new item out there&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>This is one product that will be on my &#x27;Can&#x27;t live without list&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to BUY a new spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I love using this to help protect my hair when I use a flat iron on it and blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I also love the little lock that they added on the bottle!</li>
            <li>and then again right before I use a flat or curling iron.</li>
            <li>Having high expectations I was surprised at how water based this is.</li>
            <li>every penny leaves your hair shinny and very soft and it protects your hair from heat</li>
            <li>Spritz a little of this on your hair before you apply heat of any kind, be it via flat iron, curling iron/wand, and even your hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I used it again this morning before I blow dried and again before I flat ironed and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>and i show to my step mom ,its funny coz we have the same thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty low price</li>
            <li>I am completely sold on this product after one use!</li>
            <li>There are spray nozzles that actually emit an even, consistent flow in use for hair sprays in Asia (like Liese Juicy Shower), so I don&#x27;t know why Tresseme doesn&#x27;t get on board.</li>
            <li>I have used the Chi Iron Guard for the past year, but this stuff is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>It came out just as soft as it normally would have without anything in it</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>My hair always looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t revert!</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference when I used it for the first time last night when I had to use my blow dryer and straightener.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another similar product that works better on my hair and is easier to spray but unfortunately lots more money.</li>
            <li>but I could use TRESemme&#x27;s Heat Tamer either way (before blow drying or just before straightening) with the same consistent result.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Well, I am a male who purchased the protective spray to use while running a hot comb through my afro.</li>
            <li>I get the same exact one for $3 instead of $6.</li>
            <li>I have bought several since my first time using it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft that I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner anymore!  </li>
            <li>I know that no product can completely prevent damage, but I wish this one did!</li>
            <li>I have never had my hair so soft and not brittle from straightening before!</li>
            <li>This actually works very well!</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft and silky and for an affordable price!</li>
            <li>Not for 4c natural hair!</li>
            <li>no more i can say about it except that this review requires three more words now one two three</li>
            <li>My hair became so straight after blow drying, it was completely straight after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>every which way -- maybe I just haven&#x27;t figured it out, plus I was pretty used to pumps or the standard press spray nozzle</li>
            <li>Actually this was the first one I tried</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 3 year old daughters hair as well, but not just for blow drying, it also works at getting knots out of her hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really floral or sweet or musky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light spray, doesn&#x27;t wear hear down or make it sticky.</li>
            <li>I gave this a shot to help protect my hair from hot ironing due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair is less frizzy and the ends look shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>It dries fast as long as you don&#x27;t spray too much</li>
            <li>So I dont spray it anymore, I actually open the bottle and apply the liquid directly on my damp hair before blow drying ;)</li>
            <li>Especially if you are a frequent blowdryer and hot iron user like our house hold.</li>
            <li>Sadly my supply ran out early since I took the bottle with me on a trip and spilled in my bag. :-p</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because of the numerous positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I will say is</li>
            <li>so I started using curling and flat irons that get up to a relatively high temperature, and I found my hair was getting brittle and very damaged.  </li>
            <li>I find I need to put more on wet hair versus dry</li>
            <li>I spray this in my hair right before I blow dry</li>
            <li>Many of the heat protectant sprays only are approved for use when the hair is dry ONLY.</li>
            <li>I use a few quick sprays of this around the crown of his head and voila!</li>
            <li>This was the first product that I began noticing less and less damage and was able to space out my hair cuts/trims since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Only after doing a few test squeezes in the sink will you manage to get a good flow again, but by that time you&#x27;ve wasted a fairly large amount of product.</li>
            <li>Just needed to clear that up before I review this product...</li>
            <li>Soft and silky hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair ooooo so soft.</li>
            <li>My 25 year old daughter intro&#x27;d me to it</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>my go-to when i&#x27;m low and dont have much money.</li>
            <li>Then slept on it and wore it the whole next day</li>
            <li>I do believe that it has protected my hair from the damage of so much styling, especially compared to what my hair would have been without using any heat protective.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything even in it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it being a direct result of using a heat</li>
            <li>I have mid-back natural curly hair</li>
            <li>It goes on softly, non-sticky.</li>
            <li>Despite what the instructions on the bottle say, this can’t be use directly with heat styling tools.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 of these so far</li>
            <li>and it always breaks on me near the end of it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it now twice, and it leaves my hair totally soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Helps protect my hair and keep it soft after using heat.</li>
            <li>leave your hair straightened/curled, &amp; feeling soft</li>
            <li>but at least it&#x27;s much better and cheaper than CHI.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair a lil soft but not too soft</li>
            <li>Its not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;t notice it did much for my hair - it wasn&#x27;t necessarily smoother, shinier, silkier or anything.</li>
            <li>People with red hair know that the texture of red hair is somewhat more coarse than blonde or brown.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky soft, yet manageable with it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>Lightweight, not sticky or greasy, leaves hair soft and shiny n def helps with reducing and protecting from heat damage.</li>
            <li>(conditioner included) will eventually cause damage to your hair because it leaves a residue on the hairs that overtime will build up and strip the hair from its natural oils, etc.</li>
            <li>It smells so yummy and makes my hair so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>Too much fragrance for me - can&#x27;t stand constantly smelling something in my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and I wear it in 2 strand twist</li>
            <li>there is such a thing as too much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spray directly on my hair before use, I spray in my hand to control the amount used I feel like it leaves my hair straw feeling.  </li>
            <li>Gave to my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so smooth,so soft and keeps it from tangling.</li>
            <li>this product, so far, has answered the call.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and the fly-aways are eliminated when I use TRESemme Thermal.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>really did notice a big difference.</li>
            <li>Actually this stuff is very awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft and flowy.</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>I spray this on my damp hair after rinsing the conditioner out and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if this really protects my hair, though.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I like ti so far.</li>
            <li>The box was completely  wrapped in cellophane in order to complete the trip.</li>
            <li>This heat tamer spray is affordable and makes your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It feels pleasantly soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I bought this in hopes that I would be able to minimize at least SOME of the damage I was doing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t like products that are heavy, this one is so light.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used it three times</li>
            <li>I guess so far.</li>
            <li>Granted I had to be a bit heavy handed with my hair to make sure it got to all of it but who cares when it actually works!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been known to have pretty dry and split ends.</li>
            <li>Came across it on Amazon and decided to give it a try considering how dry my hair can become when using a hot comb.</li>
            <li>It took me hours to clean the bathroom (and I&#x27;m no clean freak</li>
            <li>Trying to flat iron natural hair is a task and this heat protectant didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair shiny and makes a real difference when I apply before using the blow dryer or flat iron.</li>
            <li>After I bought and received this product I went to walmart and found the same exact one same size and everything for$ 3.70 cheaper.</li>
            <li>The Get Sleek spray is a decent product but not one I use regularly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product necessarily protects my hair from the heat, which I don&#x27;t use a lot of heat products on my hair, it mostly stays up in a bun 99% of the time, but When I do use heat products, I use this on my hair when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried to use it sparingly, and my hair still ended up quite dry, so I added a little more.</li>
            <li>If you can shop locally, check it out at Walmart where it is available for less than $4.</li>
            <li>I use low heat setting on my hair dryer and don&#x27;t use a straightener and my hair is frizzier than normal.</li>
            <li>When you uses it it will make a sizzling noise which was alarming at first.</li>
            <li>I have purchased two bottles on different occasions, and the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; on each sprayer was different, although both are located on the neck of the sprayer, one of which wasn&#x27;t obviously apparent to me when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good but not great if you&#x27;re not ok with smells</li>
            <li>This spray is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t load down my hair or make it look greasy, and doesn&#x27;t stink like rancid fruit like so many other hair products, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair, and the spray didn&#x27;t work well for me--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redken thermal protection which was very oily and CHI which was a little sticky, not a lot but very pricey in comparison to Tresemme.</li>
            <li>Easy to spray hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>only reason I give it a 4-star because I didn&#x27;t care much for the spray -- just didn&#x27;t work with me in terms of spraying directly onto hair -- unless your hair is long and you can dangle it over to the side and spray directly on it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off also cutting down your washing and allowing your own hair oils to act in the same protective way.</li>
            <li>I then proceeded with my new curling iron to try and put some curl back in.</li>
            <li>I blew it dry and immediately noticed a much silkier texture to my hair.</li>
            <li>, I think it will be a while until I notice if it really protects my hair from heat or not (once I see that my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out or burn out) .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed so my hair doesn&#x27;t really fall into either traditional category.</li>
            <li>I never liked the strong cologne scent and felt it made my hair sticky.  </li>
            <li>Okay let me just say that I am Hispanic and part Native American which means I have extremely THICK hair</li>
            <li>But after using this religiously, I barely saw any split ends!</li>
            <li>I typically use this, dry my hair, flat iron and then top it off with just a bit of an anti-humidity hair spray</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the lock button doesn&#x27;t stop it from coming out very well, so my walmart bag got kind of messy, so</li>
            <li>It actually left my hair feeling very soft and smooth, and it helped with flyaways, which usually kill my entire look!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to the world of curling irons and flat irons</li>
            <li>Not great on me, but great for my little guy!</li>
            <li>The price is hard to beat at $8- with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I also deal with oily hair, so this product not leaving behind any residue is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing things about the TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray for the past few years.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t use conditioner on my hair, either.</li>
            <li>It has been bleached a lighter blonde than my natural color</li>
            <li>I combed my hair, then spritzed on this product and could barely get the comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>O.o...)</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on expesive hair products</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I was surprised to notice during my last trip to Walmart that I could have gotten this $3 cheaper.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am used to 100% natural naked hair?</li>
            <li>Do be careful not to put too much product in or else</li>
            <li>No matter what I do, I cannot get it out of the carpets near the bathroom - from simply ONE USE of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They shipped product separately without any extra charge just so I could receive it early.</li>
            <li>I have relatively curly hair, so I want to protect my hair when I apply a lot of direct heat to it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised because if you use a light enough hand in spraying this on, it is not in the least bit gunky or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It is light-weight, it works well with my thick hair, and made it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>frustrating with most products.</li>
            <li>kind of weird</li>
            <li>I use it when I blow dry and the occasional iron, and so far you&#x27;ll have to simply have to know how much you should put on your hair.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all, very slick feeling, and when I curl, the curls feel super bouncy!</li>
            <li>I wish it was a different type of spray, but I can live with it because I&#x27;ve tried over 5 different sprays...</li>
            <li>Since this is the only new product in my routine, I can only think that this item is to blame.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and almost every product I use has some major flaw -- makes my hair look lifeless, or dull, or smells too strong.  </li>
            <li>At first I was using a lot, as it turned out, but then I kept clarifying my hair of the product and using less of it.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that it isn&#x27;t expensive, yet it performs better than some of the more expensive products out there.</li>
            <li>but as feared, I gave it its first wash today and blew dry it (which I never do, I always air dry) and used this product.</li>
            <li>before I flat ironed it because I have natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels incredibly soft when using it with my blow dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li>before I flat ironed my hair and it makes it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other Heat Protective Spray, but this one works very well.  </li>
            <li>does wonders for every hairstyle, whether it would be straight to curling your hair, it works alongside with other products, ie styling gel, spray mousse.</li>
            <li>I kept the flat iron heat at 350 to 375 and there was no heat damage that I could see once I washed my hair to return it to its natural state.</li>
            <li>Bought this for using my flat iron as well as blow dryer and my hair always feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I blow dry and flat iron my hair every day and it really started to take a toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this spray on my hair before every blow dry or hair straightening I do, whether my hair is wet or dry, and it always leaves it feeling so silky and light afterwards, it feels like I just paid to get a deep condition!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it this once so far, but I am definitely going to be using this often.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair</li>
            <li>Love the scent also, I am addicted to it, I&#x27;ll always have some extra bottles in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>This came in super quick, but unfortunately this was more expensive than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Unlike cheaper products this will not dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a lovely smell, which is an added plus for me as I find many hair products smell truly sickening.  </li>
            <li>The spray nozzle lets out a steady mist, covering my hair in the expected places.</li>
            <li>* better used when using a hair dryer or straightener comes out a little stiff just on its own.*&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li>The hair stay bouncy and not bone dry , very natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why my experience is so different from most other users.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been maintaining my below-the-hip long hair for several years now (18 years, to be precise), and of late my hair has been complaining about all the blow drying after frequent hairwashes.</li>
            <li>The other spray I used made my hair feel a little sticky, but this spray is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m basically obsessed with this product right now!!!</li>
            <li>so I prefer products which leave some natural body in my hair so that it isn&#x27;t flat to my head by mid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only used one other heat protective spray, but I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited and anxious about getting this product, once I finally received it the bottle was still wrapped in plastic but only a fourth of liquids in a 8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>I started to use this after getting a fresh haircut and usually a month or two after getting my hair cut</li>
            <li>This was highly rated on Amazon, so I bought it since I needed something to protect my hair from my straightener, but it left my hair feeling very dry and processed after.</li>
            <li>The packaging was a little sloppy but it kept the product safe which is  all the really matters.</li>
            <li>It keeps the frizzies away during humid spells, helps keep my hair soft and hydrated even when I blow dry it</li>
            <li>that is wet or even slightly damp, this will burn your hair to a crisp!</li>
            <li>I have used a few heat protectants and because of all the positive reviews I chose to give this one a shot.</li>
            <li>It also feels great the next day and doesn&#x27;t look dirty or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and tight curls, so straightening my hair always took a toll.</li>
            <li>Moreover, it is lightweight and glides on smoothly without making my hair feel greasy or crunchy, unlike other thermal sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s the very dry type of hair and is naturally frizzy...</li>
            <li>, it smells nice and is only sticky when it&#x27;s still wet on your hair, once you blow dry there is no noticeable residue left behind.</li>
            <li>Hard to spray my own hair due to the really odd</li>
            <li>If you straighten or curl or blow dry your hair on a regular basis, I would definitely recommend this to you, and I think you will see a major difference in your hair!</li>
            <li>Its hard to gauge the success of the product overall,  </li>
            <li>So imagine how felt when something I was so ready to receive was so disappointing and was not able to receive a new bottle on the hassle of a return!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This Tresemme spray is awesome!</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I used to just use Tresemme Thermal Creations Curl Activator Spray by itself to form curls, but decided it&#x27;s probably best to get some heat protection.    </li>
            <li> and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Her hair isn&#x27;t always the best when it comes to holding in curls or straightening.</li>
            <li> This works great for her!</li>
            <li> This product works great!</li>
            <li> excellent price for quality product...</li>
            <li> Great smell!</li>
            <li> I am impressed!</li>
            <li> so although the product may awesome never got to experience it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel and smell great!</li>
            <li> Great product!  </li>
            <li> Great scent!</li>
            <li> TRESemme for the win!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells so good!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It protects the hair, leaving an awesome shine without a tacky, oily or sticky finish!!!</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair</li>
            <li> I resolved this by picking up an aluminum mister I saw at the container store, which has worked perfectly for me (although some reviewers seem to have had issues).</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my 4b hair!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> However, this one has a pleasant smell and it softens and detangles too!</li>
            <li> Very good product</li>
            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> It works great and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> The best part is that, to me, it smells great, almost like a hair salon product.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells good!!!</li>
            <li> Does its job perfectly and smells great.</li>
            <li> The bottle provides great instructions on the best way to apply...follow them.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> So I bought it and loved it!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this heat tamer protective spray about a month ago and I loved it!</li>
            <li> It seems to protect my hair and make it smell good too!</li>
            <li> It smells SO good and does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a product like this before, but I guess it must be good if it isn&#x27;t doing any damage!</li>

            <li> so Im happy</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great spray, and it protects without weighting or dirtying your hair</li>

            <li> It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the product is great.</li>
            <li> After she did it, she curled it for me and it looked great</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue either, which is great since I wash my hair every 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that i can keep my hair in great condition with this.</li>
            <li> This works great to protect my hair when i put the curling iron to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This item is good for the price you pay</li>
            <li> For a cheap brand item this is awesome!</li>
            <li> Good price and good smell.</li>

            <li> Works good for any heating tool or blow dryer......</li>
            <li> Hello good deal, I bought mine at Walmart for $3.98.</li>
            <li> look good</li>
            <li> product smells good</li>
            <li> Besides that, its a good product.</li>
            <li> Cheap wonderful product!</li>
            <li> it is a good product that makes your hair feel</li>
            <li> the shape and design of the bottle and spray nozzle are somewhat add to get a good hold on.</li>
            <li> fact, I bought this after a lot of research online, and I made a good decision on this indeed!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I started using this a year ago and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> It smells SOOOO good</li>
            <li> I feel like i&#x27;m doing something good for my hair</li>
            <li> but I think those that seem to like it will soon discover that their hair isn&#x27;t in as good condition as they though it was and probably is fried when all is said and done.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and nice-smelling, which is perfect because flat-ironing and blow-drying cause a burned smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works really good</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, protects my hair, and oh my god makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> or I would have incredible static and fried ends.</li>
            <li> BOTTOM LINE - a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> so I guess its good.</li>
            <li> good good</li>
            <li> Really a good protection of heat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> good service, and</li>
            <li> If there are better products out there, I&#x27;ll never find out as this works perfectly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome and makes my hair nice and smooth when I am done.  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> My first sprits and straighten was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Something of which wasn&#x27;t very appealing, honestly.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this again for sure!</li>
            <li> and I love this product!  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Also, the pieces in the front of my hair never curl, so I tried spraying a bit more in the front before I use my curler, and it made them hold the curl!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for something better for my hair!</li>
            <li> My husband and kids love how it makes my hair smell too!</li>
            <li> I end up getting more all over my hands than I do on my hair!  </li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, the mist has great coverage, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all.</li>
            <li> As you can see from my main profile picture I try my best to protect my hair from heat styling and for the most part it does look great when I style it myself - and I&#x27;m not even a hair stylist connoisseur.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and gives my hair a lovely shine!</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy, color-treated hair and this spray works so great when I combine it with my anti-frizz serum and use my straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I can use this for heat free styling like my sock bun as well as heat styling to protect and give silky shine.</li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is really light.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing...</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and gives my hair a nice shine after heat styling.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a heat spray, but I don&#x27;t see any amazing results with it.</li>
            <li> This spray is so amazing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just letting everybody know that this product is totally amazing.</li>
            <li> so my hair can stay protected while still looking amazing.</li>
            <li> Feels light while giving hair great protection.  </li>
            <li> Hasa nice scent too.</li>
            <li> It keeps it straight, protected, healthy-looking, and gives it a great shine too!</li>
            <li> It also smells SOOOO good :)</li>
            <li> Smell nice , does the work .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell really nice.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s more than a good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather smell my own burnt hair than walk around smelling like this for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Also, this is priced a good $3+ more than purchasing from Target, Ulta, or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this I didn&#x27;t realize that it came with two bottles so that was nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and the feel on my hair was nice as well.</li>
            <li> There was nothing damaged on this item and it worked perfectly for what I was looking for and makes your hair smells really good and feel soft without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just really nice to use to get rid of the frizz</li>
            <li> and it still makes my hair look nice.</li>
            <li> Good for people who love to expose their hair with the hair dryer, heat iron etc...</li>
            <li> well it didn&#x27;t work my hair got kind of frizzy.</li>
            <li> Smells nice  </li>
            <li> It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> Is awesome and it really protect the hair from heat damage.</li>
            <li> I love products that smells good</li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> it goes great, though i think i love the dove better the dove</li>
            <li> This works effectively for use before blow drying.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews regarding this item, so I decided to purchase it and give it a try...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own heat protectant</li>
            <li> this one I am happy I did it really works great</li>
            <li> it has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and does the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t buy it again honestly.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with heat and shine sprays, so I can&#x27;t compare them to others or even evaluate it on its own merits.</li>
            <li> If you want a good protective spray ION makes a much better one than this.  </li>
            <li> I took a flyer on this product since the reviews were mostly good, and was pleased to discover this spray</li>

            <li> Very satisfied with this seller :)</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> My fine textured hair was shiny, but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products specifically for straightening my hair and this combo (gel &amp; protective spray) is by far the best I have come across.</li>
            <li> but it smells great and gives me a sense of worth knowing that I AM protecting my hair.</li>
            <li> and this is the best BY FAR.</li>
            <li> I liked the seller (PharmaSave) even more.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is necessarily comfortable to use positioning wise</li>
            <li> and it smells nice :)</li>
            <li> This has been protecting my hair for years, it also have a really nice refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best heat protector I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> Super easy to use, smells so good, and has lasted me almost six months now!</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant - much more feminine than those cologne-types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Overall, if your looking for an effective heat protectant at a wonderful price</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the great Amazon reviews and because it was a lot more economical than what they sell in salons.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and I&#x27;m assuming it must be good for my hair, LOL.</li>
            <li> A light mist from about 6-8 inches from the hair is the best way to go, and works very well.</li>
            <li> Nice, light spray in a handy pump.  </li>
            <li> I know, not that smart, but it sure smells good!</li>
            <li> At first I loved it cause it smelled good, but through out the day, I noticed my hair started becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li> Great product and keeps my hair from looking damaged after using hot tools.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, not flowery, but just a clean kind of smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and it is very light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.it is very light and non sticky</li>
            <li> It also smells pleasant and fresh.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s kind of fine in texture.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, fine mist of product.</li>
            <li> That is huge for me!  </li>
            <li> love this brand ..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use Tresemme for my hair care needs.</li>
            <li> I also use it at night as a setting spray if I&#x27;m going to roll my hair up in a sock bun to preserve my silky smooth blow out and give me a nice flip out on the ends.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this on the ends my hair doesn&#x27;t come out with any flip to it, just more of a wimpy bend.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not any better than Pantene.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the magic is</li>
            <li> and I have to say I do kinda love it.</li>
            <li> When I curled my hair after spraying this product, my hair looked shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Then I just use my trusted tresemme and love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s livelier and feels better.  </li>
            <li> Even when I don&#x27;t need a heat protectant, I use it because it makes my hair just better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the design of the spray trigger.</li>
            <li> However, there are better out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too pleased with this product.   </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have more hair than most people.  </li>
            <li> Way better than Tresemee.</li>
            <li> This stuff has kept the ends looking healthy and has prevented my hair from drying out or ever smelling burnt when using heating tools.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells great and left my hair smelling wonderfully throughout the whole day.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I made this purchase and will be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on it.</li>
            <li> claim to love it, but it just made my hair feel so sticky and look poofy.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and makes my hair look.</li>
            <li> My hair instantly felt sleek and healthy, smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell and like how it doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair or make it feel sticky.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great....wish it smelled better....</li>
            <li> I love all of their products because they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li> if you used to style your hair with heat you had better to buy it, it will protect your hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light and doesnt leave my hair feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I don’t think that I’ll be using this product again as I’m looking for something a bit more versatile.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> It helps prevent more hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Rather it&#x27;s for my real hair or weave lol.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrant it has.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I don&#x27;t use heat very often and when I do I use really great tools to help prevent damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it is protecting my hair either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> have it on sale for a even better price</li>
            <li> so just be sure to look out for that</li>
            <li> Great product as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it..</li>
            <li> But I still used it because I figured it was better than no protectant at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t saturate hair like most sprays</li>
            <li> but I found myself using this one more and more for just that.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> but, All in all..it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Protected my hair from the heat while not making it oily :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Many of the products that I have tried before (and have tried MANY)</li>
            <li> Your hair will become more softer.</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the Chi Iron Guard 44....not any more.  </li>
            <li> If I use more then hair is oily for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to just use it on the ends of my hair, or give it to someone with better hair than I have.  </li>
            <li> how many months it&#x27;s going to take to dissipate from the carpeting.</li>
            <li> I love this heat protectant.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I was using organic root stimulator&#x27;s olive oil protection serum, but this is so much better and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> love this product and defenatley will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this heat tamer</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> nothing over the top about product</li>
            <li> Better than Chi heat protectant for sure.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my hair feel great after use.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s lightweight and has a lovely scent to it too.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This spray made my hair look more shiny, even when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find the Get Sleek spray in the stores in my area anymore</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m just going to list what I love about it :)</li>
            <li> If you are going to buy I would look for the best price for only one bottle.</li>
            <li> I also used the TRESemme Thermal Creations Volumising Mousse too, but this was much better.</li>
            <li> is not a fault of the prodcut, but more the packaging.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the spray bottle itself as well.</li>
            <li> like the way the top was designed because liquid leaked when I packed it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> I love this spray.</li>
            <li> The thing that I love about it is that it&#x27;s affordable</li>
            <li> and I think my hair is better protected at home then in the salon.</li>
            <li> There have been many times that people ask me if I went to the salon to get my hair done and the answer is -</li>
            <li> I am trying to do more grown-up hairstyles</li>
            <li> The product smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I found that my hair breaks off much more after use, han it did without this &#x27;thermal protection&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t really do anything but make your hair smell kind of good after straightening.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product are great, however, I tried it and didn&#x27;t care so much for it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t go well on my brazilian hair but works okay on my hair</li>
            <li> When it comes to my hair, I want better performance.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t renew my prime because I seem to end up spending more...</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I use it without any heat sometimes because I love the feel of my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it really protects the hair well.</li>

            <li> I am in love with this product; there is nothing better on the market to protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I love using this for blow-drying, straightening, curling,</li>
            <li> Love the smell..</li>
            <li> Sprays easily, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells ok</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I tighten the top it still leaks out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product, and will be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but maybe I am just not a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; person after all</li>
            <li> Not very expensive and yet I feel like it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more very soon!!!!</li>
            <li> However, it is very hot where I live and this spray does an excellent job of keeping away frizz.  </li>
            <li> normally use pureshine Brilliant Blowout, a keratin product that leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> smells great and isn&#x27;t sticky like my high end hair products.</li>
            <li> Makes my dry, color treated hair silky, good smelling and looking great.</li>
            <li> It works really well and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally care for this brand because of the scent of their products but this one is great.</li>
            <li> First, it smells good.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is pretty good because it protects my hair when I&#x27;m straightening it and reduces my split ends, which is all I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using this product, I had read good reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle is fantastic at getting a very fine mist on my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it is cheaply made and breaks easily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to keep using it!</li>
            <li> easy squirt bottle top.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle it comes in, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best heat tamer I&#x27;ve ever used and smells FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and makes my hair feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> I also love that it sprays out as a fine mist</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is very good</li>
            <li> Need a better nozzle to lightly spray hair.</li>
            <li> My hair just felt light, smooth, and most of all healthy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it with a straightener or blow dryer, but I love how smooth it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, it also minimizes my hair from becoming frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It protects, leaves your hair soft, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and shiny my hair feels after I spray with this - then proceed to straighten or curl.</li>
            <li> and it makes it smooth and keeps my hair looking healthy and not oily.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and the bottle is a good size.</li>
            <li> This smells good and works really well.</li>
            <li> This worked good and was reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and smells really nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> a good product thanks tresemme</li>
            <li> It really smells good.</li>
            <li> Until I find the right kind of curlers to set my hair in overnight</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good, and doesn&#x27;t cause any build up, I no longer have anymore split ends!</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair more manageable, it is a unique product that helps the hair and not damaged it.  </li>
            <li> Full marks for that!</li>
            <li> But all-in-all, DEFINITELY worth it!:)</li>
            <li> Other than that it is the best heat protector!</li>
            <li> and I can proudly say that this product has kept me completely split end free since.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, it goes on light, it gives my hair more volume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use with the trigger nozzle.</li>
            <li> I have clean healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and was not damaged</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to lug around in a bag</li>
            <li> and I can easily straighten my hair without any worry of it burning.  </li>
            <li> it works great with thick hair great product</li>
            <li> Easy to comb through &amp; not sticky.</li>
            <li> Spray is to strong coming up</li>
            <li> What I really admired most about this product was how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li> product has a strong, feminine scent that somewhat lingers on the user.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a good reliable product, that will&lt;br /&gt;- protect your hair from sizzle when using high heat irons</li>
            <li> and I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> This one is really good as a thermal protectant and my hair not only feels super smooth, but also smells good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with high level of customer service and with the product!    </li>
            <li> This product works great, my hair looks healthy even after I flat iron it now.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and my hair hasn&#x27;t been burned to a crisp</li>
            <li> Sometimes after you straighten your hair, there might be a smell, but after using this your hair will smell really nice even after applying so much pressure and heat onto it!</li>
            <li> I love it soo much and it make my haire look fresh and healthy and its have agood and nice smell for your haire.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, I have wavy, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is fine, easier than going to the grocery store to buy on Amazon</li>
            <li> As for just using before I blowdry, I think it is fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s prise fine.</li>
            <li> of this being said, if you have a one step process, shake the bottle before using, and don’t over spray, the product seems to work fine as a heat protectant and it makes the hair feel “silky.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for anyone using heat daily on their hair whether they are using curling irons or hot air blower.  </li>
            <li> The spray is so fine</li>
            <li> Used it, works fine</li>
            <li> Came quickly and just as described!</li>
            <li> SMells so good and makes hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Works well, smells good, makes my hair soft too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a drugstore product buyer and for good reason.  </li>
            <li> This makes this product less than ideal for touching up or adjusting with heat styling tools.</li>
            <li> Super light and not sticky like so many hair products.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, and the price is super cheap!</li>
            <li> I have never used such an easy great product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, it is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, and it even has a nice gentle smell to it - nothing too strong.</li>
            <li> My hair is a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> Light feeling in hair.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and I feel that it works just as nicely in comparison to the Nexus version which is twice as much.</li>
            <li> Honestly this stuff hasn&#x27;t only protected my hair from heat, but makes my hair look so much more healthy.</li>
            <li> so I really need some kind of protection on it if I want it to grow without breakage.    </li>
            <li> I purchase both the &#x27;smooth&#x27; heat protector and this Tresemme&#x27; tamer protector.  </li>
            <li> but I must say given the fact that their spray is so fantastic I might have to try their line of shampoos and conditioners as well.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try it because it has such great reviews and people</li>
            <li> Works very well, nice smell.</li>
            <li> okay makes your hair oily after a day though not crazy oily but noticeable</li>
            <li> The bottle size seemed to fit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, it moisturizes my hair and it has a comfortable smell.</li>
            <li> It is light and it protects my hair, but it did not add any shine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be using this product again, if you already use some kind of leave in serum or oils you don&#x27;t really need this.</li>
            <li> Light weight and sprays evenly.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit off putting for me, but my friends enjoy the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only heat protectant I use, seems to work great</li>
            <li> You get your money worth but it just wish more came in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> The hair are silky , light and not stick together&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> this is a great product when using heat stylers regularly on your hair.  </li>
            <li> It greatly improves the overall appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s available on Amazon</li>
            <li> leaves my hair silky and smooth after curling or drying.</li>
            <li> &quot; I thought that was a nice bonus, but didn&#x27;t think much of it since it&#x27;s a heat protective spray.    </li>
            <li> after I using this stuff, my hair look smooth and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second order.. GREAT.</li>
            <li> Use a light spray only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling light, nourished and protected.</li>
            <li> For example, if you have flat-ironed your hair and want to curl the ends but have the kind of hair that curls when wet, this would not be a good option for the task at hand.</li>
            <li> This is really good for those who love styling their hair with curler and waver like me, as it can protect your hair from being damaged because of the heat coming from such hairstyling tools.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny and is a good heat protectant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to immediately curl or straighten my hair after using, and my hair comes out sleek and shiny, which is a good enough sign to me that it&#x27;s being protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing super special.</li>
            <li> Works great to product my very fine hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> ( shipping was SUPER fast) and I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> ORDERING ONE MORE RIGHT NOW!!!!❤</li>
            <li> I have fine, bleached hair and this left my hair feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this before I flat iron my hair and my daughter uses it before she blow drys, either way you choose to use it, it Provides great protection.</li>
            <li> Great heat protection for blow drying and flat ironing and</li>
            <li> If you routinely use hot curlers or curling iron on your hair, this is great for protecting it from the heat damage and helps to keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is second day after using this product the hair are still fresh and beautiful , don;t have to do anything</li>
            <li> I wanted something more to it, like redkin&#x27;s hot sets or iron shape/</li>
            <li> and I was really excited.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using a heat protectant, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I still say if you can avoid using hot irons, blow dryers, etc you&#x27;re better off.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it because i got this waver for my hair and thought i should get a protectant spray for the heat,</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> And she is pretty pleased with the spray.</li>
            <li> but it is completely worth buying it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> Its as if the product actually absorbed the heat!</li>
            <li> It is a great heat protectant and does not leave any kind of sticky or hard residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> Makes ur hair feel soft and smells AMAZING</li>
            <li> It is relatively cheap, lasts a long time, and smells soo good.</li>
            <li> It smells great, leaves my hair so healthy and shiny when my hair is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> The packaging has not proven great for travel, as no matter how carefully packed, the bottle has leaked, albeit into the freezer bag</li>
            <li> To be fair, the hair looks great the first day, but definitely needs to be washed next morning...</li>
            <li> I want my hair straight and safe.</li>
            <li> and itll last me a fair while...  for the price, and its effectablility i give it a five.</li>
            <li> It does give a nice shiny appearance after straightening, but I just don&#x27;t think its worth the price, especially since there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hair stylist and use this every day on my own hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Target store after hearing good reviews about it online.</li>
            <li> The smell is overly sweet and gives me headaches.</li>
            <li> I expect a full refund</li>
            <li> Overall really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true to name, &amp; it helps protect my hair from the heat..</li>
            <li> My husband always comments on how nice it smells when I use it, and I completely agree.</li>
            <li> I use a couple sprays around my head when I&#x27;m ready to start styling, pick up the top layers and spray a bit underneath, and run my fingers through my hair to distribute.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again, considering the great smell, effective product, and low price.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my Daughters hair it helps control the frizz and makes it more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I can&#x27;t travel away from home or spend a night without it.</li>
            <li> Only a good smell and silky hair.</li>
            <li> and I can already see this bottle will last me a good couple of months.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li> I love this product for both natural hair and virgin extensions!!!</li>
            <li> Okay so I have very FINE BLONDE hair, dyed, and straightened/curled/whathaveyou every day.</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to spray on my hair, wish hairspray had the same kind of trigger.</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair had a beautiful bounce and shine to it after I finished flat ironing my wavy hair straight.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it with other products and it works just as great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome prduct and i seriously recommend it.</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li> protects the hair, doesn&#x27;t leave it silky and amazing but it works well enough and is cheap.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more soft and smooth than it ever has before.</li>
            <li> quick tip...</li>
            <li> Luckily, it was wrapped in a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> Whatever mild smell this has wears away after a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells good, but I don&#x27;t really smell it throughout the day or anything, if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many different heat sprays and I love this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally curly and frizzes up very easily.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has a pleasant smell, makes my hair even softer, and best of all it seems to tame by thick, extremely fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my long fair feel smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair now have the best protection from my hot tools, but I only wash my hair every 3 or so days and this stuff really keeps it smelling great even on the 3rd day!</li>
            <li> My hair is baby soft and very fine</li>
            <li> new containers have a better mechanism to lock.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY buy this product: inexpensive, lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s the perfect product for any hair!!</li>
            <li> I really feel like it protect my hair, leave it shiny, and it helps the iron slide easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I really like the lock/unlock feature of the pump (now it won&#x27;t accidentally spray in my travel bags).</li>
            <li> Okay so I actually love this product, HOWEVER, I only used it a few time and the top broke!!</li>
            <li> After I used this product for the first time I was amazed!</li>
            <li> I really like how it finely mists your hair.</li>
            <li> It does its job, smells great and leaves my hair a little softer.</li>
            <li> If I have more time with testing other heat-protectant sprays, I could easily give this four or five stars!</li>
            <li> She saw them at a local store and stocked up, and she decided to show me how amazing it was.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and always available, I found my at Walgreens for $4.99.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and my hair felt really silky after curling it.</li>
            <li> I feel this is the kind of product that will work differently on everyone.</li>
            <li> The spray comes out in a wide mist so gives good coverage on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am always trying different protectors and have had my way with fairly nice sprays.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of my sister, who knows far more about hair care than I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a shopper that looks for what I want, but also offers the most for the cheapest</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrant smell that last all day!</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> I used it before blow-drying and was happy with the way it left my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> one smelled better nd left my hair smooth, not with this one though.</li>
            <li> LOVE HOW SOFT AND SHINY</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite heat protectant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The price is fabulous, deals all over the place on it depending on where you buy, and I truly doubt that the various salon type brands at quadruple the price are any better.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different heat protectants, and haven&#x27;t found one I&#x27;ve liked until now.</li>
            <li> not only does it help protect my hair, but it leaves it feeling super soft and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a new shampoo I was trying, but I&#x27;ve tried it with more than one shampoo/conditioner now and the effect has stayed.</li>
            <li> safe, when it is not tightly braided.</li>
            <li> I use it before flat ironing and sometimes before blowdrying, and it seems to keep my hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found this product on Amazon because it has really saved my hair from damage!</li>
            <li> works pretty well and priced adequately.</li>
            <li> Whatever scent there is fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> and before I flat iron it and my hair always comes out nice and shiny .</li>
            <li> If you put just the right amount, then you can&#x27;t see anything in your hair.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning, unroll my sock and have smooth pretty hair, ready to go.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, this product leaves my hair feeling silky smooth, and it even smells good after putting the iron through it a few times!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m so happy I bought this because it really left my hair super silky when I flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> suppose that might be considered a good thing if you are solely thinking about protecting your hair from heat, but in my opinion it is not worth having this stuff cover and stick to every surface it comes in contact with.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny but as long as I don&#x27;t over spray it, it gives my hair a nice sheen</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> Unlike Brilliant Blowout, Tresemme doesn&#x27;t require that you blow dry before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily or heavy and it really cuts down on static and gives your hair a great shine!</li>
            <li> The spray is pretty good, however, what I do is do about three spritzes on my palm and comb it through the bottom half of my damp hair, just right before blow-drying.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t sticky on my hair, had a nice smell and still allowed me to style, straighten, curl, blow dry...</li>
            <li> Offers good heat protection, isn&#x27;t sticky, and leaves a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Then again my hair gets frizzy easily, and is sensitive</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> However, it is a good product non the less.</li>
            <li> Normally when I ran the iron over my hair, my hair was burning hot and I had to wait for it to cool down before touching it to be able to run it through again.</li>
            <li> Wow not sure why so many good reviews for this.</li>
            <li> Nice shine, feels cool and nice not sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> That said, the layers don&#x27;t show very much.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell very much.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like the smell but as long as its doing its job its ok!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve tried something other than Brilliant Blowout and both times were disasters.</li>
            <li> But I did use it before I started blow drying and my hair was super super soft.</li>
            <li> The scent of this one is not at all overpowering, but really nice (like a subtle perfume)  when you put it on and then soon it mostly disappears.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this helps my hair :p</li>
            <li> The style holds much better throughout the day and I get home with my hair looking the way it did when I left the house in the morning!</li>
            <li> Spray it on and then use your hot tools.</li>
            <li> I will have to compare the prices to see which one would be a better deal as they both have the same results.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product but make sure you don&#x27;t overspray because your hair will get sticky.</li>
            <li> I first read about it on a makeup blog or something and tried it out...</li>
            <li> Hair has grown so much!</li>
            <li> When I first started using a hair straightener</li>
            <li> i also think that when i straighten my hair using this, it keeps the style much longer!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The only reason that i give it four stars is that the spray top doesn&#x27;t always spray even and seems to get stuck a bit at first.</li>
            <li> I first read about it on a makeup blog or something and tried it out...</li>
            <li> First I broke the sprayer trying to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> I bought this exact bottle in stores for $4 in Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> Again, I love it and totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why all these people are complaining about the smell its not even noticeable unless you are smelling your hair, which, why are you smelling your hair in the first place?</li>
            <li> This seems to do the same job but for a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She complimented me on how much healthier my hair was, and she couldn&#x27;t find any trace of heat damage!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this</li>
            <li> First off, I always read reviews before I buy things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try using a bit more of the spray next time around.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It actually tames my flyaways and keeps my hair smooth all day!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this one rated higher than the rest.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one with such an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to use with</li>
            <li> I do know I am not going to risk damaging otherwise perfectly healthy hair by brutalizing it with this stuff on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty neutral.</li>
            <li> And it works really well!</li>
            <li> protection is all what this item is really do !</li>
            <li> This is the first heat protectant I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, the results were with my first use and has continued to improve weekly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who styles their hair with hot tools.</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty great, especially for someone with hair as long as mine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soooo smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it is intended for: my hair is undamaged and in tact after using heat on it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several heat protection sprays but this has found its place among my top 3 favorites.</li>
            <li> Protects my hair from my hot air brush and curling iron...</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty detangled already</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like this product will show immediate and evident results.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> I am actually paying more ordering it on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive or half-filled like some products are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The nozzle can be tricky because there is a little button that kind of turns it off if you need to travel with it or have children near your stuff, but the button is right where you&#x27;d put your hand to grab the nozzle and you can easily move it to the off position.</li>
            <li> But as far as the product is concerned, it is really great especially for people having long, straight, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Never flat iron or blow dry my hair without it, holy grail! &amp; great price</li>
            <li> Super duper lightweight spray that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, smells fantastic, really does make a difference with heat damage</li>
            <li> I know lots of other people think it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight longer and is so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> It left it really soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> My favorite thermal heat protective spray, ive used this spray for a long while now it never fails i have noticed the difference in my hair since i started using it</li>
            <li> It also smells really nice and makes your hair feel soft wtihout the sticky gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and smooth, and very manageable.</li>
            <li> the product serves its purpose, my hair definitely feels different and it was really good for the price.</li>
            <li> It smells OK, a little cheap and fruity like pretty much all the hair care stuff on the shelves these days</li>
            <li> My hair is normally really dry and crisp due to the dyeing and curling I did before, so, I cut it leaving it nice and healthy, but just couldn&#x27;t resist curling again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product has positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything positive.  </li>
            <li> I recently just purchased the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener (which I love) and wanted a new spray to go with it.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I added too much to the ends of my hair the first time, but I&#x27;m not giving up.</li>
            <li> Probably better for those wanting ultra straight, flat hair.</li>
            <li> , it makes my hair feel nice and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle sprays out a fine mist that lightly coats my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Great clean scent...works well for long lasting flat iron hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s says its just a heat tamer, but it made my hair super soft and it holds the style.</li>
            <li> Plus it makes my hair feel super soft.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to distribute it evenly with a comb and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> hair feels super soft after using&lt;br /&gt;-Love</li>
            <li> Even after months and months of curling, my hair is still super soft an shiny.</li>
            <li> figured since my hair tangles easily and that I might decide to straighten my hair occasionally, that I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my hair is dry, I can&#x27;t tell it is on my hair at all, which I love.  </li>
            <li> Those usualy have strong smell and leave residue to the point that I have to wash my hair same day to relieve it of all of that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps protect from heat, but it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Although I would strongly recommend, you buy this at your local Walgreens..</li>
            <li> so it was great to see her have a different perspective due to me using this spray!</li>
            <li> This product worked so amazingly that after I sprayed it on and went over it with the iron, my hair was straight and not hot to the touch!</li>
            <li> they certainly wouldn&#x27;t publish it so I am using a F. Scott Fitzgerald approach and stipulate &#x27;don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I might be speaking from pure inexperience.....</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose and extremely easy to apply ..5 sprays for mid length hair is just fine , should last for atleast 30 sessions.</li>
            <li> Great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews here on Amazon, I decided this product was cheap enough to take the risk of purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that I recently decided to style with heat.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier and I don&#x27;t have any more dry ends!</li>
            <li> I feel such a huge difference in my hair when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I think the Tresemme Runway collection Get Sleek Polish works much better, although you have to be careful not to use too much.  </li>
            <li> It helps maintain it&#x27;s natural shine, soft feeling, and smooth</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference really.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It protect my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this heat tamer spray.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very brittle and I do not feel this spray protects my hair at all.</li>
            <li> However I was really suprised by this product.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my hair looks and feels much healthier</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get split ends as much.  </li>
            <li> Absolute must have if you use any heat tools.</li>
            <li> If I really said in the review how it affected me</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t anything much.</li>
            <li> on the bottle to see how much you&#x27;re getting for your money.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice (reminiscent of a conditioner I had as a child, actually) and it really doesn&#x27;t leave the hair to have a residue.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> and this really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I really havent had any problems with it</li>
            <li> my wife really likes this stuff</li>
            <li> Too much and my hair an feel sticky sometimes with the heat here.</li>
            <li> Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sprayer head distributes the product very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> but I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks TRESemme&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The lady said my hair was very damaged, and she could tell it was from heat damage.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair look greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spritz it on before any heat treatment and feel like it really is making a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at my local drug store since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> It really helps to protect my hair from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it a 4 star because it cost too much online..</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the built-in knob (not pictured) to turn the sprayer off.  </li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li> This stuff really protects your hair.</li>
            <li> That is really unusual for Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> The product works very well and my 16 yr&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li> daughter is the real judge.  </li>
            <li> also did not feel this did much in humidity.</li>
            <li> I use this on my very uncontrolled, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this spray.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this not only because it protects her hair but because it gives her the light weight feel and shine in her hair</li>
            <li> and she can straighten it fast and loves the smell when she is spraying it in her hair</li>
            <li> It works like a heat protector, but i leaves my hair dull/opaque and that&#x27;s a problem because i don&#x27;t use it very often</li>
            <li> She took her liberties though and cut way too much off</li>
            <li> I applied it to my hair when it was still damp and cannot say I like it much.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really linger after your hair is done.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend using it.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of this spray.  </li>
            <li> Tresemme enriches my hair, makes it look flowely and looks naturally straight or curly or whatever.</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel, didn&#x27;t have as much body.</li>
            <li> FYI - Much cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li> The nozzle works really well, and the product lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I really like the pump spray.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says, which is protect your hair from heat.  </li>
            <li> I have had one bottle for about 3 years, you don&#x27;t need to spray much.</li>
            <li> and it really does protect it because my hair is not damaged at all.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spray it on every section but lightly cover my entire head and then use the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t use too much at once.</li>
            <li> It really does protect your hair from all hairdryers, curling irons and straight irons.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my hair does not break off as much when using a straightener.</li>
            <li> , I guess it depends on what you are doing to your hair, and how much protection you need.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
            <li> and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I noticed on the bottle it says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s a fantastic tool for instantly transforming all hair textures, enhancing strands&#x27; flexibility to reform and hold</li>
            <li> After using it I find it&#x27;s much, much easier to form curls</li>
            <li> , the smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I used to straighten my hair by using the hair straightener, it really harmful to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast too.</li>
            <li> I really love it and will be buying a few more so that I never run low.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really hurt for that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it works</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much, but I suppose it works well..</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it is really protecting my hair from heat damage as I still get split ends</li>
            <li> Maybe it prevented heat damage, but our heads were not left with a silky, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Tresemme went straight in the trash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a hair product snob, so I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li> Then I do my ironing, or go straight to styling products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li> This one sprays really well</li>
            <li> no matter how much I put in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and it really helps hold my curls.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Once I spray it on, my hair will always be straight even if I leave the curling iron in for longer than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> This arrived earlier then i expected which was good.</li>
            <li> Will be trying something more natural next time.</li>
            <li> I primarily only use this before I blow dry/ straighten my hair, but it keeps my hair silky, soft, and healthy.</li>
            <li> Helps make my hair really soft and makes it so that my hair gets straight without using super high heat on my iron.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily and does exactly what I expected, so five stars for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first bottle of this, which I bought because I needed a heat protectant to use with a new curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with a new (hot tools) curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I sort of retired TRESemme products once I started to buy natural products for my extremely curly hair, however my roommate allowed me to use hers and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Now, my problem first is that I was in walmart and saw pretty much the exact same spray for $4.99.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky like most other heat protectors do.</li>
            <li> It works better than most products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I have very coarse curly hair</li>
            <li> when flat ironing, curling etc and my hair always feels silky smooth and protected without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li> I had been using a different product earlier, which was pretty decent, but wanted to try something better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, not expensive, but a very professional hair treatment</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those with very curly hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I have long, foofy, porous hair, and apply much more to the older hair near the ends.</li>
            <li> And I only used it when I was flatironing my hair on special occasion.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use a bit on dry hair before I straight iron, and it makes the iron run really smoothly over my hair.</li>
            <li> I then blow dry my hair and so far I would say it is just okay</li>
            <li> This worked really well on my sisters very course and very naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle is full when you open the package.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair very smooth &amp; shiny when used with a blow dryer &amp; round brush.</li>
            <li> What it comes down to, once i adjusted to the way this (and frankly most...)</li>
            <li> Love this heat protective spray it don&#x27;t weight your hair down at all</li>
            <li> It does what it says and it does not not leave a sticky feeling to hair or weigh it down, like most heat protectants do.</li>
            <li> I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t be as drying as spraynet when I need to touch up the curl which is more fragile than usual styles and falls out easily.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a while back based on the great reviews and low cost in comparison to other heat proctectants.</li>
            <li> Immediately applied Brilliant Blowout, blow dried, flat ironed and my hair was back to silky.</li>
            <li> I bought it solely as a heat protectant, but I sometimes even use it when I&#x27;m not blow drying or flat ironing because it leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair both straight &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> , I especially don&#x27;t recommend it for people with more oily hair (obviously)</li>
            <li> and I like it much better than a similar product that I purchased at a local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to use it multiple times with a lot still left over.</li>
            <li> Quick fix especially if you are in a hurry!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But supposedly Not Your Mother&#x27;s heat spray is decent</li>
            <li> There are better products on the market, albeit more expensive.</li>
            <li> Use it with my curling - save my hair from high temperature.</li>
            <li> use high heat to style my hair and always worried about now burning it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like a product as is a very light spray onto the hair that doesn&#x27;t cause it to be heavy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think drugstore products are in any way comparable to high end products and this is a prime example.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I guess my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing, and not like all the other gross smelling hair products.</li>
            <li> Not ready to give up since other reviews were really good.</li>
            <li> I never got to use this product as the top on the bottle broke and the liquid completely soaked the other contents and box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products and many seem to leave my hair a little oily, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is heavily hi-lighted and my hair really cannot afford too much styling.  </li>
            <li> This product is great because it works with dry and wet hair, flat irons and blow dryiers.</li>
            <li> It makes my straight hair sleek and soft, not greasy and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> my mom even asked me ur hair is this straight and soft from blow drying?</li>
            <li> Hair is soft, straight</li>
            <li> I have always wanted the sleek, straight, soft hair I would always see.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s soft and ready to comb.</li>
            <li> a few times I&#x27;ve had to press it more than once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a few months now, and I love how silky it keeps my hair.</li>
            <li> She said that normally they would recommend me a salon brand heat protectant since I was in a salon, but she told me about Tresemme&#x27;s Heat Tamer spray.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed my hair being \\&quot;protected\\&quot; any more than with my usual hair serums.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times before blow drying or styling and it works ok.</li>
            <li> Today I did only because I was attempting to recreate that salon fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Since using it I have also bought it for a few friends or family members who are really enjoying it also.</li>
            <li> More like a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this few times and its ok, I feel like it leaves a film on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just make sure it has completely dried on your hair before using styling irons.</li>
            <li> This is the first thermal product I have used that actually got me soft,sleek hair that stayed straight all day.</li>
            <li> Great for casual wear with the sun.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it, it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; spray, it feels like water, which was a concern I had, my hair is already thick</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that didn&#x27;t stink like many products do and one that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy, this product fits all of those with a pretty low price!</li>
            <li> Both of these products, the spray part - not only didn&#x27;t spray the product but fell to pieces right before my eyes on the counter.  </li>
            <li> I saw so many sucky reviews I was inspired because their not true!</li>
            <li> basically if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, effective heat protectant that you can use both before you blow dry and before you curl or straighten, definitely buy this little guy!</li>
            <li> It smells great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny rather than stiff like some of the more expensive ones I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to protect my hair as I blow dry it everyday and it looks pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> and they immediately sent me new bottle along with apologies.</li>
            <li> my new 3-barrel waver curling iron.  </li>
            <li> My new fav leave in heat protectand when I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not a type of person that runs out to buy every new item out there&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> This is one product that will be on my &#x27;Can&#x27;t live without list&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to BUY a new spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I love using this to help protect my hair when I use a flat iron on it and blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I also love the little lock that they added on the bottle!</li>
            <li> and then again right before I use a flat or curling iron.</li>
            <li> Having high expectations I was surprised at how water based this is.</li>
            <li> every penny leaves your hair shinny and very soft and it protects your hair from heat</li>
            <li> Spritz a little of this on your hair before you apply heat of any kind, be it via flat iron, curling iron/wand, and even your hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I used it again this morning before I blow dried and again before I flat ironed and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> and i show to my step mom ,its funny coz we have the same thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty low price</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on this product after one use!</li>
            <li> There are spray nozzles that actually emit an even, consistent flow in use for hair sprays in Asia (like Liese Juicy Shower), so I don&#x27;t know why Tresseme doesn&#x27;t get on board.</li>
            <li> I have used the Chi Iron Guard for the past year, but this stuff is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> It came out just as soft as it normally would have without anything in it</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> My hair always looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t revert!</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference when I used it for the first time last night when I had to use my blow dryer and straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another similar product that works better on my hair and is easier to spray but unfortunately lots more money.</li>
            <li> but I could use TRESemme&#x27;s Heat Tamer either way (before blow drying or just before straightening) with the same consistent result.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Well, I am a male who purchased the protective spray to use while running a hot comb through my afro.</li>
            <li> I get the same exact one for $3 instead of $6.</li>
            <li> I have bought several since my first time using it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft that I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner anymore!  </li>
            <li> I know that no product can completely prevent damage, but I wish this one did!</li>
            <li> I have never had my hair so soft and not brittle from straightening before!</li>
            <li> This actually works very well!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and silky and for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Not for 4c natural hair!</li>
            <li> no more i can say about it except that this review requires three more words now one two three</li>
            <li> My hair became so straight after blow drying, it was completely straight after flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> every which way -- maybe I just haven&#x27;t figured it out, plus I was pretty used to pumps or the standard press spray nozzle</li>
            <li> Actually this was the first one I tried</li>
            <li> I also use it on my 3 year old daughters hair as well, but not just for blow drying, it also works at getting knots out of her hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really floral or sweet or musky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light spray, doesn&#x27;t wear hear down or make it sticky.</li>
            <li> I gave this a shot to help protect my hair from hot ironing due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy and the ends look shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> It dries fast as long as you don&#x27;t spray too much</li>
            <li> So I dont spray it anymore, I actually open the bottle and apply the liquid directly on my damp hair before blow drying ;)</li>
            <li> Especially if you are a frequent blowdryer and hot iron user like our house hold.</li>
            <li> Sadly my supply ran out early since I took the bottle with me on a trip and spilled in my bag. :-p</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because of the numerous positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I will say is</li>
            <li> so I started using curling and flat irons that get up to a relatively high temperature, and I found my hair was getting brittle and very damaged.  </li>
            <li> I find I need to put more on wet hair versus dry</li>
            <li> I spray this in my hair right before I blow dry</li>
            <li> Many of the heat protectant sprays only are approved for use when the hair is dry ONLY.</li>
            <li> I use a few quick sprays of this around the crown of his head and voila!</li>
            <li> This was the first product that I began noticing less and less damage and was able to space out my hair cuts/trims since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Only after doing a few test squeezes in the sink will you manage to get a good flow again, but by that time you&#x27;ve wasted a fairly large amount of product.</li>
            <li> Just needed to clear that up before I review this product...</li>
            <li> Soft and silky hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair ooooo so soft.</li>
            <li> My 25 year old daughter intro&#x27;d me to it</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> my go-to when i&#x27;m low and dont have much money.</li>
            <li> Then slept on it and wore it the whole next day</li>
            <li> I do believe that it has protected my hair from the damage of so much styling, especially compared to what my hair would have been without using any heat protective.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything even in it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it being a direct result of using a heat</li>
            <li> I have mid-back natural curly hair</li>
            <li> It goes on softly, non-sticky.</li>
            <li> Despite what the instructions on the bottle say, this can’t be use directly with heat styling tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these so far</li>
            <li> and it always breaks on me near the end of it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now twice, and it leaves my hair totally soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Helps protect my hair and keep it soft after using heat.</li>
            <li> leave your hair straightened/curled, &amp; feeling soft</li>
            <li> but at least it&#x27;s much better and cheaper than CHI.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a lil soft but not too soft</li>
            <li> Its not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t notice it did much for my hair - it wasn&#x27;t necessarily smoother, shinier, silkier or anything.</li>
            <li> People with red hair know that the texture of red hair is somewhat more coarse than blonde or brown.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky soft, yet manageable with it&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> Lightweight, not sticky or greasy, leaves hair soft and shiny n def helps with reducing and protecting from heat damage.</li>
            <li> (conditioner included) will eventually cause damage to your hair because it leaves a residue on the hairs that overtime will build up and strip the hair from its natural oils, etc.</li>
            <li> It smells so yummy and makes my hair so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance for me - can&#x27;t stand constantly smelling something in my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I wear it in 2 strand twist</li>
            <li> there is such a thing as too much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spray directly on my hair before use, I spray in my hand to control the amount used I feel like it leaves my hair straw feeling.  </li>
            <li> Gave to my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so smooth,so soft and keeps it from tangling.</li>
            <li> this product, so far, has answered the call.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and the fly-aways are eliminated when I use TRESemme Thermal.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> really did notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> Actually this stuff is very awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft and flowy.</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> I spray this on my damp hair after rinsing the conditioner out and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if this really protects my hair, though.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, I like ti so far.</li>
            <li> The box was completely  wrapped in cellophane in order to complete the trip.</li>
            <li> This heat tamer spray is affordable and makes your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It feels pleasantly soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that I would be able to minimize at least SOME of the damage I was doing.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like products that are heavy, this one is so light.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it three times</li>
            <li> I guess so far.</li>
            <li> Granted I had to be a bit heavy handed with my hair to make sure it got to all of it but who cares when it actually works!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been known to have pretty dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> Came across it on Amazon and decided to give it a try considering how dry my hair can become when using a hot comb.</li>
            <li> It took me hours to clean the bathroom (and I&#x27;m no clean freak</li>
            <li> Trying to flat iron natural hair is a task and this heat protectant didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair shiny and makes a real difference when I apply before using the blow dryer or flat iron.</li>
            <li> After I bought and received this product I went to walmart and found the same exact one same size and everything for$ 3.70 cheaper.</li>
            <li> The Get Sleek spray is a decent product but not one I use regularly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product necessarily protects my hair from the heat, which I don&#x27;t use a lot of heat products on my hair, it mostly stays up in a bun 99% of the time, but When I do use heat products, I use this on my hair when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to use it sparingly, and my hair still ended up quite dry, so I added a little more.</li>
            <li> If you can shop locally, check it out at Walmart where it is available for less than $4.</li>
            <li> I use low heat setting on my hair dryer and don&#x27;t use a straightener and my hair is frizzier than normal.</li>
            <li> When you uses it it will make a sizzling noise which was alarming at first.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two bottles on different occasions, and the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; on each sprayer was different, although both are located on the neck of the sprayer, one of which wasn&#x27;t obviously apparent to me when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good but not great if you&#x27;re not ok with smells</li>
            <li> This spray is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t load down my hair or make it look greasy, and doesn&#x27;t stink like rancid fruit like so many other hair products, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and the spray didn&#x27;t work well for me--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken thermal protection which was very oily and CHI which was a little sticky, not a lot but very pricey in comparison to Tresemme.</li>
            <li> Easy to spray hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> only reason I give it a 4-star because I didn&#x27;t care much for the spray -- just didn&#x27;t work with me in terms of spraying directly onto hair -- unless your hair is long and you can dangle it over to the side and spray directly on it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off also cutting down your washing and allowing your own hair oils to act in the same protective way.</li>
            <li> I then proceeded with my new curling iron to try and put some curl back in.</li>
            <li> I blew it dry and immediately noticed a much silkier texture to my hair.</li>
            <li> , I think it will be a while until I notice if it really protects my hair from heat or not (once I see that my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out or burn out) .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed so my hair doesn&#x27;t really fall into either traditional category.</li>
            <li> I never liked the strong cologne scent and felt it made my hair sticky.  </li>
            <li> Okay let me just say that I am Hispanic and part Native American which means I have extremely THICK hair</li>
            <li> But after using this religiously, I barely saw any split ends!</li>
            <li> I typically use this, dry my hair, flat iron and then top it off with just a bit of an anti-humidity hair spray</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the lock button doesn&#x27;t stop it from coming out very well, so my walmart bag got kind of messy, so</li>
            <li> It actually left my hair feeling very soft and smooth, and it helped with flyaways, which usually kill my entire look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the world of curling irons and flat irons</li>
            <li> Not great on me, but great for my little guy!</li>
            <li> The price is hard to beat at $8- with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I also deal with oily hair, so this product not leaving behind any residue is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing things about the TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray for the past few years.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t use conditioner on my hair, either.</li>
            <li> It has been bleached a lighter blonde than my natural color</li>
            <li> I combed my hair, then spritzed on this product and could barely get the comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> O.o...)</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on expesive hair products</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was surprised to notice during my last trip to Walmart that I could have gotten this $3 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am used to 100% natural naked hair?</li>
            <li> Do be careful not to put too much product in or else</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, I cannot get it out of the carpets near the bathroom - from simply ONE USE of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They shipped product separately without any extra charge just so I could receive it early.</li>
            <li> I have relatively curly hair, so I want to protect my hair when I apply a lot of direct heat to it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised because if you use a light enough hand in spraying this on, it is not in the least bit gunky or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It is light-weight, it works well with my thick hair, and made it shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> frustrating with most products.</li>
            <li> kind of weird</li>
            <li> I use it when I blow dry and the occasional iron, and so far you&#x27;ll have to simply have to know how much you should put on your hair.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all, very slick feeling, and when I curl, the curls feel super bouncy!</li>
            <li> I wish it was a different type of spray, but I can live with it because I&#x27;ve tried over 5 different sprays...</li>
            <li> Since this is the only new product in my routine, I can only think that this item is to blame.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and almost every product I use has some major flaw -- makes my hair look lifeless, or dull, or smells too strong.  </li>
            <li> At first I was using a lot, as it turned out, but then I kept clarifying my hair of the product and using less of it.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that it isn&#x27;t expensive, yet it performs better than some of the more expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> but as feared, I gave it its first wash today and blew dry it (which I never do, I always air dry) and used this product.</li>
            <li> before I flat ironed it because I have natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels incredibly soft when using it with my blow dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> before I flat ironed my hair and it makes it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other Heat Protective Spray, but this one works very well.  </li>
            <li> does wonders for every hairstyle, whether it would be straight to curling your hair, it works alongside with other products, ie styling gel, spray mousse.</li>
            <li> I kept the flat iron heat at 350 to 375 and there was no heat damage that I could see once I washed my hair to return it to its natural state.</li>
            <li> Bought this for using my flat iron as well as blow dryer and my hair always feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron my hair every day and it really started to take a toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this spray on my hair before every blow dry or hair straightening I do, whether my hair is wet or dry, and it always leaves it feeling so silky and light afterwards, it feels like I just paid to get a deep condition!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it this once so far, but I am definitely going to be using this often.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair</li>
            <li> Love the scent also, I am addicted to it, I&#x27;ll always have some extra bottles in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This came in super quick, but unfortunately this was more expensive than Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Unlike cheaper products this will not dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a lovely smell, which is an added plus for me as I find many hair products smell truly sickening.  </li>
            <li> The spray nozzle lets out a steady mist, covering my hair in the expected places.</li>
            <li> * better used when using a hair dryer or straightener comes out a little stiff just on its own.*&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> The hair stay bouncy and not bone dry , very natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why my experience is so different from most other users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been maintaining my below-the-hip long hair for several years now (18 years, to be precise), and of late my hair has been complaining about all the blow drying after frequent hairwashes.</li>
            <li> The other spray I used made my hair feel a little sticky, but this spray is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basically obsessed with this product right now!!!</li>
            <li> so I prefer products which leave some natural body in my hair so that it isn&#x27;t flat to my head by mid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only used one other heat protective spray, but I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited and anxious about getting this product, once I finally received it the bottle was still wrapped in plastic but only a fourth of liquids in a 8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I started to use this after getting a fresh haircut and usually a month or two after getting my hair cut</li>
            <li> This was highly rated on Amazon, so I bought it since I needed something to protect my hair from my straightener, but it left my hair feeling very dry and processed after.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little sloppy but it kept the product safe which is  all the really matters.</li>
            <li> It keeps the frizzies away during humid spells, helps keep my hair soft and hydrated even when I blow dry it</li>
            <li> that is wet or even slightly damp, this will burn your hair to a crisp!</li>
            <li> I have used a few heat protectants and because of all the positive reviews I chose to give this one a shot.</li>
            <li> It also feels great the next day and doesn&#x27;t look dirty or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and tight curls, so straightening my hair always took a toll.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it is lightweight and glides on smoothly without making my hair feel greasy or crunchy, unlike other thermal sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s the very dry type of hair and is naturally frizzy...</li>
            <li> , it smells nice and is only sticky when it&#x27;s still wet on your hair, once you blow dry there is no noticeable residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Hard to spray my own hair due to the really odd</li>
            <li> If you straighten or curl or blow dry your hair on a regular basis, I would definitely recommend this to you, and I think you will see a major difference in your hair!</li>
            <li> Its hard to gauge the success of the product overall,  </li>
            <li> So imagine how felt when something I was so ready to receive was so disappointing and was not able to receive a new bottle on the hassle of a return!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I no longer feel guilty about using a flat iron or curling iron on my fine hair!  </li>
            <li> I highly doubt this product works well for any black hair in the type 4 category.</li>
            <li> I blow dry &amp; straighten my hair almost every day, so I really need something to protect it from the extreme heat!</li>
            <li> It saved my hair from being extremely dry and now I&#x27;m not afraid to blow dry it everyday.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m out most of my product and seriously doubting future purchases, why waste my money to have it leak all over the place.</li>
            <li> I bought it to go with a flat iron, but it takes such a short time to straighten my hair with the iron</li>
            <li> So the product is fine, but the packaging is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> especially I do a lot of blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron on my daughters hair for school it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Got 2 B Guardian Angel heat protectant and the KQC flat iron spray, and I always come back to the Tresemme heat protectant.</li>
            <li> that actually deep conditions your hair when you use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use it before I use a curling and flat iron and it sort of protects but not enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been blow drying, then flat ironing, and finally hairspraying my unruly bangs since I cut them a year ago.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviews have said do not put it on your hair directly before flat ironing!</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice so far, so it is difficult to really know how well it will protect my hair in the long term, but no complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> so it just curled up and wouldn&#x27;t flat iron.</li>
            <li> Always protects my hair from my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see whether or not it&#x27;ll protect my hair from the heat, but others have mentioned that they think it damaged their hair?</li>
            <li> It makes my hair flat and smooth--until I leave the house on a humid day when the frizz appears.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I put it on my hair and flat ironed it.  </li>
            <li> and I use this with Avocado butter and Fantasia IC Hair Polisher Heat Protector to flat iron my leave out.</li>
            <li> I flat iron</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- for long lasting Hold, you&#x27;ll need to apply hair spray after styling&lt;</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for use and proceeded to flat iron my hair, and afterwards couldn&#x27;t even tell there was anything in my hair.</li>
            <li> I flat iron</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair (not color treated)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with applying and then flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I use this every time I flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> It protects your hair when blow drying or using a curling iron or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t build up on flat iron.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with a flat iron that exudes</li>
            <li> It seems to protect the hair from heat while using the curling iron, hair feels silky afterwards, curls do not last quite as long, but the silky feel makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I tried this recently to flat iron my hair and was amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> eliminates the need to use the flat iron AND the hairspray.</li>
            <li> My hair has a normal bounce, even after straightening, but after using this it seems to fall rather heavily.   </li>
            <li> In fact, I like the smell so much, I usually spritz a little extra on top after straightening, which actually helps tame any stray frizzies.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Once your done and you run a comb thru it it becomes incredibly soft and sleek with no weigh down.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to heat protectant spray hands down!</li>
            <li> My 8 year old son, my little red-head, has this coarse hair and every morning before school</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it has such a high rating.</li>
            <li> I then sprayed the Tresemme on my dry hair prior to flat ironing and combed through.  </li>
            <li> I use this spray every time after I wash my hair, even if I&#x27;m not going to use a flat iron!</li>
            <li> I use about 15 sprays all across my head from middle to the ends of my dry hair.</li>
            <li> and this thing turned to dry yellow sticky stuff that stuck to my hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling brittle and dry ( I have relaxed 4b/4c hair)</li>
            <li> , I separated my hair in half and used the spray 3 times in each half; my hair didn&#x27;t freeze at all it was soft and looked naturally like I didn&#x27;t apply anything on it..</li>
            <li> The reviewer who complained about it obviously sprayed on way too much of it.  </li>
            <li> After having tried this on 3 different heads (2 relatives and myself), I am convinced that either I am using this terribly wrong, or this just make your hair dry  and easy to tangle.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re going to last a long, long time</li>
            <li> NEVER blow dry hair that is dry, blow dryers should only be used on wet/damp hair to avoid damage and NEVER EVER EVER flat iron hair</li>
            <li> Possibly because I have very dry, frizzy hair?</li>
            <li> I have fine/wavy hair, use blow dry and flat iron often.</li>
            <li> I use a straightening balm before I blow dry, and this before I flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> I use it when I blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to my flat iron, so I knew she was right.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is natural it is hard for me to find products that works well on on unrelaxed African American hair.</li>
            <li> and you may end up spraying what seems like just water or ,on the flip side, too much product into your hair which explains why some of the negative reviews call the product watery while others claim it is too heavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I sprayed it all over, including the close to the scalp, and applied too much, and my hair refused to cooperate after that and looked dirty...</li>
            <li> I usually spray it directly on my hands and rub it into my hair both before blow drying and then a second time before straightening.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tresemme for a long time and I am not surprised by the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Will purchase this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a thermal protector for as long as I can remember and never have paid the price that it is sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This lasts a long time</li>
            <li> whose a beautician, I discovered that because the spray left my hair wet it burned off from my heat appliant.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair, so it&#x27;s harder to spritz it</li>
            <li> My only complaint: the little &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; tab on the neck that is right where you have to hold the bottle.  </li>
            <li> If you use it before flat ironing, let it dry!</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this protects it both wet and dry from blowdrying and flat ironing without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I think for a less expensive product, it works okay on my hair for now.</li>
            <li> I have only applied the product to my wet hair before I blow dry it</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on Amazon I decided to purchase this at a local walmart for less ($4.00).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive considering how long it has lasted me, and you only need a few sprays to cover your whole head, otherwise you are putting too much and it will build up.</li>
            <li> It offers weightless heat protection and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, just soft, shiny hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned one other heat spray before - CHI 44 Iron Guard.  </li>
            <li> If you try to flat iron your hair as soon as you put this stuff on, it&#x27;ll fizzle because your hair is technically wet with the spray.</li>
            <li> I bought it and decided to do one side regular straightening and the other with the spray for comparison.</li>
            <li> the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the shipping because when I opened the package the spray bottle was a little bit open and the liquid was poured into the package.</li>
            <li> The spray helped detangle my hair it seemed but it made it wet although youre supposed to flat iron your hair when its dry.....  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for really hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on the ends to help protect them before I blow dry or curl them.</li>
            <li> The Chi Iron Guard makes my hair sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> I spray it before I blow dry or curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry a lot</li>
            <li> I use it before I blowdry and then over dry hair before I flatten or curl it.</li>
            <li> You will have to spray and wait for it to dry or blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I do not blow dry</li>
            <li> so I’ve been spraying it on after I wash and letting it dry altogether.</li>
            <li> I use it before blow drying and before styling my dry hair EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li> I applied it to damp hair allowed it to dry about</li>
            <li> if I use this and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I give it three stars for instructing to use on dry hair before applying heat.  </li>
            <li> (and I have lots and lots of hair to blow dry) and seems to help my ends from splitting as often thus reducing the need for hair trims every 3 months</li>
            <li> You spry it on dry hair or damp before blowing&lt;br</li>
            <li> it softens my dry hair</li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and straw</li>
            <li> I use it every time I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> mske hair dry alot and has alot of perfume</li>
            <li> It may leave a film on some of your brushes, but nothing serious if your hair is greasy after this you may be using too much.</li>
            <li> I let it dry before using the iron on my hair.  </li>
            <li> After heat drying my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Then when my hair is finally dry, I take care of the dry spots with another couple spritzes on my palm and another comb-through with my hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry my hair and again before I straighten or curl it.</li>
            <li> I spray my damp hair before I blow dry, and then again before I straighten it.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it isn&#x27;t sticky when dry.</li>
            <li> I use a blowdryer and straigtening iron almost daily, and I have blonde hair that is heavily bleached with highlights.</li>
            <li> I use a blowdryer and straigtening iron almost daily, and I have blonde hair that is heavily bleached with highlights.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it until my next hair appointment a few months later.</li>
            <li> imitation cherry soda that was manufactured in a Chinese almond factory, regurgitated and then bottled.</li>
            <li> I am so upset, I received the package wet, it was not well close, so i only got the bottle empty. :@</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly and down past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> In the end, I like the product, the packaging not so much, but at least the extra step saves a little space when I travel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leavs very heavy buildup on my hair, and I use it very sparingly, so much so that the next day my hair looks like I did not wash it for 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the product doing much for my hair, other than it used to be shiny and now it is dull.</li>
            <li> my leave out weekly for the past 3 months and not damage so far.</li>
            <li> have had for a bout 3 months and have only used 1/4 of the bottle (straighten hair on average 3 times a week)</li>
            <li> There was liquid damage to the box and quiet a bit of the bottle was empty due to all the leaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only down fall on this item was how the sprayer works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to protect my hair from my flat iron and they all make my hair feel heavy and dirty.</li>
            <li> I spray it on before I blow dry and go to town!</li>
            <li> I use this every time I blow dry my hair and when I use a hair straightener or curler!</li>
            <li> I spray it onto dry hair, brush it through, and then style!</li>
            <li> You can apply wet or dry, which is a plus-</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair feel less fryed, but it makes your hair smoother and easier to curl or straighten.</li>
            <li> I am mixed (white and black) and my hair isnt the typical &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; girl texture.</li>
            <li> But since it brings the waves/frizz/fluff I end up having to go back over my hair with a flatiron several times, so I&#x27;m not sure how protected my hair can be after that.</li>
            <li> Tried it on both wet and dry hair with the Babyliss Pro.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my hair wet before I blow dry</li>
            <li> Well the first order the bottle was completely broken and the box was soaking wet...</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy, waist length hair that I often blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I applied the spray to my dry hair, then did my makeup before flat ironing, giving it a little time to absorb and dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair to begin with and this made it much worse with a very unnatural feel to it afterwards.</li>
            <li> In my hometown, you can get the same size bottle of this stuff for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t tell if it is protecting my hair when I blow dry, other than there is no immediate damage.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every other day and sometimes straighten in-between</li>
            <li> A little bit of a bummer, but this product is fabulous, it has never stirred me wrong.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to miss red on a white brush)</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I saw absolutely no improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair sizzle when i put heat to it because it is too wet.  </li>
            <li> When I press the nozzle I don&#x27;t feel as if the spray coats my hair evenly, it&#x27;s not a very well made spout I guess.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it to try this product before you go and drop $$ on an expensive salon type brand.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and let them know that the bottle was empty upon arrival</li>
            <li> Hair that curls/frizzes when exposed to humidity or wet.</li>
            <li> I like to spray from mid-length to ends and then run a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> I spray my hair after every shower when it&#x27;s still wet regardless of if i&#x27;m going to put heat on it or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed hair color on my white round blow drying brush</li>
            <li> so then I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m straightening wet</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I saw it at a Target for $3.99, so</li>
            <li> Received the bottle empty.</li>
            <li> It was empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected from this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a wide area coverage.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped the bottle and the nozzle broke into two pieces, rendering it unusable (hence minus one star).</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair on low heat.</li>
            <li> The only downside, for me anyways, was that it does make thin/fine hair heavy and/or greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It is the only one I have ever used (and I have used quite a few, mind you)</li>
            <li> Absolutely no stickyness or serum texture on the hair.</li>
            <li> My bottle of TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray was completely empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> It was dripping when I got it in the mail though- expected.</li>
            <li> I found the same product significantly cheaper at Safeway--which I thought was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> I need to blow-dry my hair constantly and have been trying to find something to tame it.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ear level) down, comb through, and let dry for a minute.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, after I flat iron my hair can look limp but not with the Tresemme.  </li>
            <li> I use is everyday when I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> My color treated hair is always exposed to either a curling iron or a flat iron everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get the dried, fried ends anymore from drying and flat ironing my hair 3-4 days/week.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to dry out less and keeps the style for longer.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair softer then the previous Redken satinwear blow dry creme.</li>
            <li> And, it could be the texture of my hair, but it definitely has left it silkier and prone to less tangling (I have thick, curly hair that tangles easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> or I was left with a big greasy frizzy sticky mess when having to apply it with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use blow dryer every other day and use this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on hair and even protects the hair from getting split ends due to the heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with greasy or sticky residue, like some other products will give -</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be acquired here or somewhere like Walmart or any other store.</li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, would probably complain if the spray handle squirted all over my things in my bag if I ever traveled with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to this brand&#x27;s other products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to try any other products because I will use this forever.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in how my hair felt compared to the other heat protectant I was using.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare to any other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used heat protective spray though (I know!</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting my hair other than stripping the color</li>
            <li> I only used a small amount.  </li>
            <li> in the past have left my hair crispy, staticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase it at Target because it&#x27;s only 3-4 bucks.</li>
            <li> and it gets tracked into every other area of your home.</li>
            <li> It gives out an even circular spray, without any other propellant chemicals messing with your hair.  </li>
            <li> I don;t have to use any other straightener gels anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> Came in the box along with other stuff, but by the time i opened the box it looked the spray probaby went off due to the movement in the box during transport.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy like other products have in the past, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It provided slip and combined well with my other hair products.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.</li>
            <li> When I spray it on dry hair, using very little, my hair is very wet and takes two hours to dry</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t put anything in my hair because I hate the way it looks, but this thermal heat protective spray really does the trick!</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve received five stars if when it came in the mail the bottle wasn&#x27;t slightly unscrewed and wet.</li>
            <li> I straighten and blow dry my hair everyday</li>
            <li> but I do not always blow dry or style my hair with heat everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it on my towel dried hair before I blow dry and then again before I use my curling iron to limit heat damage.  </li>
            <li> When I use my straightener it glides down my hair which is completely due to this product as when I don&#x27;t use it, iron does not glide over the hair.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair is crazy dry after using a blow dryer, but it was only moderately dried out.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical ordering something online for this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TreSemme is an average brand, but it stands for its value on products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, I wanted to at least try to protect it for now until I get a different curling method in gear.</li>
            <li> The only thing about the product that I found negative was the price.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on my wet hair, blow dried it, sprayed it again and curled it.</li>
            <li> My ends are in horrible shape and I need a superior product to protect them and keep them moisturized . . .</li>
            <li> I got three bottles of this crap and most of it went down the sink so that it wasn&#x27;t laying around in the \\&quot; crappy cosmetics abyss\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the product seems to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.</li>
            <li> but when I blow it out and wear it down, I use this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to cut down on my blow drying.</li>
            <li> Never leaves your hair oily or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it is weighting down my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky nor ways your hair down.</li>
            <li> For the effectiveness of the product along with the extremely affordable price it is a must try!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend any other heat protector besides this one!</li>
            <li> and when i do i would usually end up wit hairs on the floor because my hair wasnt protected, and my hair would be DRY AND brittle feeling ....</li>
            <li> so I usually just let it air dry and wear it in whatever shape it dries.  </li>
            <li> Also the flat shape of the bottle is hard to hold if your hands are slippery from styling product.  </li>
            <li> Even if my hair stays straight throughout the day, it gets crazy frizzy and very dry as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> if you are prone to greasy hair, just spray the bottom half of your hair, or spray it in your hands and run it through the bottom half.   </li>
            <li> I have previously used Redken Iron Silk 07</li>
            <li> It gets nappy just like a black girl when it gets any type of wetness to.</li>
            <li> I went to food 4 less, and saw it for $4.50.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference in that my hair looks shinier and I have less lot ends.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t think I&#x27;m burning my hair less if I use this.</li>
            <li> but it is less money</li>
            <li> but I find that my hair has a slightly thicker/ stickier feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I come across that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, or looking dirty.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick and never holds a curl without a ton of hairspray.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair hard, dry and sticky-</li>
            <li> . is that if you bring it anywhere it spills out everywhere and wastes half the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would protect my hair a little since I use a straightener on it every day.  </li>
            <li> so you can probably find it a little cheaper somewhere else.</li>
            <li> and CHI Iron Guard 44 for my hair protectants, but those are both pretty expensive and didn&#x27;t work as well as this $5.00 Tressemme product!    </li>
            <li> It has this nifty spray little handle thing-</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s is a little push-in button that you have to push before spraying it to get the product out, but</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes along way and hair is so manageable when blow drying.</li>
            <li> It does hold the curls for a little while without hair spry , like 5 hours in my case as I don;t use hair spry ever&lt;</li>
            <li> I found the consistency to be a little sticky but nothing intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still yet to see how it holds up during cold, dry weather, but so far it&#x27;s works well in battling the humidity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this product did not weigh my hair down in any way whatsoever!  </li>
            <li> Total waste of 8 bucks and shipping was forever!!!</li>
            <li> Sprayer could use some work, it is a little messy, sprays too heavily.</li>
            <li> Hair does get wet after sprayed and I sometimes have hard time getting my hair curled</li>
            <li> The nozzle is awkward as it seems to squirt too fast and too concentrated.</li>
            <li> When I curled my hair after coloring it, my hair looked dried and fried.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON EXPENSIVE SALON PRODUCTS - you don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I used as the instructions said and some detangler and blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON EXPENSIVE SALON PRODUCTS - you don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t fry the hair while I blow dried.</li>
            <li> I heat style my hair almost everyday</li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I used it both before I blow dried my hair and straightened it.</li>
            <li> I tend to curl my hair a few times a week and have been warned by my hairdresser to use a thermal protecting spray.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked oily, my hair was limp and my scalp itched by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I can give it just a few spritz around my head</li>
            <li> I know just a few mists</li>
            <li> Once it dried my hair took on a bit of dullness and film.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> All of my skepticism was misplaced however.</li>
            <li> however I have a few problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend straightening your hair everyday even if you use this product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fried and dried out despite the fact that I use a spritz of this spray on every section before I use the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it everyday</li>
            <li> Clarifying shampoo (like from Neutrogena) should help with product build up &amp; hair brushes should be changed every so few months anyways.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this at Walmart for a few years for about 5 dollars.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me, I have used it a few times, I like the smell of it</li>
            <li> and this has happened to me a few times</li>
            <li> It never feels heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> If you overspray it gets a little stiff( I found this to be a bonus while straightening my sections stayed sectioned).</li>
            <li> However, may hair was a little stiff,</li>
            <li> My hair was straw for the past few weeks, but Tresemme helped it stay soft and healthy despite the bad products and the bad state of my hair.</li>
            <li> Also it smells like chemicals and made my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I thought the product would be like a silicone protectant that wouldn&#x27;t affect the softness of my hair, but my hair was stiff.  </li>
            <li> and I couldnt separate it into part; it was so stiff and stuck together.</li>
            <li> Tresemme made my hair feel tacky and stiff upon application.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I do have is that the bottle is a little awkward to hold and try to squeeze and spray, but the pros definitely out way that one con.</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used products like this and found that they tend to leave my hair heavy, sticky, and not manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally very wary of heat treatment on my hair, but this stuff really hits the spot.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dull, less shiny.  </li>
            <li> It was even worse when I applied it to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for very little product either; you always have to look at the fl.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of other Tresemme products but this one is just AWESEOME!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice in the past couple years and both times I tried to travel with it somewhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used CHI and S factor thermal protectors in the past.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it&#x27;s really expensive here on amazon.</li>
            <li> If you know what TRESemme products USUALLY smell like, it&#x27;s about like that.</li>
            <li> I usually just use hair serum in my hair but thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> I order something every month usually, and have never found&lt;br /&gt;something</li>
            <li> I was getting bored with it and it looked frumpy and putting it up was starting to give me migraines</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get any volume with my hair like I usually do.  </li>
            <li> She said heat protectants are meant to work with blow-dryers and no more is needed for additional heat.  </li>
            <li> The bathroom floor was so slick even my dog slipped on it, as did I and my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because I try to use heat on my hair no more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but not sure if it&#x27;s done anything to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy on the hair!</li>
            <li> I usually spritz from mid-shaft (for me</li>
            <li> I usually straighten my hair so I needed a spray so my hair wouldn&#x27;t get damaged.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have been disappointed with an Amazon price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like add-on hair products because I never want my hair to feel like \\&quot;stuff\\</li>
            <li> $5.99 and the stores I usually shop in are $4.99....</li>
            <li> I like this product because leave a weird smell on the flat iron or makes my hair burn when I&#x27;m straightening it.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever even got split ends when I used this</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find products that work well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Sam appreciate all your hard work.</li>
            <li> so now I can&#x27;t do anything with it other than wear it pulled back :(</li>
            <li> It made my hair sticky and hard i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> But it makes my hair sticky and hard to brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> This heat tamer makes my hair dull instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> The trigger is made of hard plastic that can break in transit.</li>
            <li> When I would use other products my hair would with look weighed down or just oily and dirty</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair at least three times a week.</li>
            <li> people have complained that it doesn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not totally thrilled about the ingredients, but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my hair matted and tangled and icky feeling.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle broken within  few use.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hari</li>
            <li> The residue from the spray got on the flat iron and made it icky and it made my hair feel dirty and sticky.</li>
            <li> and before I put some mousse into my hair plus the TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Sprayer and a very small amount of hair spray.</li>
            <li> The trigger on this spray bottle is very difficult to use and by the time I got enough &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; out of it my finger hurt.</li>
            <li> - the price listed here is very expensive - local store sold this for $4.</li>
            <li> but I am very angry to know that the actual price of this product in stores is no.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands but they were greasy, smelled bad, or were really expensive.</li>
            <li> Its less expensive when you buy it in store that online..</li>
            <li> Seriously, you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> I was using an expensive, salon-brand heat protection, but decided to switch to save a little money.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any oily or hard, hairspray-like residue.</li>
            <li> My hair is not too thin or too thick.</li>
            <li> I guess it does protect your hair, because it makes my hair so hard to be curled!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from amazon, but when I first bought it from target, it worked horribly.</li>
            <li> It stays down and smooths the texture!!!!</li>
            <li> And when I felt my hair, it was so rough, I only used 4 sprays through out my hair, but it made my hair feel and look ugly. :(</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course hair.  </li>
            <li> On the bottle it say use liberally, and they mean it!</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced any heat damaged after using this to flatiron my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how the product itself works, but the bottle is horrible.  </li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical about purchasing this product once my usual expensive heat protector ran out.</li>
            <li> I got one and the other one is fully spilled :(</li>
            <li> Hated  this product, no matter how little or small I used</li>
            <li> Also, the sprayer is poorly designed and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> A few pre sprays into the sink are all that is needed but still slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> For under $4, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Tresemme heat protection spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get the mist to come out.</li>
            <li> Im soooo angry.....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> I had finally resolved to stop blow drying and straightening my hair all together to stop the horrible damage.</li>
            <li> It sounds weird</li>
            <li> From the reviews I read this product is supposed ot help with that, but within an hour my hair was puffed up worse than ever!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not feel that it helped protect my hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> 1st of all I&#x27;d like to add that this item tells you to spay your hair before you flat iron which is the worst thing you can do to your hair.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t bad but unnecessary, just another useless chemical to be exposed to.</li>
            <li> so I was really afraid of giving her heat damage</li>
            <li> I recommend you use it, usually I think these sprays are worthless.. but not this one!</li>
            <li> I was so mad</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  :-(</li>
            <li> I use very expensive heat protecting oils, sprays, creams etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too bad, but it does leave some buildup.</li>
            <li> I was having a really bad hair day and went online to see if I could find a product to buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just sort of a hair product smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> am a bit disappointed in Amazon, this product arrived leaking a bit.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this</li>
            <li> some people hate that it has a locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> Annoying; why have a lock??</li>
            <li> When I try to spray it, it just leaks out of the base of the sprayer.  </li>
            <li> its not that bad!</li>
            <li> I just hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed box was leaking the bottle</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the packing of the product.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible service!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel nasty and caked up.</li>
            <li> Really awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is supposed to do, but all it did was make my hair tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> love this brand .. i was surprise when i bought one of this and i show to my step mom ,its funny coz we have the same thing lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this helps my hair :p I can&#x27;t tell a difference really.</li>
            <li> I like it for two reasons. First, it smells good. Also, I believe it indeed protects my hair from the damage of heating to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;But the effect is not that obvious.</li>
            <li> I have medium-thick curly hair that I like to blow dry/flat iron almost every day. Even if my hair stays straight throughout the day, it gets crazy frizzy and very dry as the day goes on. Ever since I started using this stuff, my hair has behaved itself! I love it. At first I thought it was a new shampoo I was trying, but I&#x27;ve tried it with more than one shampoo/conditioner now and the effect has stayed. It makes my straight hair sleek and soft, not greasy and not frizzy. The style holds much better throughout the day and I get home with my hair looking the way it did when I left the house in the morning! I typically use this, dry my hair, flat iron and then top it off with just a bit of an anti-humidity hair spray and I&#x27;m good to go! Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Now, my problem first is that I was in walmart and saw pretty much the exact same spray for $4.99. So I bought it and loved it! Then I decided in my mind I should return this one but I used it when it came in and no heat damage at all. I just couldn&#x27;t use it on my hair before I flat ironed it because I have natural hair so it just curled up and wouldn&#x27;t flat iron. Never again. But I did use it before I started blow drying and my hair was super super soft. I sprayed so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, I have two now and I won&#x27;t be returning either or them. They&#x27;re going to last a long, long time and I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky like most other heat protectors do. Spray it on and then use your hot tools. No crunchy hair after heat is applied either. Soft and silky hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was looking for something that would protect my hair a little since I use a straightener on it every day.  This stuff smells awesome and makes my hair nice and smooth when I am done.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the rave reviews for this product. After using it for a week, I saw absolutely no improvement in my hair. Also, the sprayer is poorly designed and difficult to use. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes hair very soft and manageable. Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a product for frizzy and unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> Any time a product delivers what they promise I am a happy camper. I have been using Tresemme for a long time and I am not surprised by the quality of this product. I&#x27;m pleased and will continue to use Tresemme for my hair care needs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, not expensive, but a very professional hair treatment</li>
            <li> I use this on the ends to help protect them before I blow dry or curl them. I also use it at night as a setting spray if I&#x27;m going to roll my hair up in a sock bun to preserve my silky smooth blow out and give me a nice flip out on the ends. I wake up in the morning, unroll my sock and have smooth pretty hair, ready to go. When I don&#x27;t use this on the ends my hair doesn&#x27;t come out with any flip to it, just more of a wimpy bend. I&#x27;m happy that I can use this for heat free styling like my sock bun as well as heat styling to protect and give silky shine. Good stuff. Great price.</li>
            <li> This is a good thermal heat tamer but it&#x27;s not any better than Pantene.  I will have to compare the prices to see which one would be a better deal as they both have the same results.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it one star is because I had to.  After I bought and received this product I went to walmart and found the same exact one same size and everything for$ 3.70 cheaper. I was passed and couldn&#x27;t send it back. If you want this product  just go to walmart and save some money</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My hair feels incredibly soft when using it with my blow dryer and flat iron.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I curl my hair with a wand and before I put some mousse into my hair plus the TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Sprayer and a very small amount of hair spray. Well, let me tell you something, the curls stay in my hair for 3 days. I don&#x27;t know what the magic is but I think it&#x27;s this TRESemme spray. Love the scent also, I am addicted to it, I&#x27;ll always have some extra bottles in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Spray is to strong coming up and my hair sizzle when i put heat to it because it is too wet.  Need a better nozzle to lightly spray hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products specifically for straightening my hair and this combo (gel &amp; protective spray) is by far the best I have come across. It leaves your hair ooooo so soft. My 25 year old daughter intro&#x27;d me to it and she should know she buys every product under the sun.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this product and I have to say I do kinda love it. I use it before blow drying and then before styling. I didn&#x27;t experience any build up. My hair is not too thin or too thick. So the product worked well for me. I thought my hair looked nicer with the spray in it than without it. I feel this is the kind of product that will work differently on everyone. It&#x27;s a pretty low price so I suggest trying it. (:</li>
            <li> This is great to use before using a curling iron or straightener, helps protect the heat from damaging your hair. Hasa nice scent too.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t put anything in my hair because I hate the way it looks, but this thermal heat protective spray really does the trick! It keeps it straight, protected, healthy-looking, and gives it a great shine too! DEFINITELY buy this product: inexpensive, lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s the perfect product for any hair!!</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful, works great.  Best heat protectant I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
            <li> When I curled my hair after coloring it, my hair looked dried and fried.  Luckily I found this product on Amazon because it has really saved my hair from damage! When I curled my hair after spraying this product, my hair looked shiny and healthy. I definitely recommend this product but make sure you don&#x27;t overspray because your hair will get sticky.</li>
            <li> I do not agree with people about the residue. I have fine/wavy hair, use blow dry and flat iron often. After I use tresemme heat spray it makes my hair shine and no residue at all. The only products I can compare it with are those used in salon on my hair(redken, aveda). Those usualy have strong smell and leave residue to the point that I have to wash my hair same day to relieve it of all of that. Then I just use my trusted tresemme and love it.</li>
            <li> Light feeling in hair. Love!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works best to protect your hair especially I do a lot of blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this heat tamer protective spray about a month ago and I loved it! The price is hard to beat at $8- with free shipping. It shipped fast and the bottle is a good size. I use this spray on my hair before every blow dry or hair straightening I do, whether my hair is wet or dry, and it always leaves it feeling so silky and light afterwards, it feels like I just paid to get a deep condition! I have long, very thick wavy hair. It has been bleached a lighter blonde than my natural color and I&#x27;ve been known to have pretty dry and split ends. I recently got my ends trimmed and I can proudly say that this product has kept me completely split end free since. The only complaint I do have is that the bottle is a little awkward to hold and try to squeeze and spray, but the pros definitely out way that one con. I would definitely recommend this spray! I&#x27;m going to keep buying it after my current bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I combed my hair, then spritzed on this product and could barely get the comb through my hair. Fell for all the rave reviews here and on youtube by beauty gurus. I use low heat setting on my hair dryer and don&#x27;t use a straightener and my hair is frizzier than normal. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this. The smell is good and I like the spray bottle. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used!  I have fine, thin hair and almost every product I use has some major flaw -- makes my hair look lifeless, or dull, or smells too strong.  I stopped trying after a while.  I tried this product on a whim and I can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  The scent is light, it goes on light, it gives my hair more volume.  It&#x27;s livelier and feels better.  Even when I don&#x27;t need a heat protectant, I use it because it makes my hair just better.  Will purchase this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. I use a flat iron on my daughters hair for school it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t prevent heat damage.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because of the numerous positive reviews. Unfortunately it leavs very heavy buildup on my hair, and I use it very sparingly, so much so that the next day my hair looks like I did not wash it for 3-4 days. To be fair, the hair looks great the first day, but definitely needs to be washed next morning...</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have been having problems with my hair being frizzy and this product has made it feel and look silky.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome...I first read about it on a makeup blog or something and tried it out...I use a blowdryer and straigtening iron almost daily, and I have blonde hair that is heavily bleached with highlights. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON EXPENSIVE SALON PRODUCTS - you don&#x27;t need them. Just follow the directions and you will see how awesome this is. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling yucky at all.</li>
            <li> Love this! Never used heat protectant on my hair until I had heat damage and my curl pattern was ruined. I have been deep conditioning and protein treatmenting my way back to my curl pattern and this has helped me on my days I want my hair straight and safe.</li>
            <li> It really works. I use blow dryer every other day and use this. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on hair and even protects the hair from getting split ends due to the heat. I&#x27;m going to continue to use this one.</li>
            <li> This is a must have! Hair has grown so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing super special. Makes hair a bit shiny but that&#x27;s all I see different.  I should&#x27;ve bought it at a local store instead of paying shipping for it thru Amazon, not eligible for prime.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great and smells awesome. It leaves my hair soft and shiny. A little goes a long way. I love the design of the spray trigger. It makes it so easy to spray on my hair, wish hairspray had the same kind of trigger. The spray comes out in a wide mist so gives good coverage on my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I do not know if it actually protects my hair or not (how am I meant to even testify that?? O.o...) but it smells great and gives me a sense of worth knowing that I AM protecting my hair. When I first started using a hair straightener I just used it on my hair but now I must spray this on. For one, it definitely gets rid of the burnt hair smell (: And my boyfriend loves the smell too! Score!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! No residue and smells good.</li>
            <li> Good produce. It protect my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It saved my hair from being extremely dry and now I&#x27;m not afraid to blow dry it everyday. It also smells pleasant and fresh.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Okay so I have very FINE BLONDE hair, dyed, and straightened/curled/whathaveyou every day. I can&#x27;t afford to not protect my breakable hear, and i can&#x27;t afford to buy the products from salons.  I am always trying different protectors and have had my way with fairly nice sprays. What it comes down to, once i adjusted to the way this (and frankly most...) protectors are, watery (opposed to the hairspray-like salone protection i used)its my go-to when i&#x27;m low and dont have much money. its about three to four dollars so i just stock up when i can and itll last me a fair while...  for the price, and its effectablility i give it a five. I would recommend this. However, there are better out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a thermal protector for as long as I can remember and never have paid the price that it is sold on Amazon.  I think the highest I&#x27;ve paid at Meijer is $3.99.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use heat protective spray as often as I should, but I read about this in a beauty magazine and thought I would give it a shot. I&#x27;m not too pleased with this product.   When I press the nozzle I don&#x27;t feel as if the spray coats my hair evenly, it&#x27;s not a very well made spout I guess. Sometimes it gets gunked up and a few times I&#x27;ve had to press it more than once. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the product seems to weigh my hair down. My hair has a normal bounce, even after straightening, but after using this it seems to fall rather heavily.   It does give a nice shiny appearance after straightening, but I just don&#x27;t think its worth the price, especially since there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair at least three times a week. I was using an expensive, salon-brand heat protection, but decided to switch to save a little money.    I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a few months now, and I love how silky it keeps my hair. It&#x27;s also easy to use with the trigger nozzle. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I saw this on a youtube tutorial video and decided to try it... it is amazing. It&#x27;s says its just a heat tamer, but it made my hair super soft and it holds the style. My hair is long and thick and never holds a curl without a ton of hairspray. I sprayed this on my wet hair, blow dried it, sprayed it again and curled it. Then slept on it and wore it the whole next day and it still has its curl. I didn&#x27;t use any hair spray either. I&#x27;ve only used it this once so far, but I am definitely going to be using this often. Also, it&#x27;s only 3.50 at walmart, so I would just buy it there or target, not online. The only complaint I have is that the lock button doesn&#x27;t stop it from coming out very well, so my walmart bag got kind of messy, so just beware of that.   I saw some reviews saying this made their hair greasy, if you are prone to greasy hair, just spray the bottom half of your hair, or spray it in your hands and run it through the bottom half.   I am completely sold on this product after one use!</li>
            <li> Super duper lightweight spray that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, smells fantastic, really does make a difference with heat damage</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve received five stars if when it came in the mail the bottle wasn&#x27;t slightly unscrewed and wet.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me by a friend. She saw them at a local store and stocked up, and she decided to show me how amazing it was. My hair has never been so shiny after using heat products. I do believe that it has protected my hair from the damage of so much styling, especially compared to what my hair would have been without using any heat protective. This stuff is awesome! It&#x27;s not too expensive considering how long it has lasted me, and you only need a few sprays to cover your whole head, otherwise you are putting too much and it will build up. If you put just the right amount, then you can&#x27;t see anything in your hair. i also think that when i straighten my hair using this, it keeps the style much longer! It&#x27;s almost as if it amplifies the heat. Must try!</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron my hair every day and it really started to take a toll on my hair.  I was getting my hair done for a wedding last weekend and the stylist suggested i get a heat protecting product for my hair. After doing some research i decided to try this product.      Not only is it $5 at cvs, but it works so well. i don&#x27;t usually use product in my hair because i don&#x27;t like the greasy or filmy residue most usually leave.  This product leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s anything even in it. Also leaves my hair smelling good all day.    Definitely worth it to try this product before you go and drop $$ on an expensive salon type brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It smells great and keeps your hair shiny and silky at all times! I use this as well before curling my hair and it works great on it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must-have in your beauty supplies *thumbs up*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now because it&#x27;s cheaper than Paul Mitchell Heat Seal, and it does the job, but whoever designed the dispensing function on the packaging needs to go back to industrial design school. Once you get halfway through the bottle it basically stops working. When you squeeze, sometimes you&#x27;ll get nothing at all, and sometimes you&#x27;ll get giant drops of product squirted at your face and in your hair! Only after doing a few test squeezes in the sink will you manage to get a good flow again, but by that time you&#x27;ve wasted a fairly large amount of product. There are spray nozzles that actually emit an even, consistent flow in use for hair sprays in Asia (like Liese Juicy Shower), so I don&#x27;t know why Tresseme doesn&#x27;t get on board.</li>
            <li> I dont know about the reviews that say it doesnt work well and its greasy and all that. My first sprits and straighten was wonderful. However, the next day.....I COMBED THROUGH MY HAIR AND SAW FLAKES COMING OUT. I have clean healthy hair. My hairdresser and my dermatologist compliment me on how well i take care of not only the hair, but my skin and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may have simply been the effect on my scalp and hair but i immediately knew it was this and ceased use. As i said, it could be just me, but what i know is i wont be using this or recommending this for anyone else to use.</li>
            <li> When I received the TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer in the mail, there was a note from the post office stating that this product was received damaged. I contacted the seller and let them know that the bottle was empty upon arrival and they immediately sent me new bottle along with apologies. I am pleased with the product. It is inexpensive and I feel that it works just as nicely in comparison to the Nexus version which is twice as much. I am very pleased with high level of customer service and with the product!    [[ASIN:B000H88QOM TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray 8 fl oz (236 ml)]]</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst product I have ever used.  Everyone else seems to use this as their go-to heat protectant.  However, this stuff makes me look like a greaseball.  At first I was using a lot, as it turned out, but then I kept clarifying my hair of the product and using less of it.  I have more hair than most people.  ONE spritz on the ends still left me looking like a greaser.  This stuff is nasty.  I ended up getting the heat protectant from Beyond the Zone at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  Way better than Tresemee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basically obsessed with this product right now!!! I have used the Chi Iron Guard for the past year, but this stuff is MUCH better. The Chi Iron Guard makes my hair sticky and dry. This Tresemme stuff seems so vitamin-enriched, it&#x27;s super lightweight and makes my hair smooth and shiny, plus IT SMELLS AMAZING!!!! I want to wear it as perfume. LOL. The Chi Iron Guard doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. Honestly this stuff hasn&#x27;t only protected my hair from heat, but makes my hair look so much more healthy. I&#x27;m so happy I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have wavy, fine hair. Hair that curls/frizzes when exposed to humidity or wet. So, this definitely works on my type of hair.</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery. Exactly as advertised. Would do again.</li>
            <li> I really like this heat tamer spray. I have slightly wavy, waist length hair that I often blow dry and flat iron. This stuff has kept the ends looking healthy and has prevented my hair from drying out or ever smelling burnt when using heating tools. It&#x27;s lightweight and not sticky at all. The only reason that i give it four stars is that the spray top doesn&#x27;t always spray even and seems to get stuck a bit at first. A few pre sprays into the sink are all that is needed but still slightly annoying. It may only be this one bottle though so I definitely would not let that deter you from purchasing. Overall, if your looking for an effective heat protectant at a wonderful price this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I like to spray from mid-length to ends and then run a wide tooth comb to evenly distribute the product prior to blowdrying.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very brittle and I do not feel this spray protects my hair at all.</li>
            <li> It is fine, easier than going to the grocery store to buy on Amazon</li>
            <li> I got one and the other one is fully spilled :(</li>
            <li> Great product, smells so good too! I spray it before I blow dry or curl my hair. It seems to protect my hair and make it smell good too!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product. In the past I have used products like this and found that they tend to leave my hair heavy, sticky, and not manageable. However I was really suprised by this product. I used as the instructions said and some detangler and blow dried my hair. It came out just as soft as it normally would have without anything in it (but now I get the heat protection).  Very impressed. Although I purchased this item at Target for about $2.99 so you can probably find it a little cheaper somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice in the past couple years and both times I tried to travel with it somewhere. Both times it leaked out. So the product is fine, but the packaging is pretty bad. If you buy it, don&#x27;t take it any where with you.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, I used to get my hair trimmed every 6-8 weeks b/c of split ends and damage from blow drying 3 times a week.  Since using this product, my hair looks and feels much healthier and I don&#x27;t get split ends as much.  It&#x27;s very light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue at all.  Very impressed by the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a professional hair stylist and use this every day on my own hair.</li>
            <li> I use this sparingly when I&#x27;m going to style my hair with an iron. I like it, it makes my hair feel nice and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I didn&#x27;t have heat damaged hair to begin with so I can&#x27;t tell if it actually protects my hair. But overall no complaints</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of my sister, who knows far more about hair care than I do. I use it before flat ironing and sometimes before blowdrying, and it seems to keep my hair healthy and smooth. I&#x27;ve never had problems with greasy or sticky residue, like some other products will give - but obviously, use this spray in moderation, or your hair might feel funky. It washes out easily and does exactly what I expected, so five stars for that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome...I first read about it on a makeup blog or something and tried it out...I use a blowdryer and straigtening iron almost daily, and I have blonde hair that is heavily bleached with highlights. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON EXPENSIVE SALON PRODUCTS - you don&#x27;t need them. Just follow the directions and you will see how awesome this is. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling yucky at all. I have spent so much money on expesive hair products (I use Pureology shampoo and conditioner, that stuff is PRICEY) but I will not buy anything else after using this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, doesn&#x27;t work for me. Returned.</li>
            <li> Absolute must have if you use any heat tools. It smells great and acts as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Loved it.Really good stuff for the hair.I purchased the instyler rotating iron and i needed someting to pretect my hair from all the heat.Well...this worked</li>
            <li> This smells good and works really well. When I used to straighten my hair a lot, I used this liberally; it never makes your hair greasy. I hardly ever even got split ends when I used this</li>
            <li> After seeing rave reviews for this product on beauty blogs, I decided to try it myself. I usually spray it directly on my hands and rub it into my hair both before blow drying and then a second time before straightening. It offers weightless heat protection and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any residue, just soft, shiny hair! For under $4, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Tresemme heat protection spray.</li>
            <li> Always protects my hair from my flat iron. It&#x27;s not sticky and it is very light.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Target store after hearing good reviews about it online. I straighten my hair almost every day so I really need some kind of protection on it if I want it to grow without breakage.    After I used this product for the first time I was amazed! It made my hair feel so silky and sleek. Also, it smells great and left my hair smelling wonderfully throughout the whole day.    I have previously used Redken Iron Silk 07 and CHI Iron Guard 44 for my hair protectants, but those are both pretty expensive and didn&#x27;t work as well as this $5.00 Tressemme product!    I&#x27;m very happy that I made this purchase and will be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> This worked good and was reasonable priced.  It may not be the very best I have ever used, but no complaints either.</li>
            <li> Whatever company makes the plastic sprays for &#x27;TRESEMME&#x27; should be evicted from the planet.  I purchase both the &#x27;smooth&#x27; heat protector and this Tresemme&#x27; tamer protector.  Both of these products, the spray part - not only didn&#x27;t spray the product but fell to pieces right before my eyes on the counter.  If I really said in the review how it affected me they certainly wouldn&#x27;t publish it so I am using a F. Scott Fitzgerald approach and stipulate &#x27;don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;.  I always like Tresemme&#x27; products but this misadventure cured me forever.  No just one bottle but two in the same day.  Frustration or what?????????</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice the product doing much for my hair, other than it used to be shiny and now it is dull. The nozzle is awkward as it seems to squirt too fast and too concentrated. The scent isn&#x27;t bad but unnecessary, just another useless chemical to be exposed to. I also can&#x27;t tell if it is protecting my hair when I blow dry, other than there is no immediate damage. I won&#x27;t be buying it again since there seems to be no obvious advantage to using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really big on styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am starting to notice that I&#x27;m not taking care of my hair the way it&#x27;s supposed to be treated. I blow dry a lot and I only use a curling iron to staighten out the front pieces of my hair because it&#x27;s curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was looking for wasn&#x27;t anything much. I just wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t fry the hair while I blow dried. Many of the heat protectant sprays only are approved for use when the hair is dry ONLY. Something of which wasn&#x27;t very appealing, honestly. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for very little product either; you always have to look at the fl. oz. on the bottle to see how much you&#x27;re getting for your money. I&#x27;m a shopper that looks for what I want, but also offers the most for the cheapest price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be acquired here or somewhere like Walmart or any other store. It has this nifty spray little handle thing- some people hate that it has a locking mechanism. I, on the other hand, would probably complain if the spray handle squirted all over my things in my bag if I ever traveled with it. So I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on it. It smells really nice (reminiscent of a conditioner I had as a child, actually) and it really doesn&#x27;t leave the hair to have a residue. You can apply wet or dry, which is a plus- I use it BOTH ways. And, it could be the texture of my hair, but it definitely has left it silkier and prone to less tangling (I have thick, curly hair that tangles easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained that it doesn&#x27;t do its job. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see whether or not it&#x27;ll protect my hair from the heat, but others have mentioned that they think it damaged their hair? While I can&#x27;t say one way or another, I can say that hair does split and break as it grows. I can&#x27;t imagine it being a direct result of using a heat protectant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap, effective heat protectant that you can use both before you blow dry and before you curl or straighten, definitely buy this little guy! You won&#x27;t regret it!ittle guy! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews here on Amazon, I decided this product was cheap enough to take the risk of purchasing.  I use very expensive heat protecting oils, sprays, creams etc. such as Pureology, CHI, Morroccan Oil, Agadir Oil, Lanza and Kerastase.  With low expectations, I tried the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray on my damp hair after washing and conditioning.  I blew it dry and immediately noticed a much silkier texture to my hair. My ends looked very clean as well! I then sprayed the Tresemme on my dry hair prior to flat ironing and combed through.  WOW!  My hair is baby soft and very fine and this product did not weigh my hair down in any way whatsoever!  That is huge for me!  In fact, my hair had a beautiful bounce and shine to it after I finished flat ironing my wavy hair straight.  Sometimes, after I flat iron my hair can look limp but not with the Tresemme.  I can&#x27;t speak to this brand&#x27;s other products but I must say given the fact that their spray is so fantastic I might have to try their line of shampoos and conditioners as well.  For the effectiveness of the product along with the extremely affordable price it is a must try! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> protects the hair, doesn&#x27;t leave it silky and amazing but it works well enough and is cheap. easy squirt bottle top.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I use is everyday when I flat iron my hair. I really feel like it protect my hair, leave it shiny, and it helps the iron slide easy. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products and many seem to leave my hair a little oily, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> First I broke the sprayer trying to get it to work.  I poured it another spray bottle.  It makes my hair flat and smooth--until I leave the house on a humid day when the frizz appears.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff. I wanted to try it because it has such great reviews and people claim to love it, but it just made my hair feel so sticky and look poofy. I&#x27;ll stick to my fantasia heat serum from now on.</li>
            <li> Works very well, nice smell.</li>
            <li> I heat style my hair almost everyday and this really makes a difference. Not only does my hair feel less fryed, but it makes your hair smoother and easier to curl or straighten. It also smells SOOOO good :)</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I use a straightener or curling iron... not only does it help protect my hair, but it leaves it feeling super soft and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li> I use everyday. Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product!! Not greasy!</li>
            <li> Smells really good for hair and great as heat protectant.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! Thank u!</li>
            <li> Smell nice , does the work .&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t expect something like this to smell this good .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to the world of curling irons and flat irons and I picked this up at WalMart one day hoping that it would help. I have to admit that I might be speaking from pure inexperience.....it&#x27;s not too bad, but it does leave some buildup. But it could just be me, because I know I was saturating my hair with this stuff a couple of times. As for protection, only time will tell as to how well it protects. Give this a try, though! If I have more time with testing other heat-protectant sprays, I could easily give this four or five stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but amazing things about the TRESemme Heat Tamer Spray for the past few years. It has been the go-to heat protectant for beauty gurus all across YouTube. After years of hearing about it, I finally decided to pick up one for myself. I have fine hair that I recently decided to style with heat. I use about 15 sprays all across my head from middle to the ends of my dry hair. My hair feels healthier and I don&#x27;t have any more dry ends! It has a nice fragrant smell that last all day! If you&#x27;re on the go, the spray can be lock activated by pushing a button on the side. You will never have to worry about it accidentally spraying inside your luggage! There are also tons of coupons in the circulars if you&#x27;re looking to save a dollar or two on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact bottle in stores for $4 in Rite Aid. It works okay makes your hair oily after a day though not crazy oily but noticeable so youll have to wash your hair daily.</li>
            <li> so happy I purchased this!!  works great for people that use heat on their hair a lot. I will be purchasing this again for sure!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair.  I was having a really bad hair day and went online to see if I could find a product to buy.  After reading all of the reviews I went to CVS and got some.  When I got home, I put it on my hair and flat ironed it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how good my hair looked.  I have never found anything that works like this.  My hair looked like Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s when I was done!  I used it again this morning before I blow dried and again before I flat ironed and the results were amazing.  I don&#x27;t need to try any other products because I will use this forever.  FYI I have very fine hair but a lot of it.  This did not make my hair look greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This item is good for the price you pay I really havent had any problems with it it seems to protect my hair well and I like that its versitile that I can use it with any styler. So ya and it smells good 2!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and makes my hair look. I am mixed (white and black) and my hair isnt the typical &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; girl texture. It gets nappy just like a black girl when it gets any type of wetness to. I used it before I flat ironed my hair and it makes it so soft and shiny. I will be buying more very soon!!!!</li>
            <li> my wife really likes this stuff so Im happy</li>
            <li> My color treated hair is always exposed to either a curling iron or a flat iron everyday and I never used any heat protectant.  I decided to give this a try and I love this product!  Not only does it smell good, and doesn&#x27;t cause any build up, I no longer have anymore split ends!</li>
            <li> I had been watching several youtube videos on styling hair and kept noticing everyone used this product. I was using the Chi heat protectant and never noticed anything great about it. I purchased this and I think its the best thing I have ever put on my hair. My hair instantly felt sleek and healthy, smells awesome too! I think I will use this the rest of my life and it only cost about $4 at walmart.</li>
            <li> The best heat spray! I have mid-back natural curly hair and I stick to three sprays around my head. Too much and my hair an feel sticky sometimes with the heat here. I spray my hair after every shower when it&#x27;s still wet regardless of if i&#x27;m going to put heat on it or not. Great for casual wear with the sun.</li>
            <li> works pretty well and priced adequately. will purchase again</li>
            <li> I use this spray every time after I wash my hair, even if I&#x27;m not going to use a flat iron! I absolutely love the smell and like how it doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair or make it feel sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute worst. It doesn&#x27;t work and actually takes me longer to fix my hair. The smell is overly sweet and gives me headaches. When I spray it on dry hair, using very little, my hair is very wet and takes two hours to dry so I can use it. I recommend using salon-quality heat protectants instead.</li>
            <li> The fact that this is a spray doesn&#x27;t work to well for me when using a flat-iron. The consistency makes my naturally curly hair fluff up and get kinda frizzy. As for just using before I blowdry, I think it is fine. But since it brings the waves/frizz/fluff I end up having to go back over my hair with a flatiron several times, so I&#x27;m not sure how protected my hair can be after that.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING! Works great and good price!</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose and extremely easy to apply ..5 sprays for mid length hair is just fine , should last for atleast 30 sessions.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other Heat Protective Spray, but this one works very well.  I blow dry my hair every other day and sometimes straighten in-between and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference since I started using this.  I&#x27;ve been using it almost two months and have fewer split ends and my hair seems shinier. I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of tutorials for hair with this in it, so I bought it. I use it before I blowdry and then over dry hair before I flatten or curl it. I admit, I love it! It goes on softly, non-sticky. The best part is that, to me, it smells great, almost like a hair salon product. You can smell it hours later as your hair moves around. Again, I love it and totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product was sent without proper packaging and because of that it was damaged during shipping, it leaked all over my purchases. I contacted the seller for a refund or a replacement but haven&#x27;t heard back. Absolutely horrible service!</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s a great spray, and it protects without weighting or dirtying your hair</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and gives my hair a lovely shine!</li>
            <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product has positive reviews. I put some and curled my hair with a curling wand and this thing turned to dry yellow sticky stuff that stuck to my hair. It won&#x27;t come off even if i wash</li>
            <li> Works great....wish it smelled better....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why all these people are complaining about the smell its not even noticeable unless you are smelling your hair, which, why are you smelling your hair in the first place? This product is lightweight and does its job. When I use my straightener it glides down my hair which is completely due to this product as when I don&#x27;t use it, iron does not glide over the hair. For a cheap brand item this is awesome!</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair both straight &amp; soft. I love all of their products because they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I was quite pleased. It arrived very quickly and was not damaged however you would say that. It is light-weight, it works well with my thick hair, and made it shiny and smooth. What I really admired most about this product was how nice it smelled. The bottle size seemed to fit it&#x27;s prise fine. My only down fall on this item was how the sprayer works. There&#x27;s is a little push-in button that you have to push before spraying it to get the product out, but that&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s made. Overall, this product is very good and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its hard to gauge the success of the product overall,  but it helps seal in moisture on the ends of your hair if you heat style it, and smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used CHI and S factor thermal protectors in the past. This seems to do the same job but for a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smell&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;seems to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sprayer head distributes the product very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;None that I&#x27;ve noticed yet</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from amazon, but when I first bought it from target, it worked horribly. It left my hair feeling brittle and dry ( I have relaxed 4b/4c hair) Hated  this product, no matter how little or small I used I just hated it. I ended up giving it to my friend. However, she said it worked great for her</li>
            <li> I like this TRESemme it protects my hair if you used to style your hair with heat you had better to buy it, it will protect your hair</li>
            <li> Good price and good smell. That&#x27;s all I can&#x27;t tell since I haven&#x27;t used it a lot. It does make my hair softer and easier to straighten or curl!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells really nice &amp; feels good on my hair. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky like other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Works well, protect my hair form the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again in store.&lt;br /&gt;s ea ar arew gr gra fe</li>
            <li> This spray is great for people who use too many styling tools. It&#x27;s really light and doesnt leave my hair feeling greasy! i&#x27;d totally recommend it</li>
            <li> This is a life saver. I straighten and blow dry my hair everyday and I have noticed a difference since I started using this product. My hair feels more soft and smooth than it ever has before. I have only applied the product to my wet hair before I blow dry it but I can really tell the difference. My hair is less frizzy and the ends look shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get the mist to come out. If you do like this product, I advise you to get it at CVS at a cheaper cost.</li>
            <li> I have used a few heat protectants and because of all the positive reviews I chose to give this one a shot. Having high expectations I was surprised at how water based this is. Despite what the instructions on the bottle say, this can’t be use directly with heat styling tools. You will have to spray and wait for it to dry or blow dry your hair. I do not blow dry so I’ve been spraying it on after I wash and letting it dry altogether. This makes this product less than ideal for touching up or adjusting with heat styling tools. For example, if you have flat-ironed your hair and want to curl the ends but have the kind of hair that curls when wet, this would not be a good option for the task at hand. Another issue I’ve had with the product is that if you do not shake the bottle before you use it it seems that the ingredients separate and you may end up spraying what seems like just water or ,on the flip side, too much product into your hair which explains why some of the negative reviews call the product watery while others claim it is too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;All of this being said, if you have a one step process, shake the bottle before using, and don’t over spray, the product seems to work fine as a heat protectant and it makes the hair feel “silky.”&lt;br /&gt;Overall I don’t think that I’ll be using this product again as I’m looking for something a bit more versatile.</li>
            <li> i LOVEEEEEE this heat tamer, im not a flatiron queen... but everytime i wash my hair and do a deep condition i always blowdry my hair ....and when i do i would usually end up wit hairs on the floor because my hair wasnt protected, and my hair would be DRY AND brittle feeling ....but using this was perfect my mom even asked me ur hair is this straight and soft from blow drying? nind you (she ANTI blow drying) ... so it was great to see her have a different perspective due to me using this spray! Thanks TRESemme&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, it moisturizes my hair and it has a comfortable smell. The best of all IT&#x27;S NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I just have to say that this stuff...(sniffles)....saved my hair! I had been using a heat protectant by got2be, and I had no idea that my hair was still being damaged until one day I went to get my hair cut. The lady said my hair was very damaged, and she could tell it was from heat damage. I am addicted to my flat iron, so I knew she was right. I told her I used a heat protectant, but she said the one I was using had been known not to work. She said that normally they would recommend me a salon brand heat protectant since I was in a salon, but she told me about Tresemme&#x27;s Heat Tamer spray. After my hair appointment, I ran to Walmart and found the spray. The next day I decided to try it out. I used it both before I blow dried my hair and straightened it. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in how my hair felt compared to the other heat protectant I was using. My hair just felt light, smooth, and most of all healthy. I continued to use it until my next hair appointment a few months later. I always go to the same lady in the salon. I didn&#x27;t tell her I had been using the spray, I just wanted to see if she noticed any difference in my hair. She complimented me on how much healthier my hair was, and she couldn&#x27;t find any trace of heat damage! This stuff is magic in a bottle. Thank you Tresemme.&lt;br /&gt;A quick tip...do not spray too mcuh or you will regret it. It will make your hair look greasy if you use too much. On the bottle it say use liberally, and they mean it!</li>
            <li> Works well. Great hair styling tool. It helps prevent more hair breakage. It leaves my hair silky smooth!! It&#x27;s just what I expected. I am completely satisfied with this product. Just Awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this product! ! I feel such a huge difference in my hair when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back based on the great reviews and low cost in comparison to other heat proctectants. It wasn&#x27;t sticky on my hair, had a nice smell and still allowed me to style, straighten, curl, blow dry...whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was/is the nozzle. I&#x27;ve had 2 of these so far and it always breaks on me near the end of it&#x27;s use. I wish it was a different type of spray, but I can live with it because I&#x27;ve tried over 5 different sprays...all more expensive to this one and this is the best BY FAR. Will go back to purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time as I only straighten my hair once a year. I used it in conjunction with another heat protectant and I was satisfied with the results. When I reverted i had no heat damage to my curly hair. So i will give this product a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I like this product because leave a weird smell on the flat iron or makes my hair burn when I&#x27;m straightening it.</li>
            <li> This is the only heat protector I use. Rather it&#x27;s for my real hair or weave lol. I also love the little lock that they added on the bottle!</li>
            <li> It is light and it protects my hair, but it did not add any shine. I wanted something more to it, like redkin&#x27;s hot sets or iron shape/</li>
            <li> good price &amp; quality. Use it with my curling - save my hair from high temperature. Big size, 2 years use it</li>
            <li> This spray served it&#x60;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrant it has. I&#x27;m not sure if it really helps protect from heat, but it smells really good. Hair does get wet after sprayed and I sometimes have hard time getting my hair curled but I guess that&#x27;s how it works to protect from heat? This is my first time using a product like this so I can&#x27;t compare to any other products but I would purchase this again if my current one runs out.</li>
            <li> I wear u-parts I make myself and I use this with Avocado butter and Fantasia IC Hair Polisher Heat Protector to flat iron my leave out. My hair always looks so natural and doesn&#x27;t revert! After I wash my hair with Suave&#x27;s sulfate free/silicone clarifying conditioner my hair always reverts back to its coils and I follow that by co washing my hair with suave waterfall mist conditioner. My hair stays moisturized! I flat iron my leave out weekly for the past 3 months and not damage so far.</li>
            <li> I use the TRESemme protective spray on my hair before using heat. It makes my hair smell really nice. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!! Worth every penny leaves your hair shinny and very soft and it protects your hair from heat great 3 in one product.</li>
            <li> Exploded in the package, soaking everything else I bought. There is nothing left in the bottle to use. I expect a full refund</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve used it now twice, and it leaves my hair totally soft and manageable. Another pro is that it has a great scent to it, I could smell it all day. The only downside is it&#x27;s really expensive here on amazon. I went to food 4 less, and saw it for $4.50. I bought mine for 8$.</li>
            <li> 22&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s more than a good product</li>
            <li> This is the best heat protectant on the market! This came in super quick, but unfortunately this was more expensive than Wal-Mart. A little bit of a bummer, but this product is fabulous, it has never stirred me wrong. Definitely try it out!</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this protects it both wet and dry from blowdrying and flat ironing without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> we received this product without expiry date or even a production date. how can we know if the content is still good if we don&#x27;t have it printed on the bottles</li>
            <li> My hair is a huge fan of this product. I recommend you use it, usually I think these sprays are worthless.. but not this one!</li>
            <li> Great Value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TreSemme is an average brand, but it stands for its value on products.&lt;br /&gt;I great value and must have if you use Blowdryer.</li>
            <li> First off, I always read reviews before I buy things. Ladies here were going nuts over the smell and I was really excited. I also so a lot of ladies bashing it. If you know what TRESemme products USUALLY smell like, it&#x27;s about like that. It&#x27;s not over powering at all, but it is pleasant. Anyway, I don&#x27;t use heat very often and when I do I use really great tools to help prevent damage. I&#x27;ve never really used heat protective spray though (I know! For shame!). I did notice a difference when I used it for the first time last night when I had to use my blow dryer and straightener. Normally my hair is crazy dry after using a blow dryer, but it was only moderately dried out. I&#x27;m going to try using a bit more of the spray next time around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several heat protectants and still noticed continuous damage to my hair. This was the first product that I began noticing less and less damage and was able to space out my hair cuts/trims since I started using it. I&#x27;ll spritz it on before any heat treatment and feel like it really is making a difference.</li>
            <li> I tend to curl my hair a few times a week and have been warned by my hairdresser to use a thermal protecting spray.  I tried this product because of the great Amazon reviews and because it was a lot more economical than what they sell in salons.  I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.  It smells great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny rather than stiff like some of the more expensive ones I have tried.  I&#x27;m excited to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times and absolutely love it.  It protects the hair from heat and leave it feeling great.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at my local drug store since it was so cheap. I usually just use hair serum in my hair but thought I&#x27;d give this a try. 1st of all I&#x27;d like to add that this item tells you to spay your hair before you flat iron which is the worst thing you can do to your hair. #1 rule you should always follow when it comes to hair... NEVER blow dry hair that is dry, blow dryers should only be used on wet/damp hair to avoid damage and NEVER EVER EVER flat iron hair that is wet or even slightly damp, this will burn your hair to a crisp! Just needed to clear that up before I review this product... 1st impression of the item, it smells nice and is only sticky when it&#x27;s still wet on your hair, once you blow dry there is no noticeable residue left behind. I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed my hair being \\&quot;protected\\&quot; any more than with my usual hair serums. One thing I have noticed is my hair color seems to be faded after 2 uses and I have noticed hair color on my white round blow drying brush (my hair is red so it&#x27;s hard to miss red on a white brush) Since this is the only new product in my routine, I can only think that this item is to blame. Overall impression, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting my hair other than stripping the color but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it is protecting my hair either. I don&#x27;t think I will be using this product again, if you already use some kind of leave in serum or oils you don&#x27;t really need this.</li>
            <li> This arrived earlier then i expected which was good. The packaging was a little sloppy but it kept the product safe which is  all the really matters. Smells pretty good but not great if you&#x27;re not ok with smells the are kinda chemical. Overall really good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It works better than most products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I have very coarse curly hair so it&#x27;s hard to find products that work well with my hair.</li>
            <li> It really helps to protect my hair from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use high heat to style my hair and always worried about now burning it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps my ends to keep with the heat</li>
            <li> This. Smells. Nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like imitation cherry soda that was manufactured in a Chinese almond factory, regurgitated and then bottled. I&#x27;d rather smell my own burnt hair than walk around smelling like this for the rest of the day. Gross.</li>
            <li> What a product! This product has made my hair more manageable, it is a unique product that helps the hair and not damaged it.  Great product!  I am very satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> Prompt service and good merchandise. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is really good for those who love styling their hair with curler and waver like me, as it can protect your hair from being damaged because of the heat coming from such hairstyling tools.</li>
            <li> I only used a small amount.  My fine textured hair was shiny, but not in a good way.  My hair looked oily, my hair was limp and my scalp itched by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The trigger on this spray bottle is very difficult to use and by the time I got enough &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34; out of it my finger hurt. I&#x27;ve used another similar product that works better on my hair and is easier to spray but unfortunately lots more money. It figures!</li>
            <li> I use this before I flat iron my hair and my daughter uses it before she blow drys, either way you choose to use it, it Provides great protection. It also smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> Never flat iron or blow dry my hair without it, holy grail! &amp; great price but sometimes select stores have it on sale for a even better price so just be sure to look out for that if your considering purchasing. Still a great quality authentic product that truly lives up to its purpose!</li>
            <li> Does the job and is affordable! Light weight and sprays evenly. Helps protect my hair and keep it soft after using heat.</li>
            <li> Product is good, leaves hair shiny, smells nice.  Sprayer could use some work, it is a little messy, sprays too heavily.</li>
            <li> I use this when blow drying and curling my hair. My hair seems to dry out less and keeps the style for longer. Smells DELISH!! I also have used it as a leave in conditioner in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase! Great product as described and fast shipping. Will definitely repurchase from this seller in the future! Works great for when I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical ordering something online for this. But, this product is awesome. It dries fast as long as you don&#x27;t spray too much and it&#x27;s easy to lug around in a bag</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful smell, protects my hair.. and I absolutely love it.. The reason why I gave it a 4 star because it cost too much online.. I got the same heat protector, same size in five dollars.. Its less expensive when you buy it in store that online..</li>
            <li> review by Wife-&lt;br /&gt;this is a good reliable product, that will&lt;br /&gt;- protect your hair from sizzle when using high heat irons&lt;br /&gt;- leave your hair straightened/curled, &amp; feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;- for long lasting Hold, you&#x27;ll need to apply hair spray after styling&lt;br /&gt;i do like that the spray has 2 options.  The scent is a bit off putting for me, but my friends enjoy the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit disappointed in Amazon, this product arrived leaking a bit.  Luckily, it was wrapped in a plastic bag.  But it made the entire bottle sticky.  Also, this is priced a good $3+ more than purchasing from Target, Ulta, or Walmart.  I didn&#x27;t realize it, and added it to my order.  When I repurchase, I hope Amazon will match competitor pricing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned one other heat spray before - CHI 44 Iron Guard.  And I only used it when I was flatironing my hair on special occasion.  I never liked the strong cologne scent and felt it made my hair sticky.  But I still used it because I figured it was better than no protectant at all.  I recently just purchased the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener (which I love) and wanted a new spray to go with it.  I have to say TRESemme&#x27;s Heat Tamer works quite well.  Since I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best but at least it&#x27;s much better and cheaper than CHI.&lt;br /&gt;1. The scent is light and pleasant - much more feminine than those cologne-types.&lt;br /&gt;2. I really like how it finely mists your hair. I can give it just a few spritz around my head and it applies evenly.  It doesn&#x27;t saturate hair like most sprays so then I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m straightening wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t give me any noticeable residue.  It makes my hair a lil soft but not too soft considering it&#x27;s alright silky and I actually don&#x27;t like products that soften hair too much.&lt;br /&gt;4. I really appreciate the built-in knob (not pictured) to turn the sprayer off.  I took this while traveling over the weekend and didn&#x27;t have to deal with the fear of leaking or obnoxious caps.  I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like much but those lil features can make a big difference in the overall product.&lt;br /&gt;5. I never considered using a protectant before blow-drying but I found myself using this one more and more for just that.  But if I forgot to apply it before blow-drying I know just a few mists and I can easily straighten my hair without any worry of it burning.  It probably has a lot to do with hair types and tools used but I could use TRESemme&#x27;s Heat Tamer either way (before blow drying or just before straightening) with the same consistent result.&lt;br /&gt;All and all I&#x27;m happy!  I say for the price-give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love this heat protective spray it don&#x27;t weight your hair down at all and u don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> This stuff really protects your hair.</li>
            <li> Did not like the fruity smell at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the ratings and reviews. It was my first time using a heat protectant, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I followed the instructions for use and proceeded to flat iron my hair, and afterwards couldn&#x27;t even tell there was anything in my hair. It left it really soft and smelling nice. If there are better products out there, I&#x27;ll never find out as this works perfectly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair very smooth &amp; shiny when used with a blow dryer &amp; round brush. It doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I didn&#x27;t realize that it came with two bottles so that was nice. I think its a good price. The smell is nice and the feel on my hair was nice as well. Its not heavy or greasy. It actually tames my flyaways and keeps my hair smooth all day! I even use it when I&#x27;m air drying my hair and not using heat at all just because it makes my hair feel so good. It has a detangler effect for me too. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> We have used Suave and Garnier before this.  I did some research and&lt;br /&gt;this one rated higher than the rest.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at Walmart so I ordered&lt;br /&gt;it online for $6.99.  A few weeks later I saw it at a Target for $3.99, so I&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t order it off of Amazon anymore.  That is really unusual for Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;because I order something every month usually, and have never found&lt;br /&gt;something cheaper in a store.  The product works very well and my 16 yr&lt;br /&gt;old daughter is the real judge.  She likes this one the best of all we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Well, I am a male who purchased the protective spray to use while running a hot comb through my afro. Came across it on Amazon and decided to give it a try considering how dry my hair can become when using a hot comb. I think it works great and smells good as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was surprised to notice during my last trip to Walmart that I could have gotten this $3 cheaper. May not seem like a lot, but for a struggling college student, it matters.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle broken within  few use.  Had to pour it out to use</li>
            <li> If you routinely use hot curlers or curling iron on your hair, this is great for protecting it from the heat damage and helps to keep your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Hard to spray my own hair due to the really odd handle squeeze location/shape</li>
            <li> Seems to help keep the Texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Offers good heat protection, isn&#x27;t sticky, and leaves a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> One of the best things about it is that it smells GREAT! But, it does leave some build-up, I especially don&#x27;t recommend it for people with more oily hair (obviously) but, All in all..it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> This spray seems to do what it says but I still have a problem with a bit of frizz and my hair had a bit of a wave when using this. I did&#x27;t notice it did much for my hair - it wasn&#x27;t necessarily smoother, shinier, silkier or anything. I also noticed that my hair was flatter - with almost no body. Yes I flat iron but to straighten my hair so I prefer products which leave some natural body in my hair so that it isn&#x27;t flat to my head by mid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not feel this did much in humidity. Overall it works just o.k.</li>
            <li> There was nothing damaged on this item and it worked perfectly for what I was looking for and makes your hair smells really good and feel soft without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> Received the bottle empty.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and smells really nice and fresh. It&#x27;s easy to use and I really like the lock/unlock feature of the pump (now it won&#x27;t accidentally spray in my travel bags). It&#x27;s also just really nice to use to get rid of the frizz/static I get in my hair in the winter time. Sometimes I spray it in but don&#x27;t get the chance to curl or straighten my hair and it still makes my hair look nice. This is my new go to heat protectant spray hands down!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does - I noticed that I was getting hair damage from blow drying and curling every day, so I started using this and also switched to curling my hair without heat every so often. I notice a difference in that my hair looks shinier and I have less lot ends. I have long blonde hair (not color treated) that&#x27;s kind of fine in texture. This works well for me and I like that it doesn&#x27;t add any weight or oil to my hair.</li>
            <li> People with red hair know that the texture of red hair is somewhat more coarse than blonde or brown. My 8 year old son, my little red-head, has this coarse hair and every morning before school I would go through a 20 minute routine of trying to get his hair to not poof out or stand up everywhere (he refuses to cut it too short). So, I tried this. I use a few quick sprays of this around the crown of his head and voila! It stays down and smooths the texture!!!! I have used it a few times before blow drying or styling and it works ok. Not great on me, but great for my little guy!</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice so far, so it is difficult to really know how well it will protect my hair in the long term, but no complaints so far.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with applying and then flat ironing.  I applied the spray to my dry hair, then did my makeup before flat ironing, giving it a little time to absorb and dry.</li>
            <li> Protected my hair from the heat while not making it oily :)</li>
            <li> I used it before blow drying my hair and my hair felt AMAZING! I have fine, bleached hair and this left my hair feeling amazing! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best heat protectant. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily and weighed down. I&#x27;ve never experienced any heat damaged after using this to flatiron my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. The nozzle has a lock too.</li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical about purchasing this product once my usual expensive heat protector ran out. I sort of retired TRESemme products once I started to buy natural products for my extremely curly hair, however my roommate allowed me to use hers and it was amazing. It smells SO good and does the job! I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one with such an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this  upon suggestion by one of the salespeople at Ulta. I use this on my very uncontrolled, wavy hair.  Many of the products that I have tried before (and have tried MANY) in the past have left my hair crispy, staticky or greasy.  This does none of those.  My hair feels silky soft, yet manageable with it&#x27;s use.  Don&#x27;t get the dried, fried ends anymore from drying and flat ironing my hair 3-4 days/week.  It also feels great the next day and doesn&#x27;t look dirty or weighed down. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product and don&#x27;t feel the need to look for another!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I bought this product. I absolutely adore this spray. It makes my hair smell like unicorns and sunshine. Plus it makes my hair feel super soft.I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Does the job! Protects your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a product like this before, but I guess it must be good if it isn&#x27;t doing any damage! My hair is soft and I&#x27;m assuming it must be good for my hair, LOL. I know, not that smart, but it sure smells good!</li>
            <li> Good for people who love to expose their hair with the hair dryer, heat iron etc... Your hair will become more softer.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this not only because it protects her hair but because it gives her the light weight feel and shine in her hair and she can straighten it fast and loves the smell when she is spraying it in her hair</li>
            <li> I use this every time I flat iron my hair.  It smells good &amp; seems to do the job great!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a couple of times but it works well and I like it much better than a similar product that I purchased at a local beauty supply store.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Sun-In to help protect my hair. I think it works great. I haven&#x27;t used it with a straightener or blow dryer, but I love how smooth it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, great smell and all it leaves the hair with a great finish afterwards. I used this to straightened my sisters hair and she&#x27;s natural so I was really afraid of giving her heat damage but this spray was eve protective.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product even more i love the smell!! You will not regret buying this. Sam appreciate all your hard work. Will purchase this item again again &amp; again!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. If you can shop locally, check it out at Walmart where it is available for less than $4.</li>
            <li> I purchased this protective spray after I bought a curling wand.  I only used one other heat protective spray, but I really like this one.  The other spray I used made my hair feel a little sticky, but this spray is smooth and silky.  It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells good!!!</li>
            <li> This worked really well on my sisters very course and very naturally curly hair. Good smell also. I don&#x27;t normally care for this brand because of the scent of their products but this one is great. I took medium sections and sprayed them individually. The product goes a long way. She has a lot of hair and I&#x27;ve been able to use it multiple times with a lot still left over. I highly recommend this product for really hard to straighten hair. The results stood up well to our FL humidity as well!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to use with my new 3-barrel waver curling iron.  I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t be as drying as spraynet when I need to touch up the curl which is more fragile than usual styles and falls out easily.  My only complaint: the little &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; tab on the neck that is right where you have to hold the bottle.  It&#x27;s always accidentally locking so you have to stop and unlock the spray.  Annoying; why have a lock?? Also the flat shape of the bottle is hard to hold if your hands are slippery from styling product.  Otherwise the product is great.</li>
            <li> Does its job perfectly and smells great.</li>
            <li> My new fav leave in heat protectand when I straighten my hair. Lightweight, not sticky or greasy, leaves hair soft and shiny n def helps with reducing and protecting from heat damage. Will def use this stuff from now on!!</li>
            <li> Works good for any heating tool or blow dryer......</li>
            <li> It was empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> It works like a heat protector, but i leaves my hair dull/opaque and that&#x27;s a problem because i don&#x27;t use it very often</li>
            <li> Awesome product👍👍😊 Will definitely purchase another one before I run out.</li>
            <li> Makes ur hair feel soft and smells AMAZING</li>
            <li> I love this spray! It&#x27;s true to name, &amp; it helps protect my hair from the heat.. Although I would strongly recommend, you buy this at your local Walgreens.. I get the same exact one for $3 instead of $6.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and my hair hasn&#x27;t been burned to a crisp so I take it this works</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Read about this in a facebook post and had to order to see for myself. It smells great and is really light. I spray it on before I blow dry and go to town!</li>
            <li> This is a review from someone with virgin hair. I have, for the last ten years, done nothing to my hair. I decided to grow it out, get semi annual trims and that&#x27;s about it. I keep my hair wrapped up to keep it (and the world) safe, when it is not tightly braided. I was getting bored with it and it looked frumpy and putting it up was starting to give me migraines so when I got it cut last week I asked for some layer which I used to have. She took her liberties though and cut way too much off so now I can&#x27;t do anything with it other than wear it pulled back :( That said, the layers don&#x27;t show very much. After she did it, she curled it for me and it looked great but as feared, I gave it its first wash today and blew dry it (which I never do, I always air dry) and used this product. I then proceeded with my new curling iron to try and put some curl back in. Until I find the right kind of curlers to set my hair in overnight I knew I would be using heat so I grabbed a bottle of this stuff last night. Hello good deal, I bought mine at Walmart for $3.98. Anyone paying $5 and up got ripped. I applied it to my hair when it was still damp and cannot say I like it much. Perhaps I am used to 100% natural naked hair? Once it dried my hair took on a bit of dullness and film. It smells OK, a little cheap and fruity like pretty much all the hair care stuff on the shelves these days but it&#x27;s not a bad smell and it doesn&#x27;t really linger after your hair is done. My hair feels silky but... can I say it has protected it from the blow dryer and iron? Not sure. I do know I am not going to risk damaging otherwise perfectly healthy hair by brutalizing it with this stuff on a regular basis. However, I wanted to at least try to protect it for now until I get a different curling method in gear. I still say if you can avoid using hot irons, blow dryers, etc you&#x27;re better off. This stuff, if used regularly, and this goes for any leave in product (conditioner included) will eventually cause damage to your hair because it leaves a residue on the hairs that overtime will build up and strip the hair from its natural oils, etc. I generally don&#x27;t use conditioner on my hair, either. Today I did only because I was attempting to recreate that salon fresh feeling. The residue I felt from my hair after applying this is likely what protects the hair. You&#x27;re better off also cutting down your washing and allowing your own hair oils to act in the same protective way.</li>
            <li> I have bought several since my first time using it. It seems to protect my hair. I use it before blow drying and before styling my dry hair EVERY TIME. Since using it I have also bought it for a few friends or family members who are really enjoying it also. This lasts a long time but I do not always blow dry or style my hair with heat everyday. More like a few times a week. For the price this is some pretty awesome spray. I would absolutely recommend using it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed box was leaking the bottle was open.</li>
            <li> Seems to work when I remember to actually use it.</li>
            <li> best ever when it comes to heat protection. does not leave a residue</li>
            <li> I love it it just keeps my hair look good</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of this spray.  I don&#x27;t use any products on my hair that involve heat.  However, it is very hot where I live and this spray does an excellent job of keeping away frizz.  I bought it for that purpose and am very pleased with the results.  I also really like the fact that it isn&#x27;t expensive, yet it performs better than some of the more expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel any difference</li>
            <li> This is an awesome prduct and i seriously recommend it. My hair&#x27;s the very dry type of hair and is naturally frizzy... frustrating with most products. Tresemme enriches my hair, makes it look flowely and looks naturally straight or curly or whatever. BUY THIS AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It made my hair sticky and hard i didn&#x27;t like it. Also it smells like chemicals and made my hair feel stiff. I originally bought it because i got this waver for my hair and thought i should get a protectant spray for the heat, well it didn&#x27;t work my hair got kind of frizzy. Then again my hair gets frizzy easily, and is sensitive i guess so maybe it just wasn&#x27;t for my hair type. I know lots of other people think it&#x27;s amazing so i don&#x27;t know, not for me though. Total waste of 8 bucks and shipping was forever!!!</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my 4b hair!!!!!!! I applied it to damp hair allowed it to dry about and it made my hair hard, dry and sticky- kind of weird but yes this was the outcome. It was even worse when I applied it to my dry hair. I highly doubt this product works well for any black hair in the type 4 category.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells so yummy and makes my hair so incredibly soft. I love the bottle it comes in, easy to use. My fav hair product!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course hair.  I use a straightening balm before I blow dry, and this before I flat iron.  It leaves my hair so soft that I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner anymore!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue either, which is great since I wash my hair every 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely try it!</li>
            <li> One thing that I can not stand about hair products is smell. However, this one has a pleasant smell and it softens and detangles too!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the Chi Iron Guard 44....not any more.  This stuff actually makes a difference.  I always used a heat protective spray because I knew I should, not because I could actually see the benefits.  This stuff has a pleasant smell, makes my hair even softer, and best of all it seems to tame by thick, extremely fine hair.  Have already used up and repurchased.</li>
            <li> Smells nice  and I assume it works.</li>
            <li> My favorite thermal heat protective spray, ive used this spray for a long while now it never fails i have noticed the difference in my hair since i started using it , it no longer looks as damaged as it use to when i wasn&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of flyaways and frizz if I use this and blow dry. If I use more then hair is oily for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought this in stores, not on amazon &amp; I don&#x27;t care for it at all. I prefer the straightening gel which of course is nowhere to be found in stores now.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and soft. It also smells nice. I am gonna buy this again. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance for me - can&#x27;t stand constantly smelling something in my hair and I could still smell it the next day. Also didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel, didn&#x27;t have as much body. Probably better for those wanting ultra straight, flat hair. FYI - Much cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly and down past my shoulders. Tried it on both wet and dry hair with the Babyliss Pro. Came out FRIZZY! And simply didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;. Dumped it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Got 2 B Guardian Angel heat protectant and the KQC flat iron spray, and I always come back to the Tresemme heat protectant. It smells pretty neutral. It&#x27;s not really floral or sweet or musky. It&#x27;s just sort of a hair product smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. And it works really well! It helps make my hair sleek and shiny when I straighten it. Do be careful not to put too much product in or else your hair will look greasy, though! Also, make sure to distribute it evenly with a comb and wait for it to dry. If you try to flat iron your hair as soon as you put this stuff on, it&#x27;ll fizzle because your hair is technically wet with the spray. The nozzle works really well, and the product lasts for quite a while. I usually purchase it at Target because it&#x27;s only 3-4 bucks. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, smells so good, and has lasted me almost six months now! I know that no product can completely prevent damage, but I wish this one did!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and the spray didn&#x27;t work well for me--couldn&#x27;t get any volume with my hair like I usually do.  I&#x27;m going to just use it on the ends of my hair, or give it to someone with better hair than I have.  I bought it to go with a flat iron, but it takes such a short time to straighten my hair with the iron, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll end up with heat damage.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected from this product.  Leaves hair feeling durty, and also leaves build up.it The only positive thing I will say is product smells good</li>
            <li> protection is all what this item is really do !</li>
            <li> Bye Bye flyaways. Just a little bit goes along way and hair is so manageable when blow drying.</li>
            <li> Im soooo angry.....I am so upset, I received the package wet, it was not well close, so i only got the bottle empty. :@</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman.  This is the first heat protectant I&#x27;ve used.  I used it before blow-drying and was happy with the way it left my hair soft.  The problem didn&#x27;t come until I used it before pressing my hair. IT BURNED MY HAIR OFF!  I was so mad I took it back.  After discussing what happen to my aunt whose a beautician, I discovered that because the spray left my hair wet it burned off from my heat appliant.  She said heat protectants are meant to work with blow-dryers and no more is needed for additional heat.  I give it three stars for instructing to use on dry hair before applying heat.  Besides that, its a good product.</li>
            <li> If you are planning on using this product - Be Warned - it will leave a film of what is like a silicon substance on anything and everything it touches including not only brushes, combs, and styling equipment but also but floors, walls, towels, carpeting, clothing, shoes, socks, pets and it gets tracked into every other area of your home. No matter what I do, I cannot get it out of the carpets near the bathroom - from simply ONE USE of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that might be considered a good thing if you are solely thinking about protecting your hair from heat, but in my opinion it is not worth having this stuff cover and stick to every surface it comes in contact with. It took me hours to clean the bathroom (and I&#x27;m no clean freak, mind you!) and I have no idea how many months it&#x27;s going to take to dissipate from the carpeting. The bathroom floor was so slick even my dog slipped on it, as did I and my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for protecting my hair, I saw no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I really like the pump spray. It gives out an even circular spray, without any other propellant chemicals messing with your hair.  I liked the seller (PharmaSave) even more. They shipped product separately without any extra charge just so I could receive it early. Full marks for that!</li>
            <li> Best product. I&#x27;d give it 10  stars if i could. I use it everyday. Cheap wonderful product! I definetly suggest this product</li>
            <li> My wife uses the product in tandem with the Hair Straightener that she got off of Amazon too. And she is pretty pleased with the spray. I have no comments but from my wife, I get the feel that she likes the product.</li>
            <li> I love this heat protectant. It has a great smell and leaves your hair feeling soft. Before purchasing this product I was using organic root stimulator&#x27;s olive oil protection serum, but this is so much better and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> SMells so good and makes hair so soft! love this product and defenatley will buy more. have had for a bout 3 months and have only used 1/4 of the bottle (straighten hair on average 3 times a week)</li>
            <li> Is awesome and it really protect the hair from heat damage. And also this bottle is double the size of the one the beauty supply sale.  So the price is awsome</li>
            <li> it is a good product that makes your hair feel soft.when you try you ll see you get a good product thanks tresemme</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, it is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, and it even has a nice gentle smell to it - nothing too strong. It actually left my hair feeling very soft and smooth, and it helped with flyaways, which usually kill my entire look! The product itself is a lifesaver but I did have one issue with it; the shape and design of the bottle and spray nozzle are somewhat add to get a good hold on. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is necessarily comfortable to use positioning wise but it is completely worth buying it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this heat tamer it doesn&#x27;t smell like a product as is a very light spray onto the hair that doesn&#x27;t cause it to be heavy. I like that i can keep my hair in great condition with this.</li>
            <li> The only heat protectant I use, seems to work great and I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for a while now! I should probably re-buy soon!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My husband always comments on how nice it smells when I use it, and I completely agree. It keeps my hair shiny and makes a real difference when I apply before using the blow dryer or flat iron. I use a couple sprays around my head when I&#x27;m ready to start styling, pick up the top layers and spray a bit underneath, and run my fingers through my hair to distribute. I have only bought one bottle and I&#x27;m still working my way through it, but that&#x27;s because I try to use heat on my hair no more than twice a week. I&#x27;m sure if I used it daily it would be gone already. I would definitely buy again, considering the great smell, effective product, and low price.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product in a hair styling &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; video on YouTube some time back. I was skeptical but bought it anyway. All of my skepticism was misplaced however. This stuff is absolutely incredible! Both my mother and I use it now on a daily basis. It keeps the frizzies away during humid spells, helps keep my hair soft and hydrated even when I blow dry it (and I have lots and lots of hair to blow dry) and seems to help my ends from splitting as often thus reducing the need for hair trims every 3 months, now I go every 4-5 months! Way to go TRESemme!</li>
            <li> I love products that smells good and this one does. My hair is natural and I wear it in 2 strand twist but when I blow it out and wear it down, I use this product. It really smells good.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says, which is protect your hair from heat.  I have fine hair that is heavily hi-lighted and my hair really cannot afford too much styling.  This works great to protect my hair when i put the curling iron to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip...there is such a thing as too much.  The bottle provides great instructions on the best way to apply...follow them.  The first time I used it, I sprayed it all over, including the close to the scalp, and applied too much, and my hair refused to cooperate after that and looked dirty...the bottle tells you to spray from mid-shaft to the ends of your hair.  A light mist from about 6-8 inches from the hair is the best way to go, and works very well.</li>
            <li> My bf says I smell goof when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but not sure if it&#x27;s done anything to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; my hair. Nice smell and I can&#x27;t think I&#x27;m burning my hair less if I use this.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It is a great heat protectant and does not leave any kind of sticky or hard residue on your hair. You get your money worth but it just wish more came in a bottle.  Bonus points: it smells great too!</li>
            <li> nothing over the top about product</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that didn&#x27;t stink like many products do and one that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy, this product fits all of those with a pretty low price!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for anyone using heat daily on their hair whether they are using curling irons or hot air blower.  It is convenient tp buy through Amazon and arrived well packaged  on the date promised.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy on the hair! Quick fix especially if you are in a hurry!&lt;br /&gt;It does wonders for every hairstyle, whether it would be straight to curling your hair, it works alongside with other products, ie styling gel, spray mousse. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my number one thermal heat protector ever !! I will give it 10 stars ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.it is very light and non sticky&lt;br /&gt;2. You spry it on dry hair or damp before blowing&lt;br /&gt;3. I don;t have to use any other straightener gels anymore&lt;br /&gt;4. The hair are silky , light and not stick together&lt;br /&gt;5. The hair stay beautiful no freeze even exposed to humid&lt;br /&gt;6. it softens my dry hair&lt;br /&gt;7. The hair stay bouncy and not bone dry , very natural&lt;br /&gt;8. It does hold the curls for a little while without hair spry , like 5 hours in my case as I don;t use hair spry ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 and will do again as I had enough of the expensive serums and bs that cost you money and do nothing more as for a 10 hours .&lt;br /&gt;It is second day after using this product the hair are still fresh and beautiful , don;t have to do anything&lt;br /&gt;and the best part is that I used the lowest setting on my installer to do the job, and it never worked before .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also great for extensions as I tested yesterday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really recommended product !! trust me</li>
            <li> Works well, smells good, makes my hair soft too!  Better than Chi heat protectant for sure.  I&#x27;m happy I switched.</li>
            <li> This product works well and smells yummy however I have a few problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;1. is that if you bring it anywhere it spills out everywhere and wastes half the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes a lot longer for your hair to straighten using this product.&lt;br /&gt;3. When you uses it it will make a sizzling noise which was alarming at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this few times and its ok, I feel like it leaves a film on my hair. I don&#x27;t spray directly on my hair before use, I spray in my hand to control the amount used I feel like it leaves my hair straw feeling.  Gave to my 13 year old niece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to protect my hair from my flat iron and they all make my hair feel heavy and dirty. This product is amazing! It&#x27;s light and makes my hair feel very smooth. I&#x27;ll never try anything else.</li>
            <li> I love using this product, and for me it&#x27;s the best product when blow drying my hair, curling and ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> This spray helped me to keep my hair healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I bought this after a lot of research online, and I made a good decision on this indeed!&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you wont regret!</li>
            <li> I started using this a year ago and have loved it ever since. It really makes my hair feel great after use. I blow dry and flat iron 2-3 times a week and this helps against damage! It&#x27;s a light spray, doesn&#x27;t wear hear down or make it sticky. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before a few years ago. I have had one bottle for about 3 years, you don&#x27;t need to spray much. It can be brushed out and my curls look shiny!</li>
            <li> This works really well on my Daughters hair it helps control the frizz and makes it more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li> The best heat protectant out there! Seriously, you will be amazed. Spritz a little of this on your hair before you apply heat of any kind, be it via flat iron, curling iron/wand, and even your hair dryer. I usually spritz from mid-shaft (for me that&#x27;s ear level) down, comb through, and let dry for a minute. Works like a charm. Plus, it&#x27;s lightweight and has a lovely scent to it too. In fact, I like the smell so much, I usually spritz a little extra on top after straightening, which actually helps tame any stray frizzies. This stuff leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny all day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have this 2 stars because it smells great and has a lock on the lid. But it makes my hair sticky and hard to brush.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I straighten my hair and it really does protect it because my hair is not damaged at all. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend straightening your hair everyday even if you use this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for me everytime I use heat</li>
            <li> After seeing people talk about this stuff on YouTube and reading the reviews, I had to try it.  Glad I did.  It smells SOOOO good and it works really well. Hair is soft, straight and I won&#x27;t apply heat without it from now on.</li>
            <li> it works great with thick hair great product</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference but I do like the spray.I feel like i&#x27;m doing something good for my hair and it smells nice :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product  for the last several years. It protects your hair when blow drying or using a curling iron or flat iron.  It serves both as a styling spray and a protective spray.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I usually straighten my hair so I needed a spray so my hair wouldn&#x27;t get damaged. This spray made my hair look more shiny, even when I didn&#x27;t use it. My hair didn&#x27;t look damaged anymore and protected my hair from the heat. Love it.</li>
            <li> Okay let me just say that I am Hispanic and part Native American which means I have extremely THICK hair all the way to my waist and I have tried EVERYTHING!!! Either it didn&#x27;t get the job done or I was left with a big greasy frizzy sticky mess when having to apply it with my thick hair. I had finally resolved to stop blow drying and straightening my hair all together to stop the horrible damage. I had read the reviews about the Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray before but finally decided to get it thinking there is no way it could work for me. I bought it and decided to do one side regular straightening and the other with the spray for comparison. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! I have never had my hair so soft and not brittle from straightening before! It smells soo good too! Granted I had to be a bit heavy handed with my hair to make sure it got to all of it but who cares when it actually works! And this is only after one use! SO happy!</li>
            <li> this is a great product when using heat stylers regularly on your hair.  not sticky, crunchy or gooey.  love it!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so smooth,so soft and keeps it from tangling. It greatly improves the overall appearance of my hair. I am buying this for my family this Xmas. This doesn&#x27;t smell very much. Whatever mild smell this has wears away after a day. It&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best heat tamer I&#x27;ve ever used and smells FANTASTIC but i just bought it on sale today at the grocery store (Giant) 2 for $7. So glad i waited to check the price!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny and is a good heat protectant</li>
            <li> My ends are in horrible shape and I need a superior product to protect them and keep them moisturized . . . this product, so far, has answered the call. My hair feels soft and the fly-aways are eliminated when I use TRESemme Thermal. Believe it or not, the results were with my first use and has continued to improve weekly. Try it, I believe you will like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this spray protects my hair from heat styling at all.  My hair feels fried and dried out despite the fact that I use a spritz of this spray on every section before I use the curling iron.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work well at all.  I think the Tresemme Runway collection Get Sleek Polish works much better, although you have to be careful not to use too much.  I don&#x27;t spray it on every section but lightly cover my entire head and then use the curling iron.  It makes my hair shiny but as long as I don&#x27;t over spray it, it gives my hair a nice sheen and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and straw-like like it does with this Heat Tamer spray.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find the Get Sleek spray in the stores in my area anymore but it&#x27;s available on Amazon so that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve been getting it.  I may be in the minority in not liking the Heat Tamer spray but I think those that seem to like it will soon discover that their hair isn&#x27;t in as good condition as they though it was and probably is fried when all is said and done.  You get what you pay for I guess.  I&#x27;m usually not a drugstore product buyer and for good reason.  I just don&#x27;t think drugstore products are in any way comparable to high end products and this is a prime example. The Get Sleek spray is a decent product but not one I use regularly.  But if I had to use a drugstore heat spray, that is the one I would choose.  But supposedly Not Your Mother&#x27;s heat spray is decent so maybe I&#x27;ll try that one next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week or two and I haven&#x27;t used it everyday. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my hair but hopefully it&#x27;s being protected from the heat! Smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice, fine mist of product. Works well as a heat protectant- my hair is soft and shiny. Doesn&#x27;t build up on flat iron.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any cons with Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray-- yet. So I&#x27;m just going to list what I love about it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great price&lt;br /&gt;-My hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like I just used a hair product&lt;br /&gt;-My hair feels super soft after using&lt;br /&gt;-Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have left something out... Anyway. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of other Tresemme products but this one is just AWESEOME!!! It makes my hair feel and smell wonderful. I use it to protect my hair when flat ironing, curling etc and my hair always feels silky smooth and protected without feeling greasy. I also love that it sprays out as a fine mist so you don&#x27;t use too much at once. A must have for anyone who styles their hair with hot tools.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and more manageable. Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> This Tresemme spray is awesome! it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily or heavy and it really cuts down on static and gives your hair a great shine!</li>
            <li> leaves my hair silky and smooth after curling or drying. great product. didn&#x27;t think i needed it but now i always use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap, its good, it works! ive seen alot of youtubers use this product, so i decided to give it a try! it goes great, though i think i love the dove better the dove one smelled better nd left my hair smooth, not with this one though.</li>
            <li> Wow not sure why so many good reviews for this. It made my hair feel nasty and caked up. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. I guess everyone is different. I have dry hair to begin with and this made it much worse with a very unnatural feel to it afterwards. If you are going to buy I would look for the best price for only one bottle. I got three bottles of this crap and most of it went down the sink so that it wasn&#x27;t laying around in the \\&quot; crappy cosmetics abyss\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> If you use any heat products, this is your product.  It really does protect your hair from all hairdryers, curling irons and straight irons.  A nice pleasant smell and easy to use.  We have tried the more expensive brands, but keep coming back to this product.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I blow dry my hair and when I use a hair straightener or curler! I also paired this with a bit of morrocan oil before blow drying after washing my hair, which I also bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did notice a big difference. I started to use this after getting a fresh haircut and usually a month or two after getting my hair cut I&#x27;d be riddled with split ends! But after using this religiously, I barely saw any split ends! I also used the TRESemme Thermal Creations Volumising Mousse too, but this was much better.</li>
            <li> Came in the box along with other stuff, but by the time i opened the box it looked the spray probaby went off due to the movement in the box during transport. There was liquid damage to the box and quiet a bit of the bottle was empty due to all the leaks.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a fault of the prodcut, but more the packaging.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I get out of the shower. I have noticed my hair does not break off as much when using a straightener. Good product!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like the smell but as long as its doing its job its ok! its not that bad!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair soft without weighing it down. I have long, fine hair so I need all the heat protection that I can get. Unlike cheaper products this will not dry your hair out. Just make sure it has completely dried on your hair before using styling irons.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I spray it on my hair wet before I blow dry and it has noticeably reduced the amount of damage to my hair. Also, I use a bit on dry hair before I straight iron, and it makes the iron run really smoothly over my hair. I find I need to put more on wet hair versus dry, I guess it depends on what you are doing to your hair, and how much protection you need. It is relatively cheap, lasts a long time, and smells soo good. It sounds weird but I catch people smelling my hair sometimes in the elevator on my way to work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I didn&#x27;t know of this product sooner. It&#x27;s almost a shame! It smells great, leaves my hair so healthy and shiny when my hair is the complete opposite. I love the spray bottle itself as well. It has a wide area coverage. Will be definitely buying again... forever!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in split ends at all. I just feel like I&#x27;ve been spraying around chemicals with no benefit whatsoever. Will be trying something more natural next time.</li>
            <li> The nozzle wouldnt spray but nothing looked broken....and locked or unlocked the nozzle leaks.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say. It does its job, smells great and leaves my hair a little softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several but they made my hair sticky. This makes it feel silky and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like the way the top was designed because liquid leaked when I packed it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The new containers have a better mechanism to lock.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB AND THEN SUM!! LOVE HOW SOFT AND SHINY IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL AND LOOK!!! AWESOME!!! ORDERING ONE MORE RIGHT NOW!!!!❤</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it. Very good product and it does the job very well. It avoids burns on the hair.</li>
            <li> This has been protecting my hair for years, it also have a really nice refreshing smell. Sometimes after you straighten your hair, there might be a smell, but after using this your hair will smell really nice even after applying so much pressure and heat onto it! By far one of the best heat protector I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed so my hair doesn&#x27;t really fall into either traditional category. It&#x27;s naturally curly and frizzes up very easily.  I need to blow-dry my hair constantly and have been trying to find something to tame it.  From the reviews I read this product is supposed ot help with that, but within an hour my hair was puffed up worse than ever!  The smell is chemical, not perfume like as claimed.  It didn&#x27;t soften it either.  The only thing it did help with was keeping it from getting tangled as I blow-dried.</li>
            <li> I use this product whenever I straighten it. I have relatively curly hair, so I want to protect my hair when I apply a lot of direct heat to it. I think this product helps keep frizz and damage to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel guilty about using a flat iron or curling iron on my fine hair!  I spray this in my hair right before I blow dry and then again right before I use a flat or curling iron. Not only does my hair now have the best protection from my hot tools, but I only wash my hair every 3 or so days and this stuff really keeps it smelling great even on the 3rd day!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best-smelling hair products I&#x27;ve ever tried! It leaves my hair smooth and nice-smelling, which is perfect because flat-ironing and blow-drying cause a burned smell.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because it arrived leaking.</li>
            <li> I got this product because of the reviews and I guess my expectations were too high. I used a couple of times and finally threw in the trash. I&#x27;m glad it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> This works effectively for use before blow drying. Like some other reviews have said do not put it on your hair directly before flat ironing! If you use it before flat ironing, let it dry!</li>
            <li> This hair spray is pretty good because it protects my hair when I&#x27;m straightening it and reduces my split ends, which is all I wanted it to do. Moreover, it is lightweight and glides on smoothly without making my hair feel greasy or crunchy, unlike other thermal sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past. As a bonus, it also minimizes my hair from becoming frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this product can&#x27;t be beat. My one qualm with this product is the fragile nozzle though. I accidentally dropped the bottle and the nozzle broke into two pieces, rendering it unusable (hence minus one star).</li>
            <li> It works really good i would recommend this to any one. Love the smell of this product in my hair</li>
            <li> At first I loved it cause it smelled good, but through out the day, I noticed my hair started becoming frizzy. And when I felt my hair, it was so rough, I only used 4 sprays through out my hair, but it made my hair feel and look ugly. :(</li>
            <li> I recently bought this strictly as a heat protective spray for when I curl my hair. I used to just use Tresemme Thermal Creations Curl Activator Spray by itself to form curls, but decided it&#x27;s probably best to get some heat protection.    I noticed on the bottle it says, \\&quot;It&#x27;s a fantastic tool for instantly transforming all hair textures, enhancing strands&#x27; flexibility to reform and hold shape.\\&quot; I thought that was a nice bonus, but didn&#x27;t think much of it since it&#x27;s a heat protective spray.    After using it I find it&#x27;s much, much easier to form curls and it keeps my hair soft and easy to style. It has a very mild scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, the mist has great coverage, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky at all. After using both products to form a curl I use hairspray to set the shape. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, it&#x27;s worked like magic for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great smells awesome and definitely makes my hair shinier</li>
            <li> Personally love the spray..!! I applied just enough, I separated my hair in half and used the spray 3 times in each half; my hair didn&#x27;t freeze at all it was soft and looked naturally like I didn&#x27;t apply anything on it.. the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the shipping because when I opened the package the spray bottle was a little bit open and the liquid was poured into the package. I recommend you guys use a better system to deliver this types of products..! Four stars because of that.</li>
            <li> really nice - good quality!</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews regarding this item, so I decided to purchase it and give it a try... Unfortunately, I did not feel that it helped protect my hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, protects my hair, and oh my god makes my hair so smooth. Love everything about it!</li>
            <li> Loved it! I am African American with natural hair I used this in combination with a flat iron that exudes it&#x27;s own heat protectant and it worked perfectly. It left no type of residue on my hair. I blow dried my hair on low heat. I kept the flat iron heat at 350 to 375 and there was no heat damage that I could see once I washed my hair to return it to its natural state. If you&#x27;re having doubts...don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s a good product at a good price!</li>
            <li> I use it every time I blow dry my hair. It helps maintain it&#x27;s natural shine, soft feeling, and smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not totally thrilled about the ingredients, but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a strong, feminine scent that somewhat lingers on the user.</li>
            <li> Actually this stuff is very awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the smell is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;As I used to straighten my hair by using the hair straightener, it really harmful to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But after I using this stuff, my hair look smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;This is very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m using it everyday and I will repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Well the first order the bottle was completely broken and the box was soaking wet... The second order.. GREAT. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft and flowy. I spray it on my hair before I blowdry it and before I flat iron it and my hair always comes out nice and shiny . The shipment was fast too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product. My hair is normally really dry and crisp due to the dyeing and curling I did before, so, I cut it leaving it nice and healthy, but just couldn&#x27;t resist curling again. So, I bought this and oh my god! Even after months and months of curling, my hair is still super soft an shiny. I definitely reccomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty great, especially for someone with hair as long as mine. I&#x27;ve been maintaining my below-the-hip long hair for several years now (18 years, to be precise), and of late my hair has been complaining about all the blow drying after frequent hairwashes. I had been using a different product earlier, which was pretty decent, but wanted to try something better. This one is really good as a thermal protectant and my hair not only feels super smooth, but also smells good. The only reason of not giving 5 stars is the bottle itself, whose nozzle broke within 3 uses! So I dont spray it anymore, I actually open the bottle and apply the liquid directly on my damp hair before blow drying ;) Trust me, it works, except that it is a bit of a hassle especially when you are in a hurry. But as far as the product is concerned, it is really great especially for people having long, straight, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> My culy hair didnt like it ..mske hair dry alot and has alot of perfume</li>
            <li> I am not a type of person that runs out to buy every new item out there&lt;br /&gt;but this one I am happy I did it really works great</li>
            <li> I love it soo much and it make my haire look fresh and healthy and its have agood and nice smell for your haire.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend as a gift and she loves it. Her hair isn&#x27;t always the best when it comes to holding in curls or straightening. This works great for her!</li>
            <li> Great heat protection for blow drying and flat ironing and it has a nice smell to it. Didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy like other products have in the past, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday ( shipping was SUPER fast) and I am very satisfied with this product. It does what it says and it does not not leave a sticky feeling to hair or weigh it down, like most heat protectants do.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing... it works well and maintains your hair as it is supposed to. Works as advertised. The smell however, is an entirely different story- it smells amazing, and not like all the other gross smelling hair products.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells great</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was using another brand, but wanted to try this one.  I like this product better.  It smells nice and does the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I use it for straightening and curling my hair. I spray it onto dry hair, brush it through, and then style! It leaves my hair feeling soooo smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Great clean scent...works well for long lasting flat iron hair...definitely helps to prevent heat damage...excellent price for quality product...I highly recommend...</li>
            <li> Great product. Especially if you are a frequent blowdryer and hot iron user like our house hold. Will order again.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on Amazon I decided to purchase this at a local walmart for less ($4.00).  Well, I&#x27;m so happy I bought this because it really left my hair super silky when I flat iron it.  I really love it and will be buying a few more so that I never run low. ;-)</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I can&#x27;t travel away from home or spend a night without it. This is by far my favorite heat protectant that I have ever used. It also smells really nice and makes your hair feel soft wtihout the sticky gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product. It seems to protect the hair from heat while using the curling iron, hair feels silky afterwards, curls do not last quite as long, but the silky feel makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. It smells amazing and gives my hair a nice shine after heat styling. There is a noticeable difference in my hair when I use this vs when I don&#x27;t use it for heat styling. My hair feels a lot healthier even with regular styling. Would recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> I saw so many sucky reviews I was inspired because their not true! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. The thing that I love about it is that it&#x27;s affordable and I think my hair is better protected at home then in the salon. There have been many times that people ask me if I went to the salon to get my hair done and the answer is - No darling I did it at home. This spray helps preserve the length of my hair. I can go longer between cuts &amp; trims. As you can see from my main profile picture I try my best to protect my hair from heat styling and for the most part it does look great when I style it myself - and I&#x27;m not even a hair stylist connoisseur. It may leave a film on some of your brushes, but nothing serious if your hair is greasy after this you may be using too much. Clarifying shampoo (like from Neutrogena) should help with product build up &amp; hair brushes should be changed every so few months anyways. Otherwise - Definite recommendation!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted the sleek, straight, soft hair I would always see. When I would use other products my hair would with look weighed down or just oily and dirty or I would have incredible static and fried ends. This is the first thermal product I have used that actually got me soft,sleek hair that stayed straight all day. Great on both wet and dry hair. * better used when using a hair dryer or straightener comes out a little stiff just on its own.*&lt;br /&gt;By far the best smelling thermal product I have used. Easy to spray hard to reach areas. If you overspray it gets a little stiff( I found this to be a bonus while straightening my sections stayed sectioned). Once your done and you run a comb thru it it becomes incredibly soft and sleek with no weigh down. This is a definite must buy!!! This is one product that will be on my &#x27;Can&#x27;t live without list&#x27;. Very affordable and always available, I found my at Walgreens for $4.99.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to cut down on my blow drying. This product is great because it works with dry and wet hair, flat irons and blow dryiers. Leaves my hair softer then the previous Redken satinwear blow dry creme. Great smell! Makes hair shiny and soft. Never leaves your hair oily or weighed down. I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I have never used a heat protective spray before.  My hair is naturally curly so I usually just let it air dry and wear it in whatever shape it dries.  I am trying to do more grown-up hairstyles so I started using curling and flat irons that get up to a relatively high temperature, and I found my hair was getting brittle and very damaged.  I got this product because it was recommended by one of the beauty blogs I sought out for advice.  The product smells fantastic!  I followed the instructions verbatim.  I sprayed it on the mid-ends of my hair and combed it through.  I let it dry before using the iron on my hair.  I didn&#x27;t notice any brittleness or additional damage after using this product.  However, may hair was a little stiff, like I added some hairspray to the ends.  I thought the product would be like a silicone protectant that wouldn&#x27;t affect the softness of my hair, but my hair was stiff.  Perhaps I added too much to the ends of my hair the first time, but I&#x27;m not giving up.</li>
            <li> After heat drying my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore. Now it&#x27;s soft and ready to comb.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this, I asked how well it would work on straightened African American hair, and was told that it worked well.  But whatever type of thermal protection this product provides is outweighed by how brittle my hair gets after using it. I found that my hair breaks off much more after use, han it did without this &#x27;thermal protection&#x27;.  Threw it away.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Super light and not sticky like so many hair products.  However, this sells for $3.99 at Target (haven&#x27;t checked Wal-Mart). This is the first time I have been disappointed with an Amazon price.</li>
            <li> I was so excited and anxious about getting this product, once I finally received it the bottle was still wrapped in plastic but only a fourth of liquids in a 8 oz bottle. So imagine how felt when something I was so ready to receive was so disappointing and was not able to receive a new bottle on the hassle of a return!!!!!!! so although the product may awesome never got to experience it.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a heat spray, but I don&#x27;t see any amazing results with it. I do feel it products my hair so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t really do anything but make your hair smell kind of good after straightening.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what it is intended for: my hair is undamaged and in tact after using heat on it. The only downside, for me anyways, was that it does make thin/fine hair heavy and/or greasy looking. I use it for curls so it doesn&#x27;t really hurt for that.</li>
            <li> This actually works very well!</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells fantastic and my hair felt really silky after curling it. I&#x27;m normally very wary of heat treatment on my hair, but this stuff really hits the spot.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best heat protectant product on the market! It is the only one I have ever used (and I have used quite a few, mind you) that actually deep conditions your hair when you use a flat iron. The smell is fantastic, and the price is super cheap! Definitely a must-buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it works and I won&#x27;t buy it again honestly.</li>
            <li> I read sonewhere that it works great as a detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured since my hair tangles easily and that I might decide to straighten my hair occasionally, that I&#x27;d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing and drying my hair I rubbed about 3-4 pumps throughout it. I found the consistency to be a little sticky but nothing intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sectioned my hair off and began detangling with a wide-tooth comb. It worked! It provided slip and combined well with my other hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and my local store stopped carrying it.  I have fine, frizzy, color-treated hair and this spray works so great when I combine it with my anti-frizz serum and use my straightening iron.  The spray nozzle is fantastic at getting a very fine mist on my hair.  Helps make my hair really soft and makes it so that my hair gets straight without using super high heat on my iron. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works great to product my very fine hair without weighing it down.  I use it when I blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have tried several heat protection sprays but this has found its place among my top 3 favorites. Will buy it again. Very satisfied :-)</li>
            <li> I blow dry &amp; straighten my hair almost every day, so I really need something to protect it from the extreme heat! This spray does the trick. The spray nozzle sprays out a fine mist that lightly coats my hair without weighing it down. It makes my hair feel and smell great! I&#x27;ve tried several other brands but they were greasy, smelled bad, or were really expensive. This leaves my hair soft and silky and for an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Protects my hair from my hot air brush and curling iron...</li>
            <li> I have no experience with heat and shine sprays, so I can&#x27;t compare them to others or even evaluate it on its own merits. This will take time and experience.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using this product, I had read good reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It protects, leaves your hair soft, and smells great. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not for 4c natural hair! I am a African American woman with hair in the middle of my back. My hair was pretty detangled already and I sprayed it on the ends and midshaft. The spray helped detangle my hair it seemed but it made it wet although youre supposed to flat iron your hair when its dry.....  when the heat touched it, it sizzled and burned it. It made my hair matted and tangled and icky feeling. The residue from the spray got on the flat iron and made it icky and it made my hair feel dirty and sticky. I guess I must have touched the roots or something while plaiting my hair because it seized up my roots and I couldnt comb through it and I couldnt separate it into part; it was so stiff and stuck together. Alot of the stuck togetrher hair came out too. I will never use any of these type products again. When I went to the salon growing up, they didnt need heat protectant...I wont reinvent the wheel again!</li>
            <li> Stops hair from burning, wonderful smell, after curling with an iron your hair looks silky, soft and beautiful. Spray bottle is&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and sprays where you need it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much, but I suppose it works well.. It&#x27;s not like this product will show immediate and evident results.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling stiff. Only used once since receiving. Will have to try again. Not ready to give up since other reviews were really good. I will say that if I didn&#x27;t have gift card would not have bought from here. Found after I ordred online at Wal-Mart for $3 and change.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this at Walmart for a few years for about 5 dollars.  I spray this on my damp hair after rinsing the conditioner out and my hair feels soft. I then blow dry my hair and so far I would say it is just okay because of the softness of my hair but I don&#x27;t find it is really protecting my hair from heat damage as I still get split ends but it is less money so I buy it. I use it before I use a curling and flat iron and it sort of protects but not enough.  I think for a less expensive product, it works okay on my hair for now.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  BOTTOM LINE - a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first bottle of this, which I bought because I needed a heat protectant to use with a new curling wand.  I don&#x27;t usually like add-on hair products because I never want my hair to feel like \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; is on it.  I was pleasantly surprised because if you use a light enough hand in spraying this on, it is not in the least bit gunky or sticky.  After my hair is dry, I can&#x27;t tell it is on my hair at all, which I love.  The reviewer who complained about it obviously sprayed on way too much of it.  Use a light spray only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely smell, which is an added plus for me as I find many hair products smell truly sickening.  The scent of this one is not at all overpowering, but really nice (like a subtle perfume)  when you put it on and then soon it mostly disappears.  The price is fabulous, deals all over the place on it depending on where you buy, and I truly doubt that the various salon type brands at quadruple the price are any better.  Only time will tell if this really protects my hair, though.  I hope it does.  Since I don&#x27;t yet know how well it works as a heat shield, I only gave it 4 stars for now.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product are great, however, I tried it and didn&#x27;t care so much for it.  If you want a good protective spray ION makes a much better one than this.  You don&#x27;t need a lot and it takes the friz out of the hair and softens it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t go well on my brazilian hair but works okay on my hair I guess I use the shampoo so I guess its good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product necessarily protects my hair from the heat, which I don&#x27;t use a lot of heat products on my hair, it mostly stays up in a bun 99% of the time, but When I do use heat products, I use this on my hair when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, but I don&#x27;t really smell it throughout the day or anything, if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle can be tricky because there is a little button that kind of turns it off if you need to travel with it or have children near your stuff, but the button is right where you&#x27;d put your hand to grab the nozzle and you can easily move it to the off position.</li>
            <li> Hmmmm. After having tried this on 3 different heads (2 relatives and myself), I am convinced that either I am using this terribly wrong, or this just make your hair dry  and easy to tangle. Trying to flat iron natural hair is a task and this heat protectant didn&#x27;t do much.Maybe it prevented heat damage, but our heads were not left with a silky, smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> I love using this to help protect my hair when I use a flat iron on it and blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought it solely as a heat protectant, but I sometimes even use it when I&#x27;m not blow drying or flat ironing because it leaves my hair feeling very soft and smooth. The scent is nice, not flowery, but just a clean kind of smell.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Came quickly and just as described! Very satisfied with this seller :)</li>
            <li> This heat tamer makes my hair dull instead of shiny. There are better products on the market, albeit more expensive. When it comes to my hair, I want better performance.</li>
            <li> This spray is so amazing. Always leave my hair looking and feeling like I went to the hair salon and got my hair did.</li>
            <li> Good product until it&#x27;s now owned by Unilever and will be tested on animals!  I won&#x27;t support this!&lt;br /&gt;Btw - the price listed here is very expensive - local store sold this for $4.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me, I have used it a few times, I like the smell of it, I think it will be a while until I notice if it really protects my hair from heat or not (once I see that my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out or burn out) . Anyhow, I like ti so far.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works great</li>
            <li> I never got to use this product as the top on the bottle broke and the liquid completely soaked the other contents and box. The box was completely  wrapped in cellophane in order to complete the trip. Very disappointed in the packing of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why my experience is so different from most other users. Possibly because I have very dry, frizzy hair? In any event, I don&#x27;t feel that I got any benefit from this product. Didn&#x27;t seem like it was protecting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use pureshine Brilliant Blowout, a keratin product that leaves my hair feeling silky smooth. I&#x27;m low at the moment so I decided to try Tresemme Thermal Creations. Unlike Brilliant Blowout, Tresemme doesn&#x27;t require that you blow dry before flat ironing. Tresemme made my hair feel tacky and stiff upon application.  I only ironed 1/2 my head. It looked and felt like straw. Really awful.  Immediately applied Brilliant Blowout, blow dried, flat ironed and my hair was back to silky. Tresemme went straight in the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve tried something other than Brilliant Blowout and both times were disasters. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome thank you :) 👌</li>
            <li> I tried this recently to flat iron my hair and was amazed by the results. Highly recommended for those with very curly hair like mine. I&#x27;ve used Redken thermal protection which was very oily and CHI which was a little sticky, not a lot but very pricey in comparison to Tresemme.</li>
            <li> I swear by this. Affordable. Has a neat locking system so you wouldn&#x27;t spray accidently.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this product.  I do love the smell and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> good good no more i can say about it except that this review requires three more words now one two three</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product off of Amazon but I&#x27;m just letting everybody know that this product is totally amazing. Since my hair is natural it is hard for me to find products that works well on on unrelaxed African American hair. My hair became so straight after blow drying, it was completely straight after flat ironing it. Sadly my supply ran out early since I took the bottle with me on a trip and spilled in my bag. :-p</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a hair product snob, so I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product. I&#x27;d been blow drying, then flat ironing, and finally hairspraying my unruly bangs since I cut them a year ago. I took a flyer on this product since the reviews were mostly good, and was pleased to discover this spray eliminates the need to use the flat iron AND the hairspray. I am over the moon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! This is the first product I come across that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, or looking dirty. I personally don&#x27;t like the shine that products leave in my hair because I feel it looks greasy. Nonetheless, this product leaves my hair feeling silky smooth, and it even smells good after putting the iron through it a few times! I will definitely be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Note: My hair is medium thickness, its curly/wavy, and it&#x27;s been colored. I also deal with oily hair, so this product not leaving behind any residue is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning with my steam rollers. Great product and keeps my hair from looking damaged after using hot tools.</li>
            <li> So I like the product I guess it protects my hair forum the heat of the irons hair dryers etc. but I am very angry to know that the actual price of this product in stores is no. Ore the. $5.99 and the stores I usually shop in are $4.99.... I am actually paying more ordering it on amazon. I am really disappointed with this and this has happened to me a few times so when my membership is up in august I probably won&#x27;t renew my prime because I seem to end up spending more...</li>
            <li> I use it when I blow dry and the occasional iron, and so far you&#x27;ll have to simply have to know how much you should put on your hair. I tried to use it sparingly, and my hair still ended up quite dry, so I added a little more. The spray is pretty good, however, what I do is do about three spritzes on my palm and comb it through the bottom half of my damp hair, just right before blow-drying. Then when my hair is finally dry, I take care of the dry spots with another couple spritzes on my palm and another comb-through with my hands and fingers. Then I do my ironing, or go straight to styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and smooth, and very manageable. I&#x27;ve still yet to see how it holds up during cold, dry weather, but so far it&#x27;s works well in battling the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it a 4-star because I didn&#x27;t care much for the spray -- just didn&#x27;t work with me in terms of spraying directly onto hair -- unless your hair is long and you can dangle it over to the side and spray directly on it. I have short hair, so it&#x27;s harder to spritz it every which way -- maybe I just haven&#x27;t figured it out, plus I was pretty used to pumps or the standard press spray nozzle</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome makes my hair looks healthy and smells nice. Really a good protection of heat.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of it.. I Love TRESemme!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best heat protectant spray around. It works really well and the smell is amazing! I love it</li>
            <li> Actually this was the first one I tried and I liked it very much. It really seems to protect my hair as I blow dry it everyday and it looks pretty healthy. I&#x27;d recommend but I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.</li>
            <li> Not very expensive and yet I feel like it does a great job. Plus I like the smell of it!</li>
            <li> This heat tamer spray is affordable and makes your hair so soft and shiny. I use it without any heat sometimes because I love the feel of my hair with it. It feels pleasantly soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as part of a package from amazon where you had to have your purchases add up to $25. in order to order any of them. I found the same product significantly cheaper at Safeway--which I thought was a little disappointing. However, it is a good product non the less.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me a bottle of this 4 years ago and I have been using it ever since! I absolutely love this product. It smells great and it really protects the hair well. Plus, you can spray a lot and not get a lot of build-up at all. You can also use it with other products and it works just as great. I would not recommend any other heat protector besides this one!</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and shiny my hair feels after I spray with this - then proceed to straighten or curl. Not greasy at all, very slick feeling, and when I curl, the curls feel super bouncy! Great scent!</li>
            <li> I love this product although I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product; there is nothing better on the market to protect your hair from the heat. My husband loves the smell also! Recently, my hair and skin have been acting up and I have been temporarily using a shampoo and conditioner that is not helping me. I have had to continue the inferior shampoos until my amazon orders come in from the States.  My hair was straw for the past few weeks, but Tresemme helped it stay soft and healthy despite the bad products and the bad state of my hair. Everyone of all hair types should have this as a part of their haircare routine. The heat is damaging our hair, but this will protect us!</li>
            <li> I have very curly and tight curls, so straightening my hair always took a toll. I bought this in hopes that I would be able to minimize at least SOME of the damage I was doing. Normally when I ran the iron over my hair, my hair was burning hot and I had to wait for it to cool down before touching it to be able to run it through again. This product worked so amazingly that after I sprayed it on and went over it with the iron, my hair was straight and not hot to the touch! Its as if the product actually absorbed the heat! My hair stays straight longer and is so soft and smooth now. Definitely reccomend this product</li>
            <li> This stuff smells absolutely amazing! I use it before I blow dry my hair and again before I straighten or curl it. It helps put a barrier between my hair and the heat so my hair can stay protected while still looking amazing. It has a nice smell to it, it isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; spray, it feels like water, which was a concern I had, my hair is already thick so I don&#x27;t like products that are heavy, this one is so light. If you straighten or curl or blow dry your hair on a regular basis, I would definitely recommend this to you, and I think you will see a major difference in your hair!</li>
            <li> It smells great and does the job.</li>
            <li> Its good but im rating it three cause i recieved mine leaking 😥</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. Absolutely no stickyness or serum texture on the hair. I love using this for blow-drying, straightening, curling, everything!</li>
            <li> I have never used such an easy great product. The spray is so fine I don&#x27;t feel like it is weighting down my hair.</li>
            <li> smells great and isn&#x27;t sticky like my high end hair products. super happy!</li>
            <li> like the way it works</li>
            <li> Love the smell.. Only used it once.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for your hair!  Nice, light spray in a handy pump.  Easy to comb through &amp; not sticky. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day before blow drying, straightening or curling my hair. I can already tell the difference that it has made. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily at all and I can tell that it is protecting well. TRESemme for the win!</li>
            <li> Makes my dry, color treated hair silky, good smelling and looking great. I spray my damp hair before I blow dry, and then again before I straighten it. I love it!</li>
            <li> This spray has reduced the damage a LOT. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any oily or hard, hairspray-like residue. Only a good smell and silky hair. I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s not expensive or half-filled like some products are. The bottle is full when you open the package. So far, I have used it three times and I can already see this bottle will last me a good couple of months. The spray nozzle lets out a steady mist, covering my hair in the expected places. The only thing about the product that I found negative was the price. In my hometown, you can get the same size bottle of this stuff for a little cheaper. But all-in-all, DEFINITELY worth it!:)</li>
            <li> My bottle of TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray was completely empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my hair. Just a couple of spritz on each side and then I brush it through. I&#x27;m able to immediately curl or straighten my hair after using, and my hair comes out sleek and shiny, which is a good enough sign to me that it&#x27;s being protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase another bottle when I run out of mine.</li>
            <li> Great product! It works and smells great. The container that the product comes in is not durable enough to survive shipment unless it is properly packaged. The trigger is made of hard plastic that can break in transit.</li>
            <li> Smells so good!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Okay so I actually love this product, HOWEVER, I only used it a few time and the top broke!! Be prepared to BUY a new spray bottle. This one sprays really well but it is cheaply made and breaks easily! Other than that it is the best heat protector!</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth a try. It smells great, and my favorite part about it is that it keeps my style in all day. I don&#x27;t even have to use hairspray! Also, the pieces in the front of my hair never curl, so I tried spraying a bit more in the front before I use my curler, and it made them hold the curl!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Leaves my hair smelling wonderful and feeling extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product for both natural hair and virgin extensions!!! It protects the hair, leaving an awesome shine without a tacky, oily or sticky finish!!! I love it and it smells nice!!</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything positive.  Made my hair dull, less shiny.  Gave it away.  I don&#x27;t think I need a heat protectant anyway.</li>
            <li> Sprays easily, love the smell. Makes my long fair feel smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Feels light while giving hair great protection.  Smells ok</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it isn&#x27;t sticky when dry. It also smells good. What I don&#x27;t like about this is the bottle. No matter how many times I tighten the top it still leaks out. It fell once on it&#x27;s side and spilled 3/4 of the liquid onto my bathroom vanity. You would think they could come up with a sturdier cap that actually stays on, but nope. Wishful thinking. Now I&#x27;m out most of my product and seriously doubting future purchases, why waste my money to have it leak all over the place. Fix your bottle TRESemme. Maybe I&#x27;ll consider purchasing again. If not, I&#x27;ll go elsewhere to buy my heat protective spray.</li>
            <li> Can definitely see a difference in my hair with use of this product and my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product protects and helps your hair curl faster. It has a nice smell and is not sticky like some thermal protector sprays.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and smells fabulous too. It provides excellent heat protection and adds just the right amount of softness.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Used it, works fine I guess so far. It was dripping when I got it in the mail though- expected.</li>
            <li> This was highly rated on Amazon, so I bought it since I needed something to protect my hair from my straightener, but it left my hair feeling very dry and processed after. It might be because of the alcohol and chemicals in it. I&#x27;m not sure why it has such a high rating. I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for something better for my hair!</li>
            <li> Spray handle broke after one try</li>
            <li> This product works great, my hair looks healthy even after I flat iron it now. It was not as big of a bottle as I thought that it would be, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> good service, and the product serves its purpose, my hair definitely feels different and it was really good for the price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift. She was happy with the product. It seemed to help her hair seem silky</li>
            <li> You can feel it working in your hair when you use the straightener. Nice shine, feels cool and nice not sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with a new (hot tools) curling iron.  I use it on my towel dried hair before I blow dry and then again before I use my curling iron to limit heat damage.  It never feels heavy or greasy no matter how much I put in my hair.  It makes my hair shiny and it really helps hold my curls.  My husband and kids love how it makes my hair smell too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different heat protectants, and haven&#x27;t found one I&#x27;ve liked until now. I primarily only use this before I blow dry/ straighten my hair, but it keeps my hair silky, soft, and healthy. It&#x27;s very light, and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down. It also tames frizz and keeps my hair shiny. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product, and will be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different heat sprays and I love this one. I have thick hari and it makes it smooth and keeps my hair looking healthy and not oily.</li>
            <li> I use the curling iron a lot and it does protect my hair from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell the differece if I use this before rolling my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for using my flat iron as well as blow dryer and my hair always feels soft after using it. I also use it on my 3 year old daughters hair as well, but not just for blow drying, it also works at getting knots out of her hair!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely phenomenal. It leaves my hair feeling light, nourished and protected. I am absolutely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this a shot to help protect my hair from hot ironing due to the positive reviews. It does seem to help prevent my hair from frying and give it a smoother, shinier look. I have long, foofy, porous hair, and apply much more to the older hair near the ends. This spray is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t load down my hair or make it look greasy, and doesn&#x27;t stink like rancid fruit like so many other hair products, which I appreciate. Whatever scent there is fades pretty quickly. I have purchased two bottles on different occasions, and the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; on each sprayer was different, although both are located on the neck of the sprayer, one of which wasn&#x27;t obviously apparent to me when I first got it. The packaging has not proven great for travel, as no matter how carefully packed, the bottle has leaked, albeit into the freezer bag I packed it in - still, a pain. I resolved this by picking up an aluminum mister I saw at the container store, which has worked perfectly for me (although some reviewers seem to have had issues). In the end, I like the product, the packaging not so much, but at least the extra step saves a little space when I travel.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Made my hair smooth and shiny! I also like how it sprays out evenly.</li>
            <li> I .love this spray It&#x27;s lite wait also it smell great recommend. It&#x27;s not sticky nor ways your hair down.</li>
            <li> I guess it does protect your hair, because it makes my hair so hard to be curled! Once I spray it on, my hair will always be straight even if I leave the curling iron in for longer than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok. It does smell great but I find that my hair has a slightly thicker/ stickier feel to it. Not terrible, but maybe I am just not a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; person after all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how the product itself works, but the bottle is horrible.  When I try to spray it, it just leaks out of the base of the sprayer.  I end up getting more all over my hands than I do on my hair!  Very frustrating.  :-(</li>
