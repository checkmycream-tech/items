            <li>Thanks Sublime Beauty!</li>
            <li>I noticed changes first</li>
            <li>My skin is getting more firm and the fine lines are filling in.  </li>
            <li>This ageless serum is sensitive skin friendly</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes of us seeing each other, she asked me what is my beauty secret....and then told me how young and fresh my skin looks!!!!</li>
            <li>I will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I will ever apply makeup without this serum, totally worth the price, and I usually do not splurge on things like a serum, but this has changed me.</li>
            <li>It might&lt;br /&gt;be fine using a regular foundation, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.</li>
            <li>The serum is absorbed by the skin within few seconds and leaves it very smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very nourished by this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I really want to try the Fibroblast Serum, but in the meantime I&#x27;ve used a number of the serums in their line.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Ageless  Serum with Renovage &amp; Matrixyl.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for a short time and I like the silky, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Even with only using it once a day instead of the two suggested my skin is smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>With more time I believe that the other benefits should make themselves seen.</li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference in my skin, tone, texture is so much better especially when combined with their other products !</li>
            <li>Nice texture, hardly any scent.  </li>
            <li>, I do not have that many wrinkles yet, but the few I have do look very seamless when I apply this serum</li>
            <li>It works by targeting the four major signs of premature aging: wrinkles, large pores, redness, and age spots</li>
            <li>It battles 8 different signs of aging and once you hit a certain time in your life, you need all the help you can get.</li>
            <li>I have used other sublime beauty products in the past and this one is the same great quality.</li>
            <li>So far have not seen any results.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>just a 51 year young homemaker who runs a ranch in Texas.  </li>
            <li>If you are a person that likes natural beauty as I do, the beauty that others notice instead of all the cover up, then you need to try all three of the ageless line.  </li>
            <li>She is 46 years old and has some aging spots on her face.</li>
            <li>Then I order another right after I open the back up.  </li>
            <li>I have been using many of Sublime Beauty products over the past 6 months and have noticed quite an improvement of my face and neck area overall!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a dude and wondering whether it&#x27;s worth using a woman&#x27;s skincare, then I say go for it, my experience at least has been nothing, but positive.</li>
            <li>After only two weeks, this depressed area is noticeably raised---indicating to me that new collagen has formed underneath the surface.</li>
            <li>and I always found moisturizers either too rich or not rich enough.</li>
            <li>I was recently out with an old friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in ages.</li>
            <li>I feel my face a little firm, but I use more than one product at once.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products claiming to stimulate new collagen, and this is the only one that has actually done something.</li>
            <li>This is the first bottle I used and will continue for a few months to see result.</li>

            <li> Even with only using it once a day instead of the two suggested my skin is smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> With more time I believe that the other benefits should make themselves seen.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in my skin, tone, texture is so much better especially when combined with their other products !</li>
            <li> Nice texture, hardly any scent.  </li>
            <li> , I do not have that many wrinkles yet, but the few I have do look very seamless when I apply this serum</li>
            <li> It works by targeting the four major signs of premature aging: wrinkles, large pores, redness, and age spots</li>
            <li> It battles 8 different signs of aging and once you hit a certain time in your life, you need all the help you can get.</li>
            <li> I have used other sublime beauty products in the past and this one is the same great quality.</li>
            <li> So far have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> just a 51 year young homemaker who runs a ranch in Texas.  </li>
            <li> If you are a person that likes natural beauty as I do, the beauty that others notice instead of all the cover up, then you need to try all three of the ageless line.  </li>
            <li> She is 46 years old and has some aging spots on her face.</li>
            <li> Then I order another right after I open the back up.  </li>
            <li> I have been using many of Sublime Beauty products over the past 6 months and have noticed quite an improvement of my face and neck area overall!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a dude and wondering whether it&#x27;s worth using a woman&#x27;s skincare, then I say go for it, my experience at least has been nothing, but positive.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks, this depressed area is noticeably raised---indicating to me that new collagen has formed underneath the surface.</li>
            <li> and I always found moisturizers either too rich or not rich enough.</li>
            <li> I was recently out with an old friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in ages.</li>
            <li> I feel my face a little firm, but I use more than one product at once.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products claiming to stimulate new collagen, and this is the only one that has actually done something.</li>
            <li> This is the first bottle I used and will continue for a few months to see result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to notice any visible change, but my skin</li>
            <li> The few near the eyes have improved and I can&#x27;t wait to see after longer use the improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I am noticing a difference; i.e., by comparing my facial skin to other&#x27;s in my age range (75-85 years).  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this product has helped with my dryness.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference on my wrinkles but it has only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks (in combination with their &#x27;Line Smoother&#x27;)</li>
            <li> My skin stays moisturized all day long and looks healthier than it did previously.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and there is no greasiness.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with their other products and am please with the subtle results I have had so far.  </li>
            <li> Complements other Sublime products that I use in my skin care regimement</li>
            <li> I use the Sublime Beauty AGELESS SERUM with RENOVAGE in concert with other Sublime Beauty products, and as directed.  </li>
            <li> Now other women I know, are noticing this.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin which is a little dry over oily</li>
            <li> I really think (at least for me) that the product does stimulate the regeneration of collagen, because I have an area on my forehead which looks like a deep depression where the collagen has simply broken down.</li>
            <li> I only use it once per day instead of the two because it is thick and takes a while to soak in and makes me feel like I am wearing a mask.</li>
            <li> I have seen  a slight improvement in wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I am no super model</li>
            <li> As always, SUBLIME  products will never let you down!  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I put it on everyday when I am doing my makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite difficult and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily on my skin.nI</li>
            <li> The texture is richer than some other serum which are quickly absorbed, I prefer this as it makes a smoother base for makeup.</li>
            <li> a very polite lady commented on my skin and was shocked to hear my age.  </li>
            <li> Some small wrinkles between the eyes, on the lips, and cheeks are almost invisible now.</li>
            <li> Even though its a very thick consistency it does not go heavy on the skin</li>
            <li> With this serum added to your daily routine, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Just a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy, don&#x27;t know if I can return it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 weeks and have seen no change.  </li>
            <li> but it arrived very quickly mad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not find this product to be what they claimed.  I really went by what another gal had written, saying she thought it was better than her stand by cream at Nordstrom&#x27;s.. It does not tighten the skin as my currant one did.  I was not happy, don&#x27;t know if I can return it.  If so I will.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only two weeks, and already I see improvement. I really think (at least for me) that the product does stimulate the regeneration of collagen, because I have an area on my forehead which looks like a deep depression where the collagen has simply broken down. After only two weeks, this depressed area is noticeably raised---indicating to me that new collagen has formed underneath the surface. I have tried numerous products claiming to stimulate new collagen, and this is the only one that has actually done something. I will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li> This serum is silky and absorbs into the skin nicely. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my skin the minute I used it.  Everytime I use it seems to do better and better.  I received this product at a reduced price to give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I am incredibly impressed with this serum, it has work beautifully as a primer, I do not have that many wrinkles yet, but the few I have do look very seamless when I apply this serum, I don&#x27;t think I will ever apply makeup without this serum, totally worth the price, and I usually do not splurge on things like a serum, but this has changed me. Even though its a very thick consistency it does not go heavy on the skin it is actually very light, and you do not need much to get results</li>
            <li> So far have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> Product is a nice cream for your face not a instant wrinkle fix.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in my skin, tone, texture is so much better especially when combined with their other products !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 weeks. I love it because it makes my skin feel like velvet!!! A little goes a long way. I think I&#x27;ve got one of everything Sublime makes because I wanted to try the line. I have been happy with all of my purchases and plan to stick with them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product</li>
            <li> Started using this and I am quite pleased with this product. I don&#x27;t have to moisturize after application, as it does the job. It also has many of the ingredients that help reduce wrinkles, even skin color, gives you a smoother face. It battles 8 different signs of aging and once you hit a certain time in your life, you need all the help you can get.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 weeks and have seen no change.  I will continue use until bottle is gone in hopes that I will see improvement.</li>
            <li> This ageless serum is sensitive skin friendly and I loved the smoothing effects. I will definitely reorder. It lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for three weeks now and have decided to switch permanently from my regular moisturizer.  I love the way it feels on my face..Very smooth and soft..and smells good. My skin stays moisturized all day long and looks healthier than it did previously.  Great item!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for about two weeks now.  I am loving it.  My skin stays moisturized all day.  I do use it twice a day.  I have seen  a slight improvement in wrinkles.  However I&#x27;m in my 70s and for sure don&#x27;t expect miracles.  I will keep using this.</li>
            <li> All I can say is SILK!</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for several weeks and I like how soft and smooth it makes my face feel.  I have dry skin and this product has helped with my dryness. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference on my wrinkles but it has only been a few weeks. I will definitely continue using!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  I like the pump applicator because just the right amount comes out.  I will buy this product again.  I am using it around my eyes to help reduce crows feet.</li>
            <li> This is the first bottle I used and will continue for a few months to see result. I feel my face a little firm, but I use more than one product at once.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on so smooth and luxurious and smells great.  I use it each morning and evening and feel it is helping make the fine lines disappear.  My skin feels very nourished by this moisturizer and I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought the serum was wonderful...I like the products by Sublime Beauty and the customer service is excellent..The serum is easily absorbed and feels good on the skin</li>
            <li> I love sublime products. Every one of them have been great. I would recommend trying any and all of them,</li>
            <li> Easy to apply skin looks smooother, use morning &amp; night.  Complements other Sublime products that I use in my skin care regimement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this a 3 star rating. I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to notice any visible change, but my skin&lt;br /&gt;does feel so nice from all of the Sublime Beauty products. The instructions for this say it can be used twice&lt;br /&gt;a day, so I was applying it at night and in the morning. I am now only using it at night. I wear airbrush makeup,&lt;br /&gt;and this does not work well with my makeup at all. A couple of hours after applying, my makeup was just not&lt;br /&gt;staying fresh looking. It took me about a week to figure it out, so I&#x27;m sticking to night time for this one. It might&lt;br /&gt;be fine using a regular foundation, but I haven&#x27;t tried that.</li>
            <li> As always, SUBLIME  products will never let you down!  Just when you fall in love with one, you start loving another  one just as much. They are all great. Customer service is unbeatable!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks (in combination with their &#x27;Line Smoother&#x27;) and there is no question that my face and neck already look like they are aging in reverse.  My skin is getting more firm and the fine lines are filling in.  I am very pleased with the results so far and will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Skin elasticity has improved.</li>
            <li> I love the way this serum felt on my skin. It is not heavy or oily. My skin looks Great!</li>
            <li> Sublime Beauty ageless serum with renovage and matrixyl to me, is as close as you can get to an all-in-one anti-aging product for the skin. It works by targeting the four major signs of premature aging: wrinkles, large pores, redness, and age spots (I personally have all 4). Wrinkles are one of the few things that are almost universally feared, so as you can imagine, there are hundreds of wrinkle creams out there that claim to be able to fix or prevent wrinkle problems for good. I have been using many of Sublime Beauty products over the past 6 months and have noticed quite an improvement of my face and neck area overall! I was recently out with an old friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in ages. After 5 minutes of us seeing each other, she asked me what is my beauty secret....and then told me how young and fresh my skin looks!!!! She wanted to know my \\&quot;secret\\&quot;!!! With this serum added to your daily routine, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it everyday and seems to be working. I put it on everyday when I am doing my makeup. I really love the way that it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sublime Beauty product for over a year now - Retinol Serum, day &amp; night cream and recently purchased Ageless Serum - another wonderful product! My skin feels great! Very smooth! Goes well under make up. I use it am and pm and love it! Customer service is great too! I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and worth a try.  It made my pores smaller giving my face a nice smooth complexion.  I wear makeup, with this product my face looked flawless even without a primer.  I highly recommend to anyone to include in product in your skincare regimen!!! One more year till I&#x27;m 30, so want to start focusing on anti-aging products now rather than correcting them later :)</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 of them because I love it!</li>
            <li> I use the Sublime Beauty AGELESS SERUM with RENOVAGE in concert with other Sublime Beauty products, and as directed.  I am noticing a difference; i.e., by comparing my facial skin to other&#x27;s in my age range (75-85 years).  My skin is softer in appearance with fewer wrinkles over-all, and a disappearance of the creases at the corners of the eyes and across the upper lip.  I reiterate, my use of this product is but one of several Sublime Beauty products I have selected to use and I use them as a team approach to facial care for maximum benefit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> Great line of skin care products!  Especially for us that time is catching up to.  I really want to try the Fibroblast Serum, but in the meantime I&#x27;ve used a number of the serums in their line.  I really like this Ageless  Serum with Renovage &amp; Matrixyl.  Applies like silk and absorbs quickly.  I use it in combination with their other products and am please with the subtle results I have had so far.  Thanks Sublime Beauty!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Just a little expensive.  Skin feels great after you use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a short time and I like the silky, smooth skin. I have some deep wrinkles in the jaw line and have not yet notice a difference in them yet. The few near the eyes have improved and I can&#x27;t wait to see after longer use the improvement in my skin. A little goes a long way and there is no greasiness. My base makeup goes over the serum very nicely and so far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I always order this, along with several items from SUBLIME BEAUTY.  I LOVE COMBINING THE AGELESS RAPID TIGHTNER, AND SERUM TOGETHER IN THE DAY.  IT WILL GIVE SUCH AN AMAZING LIFT.  IF I DO NOT COMBINE THE AGELESS RAPID TIGHTNER.  I COMBINE THEIR COLLAGEN PEPTIDE SERUM, WITH THE AGELESS SERUM, AGAIN AN AMAZING LIFT.  IF YOU DECIDE YOU LIKE THEY HAVE A SITE WHERE IF YOU SIGN UP FOR EMAILS, YOU WILL GET AMAZING DISCOUNTS.  NO I DO NOT WORK FOR THEM.  I AM A CUSTOMER.  THE SITE IS sublime-beauty.net</li>
            <li> You have to try this product.  Many other products say this and that about how gorgeous your skin will be after using there products but, come on a super model telling me that an injection out of a fruit in another country is the trick, it is not so believable to me.&lt;br /&gt;Well I am no super model just a 51 year young homemaker who runs a ranch in Texas.  I know, how original right. I love to be in nature surrounded with my horses, my dogs and all the natural beauty that is so gracefully given freely.  With that said, here is some free given advice.  This works! Sublime Beauty works.  I have never seen anything like this product ever.  The proof is on my face.  My skin is glowing.  I noticed changes first then others started noticing. My deeper lines between my brows started to become thinner and then became unnoticeable at all.  Now other women I know, are noticing this.  What a twist in words.  If you are a person that likes natural beauty as I do, the beauty that others notice instead of all the cover up, then you need to try all three of the ageless line.  I am so thrilled beyond words that i did. Sublime Beauty thank you.  Ps.  I always have one back up for when I go through a bottle.  Then I order another right after I open the back up.  I can not say enough about this product.  It is all in the ingredients.  Truly the ingredients says it all and why it works so well.  I am 52 years of age and just today (this is the truth) a very polite lady commented on my skin and was shocked to hear my age.  This is something that did not happen to me until Sublime Products.  Of course I told her how to get the good stuff!! A MUST HAVE!&lt;br /&gt;Sherri</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom. She is 46 years old and has some aging spots on her face. She told me that the product is very effective in lightening her dark spots! She is happy and I am happy too!</li>
            <li> Nice texture, hardly any scent.  Soaks right in.  Have had no breakouts from using this product.  After using it for weeks,  my skin is softer and my lines are softer too on my face.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this Ageless Serum from Sublime Beauty. It is probably the best serum I have ever had. My skin is quite difficult and sensitive. This serum has very light scent, goes on smoothly and causes no irritation. Am very pleased with this product. The texture is richer than some other serum which are quickly absorbed, I prefer this as it makes a smoother base for makeup. The serum is absorbed by the skin within few seconds and leaves it very smooth. Some small wrinkles between the eyes, on the lips, and cheeks are almost invisible now. I was amazed on how my skin changed. I get a lot of compliments on the healthy look of my skin. It is such a terrific product in this category of skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based upon my own experiences with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, recently I was offered the opportunity to receive this Ageless Serum in exchange for my unbiased reviews. I started using it instead of a &amp;#34;men&#x27;s moisturizer&amp;#34; from a well-known brand. I have combination skin which is a little dry over oily and I always found moisturizers either too rich or not rich enough. Well, I am very happy with the results. I love the consistency of this serum, my skin stays soft and serum does not irritate the skin. If you&#x27;re a dude and wondering whether it&#x27;s worth using a woman&#x27;s skincare, then I say go for it, my experience at least has been nothing, but positive.</li>
            <li> I have been using the ageless serum by sublime beauty for about a week now. I only use it once per day instead of the two because it is thick and takes a while to soak in and makes me feel like I am wearing a mask. Even with only using it once a day instead of the two suggested my skin is smooth and moisturized. With more time I believe that the other benefits should make themselves seen. I have used other sublime beauty products in the past and this one is the same great quality. I received this for free or reduced price but the opinion seen above is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free for review. I am very happy with what I am seeing so far. I&#x27;ve noticed the fine lines in my forehead seem to be smoothing out....which excites me to no end. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily on my skin.nI am definitely going to keep using this and recommend it to my friends. Not only is it a great product...but it arrived very quickly mad the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> Yet another good product. Absorbs very nicely leaving skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love Sublime Beauty&#x27;s Products. I have used Ageless Serum with Renovage and Matrixyl for about two months and it does what it says.  I have definitely seen good results.  Skin is softer, pores are smaller face seems firmer.  Sublime Beauty&#x27;s service is excellent and I will definitely continue buying their products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.i have been using for more than 3 weeks and I haven noticed a difference with my skin</li>
            <li> Awesome! What a difference!!</li>
