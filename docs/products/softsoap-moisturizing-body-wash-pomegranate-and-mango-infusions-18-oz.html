            <li>The price is cheap too!</li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m sure will have an effect somewhere.</li>
            <li>five or more times.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing and the smell stays with you for a while.</li>

            <li>It smells wonderful, lathers well, and leaves your skin feeling clean and not dry.  </li>
            <li>Nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Softsoap&#x27;s new Pomegranate &amp; Mango body wash is one of the most amazing smelling body washes that I have ever tried, one sniff is what made me put it in my cart, and I am so extremely glad that I</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves me skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>For $3.50 to $4 per 18 oz, it&#x27;s a pretty good value compared with other good aromatic body bathing products I shop online for $1 or more per oz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for beautiful exotic unique bathing scents that don&#x27;t smell too chemically synthetic (as you can see from my other reviews).  </li>
            <li>He liked it, and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it</li>
            <li>This body wash generates a great amount of lather from a small portion and the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li>Gets me clean with no residue in the shower.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice and it&#x27;s not drying for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>if u wanna take a quick shower</li>
            <li>The aroma&#x27;s are pleasant and enjoyable, yet not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>fresh and sweet scent lasts more than 2hours and leave my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It is the kind of scent that leaves your entire bathroom smelly, but in a good way, long after you are done with your shower.</li>
            <li>Softsoap&#x27;s Pomegranate &amp; Mango and the powerful smell of grapefruit and citrus hits your nose.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh fruity smell.</li>
            <li>Simply put, I feel the amount of soap needed to feel like you got a good cleaning is too much.</li>
            <li>And the texture of the soap is just right</li>
            <li>Seems to clean very well.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product of which you can easily obtain at Walmart, is the pretty color and cute little beads in there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve occasionally come to Amazon looking to find a better deal, and often, if you buy a product in a multi-pack, you do save money per unit.</li>
            <li>Read a hundred positive reviews about this product so bought it and fallin&#x27; in love with it instantly!</li>
            <li>and I like it so much that it&#x27;s all I buy.</li>
            <li>did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent really is the premium feature of this body wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see this as being very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for the amount</li>
            <li>thanks for my order</li>
            <li>With liquid soap, it&#x27;s normal to remove the top of a container which is almost empty and pour the contents into a new one.</li>
            <li>i will be back later love this</li>
            <li>I mix half of it with half my shampoo to give my hair that great aromatic smell.  </li>
            <li>As far as bathing, it DOES take a lot of it to use since it doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li>Right now we are only buying and using this product.</li>
            <li>basically I feel VERY ITCHY whenever my body wants to sweat and the itches are inside my body not outside...</li>
            <li>In fact, it lathered better than the baby bubble bath I usually use.</li>
            <li>far from it in fact!</li>
            <li>but it makes the hives less intense when they come unlike other body wash lotions that will make the hives more intense if you use them.</li>
            <li>This formula is also easy on my dry skin, so I never get out of the shower itchy feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Not suggested for people with sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen more expensive brands in the drugstore for bodywashes with labels featuring \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; scents but they smell too synthetic for me as if someone in a lab mixed up a whole lot of unpronounceable chemicals together and then added a whole lot of coconut scent to finish them off.  </li>
            <li>my family first thought there was dirt in the soap due to the pomegranate seeds...</li>
            <li>DO NOT buy at this price, as this is still more double a poor price at a grocery store.</li>
            <li>This body wash was not very moisturizing, I would recommend it for normal skin.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m usually all natural and no sls.</li>

            <li> Not here.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s just soap like any other.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it over other washes.</li>
            <li> With Softsoap body wash, I couldn&#x27;t do this with my hands or even kitchen tools, and finally needed a pipe wrench, which was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> leaves skin slightly fruity.</li>
            <li> It does not clean.  </li>

            <li> Hard to find sometimes in the store but Iove the fragrance</li>
            <li> I have to squirt the bottle hard</li>

            <li> all attempts to a useless digital assistant (artificial intelligence, not quite).</li>
            <li> The outrageous $25.95 cent price of Sept 1 has gone and is currently $12.79.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> &quot; This is shocking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When we use this body wash the entire upstairs smells like mangos and pomegranates. So yummy! And I can smell it on my skin for hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Softsoap&#x27;s various body wash products for about 3 years now and I like it so much that it&#x27;s all I buy. The aroma&#x27;s are pleasant and enjoyable, yet not overwhelming. And the texture of the soap is just right--I get a lot of lather from a relatively small amount. This formula is also easy on my dry skin, so I never get out of the shower itchy feeling dry. The moisture seems to lock in and I feel exceptionally clean--more so than a bar of soap or a thinner body wash. So to me, this is a great product, deserving of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about the over $12-14 prices I currently see on the various options. I&#x27;ve occasionally come to Amazon looking to find a better deal, and often, if you buy a product in a multi-pack, you do save money per unit. But I have yet to see this product offered at a bargain. In fact, the 3-pack is a premium. I&#x27;ve never seen it at a grocery store (for this 18oz) for *more* than $4.19 per bottle, and the grocery stores I buy it from have it for $3.69-$3.99. So I recommend a little comparison shopping until Amazon can bring the price down to around the $11 level for this 3-pack, at which point I&#x27;d be willing to buy this and wait for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Sept 1, 2010: This product is currently listed at the exorbitant price of $25.95 by a sell known as \\&quot;Empire Invest.\\&quot; This is shocking. DO NOT buy at this price, as this is still more double a poor price at a grocery store. I expect this price and seller to eventually change, but for now, stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Sept 26, 2010: The outrageous $25.95 cent price of Sept 1 has gone and is currently $12.79. An acceptable price, but still more than $4.25 per b18oz bottle. I&#x27;d like to see it under $11 before I buy here, even though I normally love shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for beautiful exotic unique bathing scents that don&#x27;t smell too chemically synthetic (as you can see from my other reviews).  I bought my bottle at my local Walgreen&#x27;s.  Softsoap&#x27;s done a good job with this bodywash.  I&#x27;ve seen more expensive brands in the drugstore for bodywashes with labels featuring \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; scents but they smell too synthetic for me as if someone in a lab mixed up a whole lot of unpronounceable chemicals together and then added a whole lot of coconut scent to finish them off.  Open up the lid for Softsoap&#x27;s Pomegranate &amp; Mango and the powerful smell of grapefruit and citrus hits your nose.  As far as bathing, it DOES take a lot of it to use since it doesn&#x27;t lather much but it has very thick viscosity and REAL pomegranate seeds.  It IS moisturizing.  I mix half of it with half my shampoo to give my hair that great aromatic smell.  I&#x27;ve found that by keeping it on your skin or hair for a longer time, then the scent stays longer.  For $3.50 to $4 per 18 oz, it&#x27;s a pretty good value compared with other good aromatic body bathing products I shop online for $1 or more per oz. including s/h.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product of which you can easily obtain at Walmart, is the pretty color and cute little beads in there.  It does not clean.  I was still with body odor using this stuff.  Use as a bubble bath instead.</li>
            <li> This wash smells sooooooo GOOD! Like actual pomegranate! The consistency is thick and not watered down at all! At 3 for 12 this soap comes out to 4 dollars each while its almost 6 dollars each when you buy this at stores! Great must have if you are looking to stock up a good body wash at a low price! xD</li>
            <li> Softsoap&#x27;s new Pomegranate &amp; Mango body wash is one of the most amazing smelling body washes that I have ever tried, one sniff is what made me put it in my cart, and I am so extremely glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent really is the premium feature of this body wash. The aroma is absolutely remarkable. It is the kind of scent that leaves your entire bathroom smelly, but in a good way, long after you are done with your shower. And while you are in the shower, the way the smell envelops you is just downright heavenly. Thats why we love to wake up to it each and every morning !!!!!!</li>
            <li> After trying every bottle of body wash on the market, my husband and I have finally found the one for us. We love the scent, love the lather, and love the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get this thru Amazon on their &#x27;Subsribe &amp; Save&#x27; program for a LOT cheaper than advertised from this Seller. And, it&#x27;s automatically shipped to you, so now we never run out of body wash.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.  It smells wonderful, lathers well, and leaves your skin feeling clean and not dry.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive areas of the body, if you know what I mean.  I always avoid bodywash with \\&quot;mint\\&quot; in them for that reason!  For those who say this doesn&#x27;t lather well, get yourself a shower pouf or Salux type of body washcloth (Asian Style).  You will only need one squirt for mounds of lather, and it exfoliates as well.  If you find the Salux a little rough, go to an Asian market where they sell other brands that are softer.</li>
            <li> I was almost out of body wash. It was time to pick up some more. This time I spotted a purple bottle of Softsoap body wash with Juicy Pomegranate and Mango Infusions. Well, why not? It turns out that it&#x27;s rather good. Nice fresh smell. Seems to clean very well. I put it on a big fluffy bath sponge (not really a sponge but a net of wrinkled plastic) and it lathers and scrubs well. My youngster (3 1/2-year-old boy) spotted it and asked me to use it on him. Okay, I put some in his tub and turned the water briskly on to fill the tub. It lathered well. In fact, it lathered better than the baby bubble bath I usually use. He liked it, and it worked very well. It&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> Read a hundred positive reviews about this product so bought it and fallin&#x27; in love with it instantly! fresh and sweet scent lasts more than 2hours and leave my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Very good and cheap smells pretty good two can be used instead of soap if u wanna take a quick shower</li>
            <li> My husband loves this smell!</li>
            <li> The smell is what has made me stick with this body wash for over a year. However I have become too used to the smell and have switched now. I don&#x27;t really see this as being very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash with a wonderful fruity smell.  I really liked this product after I used to buy it buy the single bottle</li>
            <li> My boyfriend cannot get enough of this body wash. He loves the smell. Right now we are only buying and using this product. More than satisfied.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves me skin feeling soft and clean. One of my favorites! It has a fresh fruity smell. The price is cheap too!</li>
            <li> Hard to find sometimes in the store but Iove the fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soap snob. I&#x27;m usually all natural and no sls. If I am choosing a standard soap, I would pick this one. Fragrance is nice and it&#x27;s not drying for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This body wash was not very moisturizing, I would recommend it for normal skin. The scent is also very light.</li>
            <li> I always keep this one, along with varying others . Delightful to use and at a good to great price . ( Price varies .)</li>
            <li> 1. Smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;2. Reasonable price for the amount you pay.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s stays soapy for a long time - even under water&lt;br /&gt;4. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize too well, can&#x27;t do a really good job shaving with it either. But I&#x27;m being picky.</li>
            <li> Nice, not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I like the soap and it&#x27;s sometimes a good buy, but I&#x27;ve stopped buying it because of the packaging. With liquid soap, it&#x27;s normal to remove the top of a container which is almost empty and pour the contents into a new one. With Softsoap body wash, I couldn&#x27;t do this with my hands or even kitchen tools, and finally needed a pipe wrench, which was ridiculous. To add insult to injury, Colgate, the manufacturer, has no email address or phone number for product feedback or any other reason, and routes all attempts to a useless digital assistant (artificial intelligence, not quite). Maybe I wasn&#x27;t persistent enough in pursuing contact avenues, but I gave up, so I&#x27;m posting here, which I&#x27;m sure will have an effect somewhere.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I feel the amount of soap needed to feel like you got a good cleaning is too much. I have to squirt the bottle hard five or more times.&lt;br /&gt;I like suds when I shower.  This product will only give you lots of suds if you use LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of soap.&lt;br /&gt;Other brands tried I give 3 squirts and it&#x27;s almost like bathing with shampoo. Not here.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s just soap like any other.  ME, I prefer lots of lather.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have cholinergic urticaria (heat hives) basically I feel VERY ITCHY whenever my body wants to sweat and the itches are inside my body not outside... Anyway this is probably the best body wash for my condition.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOT A CURE.. far from it in fact! but it makes the hives less intense when they come unlike other body wash lotions that will make the hives more intense if you use them.</li>
            <li> The smell is the strongest selling point, for me. It is so refreshing and the smell stays with you for a while. my family first thought there was dirt in the soap due to the pomegranate seeds...I just had to educate them...again!!</li>
            <li> thanks for my order i will be back later love this i use it all the time thank again god bless</li>
            <li> Received product as described and promptly.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, but this is the best.  It smells great, very sudsy, and cleans well.  It does not leave my skin dry either.  Love it!</li>
            <li> What to say?  It works.  Gets me clean with no residue in the shower. Recommended. The price is good. And the variety of scents adds even more.</li>
            <li> A wonderful smell but I had such a bad allergic reaction. I had dry itchy skin and hives for 3 weeks, ugh. I wish my skin would take to to cheaper body wash because I&#x27;m on a budget! Not suggested for people with sensitive skin like me. I&#x27;ve recently been using equate body wash with shea and it works well. And it&#x27;s cheap, if anyone is looking! :D</li>
            <li> This product smells good and does what it is supposed to.  The price was good and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> smells really nice. leaves skin slightly fruity.</li>
            <li> This body wash generates a great amount of lather from a small portion and the smell is really nice. I would recommend it over other washes. Hope you enjoy it</li>
