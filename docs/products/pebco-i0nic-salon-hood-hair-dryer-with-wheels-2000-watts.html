            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased hooded hair dryers before but this one is the BEST!</li>

            <li>For me it STILL works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>and it is the best dryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li>My clients are impressed.</li>
            <li>Best of all,  the heat does not burn;  there is an adjustable heat setting which gives you the temperature you want.  </li>
            <li>This is really a very good dryer and I have owned it for about 4 years.  </li>
            <li>Excellent dryer great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>Have used it twice, once for wrapping my hair and once for conditioning my hair, worked great both times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used tabletop hairdryers and find the portability of this dryer a great plus.</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer based on the great reviews I&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li>My hair is in great condition and I contribute it to my dryer...</li>
            <li>great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>i bought two of them for a beauty salon.worked great.</li>
            <li>I can set my hair and it comes out as good as a Salon do--saving me time and money times 2 for me and my daughter.</li>
            <li>, so I figured the hood dryer would be just as good.</li>
            <li>The internet is full of profitable, HONEST, thriving beauty suppliers, -AMAZON should never, EVER accept this type of behavior from it&#x27;s SELLERs.- UNACCEPTABLE!!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>I absolutly love it!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to rush to the salon after work or on a precious Saturday!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this company should be ashamed of its products.  </li>
            <li>it comes in three peaces and very easy to assamble.</li>
            <li>Truly a great product and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m moving to place where there aren&#x27;t many african-american salons and stylist, so i figured i&#x27;ll be doing my own hair quite a bit.</li>
            <li>and so far it works great!  </li>
            <li>My dryer is still going strong!</li>
            <li>Over all this is a great dryer, AND also all salon hooded dryers are large!</li>
            <li>Not to fear though, I love taking care of my hair and often do it at home anyway.</li>
            <li>I still love it though.</li>
            <li>Okay, you can hear the timer...  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even look at the directions when i assembled mine and best of all, it&#x27;s QUIET.</li>
            <li>I could make a better dryer myself with a screwdriver and a trip to Home DEpot.</li>
            <li>I love being in control of my beauty and hair health</li>
            <li>(in my salon I often felt rushed and lost precious hairs).</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say more about it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m STILL in love..</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews and did a lot of research before purchasing this dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer more than paid for itself after a month.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it with any chair because I can wheel the dryer wherever I want around the house</li>
            <li>I cannot do that at the salon or even with a table top dryer because I was restricted about where to sit.     </li>
            <li>I was so excited purchasing this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>The bell when it goes off is extremely loud and did scare me (and my dog) when it went off, lol.</li>
            <li>came quicker than expected and EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY!</li>
            <li>I guess I could take it apart to store it since it can be put together so easily, (</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d still recommend this dryer and would easily purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair evenly and very quickly without any damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>The hood lifts up and easily accommodates the head.  </li>
            <li>Easy to assemble  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to put together and it looked exactly like what I was looking for.    </li>
            <li>If you want, smooth, frizz-free hair and a salon quality wash and set...get this dryer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny with great body, similar to when I would use tabletop hood dryer.  </li>
            <li>&quot; sound.  </li>
            <li>Also, this dryer makes a ticking sound and when the timer finished the ticking continued for a minute even after I unplugged it.</li>
            <li>It says free shipping, but its not, when you put it in your cart you pay like $30 for shipping and its comes up to like $164.00.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any shine from the IONIC stuff, whatever that is, but am thoroughly satisfied with how hot it gets and</li>
            <li>Originally I was looking at a Pibbs</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it was worth the money!</li>
            <li>The dryer works good but the face shield and the stand do not last.</li>
            <li>I think it is a terrific hair dryer--as good as what is used in the Salons.  </li>
            <li>I originally posted in January 2008 as a New Years resolution for better hair.</li>
            <li>It works well and dries the hair quickly.</li>
            <li>but the owner of the beauty supply distribution store I bought this at (which they carry both) told me that most of the local salons buy this one instead (Pibbs) and that they all love it.</li>
            <li>had I not unplugged it quickly.      </li>
            <li>I was surprise how quickly I received it.</li>
            <li>Very nice, quiet &amp;yge shippment was fast .best dryer ever.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, just like in the salon</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and there aren&#x27;t that many African-American Hair Salons close to me.</li>
            <li>I have to edit my first review on this product!  </li>
            <li>what i love the most is that it has two fan speed settings, high and low and you can adjust the heat setting to whatever is comfortable for you because it does get as hot as the dryers in salons.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Well worth my investment.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how powerful that dryer is.  </li>
            <li>What i love most is that the hair is left very soft.</li>
            <li>Then to try and return it to Beauty Genesis was a pure JOKE!  </li>
            <li>I certainly wish I had not!  </li>
            <li>the height is adjustable, and the hood is large enough to fit even your larges rollers comfortably.</li>
            <li>It was extremely hot to the touch.    </li>
            <li>I have had this dryer for a month and am pleased overall.  </li>
            <li>The first time the bell went off, I was under the dryer and just about jumped out of my skin</li>
            <li>so I can turn the timer back to 60 minutes if I need more time</li>
            <li>I sent my blow dryer packing after using this the first time.</li>
            <li>love shopping on Amazon, my entire family, co-workers,</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHERE IT BELONGS...</li>
            <li>This dryer has a fan that distributes the air evenly instead of the cheaper table top dryers that blow air only in one spot causing breakage and leaving some parts of your hair damp.     </li>
            <li>This dryer is extremely quiet and dries your hair much faster than any table top dryer.</li>
            <li>This one is great because I can just butt it up against the back of my office chair and pull the bonnet down over my head.   </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the outside [not the inside where I would dry my hair; it was barely warm] became so extremely hot that the plastic hood became wavy from the heat.  </li>
            <li>When I decided to buy it there was only for cheap prices compared to other,but I really couln&#x27;t bilieve the results.</li>
            <li>It feels gentle so</li>
            <li>you are a REAL Company and INVESTIGATE before you assume and accuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think its 2,000 watts.</li>
            <li>It is definitely quieter than most dryers outside of the ticking.</li>
            <li>The height is adjustable and the unit is portable on wheels, so it is easy to be moved from one room to the other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% convinced of the whole *ionic* craze, but I will say my hair is soft and shiny right out of the dryer without the standard leave-in sprays I would normally add.  </li>
            <li>And I am African American and my hair dried under an hour, I stayed a full hour + under the dryer because I was enjoying my new purchase, I also like to use the cool feature to close the cuticle after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I had one bad experience and decided I was better off doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected.. Works Magic</li>
            <li>I highly recommened this hair dryer to anyone,anyone!!!!!!I am professional hairstyling</li>
            <li>I am surprised that Amazon continues to let this product be sold on its website!</li>
            <li>I was considering getting a Pibbs dryer but decided to get a less expensive version of the Pibbs dryer and I am very pleased!!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and use 1 and 1/2 inch rollers for rollersets and it is a tight fit,</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer to replace an old bonnet style dryer that broke.</li>
            <li>So far, nobody has returned that phone call.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I noticed any improvement (thus far) in condition of hair with the Ionic power feature.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely loud, think continuous \\&quot;ticking time bomb\\</li>
            <li>The dryer was gently used (20 minutes for deep conditioner mid-week and drying rollerset on Sundays).  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of drafting a complaint with the BBB- Better Business Bureau- and Consumer affairs.  </li>
            <li>at first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair, but it does.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I bought a defective item, but my sister bought it at the same time and her dryer was doing the same thing.  </li>
            <li>Small inconveniences for a HUGE return.  </li>
            <li>or it took too long learn to rollerset faster with your wet hair right after you wash because if you have to hit up the spray bottle you&#x27;ll be drying for hours!  </li>
            <li>and I can FINALLY sit comfortably in my reading chair instead of propped up at unnatural angles on the floor/kitchen chairs trying to use the other models!!  </li>
            <li>It keeps on turning from high to low, and stays mostly on the low range, making it really difficult to dry your hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>(drop shipped from Pebco directly), (b) didn&#x27;t work out of the box (unless a hair dryer without the blow drying function is Pebco&#x27;s idea of a dryer), and (c) was a pain in the rear end to ship back.  </li>
            <li>I use the ionic technology and it made my hair extra soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>This Hair Dryer is very quiet and dry&#x27;s fast.  </li>
            <li>The hood has to be large enough to accomodate rollers (which it is), but the base (while it makes the dryer very stable) is too large to fit into my closet.  </li>
            <li>, this dryer work really well dry the hair faster when u turn on d extra power button in d middle,</li>
            <li>I leave mine out in the living room behind my favorite chair and roll it into our 3rd bedroom and close the door when company comes over.</li>
            <li>My hair gets dry in 30 minutes on high and 45 minutes on low.</li>
            <li>This Hair dryer is fast and very quiet compared to other dryers.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, course and relaxed but still delicate enough it is easily burnt and over-processed.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer, especially for other African-American Women who do their hair at home.</li>

            <li> love shopping on Amazon, my entire family, co-workers,</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHERE IT BELONGS...</li>
            <li> This dryer has a fan that distributes the air evenly instead of the cheaper table top dryers that blow air only in one spot causing breakage and leaving some parts of your hair damp.     </li>
            <li> This dryer is extremely quiet and dries your hair much faster than any table top dryer.</li>
            <li> This one is great because I can just butt it up against the back of my office chair and pull the bonnet down over my head.   </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the outside [not the inside where I would dry my hair; it was barely warm] became so extremely hot that the plastic hood became wavy from the heat.  </li>
            <li> When I decided to buy it there was only for cheap prices compared to other,but I really couln&#x27;t bilieve the results.</li>
            <li> It feels gentle so</li>
            <li> you are a REAL Company and INVESTIGATE before you assume and accuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think its 2,000 watts.</li>
            <li> It is definitely quieter than most dryers outside of the ticking.</li>
            <li> The height is adjustable and the unit is portable on wheels, so it is easy to be moved from one room to the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% convinced of the whole *ionic* craze, but I will say my hair is soft and shiny right out of the dryer without the standard leave-in sprays I would normally add.  </li>
            <li> And I am African American and my hair dried under an hour, I stayed a full hour + under the dryer because I was enjoying my new purchase, I also like to use the cool feature to close the cuticle after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I had one bad experience and decided I was better off doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.. Works Magic</li>
            <li> I highly recommened this hair dryer to anyone,anyone!!!!!!I am professional hairstyling</li>
            <li> I am surprised that Amazon continues to let this product be sold on its website!</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a Pibbs dryer but decided to get a less expensive version of the Pibbs dryer and I am very pleased!!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and use 1 and 1/2 inch rollers for rollersets and it is a tight fit,</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace an old bonnet style dryer that broke.</li>
            <li> So far, nobody has returned that phone call.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I noticed any improvement (thus far) in condition of hair with the Ionic power feature.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely loud, think continuous \\&quot;ticking time bomb\\</li>
            <li> The dryer was gently used (20 minutes for deep conditioner mid-week and drying rollerset on Sundays).  </li>
            <li> I am in the process of drafting a complaint with the BBB- Better Business Bureau- and Consumer affairs.  </li>
            <li> at first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair, but it does.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I bought a defective item, but my sister bought it at the same time and her dryer was doing the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Small inconveniences for a HUGE return.  </li>
            <li> or it took too long learn to rollerset faster with your wet hair right after you wash because if you have to hit up the spray bottle you&#x27;ll be drying for hours!  </li>
            <li> and I can FINALLY sit comfortably in my reading chair instead of propped up at unnatural angles on the floor/kitchen chairs trying to use the other models!!  </li>
            <li> It keeps on turning from high to low, and stays mostly on the low range, making it really difficult to dry your hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> (drop shipped from Pebco directly), (b) didn&#x27;t work out of the box (unless a hair dryer without the blow drying function is Pebco&#x27;s idea of a dryer), and (c) was a pain in the rear end to ship back.  </li>
            <li> I use the ionic technology and it made my hair extra soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> This Hair Dryer is very quiet and dry&#x27;s fast.  </li>
            <li> The hood has to be large enough to accomodate rollers (which it is), but the base (while it makes the dryer very stable) is too large to fit into my closet.  </li>
            <li> , this dryer work really well dry the hair faster when u turn on d extra power button in d middle,</li>
            <li> I leave mine out in the living room behind my favorite chair and roll it into our 3rd bedroom and close the door when company comes over.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry in 30 minutes on high and 45 minutes on low.</li>
            <li> This Hair dryer is fast and very quiet compared to other dryers.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, course and relaxed but still delicate enough it is easily burnt and over-processed.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer, especially for other African-American Women who do their hair at home.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in to give it a test run and the black plastic in front (above the clear hood)</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 years later (can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been that long)</li>
            <li> It dries and conditions my hair in no time flat!</li>
            <li> My deep conditioning and I can roller set and dry in about 45 mins.</li>
            <li> My daughters have thick, long hair which require large rollers.  </li>
            <li> When you rollerset your hair your hair should not be soaking wet, you have to build up speed when rollersetting so that you don&#x27;t have to use a spray bottle to keep oversaturating tha hair with water, if your hair is too wet it will never dry regardless of which dryer you use or your hair texture, I&#x27;ve been doing hair for years and getting wash and sets for years and NEVER have I had my hair soaking overly wet for a rollerset if that were the case my hair would never dry.</li>
            <li> If you are a Black person, this dryer doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as shiny as the regular dryer and if you put rollers in tightly to straighten new growth, it does nothing.</li>
            <li> I mean my hair shines regardless but it was intense.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m working on other possible storage options,</li>
            <li> When I dry my hair, I like to work on my computer.</li>
            <li> When the bell dings and it stops ... my hair is dry.   </li>
            <li> the time it takes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> So my advice to those saying their hair didn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> my hair is relaxed and dyed to cover gray, so my processed hair may dry faster than others.  </li>
            <li> I now stay under for about 75 minutes when I dry it wrapped and it takes about 45-60 mins when I roller set.  </li>
            <li> Certainly worth about $150 although I paid $139.99 + $38.49 S&amp;H (expensive shipping which we call the paradise tax) for a total of $178 and change.    </li>
            <li> I like that you can adjust the height simply by twisting the black handle and lower</li>
            <li> and I actually save money because I spend less money at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it would take about 2 hours for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s been sitting in the open behind my chair.  </li>
            <li> My hair may dry in less than an hour ...</li>
            <li> The major negative is the timer,  setting the timer powers the dryer on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other dryers that just didn&#x27;t do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I have thick African American hair and this dryer dried my hair in 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> The other knob operates the timer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dry in under 25 minutes (and not under high, uncomfortable heat), there is no waiting in line</li>
            <li> that did not have Black hair salons.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of the tabletop and soft-bonnet models within less than a year.  </li>
            <li> One negative, it is fairly large so storing it is difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my review because it seems this dryer has been getting bad reviews from those who haven&#x27;t spent much time  using it.  </li>
            <li> With this dryer it took my hair dried in about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer dried my hair faster and with no frizzing.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and people commented that that their hair dried in 30 minutes, I can&#x27;t even imagine that happening.</li>
            <li> If your normal practice is to treat your customers poorly, decieve them, Charge, and NEVER send products, and then threaten them with credit agencies and false accusations.</li>
            <li> I went from shoulder length to past bra-strap in about a year and choose to keep this length as I don&#x27;t have the patience or time for longer lengths.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I waited so long to purchase this type of dryer.  </li>
            <li> Also the dryer sucks your hair into to heating element....</li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer (somewhere else) and it dried my hair fast, now for those that say the ionic feature is crap or they don&#x27;t see a difference must be doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HAIR DRYIER!  </li>
            <li> it says professional/salon hair dryer doesn&#x27;t mean any thing, they are not made to last\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Within six months everyone of them were broken.</li>
            <li> In summary, I don&#x27;t hate it but would not have bought it if I had read the prior review about the timer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer two days ago and I have to say that this is the WORSE dryer I have ever used in my life.  </li>
            <li> NEEDLESS</li>
            <li> I hate this dryer waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I decreased by drying time by 1hr!!</li>
            <li> it scared me so badly.  </li>
            <li> I HATE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> , IT IS CRAP, IT DRIES THE HAIR</li>
            <li> , I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> What I hate is that I&#x27;m going to have to return it and spend ANOTHER $30.000!!!!</li>

            <li> I have short hair. I bought this dryer to replace an old bonnet style dryer that broke. Several things I like about it is: It has a timer on it. I set it for an hour. It also has a temperature knob. I have mine set on 60. When I dry my hair, I like to work on my computer. This one is great because I can just butt it up against the back of my office chair and pull the bonnet down over my head.   The air blows from all around the hood. It feels gentle so at first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair, but it does. It seems to kick on and off (I guess regulating the temperature while it&#x27;s drying). When the bell dings and it stops ... my hair is dry.   My hair may dry in less than an hour ... but I set it at 1 hour so I can get some work done on my computer ... Works for me!!</li>
            <li> I purchased four of these for my salon....Within six months everyone of them were broken. The dryer works good but the face shield and the stand do not last. Also the dryer sucks your hair into to heating element....</li>
            <li> I was so excited purchasing this hair dryer! I thought \\&quot;finally, I can make my hair curl!\\&quot;.    It was delivered last week (Thursday). It was very easy to put together and it looked exactly like what I was looking for.    I plugged it in to give it a test run and the black plastic in front (above the clear hood) melted! It was extremely hot to the touch.    I called the phone number that was supplied for customer service. Nobody answered, so I left a message. So far, nobody has returned that phone call.    I have to say, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and there aren&#x27;t that many African-American Hair Salons close to me. My stylist went out of business and moved back to the mainland. Not to fear though, I love taking care of my hair and often do it at home anyway. I&#x27;ve purchased hooded hair dryers before but this one is the BEST! Certainly worth about $150 although I paid $139.99 + $38.49 S&amp;H (expensive shipping which we call the paradise tax) for a total of $178 and change.    It gets very hot, just like in the salon so you need to wrap a towel around your neck to keep heat off your neck.I didn&#x27;t have any problems getting under the hood once I positioned it so that wheels go under my chair. A 4 legged chair works best. I like that you can adjust the height simply by twisting the black handle and lower/raising then tightening the handle again.     It is very quiet except for the ticking timer as others have mentioned. The bell when it goes off is extremely loud and did scare me (and my dog) when it went off, lol. I still love it though. Have used it twice, once for wrapping my hair and once for conditioning my hair, worked great both times. I don&#x27;t notice any shine from the IONIC stuff, whatever that is, but am thoroughly satisfied with how hot it gets and the time it takes to dry my hair. One negative, it is fairly large so storing it is difficult. I leave mine out in the living room behind my favorite chair and roll it into our 3rd bedroom and close the door when company comes over. I guess I could take it apart to store it since it can be put together so easily, (didn&#x27;t even need the directions when putting it together), but why bother? I highly recommend this hair dryer, especially for other African-American Women who do their hair at home.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely excellent dryer.  It is worth every penny.  Okay, you can hear the timer...  The buzzer sounds like a kitchen timer going off in your ear.  Small inconveniences for a HUGE return.  If you want, smooth, frizz-free hair and a salon quality wash and set...get this dryer.  I&#x27;ve been in the Navy for almost 8 years and have had to do (wash and set, style, etc) my hair myself.  It was a struggle until I found this dryer.  I grew up going to a hair salon in NY for a weekly wash and set.  Once I joined the Navy, I was sent to places (Guam, and Athens, GA) that did not have Black hair salons.  I&#x27;ve bought other dryers that just didn&#x27;t do the trick.  I&#x27;m currently stationed in VA Bch and decided to start going to a hair salon weekly after returning from a 7 month deployment.  I had one bad experience and decided I was better off doing my own hair.  I bought this product, and I will not go back to a hair salon unless I need my hair styled.  My weekly wash and sets I can do in the comfort of my home while I multi-task with house chores, paying bills, etc.  Truly a great product and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for a month and am pleased overall.  Ionic power seems to cut drying time with even heat distribution, cut from 90 minutes to 60.  My hair is shiny with great body, similar to when I would use tabletop hood dryer.  I can&#x27;t say I noticed any improvement (thus far) in condition of hair with the Ionic power feature.  The fan and motor are unbelievably quiet.  I have shoulder length hair and use 1 and 1/2 inch rollers for rollersets and it is a tight fit, can&#x27;t imagine getting larger rollers under the hood.    The major negative is the timer,  setting the timer powers the dryer on so you can&#x27;t avoid use of the timer.  It is extremely loud, think continuous \\&quot;ticking time bomb\\&quot; sound.  The only thing louder than the timer is the bell that goes off when your time is up.  The first time the bell went off, I was under the dryer and just about jumped out of my skin it scared me so badly.  I avoid having the bell go off while I&#x27;m under the dryer by setting the timer to 60 minutes (max allowed) and then setting my laptop alarm to go off at 50 minutes so I can turn the timer back to 60 minutes if I need more time or I can get out from under the dryer before the bell goes off.    In summary, I don&#x27;t hate it but would not have bought it if I had read the prior review about the timer.  Would not recommend if you can find similar dryer without the timer and bell.    UPDATE Nov 2009:  After six weeks of use the visor broke.  The dryer was gently used (20 minutes for deep conditioner mid-week and drying rollerset on Sundays).  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I think it is a terrific hair dryer--as good as what is used in the Salons.  I can set my hair and it comes out as good as a Salon do--saving me time and money times 2 for me and my daughter. Easy to operate.  It does take up space, which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I recently went out an purchased the Pebco I0NIC Salon Hood Hair Dryer with Wheels 2000 Watts from amazon.com and it is great!    It works well and dries the hair quickly. I have thick hair and it would take about 2 hours for it to dry completely. With this dryer it took my hair dried in about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m moving to place where there aren&#x27;t many african-american salons and stylist, so i figured i&#x27;ll be doing my own hair quite a bit. so i decided to purchase this dryer and I love it. My hair gets dry in 30 minutes on high and 45 minutes on low. I absolutly love it! I sent my blow dryer packing after using this the first time. what i love the most is that it has two fan speed settings, high and low and you can adjust the heat setting to whatever is comfortable for you because it does get as hot as the dryers in salons. the height is adjustable, and the hood is large enough to fit even your larges rollers comfortably. it comes in three peaces and very easy to assamble. I didn&#x27;t even look at the directions when i assembled mine and best of all, it&#x27;s QUIET.</li>
            <li> I have to edit my first review on this product!  Sorry to say DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HAIR DRYIER!  It stopped working and I only had it for four months before it burned out!  Then to try and return it to Beauty Genesis was a pure JOKE!  I hate this dryer waste of money!  Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER! Plus the manufacturer that makes this dryer,  I found out later had a recall as this model has defects as they had a recall on over 20,000 hair dryers back  in 2000! Oh and I must not forget to mention Beauty Genesis (amazon dealer that I made the purchase with) had the nerve to tell me \\&quot;just becasue it says professional/salon hair dryer doesn&#x27;t mean any thing, they are not made to last\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I just bought the Pebco 2500 for my wife, who has wanted a drying hood at home for years.  This piece of garbage (a) was shipped in packaging that made it looked used (drop shipped from Pebco directly), (b) didn&#x27;t work out of the box (unless a hair dryer without the blow drying function is Pebco&#x27;s idea of a dryer), and (c) was a pain in the rear end to ship back.  Honestly, this company should be ashamed of its products.  I could make a better dryer myself with a screwdriver and a trip to Home DEpot.</li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer (somewhere else) and it dried my hair fast, now for those that say the ionic feature is crap or they don&#x27;t see a difference must be doing something wrong. My hair was sooo shiny it made no sense. And I am African American and my hair dried under an hour, I stayed a full hour + under the dryer because I was enjoying my new purchase, I also like to use the cool feature to close the cuticle after my hair is dry. This dryer is fab, and I def. saw a difference using the ionic button my hair has never been this shiny after a rollerset I mean my hair shines regardless but it was intense. When you rollerset your hair your hair should not be soaking wet, you have to build up speed when rollersetting so that you don&#x27;t have to use a spray bottle to keep oversaturating tha hair with water, if your hair is too wet it will never dry regardless of which dryer you use or your hair texture, I&#x27;ve been doing hair for years and getting wash and sets for years and NEVER have I had my hair soaking overly wet for a rollerset if that were the case my hair would never dry. So my advice to those saying their hair didn&#x27;t dry or it took too long learn to rollerset faster with your wet hair right after you wash because if you have to hit up the spray bottle you&#x27;ll be drying for hours!  Over all this is a great dryer, AND also all salon hooded dryers are large!</li>
            <li> I have thick African American hair and this dryer dried my hair in 25 minutes. I use the ionic technology and it made my hair extra soft and shiney. This dryer is very quiet and makes almost no noise. I love this dryer and think that everyone should have one!!!!! I don&#x27;t know what I have been doing all this time without it...</li>
            <li> I am in the process of drafting a complaint with the BBB- Better Business Bureau- and Consumer affairs.  not to mention my blog on google.  If your normal practice is to treat your customers poorly, decieve them, Charge, and NEVER send products, and then threaten them with credit agencies and false accusations. I will expose you for the savages that you are.- NEVER IN LIFE THREATHEN ME AGAIN!  The internet is full of profitable, HONEST, thriving beauty suppliers, -AMAZON should never, EVER accept this type of behavior from it&#x27;s SELLERs.- UNACCEPTABLE!!! I was charged , and then rightfully -refunded I NEVER received my product.- PERIOD -Pretend you are a REAL Company and INVESTIGATE before you assume and accuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love shopping on Amazon, my entire family, co-workers, Friends shop on AMAZON, everyone will know NOT to shop and purchase from your company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month now and so far it works great!  I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of the tabletop and soft-bonnet models within less than a year.  At $40+ each, I wish I would have just purchased this one to start with and saved my money and the aggrevation.  I&#x27;m not 100% convinced of the whole *ionic* craze, but I will say my hair is soft and shiny right out of the dryer without the standard leave-in sprays I would normally add.  My hair is long, course and relaxed but still delicate enough it is easily burnt and over-processed.  This dryer has me done in 50-60 min tops, curls are set and last for days and I can FINALLY sit comfortably in my reading chair instead of propped up at unnatural angles on the floor/kitchen chairs trying to use the other models!!  (My aging back appreciates this let me tell you!)  My only complaint is that it is bigger than I expected.  The hood has to be large enough to accomodate rollers (which it is), but the base (while it makes the dryer very stable) is too large to fit into my closet.  I was hoping to roll the dryer into my closet when not in use but so far it&#x27;s been sitting in the open behind my chair.  This is not my preference and I&#x27;m working on other possible storage options, but I&#x27;d still recommend this dryer and would easily purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is efficient and  quiet.I&#x27;ve always used tabletop hairdryers and find the portability of this dryer a great plus.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t review what I have not received.  Its 30 days later and I am still waiting on this product that should have been here two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer based on the great reviews I&#x27;ve read and I have an ionic hand dryer that works well, so I figured the hood dryer would be just as good. Not so! If you are a Black person, this dryer doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as shiny as the regular dryer and if you put rollers in tightly to straighten new growth, it does nothing. It definitely dries faster, but the way the dryer is assembled, you cannot adjust the hood so you are sitting with your head back and it can be a strain on the neck. Also, this dryer makes a ticking sound and when the timer finished the ticking continued for a minute even after I unplugged it. It is definitely quieter than most dryers outside of the ticking.</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS PRODUCT.  BOUGHT IT IN MARCH 2014.  CONSIDERED RETURNING IT AT THE TIME BECAUSE IT JUST DID NOT SEEM STURDY ENOUGH FOR THE $222.60 I PAID FOR IT, BUT DECIDED TO KEEP IT.  IN JULY THE TIMER KNOB BROKE.  THEY ASKED ME TO SEND A PIX, SO I SENT THE PIX ON  7/24/14, AFTER NUMEROUS E-MAILS FROM ME ON 9/10/14 THEY ASKED FOR ANOTHER PIX AND THEY FINALLY REPLIED THAT THEY WANTED A $25.00 MONEY ORDER AND THEY WOULD SEND ME A REPL PART.  I OPTED NOT TO DO THAT AFTER SPEDINGING $222.60 FOR THE DRYER TO BEGIN WITH AND USED A PLIERS TO TURN THE KNOB WHENEVER I USED IT.  IT IS NOW 5/21/15 AND THE ON/OFF SWITCH NOT ONLY BROKE BUT THE PARTS INSIDE THE ON/OFF SWITCH FELL APART.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I PUT THE DRYER ON THE CURB AND THE GARBAGE MEN TOOK IT AWAY THIS MORNING.  EXACTLY WHERE IT BELONGS... THE DUMP!!!  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT IS CRAP, IT DRIES THE HAIR BUT WHO HAS OVER $200.00 TO SPEND ON A DRYER EVERY YEAR.</li>
            <li> This Hair Dryer is very quiet and dry&#x27;s fast.  I am sorry I waited so long to purchase this type of dryer.  The Pebco Ionic Salon Hood Hair Dryer with wheels 2000 Watts is Great!!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered it to use while in Iraq.  I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> 7/18/16 update:  My dryer is still going strong! I originally posted in January 2008 as a New Years resolution for better hair. I&#x27;ve now owned for over 8 years and still the same results as day 1.   12/9/12 update:  I&#x27;m updating my review because it seems this dryer has been getting bad reviews from those who haven&#x27;t spent much time  using it.  Hopefully the quality hasn&#x27;t declined since I purchased it about this time in 2008.  For me it STILL works flawlessly.  My hair is longer now than it was back then.  I went from shoulder length to past bra-strap in about a year and choose to keep this length as I don&#x27;t have the patience or time for longer lengths.  Although I am African American my hair is relaxed and dyed to cover gray, so my processed hair may dry faster than others.  I now stay under for about 75 minutes when I dry it wrapped and it takes about 45-60 mins when I roller set.  Either way you&#x27;ll need a hair net cause you&#x27;ll hear your hair going into the fan.  I did not purchase online however so I can not rate the resellers for this product.  I just wanted to give some hope to those of us who cannot afford Pibbs dryers.  This is really a very good dryer and I have owned it for about 4 years.  My goal then was to grow longer, healthier hair by taking care of it like only I could and this helped me do that.  Well worth my investment.  END OF UPDATE  I love this dryer! I&#x27;m dry in under 25 minutes (and not under high, uncomfortable heat), there is no waiting in line and I don&#x27;t have to rush to the salon after work or on a precious Saturday!  I love being in control of my beauty and hair health (in my salon I often felt rushed and lost precious hairs). It has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li> This Hair dryer is fast and very quiet compared to other dryers.When I decided to buy it there was only for cheap prices compared to other,but I really couln&#x27;t bilieve the results.This hair dryer dried my hair faster and with no frizzing.I highly recommened this hair dryer to anyone,anyone!!!!!!I am professional hairstyling and I compared to the more expensive dryer.i can&#x27;t say more about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer two days ago and I have to say that this is the WORSE dryer I have ever used in my life.  I was under the dryer for over an hour and my hair was still damp! I read the reviews, and people commented that that their hair dried in 30 minutes, I can&#x27;t even imagine that happening. It feels like someone is blowing on your hair, that&#x27;s how powerful that dryer is.  I really don&#x27;t think its 2,000 watts. It keeps on turning from high to low, and stays mostly on the low range, making it really difficult to dry your hair quickly and efficiently. At first I thought I bought a defective item, but my sister bought it at the same time and her dryer was doing the same thing.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! Save your money!! It says free shipping, but its not, when you put it in your cart you pay like $30 for shipping and its comes up to like $164.00.  What I hate is that I&#x27;m going to have to return it and spend ANOTHER $30.000!!!! Viewers BEWARE look else where for a dryer.</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a Pibbs dryer but decided to get a less expensive version of the Pibbs dryer and I am very pleased!! It dries and conditions my hair in no time flat! I love it. I would recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 years later (can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been that long) I&#x27;m STILL in love.. My hair is in great condition and I contribute it to my dryer... My deep conditioning and I can roller set and dry in about 45 mins. I would buy this dryer all over again</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews and did a lot of research before purchasing this dryer. Originally I was looking at a Pibbs but the owner of the beauty supply distribution store I bought this at (which they carry both) told me that most of the local salons buy this one instead (Pibbs) and that they all love it. He even told me that if I don&#x27;t like it I could return it within 30 days without a problem.     I have been using it for a month now and it is the best dryer I have ever had. It is so quiet I can even talk on the phone (without having to yell) while under this dryer. It dries my hair evenly and very quickly without any damage to my hair. This dryer has a fan that distributes the air evenly instead of the cheaper table top dryers that blow air only in one spot causing breakage and leaving some parts of your hair damp.     The end result is that I end up with hair just like at the salon and I actually save money because I spend less money at the hair salon. This dryer more than paid for itself after a month. I love the fact that I can use it with any chair because I can wheel the dryer wherever I want around the house and I not restricted as to where to sit. I save time too because I can do some work from home while drying my hair. I cannot do that at the salon or even with a table top dryer because I was restricted about where to sit.     Bottom line, it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> Please do not purchase this Pebco Ionic Salon Hood Hair Dryer!  I certainly wish I had not!  The first time I used it, the outside [not the inside where I would dry my hair; it was barely warm] became so extremely hot that the plastic hood became wavy from the heat.  It might have caught on fire had I not unplugged it quickly.      Then, to get my money back, I had to ship it back by a way it could be tracked --$27.00 that I was not reimbursed!  So not only did I get a defective product, but I also lost the shopping cost to return it.  A TOTAL RIPOFF.  I am surprised that Amazon continues to let this product be sold on its website!</li>
            <li> Very nice, quiet &amp;yge shippment was fast .best dryer ever. every salon should have one. My clients are impressed. What i love most is that the hair is left very soft.</li>
            <li> This dryer is extremely quiet and dries your hair much faster than any table top dryer. I decreased by drying time by 1hr!!</li>
            <li> This dryer is a pleasure to have in the home.  My daughters have thick, long hair which require large rollers.  The hood lifts up and easily accommodates the head.  The height is adjustable and the unit is portable on wheels, so it is easy to be moved from one room to the other.  Best of all,  the heat does not burn;  there is an adjustable heat setting which gives you the temperature you want.  The other knob operates the timer.  The results given by this dryer compares to that of a salon.</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer great price, this dryer work really well dry the hair faster when u turn on d extra power button in d middle, I luv it n delivery was within 2 days I was surprise how quickly I received it.</li>
