    <ol>
            <li>its the perfect shade of gold.</li>
            <li>I was so happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done both and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The response was prompt and very nice, and they sent another one to me without question.</li>
            <li>* love thank you for the greatest  pump&lt;br /&gt;it works great</li>
            <li>on my top five nail polish list... gold shimmering perfect</li>
            <li>So all in all, great product and great service :)</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be good with just one coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Tried forever to find this kind of gold</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping for a nice gold color but its not.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice gold and it also contains some silver glitter, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li>and so must I say it is awesome thanks</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting that, but it still looked nice on my nails.</li>
            <li>For the most part it looks just like the color of the bottle.</li>
            <li>and i also love it</li>
            <li>I used this on a real gold ring to cover the stones that I didn&#x27;t like and it looks great now</li>
            <li>i had to put so many coats on that it still smudged after having it on for a day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color and would probably look even better on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also very quick and the packaging was very reliable.</li>
            <li>BUT, if you want to bling it with some silver nail art or gems, it&#x27;s a really nice \\&quot;background\\&quot; for such a thing.</li>
            <li>This polish is quite nice actually.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy Gold polish for a while and haven&#x27;t ever been able to find one in the store, if I did come across it, it was always barely a color.</li>
            <li>This was exactly the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Nice color fast service just did not last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought it was more of a solid gold color, but it had silver sparkles in it.</li>
            <li>Color is pretty.</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast and it dries well.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars because you have to put 2 or 3 coats on for it to be a solid bubbly gold, pretty color though could be used as at top coat</li>
            <li>I expected this product to be more of a gold than a yellow color.</li>
            <li>Very gold, with tiny silver glitter in it.</li>
            <li>it is super super thin</li>
            <li>i use it to create designes on nails instead of just a flat complete nail color.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Insofar as customer service goes, the nail polish didn&#x27;t arrive initially; I waited a bit beyond the due date and then contacted the seller.</li>
            <li> Very gold and subtly sparkly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin, and when I got it I compared it to a dollar-store yellow I&#x27;d bought and it was basically the exact same color and consistency.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from China Glaze.</li>
            <li> Soft gold with a hint of shimmer, not too gaudy or flashy.</li>
            <li> It applies quite thin so, you&#x27;re gonna have to get a generous amount on the brush so it will spread equally.</li>
            <li> like always sorry</li>
            <li> --it makes my nails look sick.</li>
            <li> The color is so horrible</li>

            <li> Tried forever to find this kind of gold I was so happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a nice gold color but its not. Its yellow and makes my nails look stained. I think its gross looking personally.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like gold polish because it looks crappy against my skin (olive undertone), but this looked pretty enough to try. I&#x27;m glad I did, because it&#x27;s great. Soft gold with a hint of shimmer, not too gaudy or flashy. BUT, if you want to bling it with some silver nail art or gems, it&#x27;s a really nice \\&quot;background\\&quot; for such a thing. I&#x27;ve done both and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insofar as customer service goes, the nail polish didn&#x27;t arrive initially; I waited a bit beyond the due date and then contacted the seller.
