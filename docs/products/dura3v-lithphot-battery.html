            <li> I bought this as a replacement battery for my rangefinder.  I keep the spare in my golf bag.so it&#x27;s handy</li>
            <li> Everything was perfectly fine with this order.  The only thing I thought was a little unusual was the note enclosed which read, \\&quot;We would be grateful if you leave us 5-STAR positive feedback on our profile...\\&quot;  I have explained to them that I only give 5 stars when the vendor has done something unusually helpful and gone \\&quot;above and beyond\\&quot; normal expectations.  These guys did fine; they delivered as promised and on time.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with 4 stars, but if everybody gets five, how do you reward superior or exemplary performance?</li>
            <li> This product worked as expected. I installed the battery in my dogs bark collar and she received a shock when she barked.</li>
            <li> Bought this item on the if - come to see if I could resurrect my GPS.  The shipment was unbelievably fast.  The kit had every thing I needed and the video (sent on disk) explained everything.  I changed the battery in less than 10 minutes. The GPS works like new.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, and will be getting more from Ocean Discount in the very near future. I have lots of different batteries to change out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a defective battery that I paid 4 times as much for at Radio Shack.  Despite it&#x27;s lower cost, it works perfectly.  I know where I am getting my specialty batteries from now on!</li>
            <li> Typical Duracell battery. Nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Used in rangefinder and only used the rangefinder once and went to use it the next day and the battery was dead.  Put other battery in and the secound battery only lasted one day.</li>
            <li> Bought this battery for my son&#x27;s golf range finder.  The price was 1/2 of the price at Target, but the battery didn&#x27;t last even 1/2 as long.  I won&#x27;t waste my money on these batteries in the future.</li>

            <li> It was as if I purchased used batteries.  They went dead in just a few uses on the golf course in my Nikon LR550 Golf Range Finder.</li>
            <li> These were hard to find in the stores; we use these for our security system. I was surprised at how quick the order came. Great service and easy quick ordering process..</li>

            <li> They came packaged loosely in a coin envelope (2 in 1 envelope), nothing to protect the contacts of the batteries. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, as I bought them for spares. They look new but packaging could be a lot better.</li>
            <li> WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A BATTERY? THEY HAD LONG SHELF LIFE BEFORE EXPIRATION, FULLY CHARGED AND THE SHIPPING WAS FAST. COULDN&#x27;T FIND CHEAPER. WILL BY MORE.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these batteries.  They were priced right, and work great.  I will buy again when I need more.</li>
            <li> The battery actually works in the device for which it was intended! One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight</li>
            <li> Good battery at a good price. Make sure you double check the numbers, there are so many different batteries these days.</li>
            <li> It is just what I ordered and for the price it was great.&lt;br /&gt;what can I say but it is a battery and it works</li>
            <li> Bought used but works just fine.  The camera battery seems to keep a full charge according to my camera indicator.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pair of Duracell CR2 batteries a few months ago for my Kodak camera. As I don&#x27;t use the camera every day, I often pop the batteries out for a week at a time, and leave them in my backpack. Every time I put them back in and power up the camera, it still shows 100% battery life! I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier with the power and quality of the batteries. I highly recommend them!</li>
