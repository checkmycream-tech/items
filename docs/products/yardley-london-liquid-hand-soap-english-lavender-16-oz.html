            <li>Just by chance I happened to use this liquid soap in a restaurant&#x27;s rest room and fell in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li>But I use it anyway because I just love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>My mom fell in love with this soap at Carabba&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a number of years and while it performs it&#x27;s primary function, cleaning your hands well, it also has a nice fragrance which is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this stuff when I discovered it in the bathroom at Outback Steakhouse.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I just love this stuff...buy it in bulk for your bathrooms...</li>
            <li>I love Yardley and I love lavender.</li>
            <li>This liquid soap is lovely and I wish I could by it in more stores.</li>
            <li>There are way better products in the marketplace...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yardley is pricey, but I love it anyway.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite liquid hand soaps.</li>
            <li>Love the soap, but then again i love lavender smell.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and used it for years until I read about the antibacterial chemical, triclosan, which is one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is just a lovely product.</li>
            <li>Love the classic smell of lavender and this product is great.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it seems to be decently moisturizing.</li>
            <li>We first used this hand soap at Carrabba&#x27;s and loved the scent.  </li>
            <li>It left my hands clean but smelling wonderful for awhile afterwards.</li>
            <li>Now I can be happy at home any old time.  </li>
            <li>This soap leaves your hands soft and smelling so good, I you love the smell of lavender you will love this soap</li>
            <li>best way to remove germs from your hands and prevent the spread of illness is to use warm water, lather well, and rub your hands together for at least twenty seconds to create plenty of friction.</li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the soap will work fine and smells great, so no complaints necessary.</li>
            <li>It used to be available locally in a drugstore chain but is no longer stocked, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>THE SAME SOAP USED IN THE OUTBACK RESTURANTS, GREAT FRAGRANT &amp; ANTIBACTERAL.</li>
            <li>they did have it available.</li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance which I don&#x27;t personally think has changed, as some reviewers have indicated.  </li>
            <li>to use, nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s antibacterial, has a clean, pleasant odor and does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>You have to experience the unique aroma for yourself.</li>
            <li>Yardley fragrance is outstanding, leathers great with just a small amount in your hand, hands are clean and feel moisturizer added.</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful fragrant English Lavender scent that improves the smell of the whole house.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice smell and leaves your hands soft after washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin, as some harsher soaps do, and leaves a nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff for sentimental reasons, however it does smell amazing!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, I will be buying more for years to come.</li>
            <li>I buy online six bottles at a time, which lasts me a good long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than buying a new bottle every time I run out of soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap b/c of the strong lavender scent that is left on my hands after I use it.</li>
            <li>far and away my favorite smelling soap of all time.</li>
            <li>will try the regular kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably some kind of moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve used similar products before that did not have this undesirable quality.  </li>
            <li>I used to like the old original Yardley, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to have the same smell, but it was still nice.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is antibacterial as well as moisturizing (although my hands feel kind of dry after using this soap).</li>
            <li>I was so darned happy to find this on Amazon, since I&#x27;ve been looking in all the local big box stores to no avail.  </li>
            <li>It is so powerful you only need a small drop or two and the fragrance is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Took a while to find this, but if you like English lavender hand soap and the refreshing smell, this is the deal</li>
            <li>I definitely will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I think I first stumbled across this in the ladies room at Carrabbas restaurant.</li>
            <li>First used it at a restaurant and had to have</li>
            <li>I follow with an application of my favorite brushed-on shaving soap for the second pass.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love that it has such a &#x27;real&#x27; lavender scent and is not only a soft soap that gets your hands clean, but leaves them with a lovely lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>Yardley English Lavender Antibacterial Liquid Hand Soap is good quality, lathers decently, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, rinses well, and smells like true</li>
            <li>It is very thick, cleans well, softens hands and smells so great.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this item for 4 years and absolutely love(d) it...</li>
            <li>The soap leaves your hands soft and smelling delightfully fresh like lavendar.</li>
            <li>I really wish Yardley would remove the triclosan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The residual leftover feeling of whatever-it-is that gets on my hands really reeks, as well.  </li>
            <li>a fantastic smell that lasts a long time without being overpowering or chemically</li>
            <li>My wife and I recently celebrated her Birthday, we visited Red Lobster</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Good but not Great...</li>
            <li>Unlike its cousin, the body wash, this product does not suds up a lot; however, the scent is just a strong while I am using it and lasts about half an hour.</li>
            <li>First, it smells artificial and not like the pleasant scent of  lavender</li>
            <li>Exact same product as at Carrabbas.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this soap was in Carrabbas Italian Grill&#x27;s restroom and looked all over for it and could not find.</li>
            <li>Like most other reviewers, I can no longer find this in local retail outlets.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced for a product not found at any local stores.</li>
            <li>last bottle I opened is much thinner, not as moisturizing, and not as soapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I surprised her for Mother&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li>so i switch between this and soft soaps lavendar scent.  </li>
            <li>Because it does not form a thick lather, you can easily see to square off sideburns,</li>
            <li>The price per bottle through Amazon is much less than it used to be in the store, and the shipping charge is very reasonable, particularly for multiple bottles.</li>
            <li>My order not only arrived complete, but much sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li>, it is a little thicker and less watery than most liquid soap, so</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than buying a new bottle every time I run out of soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap b/c of the strong lavender scent that is left on my hands after I use it.</li>
            <li> far and away my favorite smelling soap of all time.</li>
            <li> will try the regular kind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably some kind of moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve used similar products before that did not have this undesirable quality.  </li>
            <li> I used to like the old original Yardley, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to have the same smell, but it was still nice.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is antibacterial as well as moisturizing (although my hands feel kind of dry after using this soap).</li>
            <li> I was so darned happy to find this on Amazon, since I&#x27;ve been looking in all the local big box stores to no avail.  </li>
            <li> It is so powerful you only need a small drop or two and the fragrance is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Took a while to find this, but if you like English lavender hand soap and the refreshing smell, this is the deal</li>
            <li> I definitely will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I think I first stumbled across this in the ladies room at Carrabbas restaurant.</li>
            <li> First used it at a restaurant and had to have</li>
            <li> I follow with an application of my favorite brushed-on shaving soap for the second pass.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love that it has such a &#x27;real&#x27; lavender scent and is not only a soft soap that gets your hands clean, but leaves them with a lovely lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> Yardley English Lavender Antibacterial Liquid Hand Soap is good quality, lathers decently, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, rinses well, and smells like true</li>
            <li> It is very thick, cleans well, softens hands and smells so great.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this item for 4 years and absolutely love(d) it...</li>
            <li> The soap leaves your hands soft and smelling delightfully fresh like lavendar.</li>
            <li> I really wish Yardley would remove the triclosan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The residual leftover feeling of whatever-it-is that gets on my hands really reeks, as well.  </li>
            <li> a fantastic smell that lasts a long time without being overpowering or chemically</li>
            <li> My wife and I recently celebrated her Birthday, we visited Red Lobster</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good but not Great...</li>
            <li> Unlike its cousin, the body wash, this product does not suds up a lot; however, the scent is just a strong while I am using it and lasts about half an hour.</li>
            <li> First, it smells artificial and not like the pleasant scent of  lavender</li>
            <li> Exact same product as at Carrabbas.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried this soap was in Carrabbas Italian Grill&#x27;s restroom and looked all over for it and could not find.</li>
            <li> Like most other reviewers, I can no longer find this in local retail outlets.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced for a product not found at any local stores.</li>
            <li> last bottle I opened is much thinner, not as moisturizing, and not as soapy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I surprised her for Mother&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li> so i switch between this and soft soaps lavendar scent.  </li>
            <li> Because it does not form a thick lather, you can easily see to square off sideburns,</li>
            <li> The price per bottle through Amazon is much less than it used to be in the store, and the shipping charge is very reasonable, particularly for multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> My order not only arrived complete, but much sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> , it is a little thicker and less watery than most liquid soap, so</li>
            <li> I will only ever buy this soap as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Will go a long way for usage.</li>
            <li> The product itself even looks strangely opaque, like</li>
            <li> It does not seem to dry my hands out either.</li>
            <li> Second, after I use it, my hands feel filmy like they&#x27;re still not clean.  </li>
            <li> One of the things that I use it for is &amp;#34;first pass&amp;#34; wet shaving, with the grain of my whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I apply it on wet skin with my hands.  </li>
            <li> The soap is not available locally.</li>
            <li> Not much to report other than it the product came just as described, packaged well, and in the 3-4 business day period it promised.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lavender soaps, but they just don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> But the price tag makes me think of buying some other product.</li>
            <li> some extra gunk has been added that you usually see in anti-bacterial liquid hand soaps.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!  </li>
            <li> This was an amazon.com purchase since I have a hard time finding the product in local stores.</li>
            <li> Only negative is price.</li>
            <li> I feel that because of the anti-bacterial, I have much less skin &amp;#34;breaking out&amp;#34; and</li>
            <li> so when the small container is almost empty, I can refill it with the soap in this container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a huge fan of scented soap, but I try to keep some of this in the guest bathroom; if I&#x27;m going to have scented soap around, this is the one I&#x27;m going to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not exactly sure</li>
            <li> I have taken it on trips and even used it for small food stains on clothing.</li>
            <li> There was hardly any fragrance to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Alas</li>
            <li> This is an unnecessary addition to the soap and helps contribute to the antibiotic-resistant infections rife in this country.  </li>
            <li> its expensive</li>
            <li> slow-healing nicks, when I get a bit careless with the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I cannot recommend this product, for two reasons.  </li>
            <li> It truly stinks up my bathroom and hands, and I cannot fathom how anyone can find its scent</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed with the change.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> far and away my favorite smelling soap of all time. a fantastic smell that lasts a long time without being overpowering or chemically</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the soap will work fine and smells great, so no complaints necessary. Will go a long way for usage. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Exact same product as at Carrabbas.  I have tried other lavender soaps, but they just don&#x27;t compare.  Only negative is price.</li>
            <li> Ordered because of the Soap at Carrabas. However not the same Scent. Good but not Great...</li>
            <li> Yardley of London makes the best smelling anti-bacterial hand soap ever! Whenever I wash my hands with the lavender soap, I feel refreshed and renewed. The scent brightens my day. This was an amazon.com purchase since I have a hard time finding the product in local stores. K</li>
            <li> I remember this yardley lavender as a kid, loved it then and love it now.  Great Stuff.</li>
            <li> In terms of quality, this product is really good. But the price tag makes me think of buying some other product.</li>
            <li> I deserve a pleasant smelling, effective, antibacterial hand wash experience . . . so do you . . . and this is it for me!  Not all fussy, great scent for men and women!</li>
            <li> I love this hand soap.  I used it over a friend&#x27;s house and had to buy some for my own.  I just love the scent.  I bought the body wash also.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves your hands soft and smelling so good, I you love the smell of lavender you will love this soap</li>
            <li> My wife and I recently celebrated her Birthday, we visited Red Lobster and I&#x27;m not exactly sure if this is something they do for their customers, however, inside both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rest rooms we were offered a choice of either their generic soap on the wall or the bottle of English Lavendar!  My granddad and grandmother were from Essex and Crowbrough and this soap is the only stuff they had around the house!  It is a sweet reminder and a great scent!  I love this stuff for sentimental reasons, however it does smell amazing!  www.richardpeacock.us</li>
            <li> Took a while to find this, but if you like English lavender hand soap and the refreshing smell, this is the deal</li>
            <li> Oh man, the smell of this stuff is killer good.  Then how it makes your hands feel after you wash them.  HEAVEN.  Highly recommended, I will be buying more for years to come.</li>
            <li> This soap is great!  The service of the company is great as well.  My order not only arrived complete, but much sooner than I expected.  Completely satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This is the hand soap my father always used, and I believe my grandfather before him, and for my money it&#x27;s still the best scented soap out there -- clean and pleasant and traditional, without being frilly or overpowering. I&#x27;m not generally a huge fan of scented soap, but I try to keep some of this in the guest bathroom; if I&#x27;m going to have scented soap around, this is the one I&#x27;m going to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally you&#x27;ll find this same soap used in Outback Steakhouse bathrooms. I imagine they like it for the same reason I do -- a soap *everyone* likes, pleasantly impressive without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great clean scent. Reasonably priced for a product not found at any local stores. Have been looking for years locally with no luck.</li>
            <li> Not much to report other than it the product came just as described, packaged well, and in the 3-4 business day period it promised.</li>
            <li> Just by chance I happened to use this liquid soap in a restaurant&#x27;s rest room and fell in love with it all over again. I had to have it!  It smells wonderful! I like the fact that it is antibacterial as well as moisturizing (although my hands feel kind of dry after using this soap). But I use it anyway because I just love the scent. Great job Yardley!&lt;br /&gt;The items arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  No problems there. I definitely will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This liquid hand soap is the best of the best. It cleans very well, is antibacterial yet very easy on the hands, and has a great lavender fragrance. It used to be available locally in a drugstore chain but is no longer stocked, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. The price per bottle through Amazon is much less than it used to be in the store, and the shipping charge is very reasonable, particularly for multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> THis is the best smelling soap ever. IT&#x27;s non-drying, kills germs, smells good and I&#x27;m very happy I found it, this will be at every bathroom sink. I just wish they made this in lotion. This scent is nice and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this item for 4 years and absolutely love(d) it... great scent &amp; moisturizing while antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;The last bottle I opened is much thinner, not as moisturizing, and not as soapy.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it but I am disappointed with the change.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels luxurious. Very happy,</li>
            <li> I discovered this soap in a ladies room at a restaurant and I was determined to find it to bring back to my home.  The smell of lavender is irresistable!</li>
            <li> We first used this hand soap at Carrabba&#x27;s and loved the scent.  Now we have it at home and it&#x27;s like going out every time we use it.</li>
            <li> This is great lavender scented soap. I use it everywhere in my house and also have it at work</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It smells great, but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li> My boy friend had been looking for this product for years and I was extremely thrilled when I found it and will be placing another order this year</li>
            <li> I bought this container to refill my smaller container. It is the same soap in the smaller container so when the small container is almost empty, I can refill it with the soap in this container. It has a beautiful fragrant English Lavender scent that improves the smell of the whole house.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Love the way this smells!&lt;br /&gt;And the fact it is antibacterial makes it a must to have!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Discovered this handsoap at a restaurant and have been using it ever since. It has a lingering wonderful fragrance and the cost is quite affordable.</li>
            <li> My mom fell in love with this soap at Carabba&#x27;s so I surprised her for Mother&#x27;s Day.  The soap leaves your hands soft and smelling delightfully fresh like lavendar.</li>
            <li> Love the classic smell of lavender and this product is great. would use it always if I can. keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> This product has been one of my favorites for years.  The sent is so nice</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and while it performs it&#x27;s primary function, cleaning your hands well, it also has a nice fragrance which is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Yardley English Lavender Antibacterial Liquid Hand Soap is good quality, lathers decently, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin, rinses well, and smells like true lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does contain an antibacterial chemical, triclosan, which infection control experts say should not be used routinely and which may be harmful to the environment so I can only give it 4 stars.  I really wish Yardley would remove the triclosan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to remove germs from your hands and prevent the spread of illness is to use warm water, lather well, and rub your hands together for at least twenty seconds to create plenty of friction.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this stuff when I discovered it in the bathroom at Outback Steakhouse.  I looked around locally but never had any luck finding anything but the bar form.  Finally found the liquid on here and I love it.  One thing to note, it is a little thicker and less watery than most liquid soap, so some decorator pumps may have an issue with it.  The smell is great and it seems to be decently moisturizing.</li>
            <li> THE BEST LIQUID SOAP WE HAVE EVER USED. THE SAME SOAP USED IN THE OUTBACK RESTURANTS, GREAT FRAGRANT &amp; ANTIBACTERAL.</li>
            <li> There was hardly any fragrance to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will try the regular kind, I&#x27;m wondering if the antibacterial is what&#x27;s causing this issue?</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff...buy it in bulk for your bathrooms...you can always tell when someone has washed their hands!</li>
            <li> I bought this to refill my yardley hand soap pump bottle. It&#x27;s a lot better than buying a new bottle every time I run out of soap.</li>
            <li> I love Yardley and I love lavender. This liquid soap is lovely and I wish I could by it in more stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I cannot recommend this product, for two reasons.  First, it smells artificial and not like the pleasant scent of  lavender I know of.  Second, after I use it, my hands feel filmy like they&#x27;re still not clean.  It&#x27;s probably some kind of moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve used similar products before that did not have this undesirable quality.  The product itself even looks strangely opaque, like some extra gunk has been added that you usually see in anti-bacterial liquid hand soaps.  Not going to buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;m downgrading this awful-smelling gunk to one star.  It truly stinks up my bathroom and hands, and I cannot fathom how anyone can find its scent (I&#x27;m being generous, here) even mildly pleasant.  I have to use another scented soap to get the &#x27;stank&#x27; off.  The residual leftover feeling of whatever-it-is that gets on my hands really reeks, as well.  Horrible stuff.  There are way better products in the marketplace...way way better!</li>
            <li> I love this soap b/c of the strong lavender scent that is left on my hands after I use it. It reminds me of being at my Grandma&#x27;s and the lavender scent she had everywhere. It lathers nicely and I keep it in the bathrooms and kitchen.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a good price. It is so powerful you only need a small drop or two and the fragrance is wonderful.  I have taken it on trips and even used it for small food stains on clothing.</li>
            <li> Seems to be cut with water or something</li>
            <li> I will only ever buy this soap as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Just wish I could find refills in stores locally.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of summer visitors every year and stock all of my soap dispensers with this product.  It&#x27;s antibacterial, has a clean, pleasant odor and does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li> Husband washed hands with this at a Steak House and loved it.  They gave us a bottle.  We have been hooked ever since.  Could not believe I found a way to purchase this online.  Thank you, Amazon, for offering this product.  It is excellent!</li>
            <li> I think I first stumbled across this in the ladies room at Carrabbas restaurant. It left my hands clean but smelling wonderful for awhile afterwards. So I ordered a case of it! I love that it has such a &#x27;real&#x27; lavender scent and is not only a soft soap that gets your hands clean, but leaves them with a lovely lavender fragrance. It does not seem to dry my hands out either.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. I&#x27;ve used it for years</li>
            <li> Love this soap. its expensive so i switch between this and soft soaps lavendar scent.  i put this in our guest bathroom and often people say how nice our soap smells!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this soap was in Carrabbas Italian Grill&#x27;s restroom and looked all over for it and could not find. Then checked with Amazon, and YES!!! they did have it available. Ordered it and it is wonderful. It is very thick, cleans well, softens hands and smells so great. This is the second time I have purchased this soap and will continue to buy it thru Amazon until I can find it locally. I recommend  you get a pump bottle to continually refill, works best that way.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid hand soap. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unlike its cousin, the body wash, this product does not suds up a lot; however, the scent is just a strong while I am using it and lasts about half an hour. It does not come with a pump. (I purchased the pump version too in hopes of using the pump on this one. Alas, the pump did not fit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yardley is pricey, but I love it anyway.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It has a really nice smell and leaves your hands soft after washing.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave two stars is for the chemical Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;I have removed all products with this chemical from my house.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite liquid hand soaps. This was the best price I had found. I have to order this from the Internet because it is not sold in stores around me.</li>
            <li> Yardley fragrance is outstanding, leathers great with just a small amount in your hand, hands are clean and feel moisturizer added.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Love the soap, but then again i love lavender smell. Good product.</li>
            <li> Great hand soap.  First used it at a restaurant and had to have so I searched Amazon and there it was....YES!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for over 25 years.  It has a great fragrance which I don&#x27;t personally think has changed, as some reviewers have indicated.  It cleans thoroughly and rinses off easily.  It does not dry your skin, as some harsher soaps do, and leaves a nice light fragrance.  I have no problem with the anti-bacterial agent now included in it.  One of the things that I use it for is &amp;#34;first pass&amp;#34; wet shaving, with the grain of my whiskers.  Its lubricity makes it ideal for this use.  I apply it on wet skin with my hands.  Because it does not form a thick lather, you can easily see to square off sideburns, etc.  I follow with an application of my favorite brushed-on shaving soap for the second pass.  I feel that because of the anti-bacterial, I have much less skin &amp;#34;breaking out&amp;#34; and slow-healing nicks, when I get a bit careless with the razor.  Like most other reviewers, I can no longer find this in local retail outlets.  I buy online six bottles at a time, which lasts me a good long time.  I hope that Yardley never discontinues this product; it is irreplaceable.</li>
            <li> They have this soap in all the Outback Steakhouses I&#x27;ve visited. The soap is not available locally. You have to experience the unique aroma for yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and used it for years until I read about the antibacterial chemical, triclosan, which is one of the ingredients.  This is an unnecessary addition to the soap and helps contribute to the antibiotic-resistant infections rife in this country.  I keep waiting for Yardley to reformulate its soap, but until they do I&#x27;m no longer buying it, and you shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> This is just a lovely product. We have included it in a gift basket for the holidays too...</li>
            <li> I was so darned happy to find this on Amazon, since I&#x27;ve been looking in all the local big box stores to no avail.  One of my favorite restaurants has this in the restroom and the smell always makes me feel happy.  Now I can be happy at home any old time.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> ..aaaaaaaaaa  aaaaaa aaaaaa  aaaaa aaaaaa  aaaaaa aaaaaaaa  aaaaa aaaaaa  aaa aaa aaa aaaa aaa nnnn nnnnn  nnnn nnn nn nnnnnn nnnn nnnnn nnnn nnn nnnn nnnnn nnnnnn nnnnn nnnnn nnnnn nnnn nnnn nnnn nnn</li>
            <li> I used to like the old original Yardley, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to have the same smell, but it was still nice.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! very good product</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in the Outback restarurant. Then I looked for it in the internet and it I am very happy using it in my home. It leaves a beautiful smell in my restroom and on my hands every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It smells so good!</li>
