            <li>so far this glue is great.</li>
            <li>i loved this product so much thanks</li>
            <li>Very quick adherence.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>The included applicator allows for precise placement of the glue.</li>
            <li>Good product  design,, but not enough glue</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Comes off with nail polish remover easily, but not easy enough to come off on its own, which is good.</li>
            <li>I like this far better than the brush-on container.</li>
            <li>The first use worked well, though the gems I glued on did fall off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is a never fail glue.</li>
            <li>so I used it quick and it feels very secure (unlike all my other nails now)</li>
            <li>This type can easily be applied to tiny nooks if needed.</li>
            <li>and it holds very well.</li>
            <li>It was also very runny.</li>
            <li>Dried up faster than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap knock off of 5 second nail glue, not even the same brand.</li>
            <li>I gotta say this does dry fairly quick though.</li>
            <li>Please you guys, read reviews first, don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this particular nail glue for several months locally without success.</li>
            <li>I want the real thing, or my money back.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I was sooo excited to try this out since it&#x27;s really hard to find a good nail glue that can hold false nails well.</li>
            <li>It really works and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>If you are using with nails, rough up the nail first</li>
            <li>This dried out right sfter</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used other products that kept whatever I used on my nails much longer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I stored the bottle incorrectly, but the glue dried up after the first use.</li>
            <li>I only got a few uses out of it because the top dried up and it wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount and lasts a long time plus strong.  </li>
            <li>The small like bottles that come with most nail kits can be messy.</li>

            <li> Do be aware that when they say 5 seconds, they mean it.</li>

            <li> This dried out right sfter I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Great product! I like this far better than the brush-on container.</li>
            <li> I loved this product I think its amazing and it holds very well. i loved this product so much thanks</li>
            <li> This glue is ok but I&#x27;ve used other products that kept whatever I used on my nails much longer.  This type of applicator does not give you a lot of times you can use this product.</li>
            <li> The glue was very hard to squeeze and seemed to be dried out.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> I prefer to have nail glue in a tube like form with the narrow tip for super small areas that need it when using fake nails. The small like bottles that come with most nail kits can be messy. This type can easily be applied to tiny nooks if needed.</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount and lasts a long time plus strong.  Unable to afford beauty shop do so have to do myself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I stored the bottle incorrectly, but the glue dried up after the first use. The first use worked well, though the gems I glued on did fall off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> so far this glue is great. I broke one today actually which so happens to be the day I received the glue so I used it quick and it feels very secure (unlike all my other nails now)</li>
            <li> This is a never fail glue. Do be aware that when they say 5 seconds, they mean it. Very quick adherence. If you are using with nails, rough up the nail first and you will get a hold that lasts.</li>
            <li> Well, I ordered this on Jan. 22, 2014 and Received it today (Jan.27,2014) And upon opening, I saw that it was not the product specified by the seller. This is a cheap knock off of 5 second nail glue, not even the same brand. It was dried upon receiving, the nozzle was broken, and the seller has YET to answer my email. I want the real thing, or my money back. This is ridiculous, if you are going to lie about a product, then why even attempt to sell it on a public site? It amazes me. Please you guys, read reviews first, don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> works great w linen wraps</li>
            <li> When I received this product, the glue had already dried before I opened it. In addition, for a generic (not brand name) this is woefully overpriced.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work or hold on nails.</li>
            <li> The glue doesn&#x27;t stick well enough, after 2 days my fake nail tips had fallen off.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this glue. It really works and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Dried up faster than I would have liked. I only got a few uses out of it because the top dried up and it wouldn&#x27;t come out. It was also very runny.</li>
            <li> Good product  design,, but not enough glue</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this particular nail glue for several months locally without success. Of all the nail glues I have tried this is the only one whose actions match its claims.</li>
            <li> Great product works will on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I was hoping.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product.  I would like to find something stronger.</li>
            <li> Super happy - works brilliantly.  Keep mine in the fridge which I find keeps it longer</li>
            <li> Overall a great product. Very easy to use, and comes with detailed instructions about usage, storage, etc. Works well, and holds great. Comes off with nail polish remover easily, but not easy enough to come off on its own, which is good. The included applicator allows for precise placement of the glue.</li>
            <li> I really love this glue. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. The shipping was quick. I would recommend this to anyone for a nice binding nail glue. I use this when I do press ons and when I do acrylic tips</li>
            <li> keep upright...works well</li>
            <li> Great nail glue.  I have used this product for several years and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> This was a 3rd order. Loved it.</li>
            <li> This just came in the mail today! I was sooo excited to try this out since it&#x27;s really hard to find a good nail glue that can hold false nails well. I gotta say this does dry fairly quick though.</li>
            <li> Shipping to slow. Product 4 stars</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
