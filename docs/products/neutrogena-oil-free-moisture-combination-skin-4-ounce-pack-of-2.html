            <li>This moisturizer is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this helped a bunch!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a nice sized bottle and perfect if you travel, as you can twist the top to the side to lock the pump</li>
            <li>I can see the visible difference in the clarity of her skin when she uses good quality like this.</li>

            <li>I bought a whole bunch of products that were had good reviews and were touted to be the best, but did not suit my needs as I have combination skin.  </li>

            <li>Very happy with this so far.</li>
            <li>and i think the fragrance is too strong!</li>
            <li>This is a great oil-free moisturizer that works very well for combination skin!</li>
            <li>The formula is gentle, moisturizing, non-greasy/oily, refreshing, soothing, and best of all, alcohol free, so there&#x27;s no burning.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And I used to cover it up with lots of foundation or BB cream, which caused even more breakouts.</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin better.</li>
            <li>my oily areas more shiny.</li>
            <li>I went from having abnormally oily skin to now having skin that looks as if I have a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>This one feels okay upon application, but as soon as it soaks in, skin feels like a dog just licked it.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t prevent my face from looking oily, but my skin feels so much better now.</li>
            <li>I use this product every night and love it.</li>
            <li>I love neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I truly believe it has helped  keep the oils at bay and in turn keep my acne from continuing to swell or creating more.</li>
            <li>After going through many moisturizers..</li>
            <li>I love the Neutrogena Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Very light and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>No matter how dry I am, massaging this into my skin feels amazing and leaves me looking great.</li>
            <li>I had bought the neutrogena hand cream from amazon and loved how it wasnt oily and left my hands nice and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try it since I loved the hand cream so much.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product if you prefer a light gel-like lotion!</li>
            <li>I love it keep up the great products And expect more purchases from me and other of my mates thank you</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin LOVES this stuff; no bad reactions of any kind, and NO oily feeling or residue on top afterwards!</li>
            <li>To be fair: I live in Florida and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I&#x27;m so impressed with this product that I felt that I should.</li>
            <li>It made my face SUPER OILY!</li>
            <li>The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion, but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount.</li>
            <li>I started using it after digging through my boyfriend&#x27;s medicine cabinet one day when I ran out of my own moisturizer, and realized that it&#x27;s the best kept skin secret</li>
            <li>Overall, a great addition to any night regimen.</li>
            <li>That one is smooth and silky and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>I want something that controls the oil and lets my makeup go on smoothly but also take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have combination skin it is a great product, it moisturizes enough and takes shine away from oily areas.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s oil free, it goes on light, while still hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li>Also is oil free but feels greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years because it is SO light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>but with how much you&#x27;ll love this product I doubt you&#x27;ll let it out of your sight :)</li>
            <li>This product really works!!!</li>
            <li>What exactly do they put in this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it would have more of a drying affect and leave any dry spots noticeable, but surprisingly it did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally just Googled \\&quot;Best moisturizer for acne prone skin\\&quot; and was willing to pay a much higher cost just to find something that would work for my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not heavy-duty, so I recommend having a more intensive moisturizer on hand to use once a week or so to really keep your skin from getting flaky.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products - creams, lotions and serums but nothing really helped with the dry/normal patches while keeping the oil at bay.</li>
            <li>Sure enough from the first time I tried it, I fell in love!  </li>
            <li>First of all, if you&#x27;re a dude you&#x27;ll like that this doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores) like most sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li>I used to have more of a dry/normal skin type but as normal..skin changes over time, and for me mine has been changing to be more on the oily side and where occasional breakouts have now become a persistent thing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and creamy at first, and</li>
            <li>, I am so proud to tell people that I&#x27;ve stored away my foundation makeup and use less oil-absorbent sheets than before.</li>
            <li>The lotion feels good on my dry skin but it leaves no oily feel.</li>
            <li>Before we got married he wouldn&#x27;t bother to put anything on his face!</li>
            <li>I use this moisturizer when I just want a very light layer of moisture, but it is too light to be my regular daily-use.  </li>
            <li>B00027EG9C Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, looks healthier and I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, my skin is the most acne-prone, sensitive skin there is.</li>
            <li>Yes that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I have been using it for probably right years and do not see myself changing.</li>
            <li>I even recommend this moisturizer for peels because it really helps speed up and clean up the peeling process.</li>
            <li>moisturizes works very well, absorbs quickly, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>Really great for daytime moisturizing as long as my skin is not terribly dry.</li>
            <li>at this price I could do better at my local store!!</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first use, but gave it another shot.</li>
            <li>B000052YOX Neutrogena Moisture Oil Free Formula, Sensitive Skin - 4 fl oz]])</li>
            <li>so this is my first time trying a moisturizer that targets oily/combo skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I learned early on that moisture is important in helping to control that</li>
            <li>If it is, I use Cetaphil moisturizing cream first, let it sink in, then pat off the excess with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put my bottle through some trials, and it looks like it still will be staying with me for a whole year if my math is right.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin without leaving it tight and my face feels awesome with VERY minimal to no oily reside on my face.  </li>
            <li>First of all you should know that I have a VERY oily T-Zone.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is better for people who have really dry skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer, however, made the normal/dry areas more dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer...</li>
            <li>It leaves behind happy skin and NOTHING ELSE.</li>
            <li>Why would I spend that much on one bottle of this?</li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin don&#x27;t expect wonders, it just moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li>This is actually and truly oil free.  </li>
            <li>For a while I have already been using cleansers that target acne and didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>it still keeps your skin very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hydrates really well, and keeps my oily skin at bay.  </li>
            <li>He has combination skin and since neutrogena is very hypoallegenic</li>
            <li>Then I apply Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Combination Skin, and my skin is ready for makeup.</li>
            <li>This stuff absorbs fast, keeps my skin moisturizes ALL DAY</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Pack of 3&amp;#34; is really a pack of ONE.</li>
            <li>So, I thought, &amp;#34;Well, if this really absorbs the oil, I&#x27;ll try re-applying it to see if my oil which is already on my face will get absorbed&amp;#34; and voila, it was so drying and oil-absorbing that it made my face oil-free again.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for 2 weeks now for a good face moisturizer that wasnt greasy and left my skin hydrated with minimal shine.  </li>
            <li>I really would like to find the person who told me that acne goes away when you get older...</li>
            <li>use this with the Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser and a Murad cleanser that I switch between.</li>
            <li>Both are comparable in weight and price per ounce, but CereVe is keeping the flakiness down on my forehead and cheeks in the winter much better than this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty dry while my forehead and cheeks are super oily.</li>
            <li>I feel evenly hydrated in oily and dry zones alike, can wear make-up without that \\&quot;dry\\&quot; texture beneath, and often forego make-up anyway because this lotion leaves me glowing and acne free.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m older now, and</li>
            <li>Luckily, this moisturizer not only doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out either.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize what it was at first (because I&#x27;ve tried so many things in the past), but the end of the day would come and I would realize that I hadn&#x27;t blotted my skin nor seen my reflection in my nose</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Hands down just not as great as the sensitive skin version of this moisturizer (it has a purple stripe on the bottle instead of a pink one).  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and, like all Neutrogena products, of high quality.</li>
            <li>I am overjoyed that I decided to give it a try and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other moisturizers from Olay Combination Skin Moisturizer (watery consistency, and greasy on my face causing breakouts), to high end products such as Shiseido and Lancome, none of which gave me the same smooth, matte, and oil controled skin as I do with this product.</li>
            <li>If you have relatively normal skin, then this might be for you.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new face lotion.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and have been using it for about a month now, and not only have I not broken out, but I&#x27;m also noticing that my skin is looking much healthier.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cetaphil straight from the tub as a facial moisturizer, but I noticed that it was really greasy and might have been contributing to my acne.</li>
            <li>If u have sensitive combination skin, I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so my normal one is the Sensitive Skin Neutrogena moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in the past, and they all make my face break out within 48 hours.</li>
            <li>If you have somewhat sensitive skin don&#x27;t use this!</li>
            <li>This stuff made my dry areas more dry and</li>
            <li>Was not sure this would be equivalent to the Sensitive Skin blend that I typically use, however I found the combination skin blend to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, stay FAR, FAR away!</li>
            <li>Some would be super heavy making my face shine, while others would be so very drying.</li>
            <li>It goes on lightly and doesn&#x27;t feel at all heavy.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin which is also sensitive, but I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>They do have another formula for sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and am allergic to nearly all products on the market, but this one has never been an issue.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday, morning and night time, never skipped once, because I would feel the differences right away and run straight to the bathroom to put it on.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and can still use it if I put on cream first.  </li>
            <li>I find that a single bottle lasts for a good six months (I apply the product morning and night, so a small amount goes a long way).</li>
            <li>and it just made my skin look like bare, ungreasy, unshiny skin!!</li>
            <li>It is super light, and my face doesn&#x27;t give off that weird oily shine throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and so I thought this moisturizer would do the trick: absorbing excess oil where it needs to and moisturize the places that are too dry.</li>
            <li>I have a typical combination skin, meaning by mid day my nose and forehead will be shiny and super oily while my cheeks would be normal/dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be switching back to the other version right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ridiculous, you could easily fry an egg on my face.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive combo skin like I do, this product will mostly likely work well for you, too.</li>
            <li>and this stuff keeps the oil down and really keeps my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with the combination skin moisturizer as an alternative since my forehead and nose is oily while everywhere else is either dry or normal.</li>
            <li>Instead of my normal one application, with this lotion I need to apply twice, otherwise my face is dry and flaky--once after getting out of the shower, and another time before putting on my make up.</li>
            <li>felt my oil on my face being completely absorbed by this but not long afterwards (maybe a few hours)</li>
            <li>I tried moisturizer after moisturizer, and break out after break out followed; most products left me oily and prone to worse blemishes, and the rest just didn&#x27;t absorb or do anything to help the dryness.</li>
            <li>One pump is enough to last the whole day--I don&#x27;t know how, but it keeps the dry parts moisturized and the oily parts un-shiny!</li>
            <li>Considering you can get a single bottle at BB&amp;B for $7 this is completely misleading.</li>
            <li>I am a 27 year old male with dry combination skin in the winter.</li>

            <li> I went from having abnormally oily skin to now having skin that looks as if I have a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> This one feels okay upon application, but as soon as it soaks in, skin feels like a dog just licked it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t prevent my face from looking oily, but my skin feels so much better now.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night and love it.</li>
            <li> I love neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I truly believe it has helped  keep the oils at bay and in turn keep my acne from continuing to swell or creating more.</li>
            <li> After going through many moisturizers..</li>
            <li> I love the Neutrogena Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Very light and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> No matter how dry I am, massaging this into my skin feels amazing and leaves me looking great.</li>
            <li> I had bought the neutrogena hand cream from amazon and loved how it wasnt oily and left my hands nice and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try it since I loved the hand cream so much.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product if you prefer a light gel-like lotion!</li>
            <li> I love it keep up the great products And expect more purchases from me and other of my mates thank you</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin LOVES this stuff; no bad reactions of any kind, and NO oily feeling or residue on top afterwards!</li>
            <li> To be fair: I live in Florida and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I&#x27;m so impressed with this product that I felt that I should.</li>
            <li> It made my face SUPER OILY!</li>
            <li> The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion, but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount.</li>
            <li> I started using it after digging through my boyfriend&#x27;s medicine cabinet one day when I ran out of my own moisturizer, and realized that it&#x27;s the best kept skin secret</li>
            <li> Overall, a great addition to any night regimen.</li>
            <li> That one is smooth and silky and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I want something that controls the oil and lets my makeup go on smoothly but also take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have combination skin it is a great product, it moisturizes enough and takes shine away from oily areas.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s oil free, it goes on light, while still hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li> Also is oil free but feels greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years because it is SO light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> but with how much you&#x27;ll love this product I doubt you&#x27;ll let it out of your sight :)</li>
            <li> This product really works!!!</li>
            <li> What exactly do they put in this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would have more of a drying affect and leave any dry spots noticeable, but surprisingly it did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally just Googled \\&quot;Best moisturizer for acne prone skin\\&quot; and was willing to pay a much higher cost just to find something that would work for my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not heavy-duty, so I recommend having a more intensive moisturizer on hand to use once a week or so to really keep your skin from getting flaky.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products - creams, lotions and serums but nothing really helped with the dry/normal patches while keeping the oil at bay.</li>
            <li> Sure enough from the first time I tried it, I fell in love!  </li>
            <li> First of all, if you&#x27;re a dude you&#x27;ll like that this doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores) like most sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li> I used to have more of a dry/normal skin type but as normal..skin changes over time, and for me mine has been changing to be more on the oily side and where occasional breakouts have now become a persistent thing.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and creamy at first, and</li>
            <li> , I am so proud to tell people that I&#x27;ve stored away my foundation makeup and use less oil-absorbent sheets than before.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels good on my dry skin but it leaves no oily feel.</li>
            <li> Before we got married he wouldn&#x27;t bother to put anything on his face!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer when I just want a very light layer of moisture, but it is too light to be my regular daily-use.  </li>
            <li> B00027EG9C Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, looks healthier and I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, my skin is the most acne-prone, sensitive skin there is.</li>
            <li> Yes that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I have been using it for probably right years and do not see myself changing.</li>
            <li> I even recommend this moisturizer for peels because it really helps speed up and clean up the peeling process.</li>
            <li> moisturizes works very well, absorbs quickly, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> Really great for daytime moisturizing as long as my skin is not terribly dry.</li>
            <li> at this price I could do better at my local store!!</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first use, but gave it another shot.</li>
            <li> B000052YOX Neutrogena Moisture Oil Free Formula, Sensitive Skin - 4 fl oz]])</li>
            <li> so this is my first time trying a moisturizer that targets oily/combo skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned early on that moisture is important in helping to control that</li>
            <li> If it is, I use Cetaphil moisturizing cream first, let it sink in, then pat off the excess with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put my bottle through some trials, and it looks like it still will be staying with me for a whole year if my math is right.</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin without leaving it tight and my face feels awesome with VERY minimal to no oily reside on my face.  </li>
            <li> First of all you should know that I have a VERY oily T-Zone.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is better for people who have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer, however, made the normal/dry areas more dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer...</li>
            <li> It leaves behind happy skin and NOTHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> Why would I spend that much on one bottle of this?</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin don&#x27;t expect wonders, it just moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> This is actually and truly oil free.  </li>
            <li> For a while I have already been using cleansers that target acne and didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> it still keeps your skin very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hydrates really well, and keeps my oily skin at bay.  </li>
            <li> He has combination skin and since neutrogena is very hypoallegenic</li>
            <li> Then I apply Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Combination Skin, and my skin is ready for makeup.</li>
            <li> This stuff absorbs fast, keeps my skin moisturizes ALL DAY</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Pack of 3&amp;#34; is really a pack of ONE.</li>
            <li> So, I thought, &amp;#34;Well, if this really absorbs the oil, I&#x27;ll try re-applying it to see if my oil which is already on my face will get absorbed&amp;#34; and voila, it was so drying and oil-absorbing that it made my face oil-free again.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for 2 weeks now for a good face moisturizer that wasnt greasy and left my skin hydrated with minimal shine.  </li>
            <li> I really would like to find the person who told me that acne goes away when you get older...</li>
            <li> use this with the Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser and a Murad cleanser that I switch between.</li>
            <li> Both are comparable in weight and price per ounce, but CereVe is keeping the flakiness down on my forehead and cheeks in the winter much better than this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty dry while my forehead and cheeks are super oily.</li>
            <li> I feel evenly hydrated in oily and dry zones alike, can wear make-up without that \\&quot;dry\\&quot; texture beneath, and often forego make-up anyway because this lotion leaves me glowing and acne free.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m older now, and</li>
            <li> Luckily, this moisturizer not only doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what it was at first (because I&#x27;ve tried so many things in the past), but the end of the day would come and I would realize that I hadn&#x27;t blotted my skin nor seen my reflection in my nose</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Hands down just not as great as the sensitive skin version of this moisturizer (it has a purple stripe on the bottle instead of a pink one).  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and, like all Neutrogena products, of high quality.</li>
            <li> I am overjoyed that I decided to give it a try and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other moisturizers from Olay Combination Skin Moisturizer (watery consistency, and greasy on my face causing breakouts), to high end products such as Shiseido and Lancome, none of which gave me the same smooth, matte, and oil controled skin as I do with this product.</li>
            <li> If you have relatively normal skin, then this might be for you.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new face lotion.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and have been using it for about a month now, and not only have I not broken out, but I&#x27;m also noticing that my skin is looking much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil straight from the tub as a facial moisturizer, but I noticed that it was really greasy and might have been contributing to my acne.</li>
            <li> If u have sensitive combination skin, I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so my normal one is the Sensitive Skin Neutrogena moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in the past, and they all make my face break out within 48 hours.</li>
            <li> If you have somewhat sensitive skin don&#x27;t use this!</li>
            <li> This stuff made my dry areas more dry and</li>
            <li> Was not sure this would be equivalent to the Sensitive Skin blend that I typically use, however I found the combination skin blend to be a great product.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, stay FAR, FAR away!</li>
            <li> Some would be super heavy making my face shine, while others would be so very drying.</li>
            <li> It goes on lightly and doesn&#x27;t feel at all heavy.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin which is also sensitive, but I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li> They do have another formula for sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and am allergic to nearly all products on the market, but this one has never been an issue.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, morning and night time, never skipped once, because I would feel the differences right away and run straight to the bathroom to put it on.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and can still use it if I put on cream first.  </li>
            <li> I find that a single bottle lasts for a good six months (I apply the product morning and night, so a small amount goes a long way).</li>
            <li> and it just made my skin look like bare, ungreasy, unshiny skin!!</li>
            <li> It is super light, and my face doesn&#x27;t give off that weird oily shine throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and so I thought this moisturizer would do the trick: absorbing excess oil where it needs to and moisturize the places that are too dry.</li>
            <li> I have a typical combination skin, meaning by mid day my nose and forehead will be shiny and super oily while my cheeks would be normal/dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be switching back to the other version right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous, you could easily fry an egg on my face.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive combo skin like I do, this product will mostly likely work well for you, too.</li>
            <li> and this stuff keeps the oil down and really keeps my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the combination skin moisturizer as an alternative since my forehead and nose is oily while everywhere else is either dry or normal.</li>
            <li> Instead of my normal one application, with this lotion I need to apply twice, otherwise my face is dry and flaky--once after getting out of the shower, and another time before putting on my make up.</li>
            <li> felt my oil on my face being completely absorbed by this but not long afterwards (maybe a few hours)</li>
            <li> I tried moisturizer after moisturizer, and break out after break out followed; most products left me oily and prone to worse blemishes, and the rest just didn&#x27;t absorb or do anything to help the dryness.</li>
            <li> One pump is enough to last the whole day--I don&#x27;t know how, but it keeps the dry parts moisturized and the oily parts un-shiny!</li>
            <li> Considering you can get a single bottle at BB&amp;B for $7 this is completely misleading.</li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old male with dry combination skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> even just a few days after I use facial peel to clean dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily face, and after cleaning the oil it&#x27;s all dry dead skin underneath.</li>
            <li> Left my face really dry.</li>
            <li> It does seem to control oil while at the same time keeping dry areas moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far, but I&#x27;m a firm believer.  </li>
            <li> I had accepted that I would have to endure extra white heads if I wanted to hydrate my skin enough for my foundation not to look flaky and cracked on my poor chapped skin, because even mild soap left my face feeling stiff but without washing the oil</li>
            <li> you just need a plain old moisturizer without SPF, anti-aging voodoo or anything else, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I used to get small to medium-sized pimples weekly and monthly, uneven and red spots, and very oily T-zones.</li>
            <li> Oily throughout the day, but WAY too dry after washing, I thought my skin was doomed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has issues with the winter months, acne medication, and dry skin&lt;</li>
            <li> I decided to give this one a try because of what it says it does and because I somehow developed small patches of dry skin on my face that needed to be treated, even though I was still oily.</li>
            <li> I like a creamier and just slightly heavier consistency on a daily basis</li>
            <li> After 4 months of daily use I&#x27;m only a third of the way through the bottle, and it shows no sign of discoloration, separation, or drying out despite being left \\&quot;open\\&quot;, sitting in heat/direct sunlight, or being forgotten outside in the cold winter.</li>
            <li> So I started using it on my face since it wasnt harsh and left no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice and the rest of the bottle is going to go to waste.</li>
            <li> When I say that I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on remedies, concoctions, and miracle creams to help with my oily skin, I am not exaggerating.  </li>
            <li> I expected to receive a pack of 3 of these because that is what it states in the title.</li>
            <li> The combo skin doesn&#x27;t even have sunscreen, so once the bottle is completely empty, I&#x27;ll look for another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was in the top 3 of several of the articles that I read (and number 1 in a few of them), and it was the least expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, its just not cutting it for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda pale, so I will stick with the SPF next time.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely oily, with a dry flaky layer hidden beneath the oil.</li>
            <li> I used a pump on my face after I washed it, and my skin had that dry tight feeling to it.</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers tend to leave your skin sticky and shiny but this did not</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything other than this.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other lotion since.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after application with no greasy after feel and I am totally shocked to see how well it has kept my makeup in place.</li>
            <li> My t zone is usually oily but it was over dry and the rest of my face too</li>
            <li> Well in less than 30 minutes, indoors, my forehead was oily and my cheeks and nose started shining too.</li>
            <li> At $10, that&#x27;s still less than $1 a month.</li>
            <li> My previous moisturizers were those for normal/dry and those that claim to be &amp;#34;for</li>
            <li> It absorbs the oil well, while you still have oil on your face, but the fact that I would have to RE-APPLY this moisturizer for my face to be less oily seems somewhat redundant.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I found that if I have to use it, I have to use maybe a quarter of a little pump and even then, I&#x27;m not a fan of how it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> I still have that much dead skin</li>
            <li> This one seemed to be one of the ones that was mentioned quite a few time.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin to the point where I avoided using moisturizer as every one that I tried in the past made by skin even oilier.</li>
            <li> i didnt need to use a lot of it and it lasted a while despite its small container</li>
            <li> not even a half-hour later your skin is feeling tight, dry, and oily -- perhaps the worst combination for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> That weird, sticky, tight sensation.  </li>
            <li> It took me a while to realize that maybe it was time I changed my moisturizer too (Duh!).</li>
            <li> if anything it&#x27;s worse.</li>
            <li> I gave the product three stars because it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse</li>
            <li> but since my dermatologist prescribed an irritating gel for my acne</li>
            <li> is that it covers my dead skin so it doesn&#x27;t look bad, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with that,</li>
            <li> I found this product merely by accident.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is very thin.</li>
            <li> I have incredily dry skin, with a shockingly oily t-zone.  </li>
            <li> (sorry, dogs!)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the ad though.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.  I have a combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.  Recommended by my cosmetologist</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and creamy at first, and not even a half-hour later your skin is feeling tight, dry, and oily -- perhaps the worst combination for acne prone skin. If you have relatively normal skin, then this might be for you. Otherwise, stay FAR, FAR away!</li>
            <li> I had meant to order the SPF version, which comes out of the pump a white color.  This is a creamy-whitish.  Nothing wrong with that, but I need the SPF coverage and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer...I&#x27;m kinda pale, so I will stick with the SPF next time.  That said, I still use this sometimes at night or if I know I will be bumming around the house all day with no fun-in-the-sun.  It is lightweight and, like all Neutrogena products, of high quality.</li>
            <li> I really would like to find the person who told me that acne goes away when you get older... Well, I&#x27;m older now, and if anything it&#x27;s worse. Luckily, this moisturizer not only doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out either. Very happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil-free moisturizer that works very well for combination skin!</li>
            <li> This gets the job done. It&#x27;s not too oily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave shine. I put it on every night before bed and it makes my skin feel very nice. I suffer from severe acne, so this helps keep my skin from flaking.</li>
            <li> This lotion is lightweight yet moisturizing. Once I tried this lotion, I was done searching for others. I like how there is no SPF in it so I can wear it before bed.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer when I just want a very light layer of moisture, but it is too light to be my regular daily-use.  I like a creamier and just slightly heavier consistency on a daily basis so my normal one is the Sensitive Skin Neutrogena moisturizer.  Not a bad product if you prefer a light gel-like lotion!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. I am a 27 year old male with dry combination skin in the winter. I&#x27;ve been looking for 2 weeks now for a good face moisturizer that wasnt greasy and left my skin hydrated with minimal shine.  I bought a whole bunch of products that were had good reviews and were touted to be the best, but did not suit my needs as I have combination skin.  I found this product merely by accident.  I had bought the neutrogena hand cream from amazon and loved how it wasnt oily and left my hands nice and hydrated.  So I started using it on my face since it wasnt harsh and left no oily residue.  I figure there had to be a similar moisturizer for the face from neutrogena, so I searched my local supermarket for it.  And voila!  I found a face moisturizer from neutrogena which said for combination skin.  I was excited to try it since I loved the hand cream so much.  Sure enough from the first time I tried it, I fell in love!  It hydrates my skin without leaving it tight and my face feels awesome with VERY minimal to no oily reside on my face.  I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far, but I&#x27;m a firm believer.  And at only 10 dollars a bottle, it&#x27;s a steal.  So moral of the story?  If u have sensitive combination skin, I highly recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since November 2011, and has about 1/3 of the bottle left. I&#x27;ve tried many other moisturizers from Olay Combination Skin Moisturizer (watery consistency, and greasy on my face causing breakouts), to high end products such as Shiseido and Lancome, none of which gave me the same smooth, matte, and oil controled skin as I do with this product. I started using it after digging through my boyfriend&#x27;s medicine cabinet one day when I ran out of my own moisturizer, and realized that it&#x27;s the best kept skin secret I&#x27;ve yet to discover. I used to get small to medium-sized pimples weekly and monthly, uneven and red spots, and very oily T-zones. And I used to cover it up with lots of foundation or BB cream, which caused even more breakouts. Ever since using this product, I HAVE NOT FOUND THE NEED TO WEAR FOUNDATION OR BB CREAM FOR MONTHS!!! Yes that&#x27;s right, I am so proud to tell people that I&#x27;ve stored away my foundation makeup and use less oil-absorbent sheets than before. I use this product everyday, morning and night time, never skipped once, because I would feel the differences right away and run straight to the bathroom to put it on. All of these are just the results that worked on me, and I hope it works for you as well, because having clearer skin has been truly one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> Great for out of the sun oil control.</li>
            <li> Of the thousands of moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried, this one has got to be the best. It goes on lightly and doesn&#x27;t feel at all heavy. There is no funky scent. It does the job and it makes your skin better. I even recommend this moisturizer for peels because it really helps speed up and clean up the peeling process. Overall, a great addition to any night regimen.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is better for people who have really dry skin. I used a pump on my face after I washed it, and my skin had that dry tight feeling to it. Well in less than 30 minutes, indoors, my forehead was oily and my cheeks and nose started shining too. I was disappointed. I found that if I have to use it, I have to use maybe a quarter of a little pump and even then, I&#x27;m not a fan of how it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> love the product but picture is misleading!! it appeared I was getting a 2 pack but it&#x27;s only one. at this price I could do better at my local store!! Rip off.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my dry areas more dry and my oily areas more shiny. I noticed after the first use, but gave it another shot. Second time, same thing. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and the rest of the bottle is going to go to waste.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin which is also sensitive, but I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer with SPF. It seems that everything comes with SPF these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Moisture is GREAT for combination skin. They do have another formula for sensitive skin  ([[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Moisture Oil Free Formula, Sensitive Skin - 4 fl oz]]) but if you have sensitive combo skin like I do, this product will mostly likely work well for you, too. It&#x27;s fragrance free and non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores) like most sensitive skin products. I wash my face in the morning and in the evening and use this moisturizer afterward both times. One pump is enough to last the whole day--I don&#x27;t know how, but it keeps the dry parts moisturized and the oily parts un-shiny! I haven&#x27;t tried it under makeup yet, but it looks and feels like it would do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just need a plain old moisturizer without SPF, anti-aging voodoo or anything else, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Works great for controlling the oil in the skin .Neutrogena products always work as described a great product for oily skin and acne control.</li>
            <li> Oily throughout the day, but WAY too dry after washing, I thought my skin was doomed. I tried moisturizer after moisturizer, and break out after break out followed; most products left me oily and prone to worse blemishes, and the rest just didn&#x27;t absorb or do anything to help the dryness. I had accepted that I would have to endure extra white heads if I wanted to hydrate my skin enough for my foundation not to look flaky and cracked on my poor chapped skin, because even mild soap left my face feeling stiff but without washing the oil was excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 years, I have found my lotion. No matter how dry I am, massaging this into my skin feels amazing and leaves me looking great. I feel evenly hydrated in oily and dry zones alike, can wear make-up without that \\&quot;dry\\&quot; texture beneath, and often forego make-up anyway because this lotion leaves me glowing and acne free. My sensitive skin LOVES this stuff; no bad reactions of any kind, and NO oily feeling or residue on top afterwards! Massage it in, and it&#x27;s gone. It leaves behind happy skin and NOTHING ELSE. &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with what I paid for this, too. After 4 months of daily use I&#x27;m only a third of the way through the bottle, and it shows no sign of discoloration, separation, or drying out despite being left \\&quot;open\\&quot;, sitting in heat/direct sunlight, or being forgotten outside in the cold winter. I&#x27;ve put my bottle through some trials, and it looks like it still will be staying with me for a whole year if my math is right. At $10, that&#x27;s still less than $1 a month. Your only worry about this investment will be misplacing it, but with how much you&#x27;ll love this product I doubt you&#x27;ll let it out of your sight :)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my sister.  She is quite happy with her Neutrogena face products. I can see the visible difference in the clarity of her skin when she uses good quality like this.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin to the point where I avoided using moisturizer as every one that I tried in the past made by skin even oilier. It was embarrassing! I decided to give this one a try because of what it says it does and because I somehow developed small patches of dry skin on my face that needed to be treated, even though I was still oily. This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My skin feels so smooth after application with no greasy after feel and I am totally shocked to see how well it has kept my makeup in place. I did not have to blot once during the day while at work. It&#x27;s been 12 hours since I applied it today and my face still looks great. This product really works!!! I am overjoyed that I decided to give it a try and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has done wonders on my face in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B00027EG9C Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce]].  When I say that I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on remedies, concoctions, and miracle creams to help with my oily skin, I am not exaggerating.  I started using this duo about a month ago after doing some Amazon searches.  I went from having abnormally oily skin to now having skin that looks as if I have a healthy glow.  I didn&#x27;t realize what it was at first (because I&#x27;ve tried so many things in the past), but the end of the day would come and I would realize that I hadn&#x27;t blotted my skin nor seen my reflection in my nose all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether it was one product or the next, but I will say that for those with oily skin that think they don&#x27;t need moisturizer, that&#x27;s a myth because your skin then only overproduces oil in order to compensate for the lack of moisture.  This is a great moisturizer to fill that void.</li>
            <li> This is misleading. I expected to receive a pack of 3 of these because that is what it states in the title. I only received one! Why would I spend that much on one bottle of this? Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Hands down just not as great as the sensitive skin version of this moisturizer (it has a purple stripe on the bottle instead of a pink one).  That one is smooth and silky and feels fantastic. This one feels okay upon application, but as soon as it soaks in, skin feels like a dog just licked it. That weird, sticky, tight sensation.  Not desirable! (sorry, dogs!) I also don&#x27;t think this one is as moisturizing. I&#x27;ll be switching back to the other version right away.</li>
            <li> First of all you should know that I have a VERY oily T-Zone. It&#x27;s ridiculous, you could easily fry an egg on my face. This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t prevent my face from looking oily, but my skin feels so much better now. It&#x27;s soft, looks healthier and I love the smell of this stuff. If you have very oily skin don&#x27;t expect wonders, it just moisturizes your skin. To be fair: I live in Florida and this freaking humidity let&#x27;s almost everyone look greasy. Just give it a shot, it&#x27;s only 10 bucks and if you don&#x27;t like it just use it for your elbows.</li>
            <li> After using one bottle of this moisturizer, the &amp;#34;Combination skin&amp;#34; version, all I can say is &#x27;blah&#x27;. It&#x27;s true it&#x27;s not oily, so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy in my very oily skin, but I think if I stop using it, I wouldn&#x27;t notice any difference. The combo skin doesn&#x27;t even have sunscreen, so once the bottle is completely empty, I&#x27;ll look for another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Was not sure this would be equivalent to the Sensitive Skin blend that I typically use, however I found the combination skin blend to be a great product.  No breakouts and helps reduce oil.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night and love it. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new face lotion.</li>
            <li> This is actually and truly oil free.  I have dry skin and can still use it if I put on cream first.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only face lotion I will use. It&#x27;s not overly greasy and it has actually helped decrease my acne if I use it in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li> I often use Neutrogena products with good results, but this one didn&#x27;t do what it claimed it could do in my case. I must confess that I don&#x27;t actually have combination skin, I have oily skin, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something that was meant for combination skin because it might still work on me. That and I didn&#x27;t see a similar product for oily skin on the shelf, not even from Neutrogena, so I gave it a shot. Nope. My skin&#x27;s still oily, and it becomes oily again not an hour after using this product, so there wasn&#x27;t any \\&quot;all day\\&quot; matte effect for me. I gave the product three stars because it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse and it still moisturizes when I use it after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I love it keep up the great products And expect more purchases from me and other of my mates thank you</li>
            <li> Left my face really dry. My t zone is usually oily but it was over dry and the rest of my face too</li>
            <li> I love neutrogena products.  This moisturizer is great because I have combonation skin and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s. I want something that controls the oil and lets my makeup go on smoothly but also take care of my skin.  I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> What exactly do they put in this moisturizer!! It made my face SUPER OILY!</li>
            <li> The lotion feels good on my dry skin but it leaves no oily feel. I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I used to have more of a dry/normal skin type but as normal..skin changes over time, and for me mine has been changing to be more on the oily side and where occasional breakouts have now become a persistent thing. For a while I have already been using cleansers that target acne and didn&#x27;t see much improvement. It took me a while to realize that maybe it was time I changed my moisturizer too (Duh!). My previous moisturizers were those for normal/dry and those that claim to be &amp;#34;for all skin types&amp;#34; (lies!!!!) so this is my first time trying a moisturizer that targets oily/combo skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for only 2 days now but I have felt and seen instant results. I truly believe it has helped  keep the oils at bay and in turn keep my acne from continuing to swell or creating more. I was concerned that it would have more of a drying affect and leave any dry spots noticeable, but surprisingly it did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;*Unscented&lt;br /&gt;*Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;*Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;*Dries almost a matte finish so you don&#x27;t look shiny&lt;br /&gt;*While it helps to stop the oil from surfacing,  it still keeps your skin very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this moisturizer.  Other moisturizers tend to leave your skin sticky and shiny but this did not and it just made my skin look like bare, ungreasy, unshiny skin!! (just with pimples that are hopefully leaving soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering:&lt;br /&gt;I use this with the Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser and a Murad cleanser that I switch between. Also, I find that powder/mineral foundation has helped to add that extra layer of oil stopping fighting power.</li>
            <li> I have incredily dry skin, with a shockingly oily t-zone.  I have struggled for years trying to find the perfect lotion for my face.  Hydrates really well, and keeps my oily skin at bay.  Plus the bottle lasts longer than you would think, you really do only need a dime sized amnt twice daily.</li>
            <li> First of all, if you&#x27;re a dude you&#x27;ll like that this doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  I&#x27;m a guy, and I&#x27;m prone to acne, but this stuff works for me.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers and rainbows so your buddies won&#x27;t ever know, and it keeps you from getting too oily.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my husband. Before we got married he wouldn&#x27;t bother to put anything on his face! Once he started seeing me use all my lotions and potions he asked for my recommendation. He has combination skin and since neutrogena is very hypoallegenic and I got this cream for him. He&#x27;s been using it regularly for about a year now and loves  it!</li>
            <li> Very light and absorbs easily. Perfect for combination skin. Great for the price. Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> If you have combination skin it is a great product, it moisturizes enough and takes shine away from oily areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena brand oil-free moisturizer for a while now, and it works great. Because it&#x27;s oil free, it goes on light, while still hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Neutrogena. This product work great and it feels refreshing after I use it.</li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have very oily face, and after cleaning the oil it&#x27;s all dry dead skin underneath. I have been using this product for quite a while but my skin conditions are not improved. What this product did to me that&#x27;s helpful is that it covers my dead skin so it doesn&#x27;t look bad, and that&#x27;s it. I still have that much dead skin even just a few days after I use facial peel to clean dead skin.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion. has helped me alot with ingrown hairs after i shave. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything other than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used moisturizer on my face (i&#x27;m a guy) but since my dermatologist prescribed an irritating gel for my acne I needed to soothe my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizes works very well, absorbs quickly, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> this moisturizes great and does not make you break out like lots of moisturizers i have tried over the years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I&#x27;m so impressed with this product that I felt that I should. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in the past, and they all make my face break out within 48 hours. I finally just Googled \\&quot;Best moisturizer for acne prone skin\\&quot; and was willing to pay a much higher cost just to find something that would work for my face. This moisturizer was in the top 3 of several of the articles that I read (and number 1 in a few of them), and it was the least expensive. I ordered it and have been using it for about a month now, and not only have I not broken out, but I&#x27;m also noticing that my skin is looking much healthier. If I ever hear that they may be considering discontinuing this product, I&#x27;ll definitely be stocking up!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. I have been using it for probably right years and do not see myself changing. The formula is gentle, moisturizing, non-greasy/oily, refreshing, soothing, and best of all, alcohol free, so there&#x27;s no burning. I suffered from acne for over ten years and amidst chemical peels, medication that left me sun and wind burned, and even Acutane, this moisturizer alone provided my skin the moisture it needed and soothed the burn. I find that a single bottle lasts for a good six months (I apply the product morning and night, so a small amount goes a long way). My skin is the epitome of combination skin. It is extremely oily, with a dry flaky layer hidden beneath the oil. I learned early on that moisture is important in helping to control that and this one seems to do the trick. I also have sensitive skin and am allergic to nearly all products on the market, but this one has never been an issue.</li>
            <li> Really great for daytime moisturizing as long as my skin is not terribly dry. If it is, I use Cetaphil moisturizing cream first, let it sink in, then pat off the excess with a paper towel. Then I apply Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture for Combination Skin, and my skin is ready for makeup. It does seem to control oil while at the same time keeping dry areas moist. I also like to use it  at night after I wash and treat my skin. Does not break me out.</li>
            <li> works great. i didnt need to use a lot of it and it lasted a while despite its small container</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil straight from the tub as a facial moisturizer, but I noticed that it was really greasy and might have been contributing to my acne. I decided to go with the combination skin moisturizer as an alternative since my forehead and nose is oily while everywhere else is either dry or normal. This moisturizer, however, made the normal/dry areas more dry and flaky. I intended on giving one star, but I guess I&#x27;ll give two stars since it kept my forehead and nose somewhat matte.</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing lots of research on Moisturizers.  This one seemed to be one of the ones that was mentioned quite a few time.  Great product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, my skin is the most acne-prone, sensitive skin there is. Plus around my mouth and on my nose it&#x27;s pretty dry while my forehead and cheeks are super oily. This stuff absorbs fast, keeps my skin moisturizes ALL DAY and I haven&#x27;t gotten on pimple from this stuff. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin, but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily. The lotion itself is very thin. Instead of my normal one application, with this lotion I need to apply twice, otherwise my face is dry and flaky--once after getting out of the shower, and another time before putting on my make up. The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion, but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount.</li>
            <li> If you have somewhat sensitive skin don&#x27;t use this! It makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s burning. I looked it up and it contains oxybenzone which lots of people are allegic too. Also is oil free but feels greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Pack of 3&amp;#34; is really a pack of ONE. Considering you can get a single bottle at BB&amp;B for $7 this is completely misleading. DO NOT FALL FOR IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has issues with the winter months, acne medication, and dry skin&lt;br /&gt;this helped a bunch!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a nice sized bottle and perfect if you travel, as you can twist the top to the side to lock the pump</li>
            <li> After going through many moisturizers.. I have finally found the one that doesn&#x27;t clog my pours and makes me sweat.  It also doesn&#x27;t add shine to my face and it also moisturizes my dryer areas.</li>
            <li> I love the Neutrogena Moisturizer.  I am disappointed with the ad though. It said I was would be receiving 2 but I got only one.  I will not purchase from this again.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and so I thought this moisturizer would do the trick: absorbing excess oil where it needs to and moisturize the places that are too dry. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;I felt my oil on my face being completely absorbed by this but not long afterwards (maybe a few hours) my face would get oily again.. So, I thought, &amp;#34;Well, if this really absorbs the oil, I&#x27;ll try re-applying it to see if my oil which is already on my face will get absorbed&amp;#34; and voila, it was so drying and oil-absorbing that it made my face oil-free again. Ultimately, I have mixed feelings about this. It absorbs the oil well, while you still have oil on your face, but the fact that I would have to RE-APPLY this moisturizer for my face to be less oily seems somewhat redundant.&lt;br /&gt;This is an oil-absorber rather than a moisturizer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years because it is SO light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  However, they only make one for oily skin and one for combo skin.  Unfortunately, its just not cutting it for me in the winter. I just switched to Cereve for the winter months.  Both are comparable in weight and price per ounce, but CereVe is keeping the flakiness down on my forehead and cheeks in the winter much better than this.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes my skin well without making it oily or making me break out. But it&#x27;s not heavy-duty, so I recommend having a more intensive moisturizer on hand to use once a week or so to really keep your skin from getting flaky.</li>
            <li> it is good for me and i think the fragrance is too strong! but it is still a good thing!</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin and this stuff keeps the oil down and really keeps my face soft and moisturized. Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product ! I have a typical combination skin, meaning by mid day my nose and forehead will be shiny and super oily while my cheeks would be normal/dry. I have tried so many products - creams, lotions and serums but nothing really helped with the dry/normal patches while keeping the oil at bay. Some would be super heavy making my face shine, while others would be so very drying. Then one day I saw this product in CVS and decided to give it a shot. Man did it do wonders ! It is super light, and my face doesn&#x27;t give off that weird oily shine throughout the day. I have never used any other lotion since.</li>
