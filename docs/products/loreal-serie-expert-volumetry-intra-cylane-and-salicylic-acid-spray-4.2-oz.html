            <li>Just when I think I have the best items</li>
            <li>THE VERY BEST FOR VOLUME WITH STICKNESS.  </li>
            <li>PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>I love products!!</li>
            <li>Love love it !!!</li>
            <li>If you want a good root spray that won&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, get Garnier Fructis root spray.</li>
            <li>As its companion shampoo, causes great static electricity.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; I like it better than most volumizers.  </li>
            <li>This is just ok.  </li>
            <li>and the color safe conditioner (I am now buying the anti gravity condition and will post if I see a difference)</li>
            <li>It works but I have a MUCH better product I use</li>
            <li>Great price fast delivery</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Talk about a full head of hair!</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;oreal root spray is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It really was an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t find true grip- look for</li>
            <li>the Lanza Powder Up- same type of stuff- Loved the powder up</li>
            <li>then I tried the True Grip-</li>
            <li>I like the dispensing of the True Grip better than the Lanza since they changed the packaging but both products work equally well.</li>
            <li>My stylist laughs when she asks me to try something for her because I do get quite excited by the new prospect...</li>
            <li>I finger combed first then</li>
            <li>Really helps with increasing body of hair</li>
            <li>I have other products I like better.</li>
            <li>product I have tried for fine grey hair.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair more volume than any other product I have ever used and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li>OK but it smells odd and made my hair sticky.  </li>
            <li>great for dull grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;Puts</li>
            <li>and I am not looking for anything new, she says here try this and let me know what you think....</li>
            <li>the spring and shine back... seems so much smoother and full.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>not like the old version</li>
            <li>it is a fine powder that adds some traction as I do a small amount of back-combing at the crown</li>
            <li>did use a little of the True Grip-</li>
            <li>Using rot spray and then styling paste, my fine hair looks dirty although it is clean.</li>
            <li>and if you have fine or thin hair stay away from this item</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Really helps with increasing body of hair</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;oreal root spray is fabulous. After applying and blow drying it makes my hair look fuller and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Gives me tons of volume. Hard to find.</li>
            <li> As its companion shampoo, causes great static electricity.  Can&#x27;t use it but I guess I can&#x27;t send back?</li>
            <li> I have such terrible hair, thin and fine. I &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; I like it better than most volumizers.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  Can be tackey and if you have fine or thin hair stay away from this item</li>
            <li> OK but it smells odd and made my hair sticky.  I have other products I like better.</li>
            <li> I love products!! My stylist laughs when she asks me to try something for her because I do get quite excited by the new prospect...&lt;br /&gt;Not everything I try is a keeper- But this one is. Just when I think I have the best items and I am not looking for anything new, she says here try this and let me know what you think....&lt;br /&gt;So I washed and conditioned with the Anti Gravity shampoo- and the color safe conditioner (I am now buying the anti gravity condition and will post if I see a difference) Then I toweled dry and spray on the root areas all over my head. I finger combed first then proceeded to blow it out. Talk about a full head of hair! It really was an amazing difference. I did not use any other styling product and found it was not necessary to get these results.&lt;br /&gt;I did use a little of the True Grip- it is a fine powder that adds some traction as I do a small amount of back-combing at the crown then a little hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t find true grip- look for the Lanza Powder Up- same type of stuff- Loved the powder up then I tried the True Grip- I like the dispensing of the True Grip better than the Lanza since they changed the packaging but both products work equally well.</li>
            <li> THE VERY BEST FOR VOLUME WITH STICKNESS.  PERFECT.</li>
            <li> It works but I have a MUCH better product I use and this doesn&#x27;t match it.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as I had hoped. Using rot spray and then styling paste, my fine hair looks dirty although it is clean.</li>
            <li> Great price fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love this product. It gives me just the lift and volume I need.</li>
            <li> This did very little for me. If you want a good root spray that won&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, get Garnier Fructis root spray. It costs less and it works.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair more volume than any other product I have ever used and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> Love love it !!!great for dull grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;Puts the spring and shine back... seems so much smoother and full.&lt;br /&gt;Best product I have tried for fine grey hair.</li>
            <li> I,m sorry too say it did not do anything,  I guess my hair is too thin.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I use it! Perfect</li>
            <li> Product came with no instructions how to use in English, very disappointed. Haven&#x27;t even tried it!</li>
            <li> not like the old version</li>
