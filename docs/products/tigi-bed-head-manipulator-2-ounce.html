    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The BedHead Manipulator is great!</li>
            <li>and I find this want to be the best.</li>
            <li>This product is also very good for a trick my stylist taught me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best hair gel/cement/honey on the market for men with fine hair!</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Goes really good on my hair.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I have thinning hair, so it doesn&#x27;t look so good when I style it with any hair gel/paste products, but I think that this one makes it look better.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>As many have discovered, the formula for Bed Head Manipulator has been changed.</li>
            <li>and I wear it a bit spiky in the front and top.    </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can get 2 for that price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use this product routinely, and was thrilled to find it at such a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful and clean fragrant, but the paste has been made more \\&quot;soupy\\&quot; and water-downed, thus leaving a greasy look when applied to hair, and requiring far more of an amount to actually style and hold one&#x27;s hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the product, I realized why it was such a great price.  </li>
            <li>you enjoy your cruise on the S.S. Failboat TIGI...</li>
            <li>This is not the original bed head product.</li>
            <li>The company offered a full refund if I returned it</li>
            <li>The Tigi Bed Head Manipulator is available in most stores but they charge nearly $19 for one...</li>
            <li>most importantly i know it is not bed head because it simply does not smell like bead head.</li>
            <li>You only have to use a little bit and your hair looks great every time!!!</li>
            <li>I have a short haircut, and it is the perfect product for people who have very little time or skill but who want a tousled and textured look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many different hair product for styling</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed in  a hair  </li>
            <li>The new product should be more like the old .</li>
            <li>I highly recommmended for thise who wants to keep a messy, cool, trendy style.</li>
            <li>It is not really a gel, more like a very sticky cream (almost like glue or paste).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very runny consistency, like honey, rather than like wax.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold at all like a pomade does, and it makes your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>it is light enough yet keep your hair in place.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.</li>
            <li>This is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>Because it is very runny and doesn&#x27;t do much to style the hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanksvery much  Patti</li>
            <li>Much runnier and not at all what it used to be.</li>
            <li>Whether they changed the formula to increase profit margins or to comply with regulations on new ingredients as they have suggested on the FB site, the truth remains that this is not at all like the old product and unfortunately is no longer worth using.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t seem to get a barrel for less than 10K, need lead for a more sustainable way to keep my hair the way I want.</li>
            <li>Although this sounds weird, it seems to work much better than hairspray, which leaves a film OVER the hair; Manipulator is WITHIN the hair, so you can do more with it.</li>
            <li>As other recent reviews have unconfirmed, TIGI decided to change the formula for their Manipulator product, and unfortunately NOT for the better.  </li>
            <li>Personally I thought that there was something wrong with my latest until until some quick research confirmed that the formula was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of the people that thought they received counterfeit products in fact received the new formula.</li>
            <li>It dries very naturally though (not at all like glue or paste), and leaving a sort of fiber in your hair.</li>
            <li>Ended up throwing the container away  as the product was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>very disapointed and would like my money back</li>
            <li>time I&#x27;ll buy it locally so I can open it and inspect it first.</li>
            <li>I was looking to try something different than my normal pomade, so I was recommended this product instead.</li>
            <li>but the product seems watered-down (more liquid than it should be), overly shinny, and just of poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, it smells like coconut for a while after putting it in - for better or for worse.    </li>
            <li>It feels soft and nice when dry too---never greasy---and I can leave it in the next day without having the dirty feel to my hair</li>

            <li> Medium to long hair -</li>
            <li> The current pomade is inferior to previous formula, in that it&#x27;s not only lost</li>
            <li> Put a very small amount on your fingertips, put your fingertips in your hair near the roots, and press down on the scalp while rubbing back and forth quickly over a very small area (like scrubbing).  </li>
            <li> This adds lift at the roots which lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I ordered a canister of it a few months back and discovered it didn&#x27;t look, smell, or work the same.  </li>
            <li> Finally opened the first jar and the cream inside is some sort of fake.</li>
            <li> I called tigi and they are aware of how bad thie new product was recieved.  </li>
            <li> Thats why it cost half the price Do not buy.</li>
            <li> The consistency was like soup rather than the usual firm, pliable consistency.  </li>
            <li> product I usually use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem expensive, but you use very little each time, so the two ounce container lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> way I use it is I put a very small amount on my fingers, and then rub my hands together.</li>
            <li> I HATE the new formula and will not buy it, again.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> when i opened the product to use it the &amp;#34;bead head&amp;#34; inside was almost as thin as water.</li>
            <li> That being said, this stuff is useless for my hair.</li>
            <li> The color is wrong.</li>
            <li> The smell is wrong.</li>
            <li> The texture is wrong.</li>
            <li> or I just received a bad batch</li>
            <li> The product I received with this shipment is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> it had a terrible smell and was like water in consistency.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As many have discovered, the formula for Bed Head Manipulator has been changed. All of the people that thought they received counterfeit products in fact received the new formula. Personally I thought that there was something wrong with my latest until until some quick research confirmed that the formula was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this was my go to product, but now I cannot recommend this for anyone. Whether they changed the formula to increase profit margins or to comply with regulations on new ingredients as they have suggested on the FB site, the truth remains that this is not at all like the old product and unfortunately is no longer worth using.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this expecting it to be similar to styling waxes I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a very runny consistency, like honey, rather than like wax.  A bit messy to work with, really, if you&#x27;re not used to it.  As a former user of Redken&#x27;s Water Wax 03 it took me a while to get the hang of this stuff.    I touch the tips of my fingers to the surface of the product, then rub my fingertips together to distribute it, and use it to piece out the ends of my shaggy bob.      This product is also very good for a trick my stylist taught me.  Put a very small amount on your fingertips, put your fingertips in your hair near the roots, and press down on the scalp while rubbing back and forth quickly over a very small area (like scrubbing).  This adds lift at the roots which lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;Bedhead Manipulator by Tigi is a hair cream that can be used for styling, texturizing, and forming. It is not really a gel, more like a very sticky cream (almost like glue or paste). It dries very naturally though (not at all like glue or paste), and leaving a sort of fiber in your hair. Although this sounds weird, it seems to work much better than hairspray, which leaves a film OVER the hair; Manipulator is WITHIN the hair, so you can do more with it. It feels soft and nice when dry too---never greasy---and I can leave it in the next day without having the dirty feel to my hair that leaving the hairspray in does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is I put a very small amount on my fingers, and then rub my hands together. Next I apply it throughout my hair, but especially to the roots for lift. Lastly I twist and sort of \\&quot;tweak\\&quot; the ends of my hair to add texture. I have a short haircut, and it is the perfect product for people who have very little time or skill but who want a tousled and textured look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive, but you use very little each time, so the two ounce container lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
            <li> The BedHead Manipulator is great! It&#x27;s the best hair gel/cement/honey on the market for men with fine hair! You only have to use a little bit and your hair looks great every time!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking to try something different than my normal pomade, so I was recommended this product instead. My hair is medium in length and I wear it a bit spiky in the front and top.    That being said, this stuff is useless for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t hold at all like a pomade does, and it makes your hair very shiny. Lastly, it smells like coconut for a while after putting it in - for better or for worse.    Short hair - yes.  Medium to long hair - no hold at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair product for styling and I find this want to be the best. it is light enough yet keep your hair in place.</li>
            <li> The Tigi Bed Head Manipulator is available in most stores but they charge nearly $19 for one...that&#x27;s ridiculous. I love the fact that I can get 2 for that price here on Amazon. Anyways, I have thinning hair, so it doesn&#x27;t look so good when I style it with any hair gel/paste products, but I think that this one makes it look better. Plus, it has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 15 years and when I got this order the product is altered somehow. The color is wrong. The smell is wrong. The texture is wrong. The company offered a full refund if I returned it but I won&#x27;t buy it from here again.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product.Used manipulator for years.This is not the real deal.Thats why it cost half the price Do not buy.Rip off!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am most unhappy with the hair product I purchased.  I have been using Bed Head Manipulator for several years.  Either the product has been changed or the product you sold me in inferior.  Because it is very runny and doesn&#x27;t do much to style the hair.  I might have to look for another product.</li>
            <li> I use this product routinely, and was thrilled to find it at such a great price on Amazon.  Upon receiving the product, I realized why it was such a great price.  The consistency was like soup rather than the usual firm, pliable consistency.  Ended up throwing the container away  as the product was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> the bed head i recieved is not bed head. it is a counterfeit product in packaging meant to make you think it is bed head.  when i opened the product to use it the &amp;#34;bead head&amp;#34; inside was almost as thin as water. most importantly i know it is not bed head because it simply does not smell like bead head.</li>
            <li> I used to religiously buy Bed Heads Manipulator, until now.  I ordered a canister of it a few months back and discovered it didn&#x27;t look, smell, or work the same.  I HATE the new formula and will not buy it, again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed in  a hair  product I usually use. And of course ,for the price I wanted. Thanksvery much  Patti</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get a barrel for less than 10K, need lead for a more sustainable way to keep my hair the way I want.</li>
            <li> TIGI has changed the formula. The look, feel, and smell are off. Much runnier and not at all what it used to be. Guess I have to look for a different hair product after years of use.</li>
            <li> Finally opened the first jar and the cream inside is some sort of fake. This is not the original bed head product. very disapointed and would like my money back</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and loved it. Well they re-formulated product and it had a terrible smell and was like water in consistency. I called tigi and they are aware of how bad thie new product was recieved.  They are re-formulating again.  The new product should be more like the old .</li>
            <li> As other recent reviews have unconfirmed, TIGI decided to change the formula for their Manipulator product, and unfortunately NOT for the better.  The current pomade is inferior to previous formula, in that it&#x27;s not only lost it&#x27;s wonderful and clean fragrant, but the paste has been made more \\&quot;soupy\\&quot; and water-downed, thus leaving a greasy look when applied to hair, and requiring far more of an amount to actually style and hold one&#x27;s hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product exclusively for over 12 years, I&#x27;ve decided to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy your cruise on the S.S. Failboat TIGI...</li>
            <li> Goes really good on my hair. I highly recommmended for thise who wants to keep a messy, cool, trendy style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 6 years. The product I received with this shipment is very disappointing. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the product or I just received a bad batch but the product seems watered-down (more liquid than it should be), overly shinny, and just of poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll buy it locally so I can open it and inspect it first. If the product is the same as what I received through Amazon, I&#x27;ll no longer be a customer.</li>
