            <li>It&#x27;s nice and shiny too!</li>
            <li>This top coat is awesome!</li>
            <li>Wonderful top coat.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it is safe, it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients...</li>
            <li>I know this is a good product however it didn&#x27;t state</li>
            <li>Great product and for the price you are getting alllot more.</li>
            <li>so I can do my work within minutes after applying top coat!</li>
            <li>This product really worksss!!!!!</li>
            <li>the two and many said this one was just as good as the ever so popular SV.</li>
            <li>It dries the fastest, stays on better, looks good, and I can put it on top of layers of polish</li>
            <li>This is the best clear nail polish I&#x27;ve found for the cheapest price.</li>
            <li>I had heard rave reviews but my nail polish had chipped at the top within two days.</li>
            <li>the Door top Coat</li>
            <li>so keep in mind how many times you&#x27;ve thinned and never use more than 1/8th thinner to 7/8ths polish.</li>
            <li>I work with LOVE</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, makes for a great top coat and is just an overall great product.</li>
            <li>I even put this over the cheap top coats used at nail salons, which chip within a day or two.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best top coat on the market.</li>
            <li>, so I suppose I may have to spend more money and purchase just the original nail polish and then hope I like it</li>
            <li>It noticably prolongs the life of my polish easily by 3 days.</li>
            <li>best top coat I&#x27;ve found and in a large quantity--will last all year</li>
            <li>the 118mL/4oz bottle is HUGE and is about the size of my fist.  </li>
            <li>but is is huge...</li>
            <li>So i got 2more oz free</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this super fast drying top coat instead of S.V.</li>
            <li>And it drying fast is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about OTD.</li>
            <li>They are not lying when they call it \\&quot;super fast drying top coat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Dries my nails quickly.</li>
            <li>My nails always looked freshly done.</li>
            <li>Now I am using back those not so nice colors.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries super fast!</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quick too</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the huge size and didn&#x27;t know that it wouldn&#x27;t come with a brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fast asleep in 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>but ive been able to refill my smaller bottle</li>
            <li>I normally purchase the small polish of the inn out the door super fast drying top coat and thought this was a better deal.</li>
            <li>Really dries fast so it was worth the $15.</li>
            <li>It did not live up to my expectations but it is an okay product and I will continue to finish the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Great shine even for a not very attractive nail polish color!</li>
            <li>The picture is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>It also makes all of the paint peel off fast and in one whole piece.</li>
            <li>and it still dries fast.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much thinner</li>
            <li>So i have yet to use this as I don&#x27;t have a brush to either fit in here or a smaller out the door to &amp;#34;re-fill&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two of the girls</li>
            <li>Keeps my nails unchipped for longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>There is no brush indeed included, but I&#x27;m sure we all have enough nail polishes to figure a spare brush :) I actually ended up using brush from a big bottled  nail base coat that I got from Walmart (Pro-FX series coming in &amp;#34;salon size&amp;#34;) it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li>Wow, this product really does what it says.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It really does dry fast, luv it!</li>
            <li>I just received the product and the brush was completely ripped off before i opened it!</li>
            <li>completely my fault!</li>
            <li>Recommend it as both a base and top coat to insure a great overall polished look.</li>
            <li>OK, BUT PEELS OFF PRETTY EASILY :(</li>
            <li>only issue with the large bottle is that it gets thicker after about halfway, but I use nail polish thinner</li>
            <li>you can paint you nails (2 coats of polish plus this top coat) and it will be dry in less than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>It looks blue for some reason but the polish goes on clear.</li>
            <li>I do natural manicures, and without this product I&#x27;d have to retouch almost daily.</li>
            <li>does make your manicure dry fast and provides lasting shine.</li>
            <li>When it got to the point a couple of years ago that it became much more difficult to keep up the &#x27;fill&#x27; every two weeks, I decided to go natural and have the coating taken off.</li>
            <li>I have very long natural nails</li>

            <li> I have very long natural nails</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time because its really big.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, a little pricey, but if you buy the 118ml, its not that bad.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single chip in any mani that I have done using this product.</li>
            <li> I have resorted to using a brush from another top coat bottle I have purchased but it is a bit annoying having to take it off from the other bottle instead of using it directly from this bottle.</li>
            <li> The only thing it is missing is a brush in the bottle for application.  </li>
            <li> So I have to use this one to fill my other bottle.  </li>
            <li> and i use this and in like a minuite and a half its completely dried.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT, the 118ml size does NOT come with a brush, it is a refill, and I was dumb enough not to notice it</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare, but I saw a few videos on YouTube that compared</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products out there that lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> This dries quickly to a thick, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> After about a year of growing my nails out and having them strengthened, I wanted to do something other than have natural nails, but I hated the chipped polish.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t include a brush in the largest size when the photo shows one, hard to use without a brush!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I haven&#x27;t tried that one</li>
            <li> My nails were weakened from the years of having the acrylic applied, but didn&#x27;t look as bad as I thought they would.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!</li>

            <li> I just received the product and the brush was completely ripped off before i opened it!</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this to me and I am SO happy I listened to them and bought it! It works great! This stuff dries super fast! They are not lying when they call it \\&quot;super fast drying top coat\\&quot;. It&#x27;s nice and shiny too! I would definitely buy it again. I hear everyone talk about the Seche Vite brand. Sorry, I haven&#x27;t tried that one so I can&#x27;t compare, but I saw a few videos on YouTube that compared the two and many said this one was just as good as the ever so popular SV.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, a little pricey, but if you buy the 118ml, its not that bad. Do note that 118ml bottle is a refill and doesnt have a bruch!</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever! does make your manicure dry fast and provides lasting shine. There is no brush indeed included, but I&#x27;m sure we all have enough nail polishes to figure a spare brush :) I actually ended up using brush from a big bottled  nail base coat that I got from Walmart (Pro-FX series coming in &amp;#34;salon size&amp;#34;) it worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best stuff you will ever buy !</li>
            <li> Great nail polish.  Keeps my nails unchipped for longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve owned.  Just beware- the 118mL/4oz bottle is HUGE and is about the size of my fist.  The picture is very misleading.  I bought it instead of the normal 0.5oz thinking that it would be only slightly larger than an average size nail polish bottle but is is huge...completely my fault! Still a great product.</li>
            <li> needs a brush of some sort</li>
            <li> great deal, works great</li>
            <li> WHEN I RECIEVED THIS I OPENED IT AND IT DIDN&#x27;T HAVE A BRUSH TO APPLY- VERY DISAPPOINTED!! WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Really dries fast so it was worth the $15. This bottle will last a long time because its really big.</li>
            <li> I know this is a good product however it didn&#x27;t state it wouldn&#x27;t include a brush in the largest size when the photo shows one, hard to use without a brush!</li>
            <li> One of the things that made me hesitate to take off the acrylic coating on my nails (which I had been getting for over 25 years) was the fact that the coating kept my polish intact. My nails always looked freshly done. When it got to the point a couple of years ago that it became much more difficult to keep up the &#x27;fill&#x27; every two weeks, I decided to go natural and have the coating taken off. Soaked my nails myself in acetone until the coating dissolved. My nails were weakened from the years of having the acrylic applied, but didn&#x27;t look as bad as I thought they would. But polish didn&#x27;t stay on. After about a year of growing my nails out and having them strengthened, I wanted to do something other than have natural nails, but I hated the chipped polish. One day one of my younger friends told me about Out the Door. She raved about it. So I read the reviews from Amazon (by the way, Amazon is my bible in terms of reviews) and decided to buy. It is PHENOMENAL!!!!</li>
            <li> OK, BUT PEELS OFF PRETTY EASILY :(</li>
            <li> Wow, this product really does what it says. I could have 3 coats of nail polish on and i use this and in like a minuite and a half its completely dried. Would recommend this to anyone. EXCEPT, the 118ml size does NOT come with a brush, it is a refill, and I was dumb enough not to notice it but I just purchased a bottle of topcoat and poured the contents of the topcoat out and put this stuff in the bottle</li>
            <li> This top coat is awesome! Adds life to each and every manicure! I change my polish every 4 days or so and I haven&#x27;t had a single chip in any mani that I have done using this product. And it drying fast is a huge plus! This is a refill so it does not include the brush.</li>
            <li> Came without a brush. It also makes all of the paint peel off fast and in one whole piece.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I didn&#x27;t know that I had chosen the refill bottle. I was surprised at the huge size and didn&#x27;t know that it wouldn&#x27;t come with a brush to apply it. I have resorted to using a brush from another top coat bottle I have purchased but it is a bit annoying having to take it off from the other bottle instead of using it directly from this bottle. Out the Door did not work that great for me and I was very disappointed. I had heard rave reviews but my nail polish had chipped at the top within two days. It did not live up to my expectations but it is an okay product and I will continue to finish the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The only thing it is missing is a brush in the bottle for application.  So I have to use this one to fill my other bottle.  But otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Out The Door for years, and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It dries fast, makes for a great top coat and is just an overall great product.</li>
            <li> The name of this product says it all...you can paint you nails (2 coats of polish plus this top coat) and it will be dry in less than 15 minutes. You can go to bed without getting &amp;#34;sheet marks&amp;#34; in your nails overnight. Buy the big bottle - you won&#x27;t want to run out after you start using it!!!</li>
            <li> After a manicurist recommended it to me. I can&#x27;t live without it!I put 2 coats of OPI and then my out the Door top Coat and I&#x27;m fast asleep in 5 minutes! and no sheet marks in the morning! AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I have very long natural nails and I need to keep them polished at all times. This is the best clear nail polish I&#x27;ve found for the cheapest price. It dries the fastest, stays on better, looks good, and I can put it on top of layers of polish and it still dries fast. This is one of the few products out there that lives up to its name. Last minute touch-ups are never a problem, and you are out the door.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the large bottle is that it gets thicker after about halfway, but I use nail polish thinner and then it&#x27;s perfect again. Just don&#x27;t use too much thinner or you&#x27;ll ruin the quality of the polish. so keep in mind how many times you&#x27;ve thinned and never use more than 1/8th thinner to 7/8ths polish. I&#x27;m keeping this one in stock.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat on the market. I even put this over the cheap top coats used at nail salons, which chip within a day or two. This dries quickly to a thick, glossy finish. It noticably prolongs the life of my polish easily by 3 days. I do natural manicures, and without this product I&#x27;d have to retouch almost daily. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It really does dry fast, luv it! Recommend it as both a base and top coat to insure a great overall polished look.</li>
            <li> This product really worksss!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and for the price you are getting alllot more. I went to sallys and they have the 2oz for the same price. So i got 2more oz free</li>
            <li> Keeps my jewels, pearls and/or studs on. Dries my nails quickly. I am glad I bought this super fast drying top coat instead of S.V.</li>
            <li> I did not fully realize that the &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; would not contain a nail polish brush. So i have yet to use this as I don&#x27;t have a brush to either fit in here or a smaller out the door to &amp;#34;re-fill&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two of the girls I work with LOVE This stuff, so I suppose I may have to spend more money and purchase just the original nail polish and then hope I like it so I can use this refill.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about OTD. Wonderful top coat. I use it for all my nail products, but especially for stamping.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the small polish of the inn out the door super fast drying top coat and thought this was a better deal. So I ordered it. I love it. It is a refill bottle so it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush at the tip but ive been able to refill my smaller bottle and it works great! It looks blue for some reason but the polish goes on clear. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> best top coat I&#x27;ve found and in a large quantity--will last all year</li>
            <li> Great shine even for a not very attractive nail polish color! Now I am using back those not so nice colors. Dries pretty quick too so I can do my work within minutes after applying top coat! Best of all, it is safe, it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients...</li>
