    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works perfect.</li>
            <li>; This accessory is the PERFECT solution.</li>
            <li>This item is great!</li>
            <li>The Hollywood Hip Hugger works great!</li>
            <li>When you just don&#x27;t want to wear a belt these are perfect!</li>
            <li>This is especially nice for trips to the restroom, because it eliminates the need to unfasten and refasten a belt buckle each time.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent belt replacement for my kids.  </li>
            <li>This belt works great!</li>
            <li>great for those that need to snug in the waist a bit but don&#x27;t want to wear a belt!  </li>
            <li>Love me some problem solvers!!!</li>
            <li>GREAT product...highly endorse.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I saw this on TV and thought it was a great idea.  </li>
            <li>They work great without the bulk in front.</li>
            <li>It could just be the way women in my family are shaped, but it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>so it would sit in the loops better, but works awesome!</li>
            <li>and I loved them</li>
            <li>good idea hope it works .I</li>
            <li>Good product, it does indeed hold your jeans up and eliminates the gap.  </li>
            <li>a good replacement belt when you are losing weight.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my jeans fit perfectly again!  </li>
            <li>Good idea,</li>
            <li>A great idea and works mainly OK.</li>
            <li>I love this product - works great instead of a belt.  </li>
            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Great idea and easy to move from one pair of pants to another.</li>
            <li>all is good going to order more.</li>
            <li>When it did work it worked nicely</li>
            <li>and I liked the one I had before -</li>
            <li>So very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to adjust and  can&#x27;t be seen when you wear a top that covers your waist.</li>
            <li>Thank you HHH :)</li>
            <li>Works well and keeps me from pulling up my pants every 5 minutes :)</li>
            <li>I love these adjustable fitting clips for my pants and not just hiphuggers, I wear one on each side.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure by the time I pay for more postage</li>
            <li>it will cost me more in postage</li>
            <li>So much better than a buckle in the front.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s saved me a LOT of money replacing pants that would eventually have to re-replace when I lose even more weight.</li>
            <li>I would rather have paid $5 more and had it not fall apart as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you take the hip hugger off before you wash the pants.  </li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need a belt with this fashion gadget</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>this one works too, but just unbuckles more than I want.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea, but only 2 of my 4 girls liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super easy to adjust and to clip on to my pants.  </li>
            <li>the idea is great - but the clasps are strong enough to stay in place - the clasps need to be stronger</li>
            <li>This holds my pants up without looking bulky - the front of my jeans stay smooth</li>
            <li>If not, it just will not be a comfortable wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in front to not have the big belt buckle.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of not having to wear a belt and have the bulk of a buckle, and still have pants that fit well, with no gaps.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and eliminates the bulk that belts add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this over invisi-belts any day.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about these.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>Since that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re meant to do, I think they&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, apart from that, they certainly do make pants fit them better without the bulk of a belt.</li>
            <li>This is cheap elastic and the clips are only fair grips.</li>
            <li>I started using these during a weight loss program and have been very thankful for such a great product.</li>
            <li>These are a good buy and It keeps me from pulling up my pants all day long.  </li>
            <li>broke the first time I tried to use it!</li>
            <li>plus I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t receive my original postage back....</li>
            <li>It clips right onto your belt loops and is adjustable</li>
            <li>And, the price is right.</li>
            <li>If the belt loops are large the belt just creeps up and causes everything to be out of place!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the dapper snapper for babies and toddlers.</li>
            <li>I love these as my belts were breaking, and these not only don&#x27;t break, but are adjustable, as my weight fluctuates, and no one knows I&#x27;m wearing any type of belt!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Pretty art work on the box.</li>
            <li>It is completely adjustable, so I can make it fit every pair in my closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t make the back of the waist line on my pants bunch.</li>
            <li>I wore the first one out that I had after a year -</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why pants always seem to have extra large &amp;#34;waists&amp;#34;, but they do (I&#x27;d&#x27;ve thought most women have a waistline?).</li>
            <li>These were made much cheaper and the one clamp fell apart the first day I wore them.</li>
            <li>The belt is pretty bulky -- and that defies the whole idea.  </li>
            <li>The item came quickly and works great for those pants that are a little too loose in the waist</li>
            <li>The srpings in the clips aren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>I was concerned by some of the reviews about needing certain belt loop placement to work well.  </li>
            <li>Hidden from view and perfect for someone like me who lost over 30lbs in just a few months through illness.</li>
            <li>I used them so much the elastic died.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold very well and</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This absolutely saves me.</li>
            <li>Even the smallest sizes couldn&#x27;t fit - and this has made it possible for me to have something to wear!</li>
            <li>I have lost some weight but can&#x27;t really afford to replace all my pants just yet.  </li>
            <li>and they have started popping open all the time after about a year of light use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four star though because I do really like it</li>
            <li>This actually makes the top of the jeans smaller</li>
            <li>do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to buy new clothes because I knew once I recovered</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;ll fit no matter where the loops are on your pants (whether on the sides or above the back pockets).</li>
            <li>They can easily put on or take off their pants without the need to mess with a buckle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of losing weight and the Hip Hugger lets me wear my too-big pants a lot longer than I ordinarily would be able to.</li>
            <li>This item works with all my jeans regardless of how many back center loops there are or how far forward the side loops are placed.  </li>
            <li>complete junk.</li>
            <li>They have to tighten their jeans so much that the extra stretch seems to make the hip hugger ride up and sit against the skin.</li>
            <li>perfect because I hate wearing a belt</li>
            <li>And if that wasn&#x27;t enough -- the snaps keep unsnapping, they are not nearly as tough as they should be.  </li>
            <li>If the clips aren&#x27;t closed exactly right the &amp;#34;gadget&amp;#34; can pop off.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for helping to keep your jeans up in the back.</li>
            <li>If elastic is adjusted enough to properly close the gap in pants, the clips someitmes pop open, at unexpected moments.</li>
            <li>And I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the clips popping loose, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>came fast a little pricey for one .But</li>

            <li> came fast a little pricey for one .But</li>
            <li> The ones that liked it (ages 14 &amp; 16) wear them almost every day, but the other 2 (ages 12 &amp; 18) thought it was uncomfortable and just got in the way.</li>
            <li> The strap is flat and doesn&#x27;t show under a shirt.  </li>
            <li> I was ill for about a year and lost 30 pounds (didn&#x27;t need to) and was living in pajamas because I couldn&#x27;t fit into any of my clothes...</li>
            <li> Wish I had tried it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend trying to use it long term though.</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected!  </li>
            <li> The product quality was poor and the clamp broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> it bunches no matter how loose the band is.</li>
            <li> I have the black elastic ones and always wear a shirt on outside of pants and they truly help.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these because the waist on my pants/jeans are usually too big.</li>
            <li> She had lost some weight so the back of her pants would slip a little when she got up from sitting.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> But, not as &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; as expected.</li>
            <li> This broke after roughly 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> I agree with a lot of other reviewers here.</li>
            <li> This one, though, has one of the buckles that doesn&#x27;t quite hold together as well as the other one did.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I wasted my money -- don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> Takes a little finesse to put it on, but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> keeps pants or jeans from riding down</li>
            <li> My pants still fall down.</li>
            <li> I have one with a silver clip and one with a black clip.  </li>
            <li> Depending on the pants, it may bunch up and rub your skin a little, but otherwise no problem.</li>
            <li> However, I think I may have gotten one that is a little defective.  </li>
            <li> My friend showed me this product a few weeks ago and I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure what that is all about.  </li>
            <li> I have a bubble butt like Iggy Azalea, and pants are just hard for me.</li>
            <li> but I do have one complaint.  </li>
            <li> She tried it on immediately and said it was a little difficult to adjust.</li>
            <li> Very hard.</li>
            <li> Biggest issue is strength of clips is not great.</li>
            <li> Saw these and was skeptical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with this purchase!  </li>
            <li> no more annoying pulling up the pants or no bending because of trying to avoid &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible waste of money.....</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate these stupid pants that sit so low on your hips!</li>

            <li> I had gotten Hollywood hip huggers before and I loved them I used them so much the elastic died. These were made much cheaper and the one clamp fell apart the first day I wore them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to cinch a dress and coat in at the waist. Works perfect.</li>
            <li> I was ill for about a year and lost 30 pounds (didn&#x27;t need to) and was living in pajamas because I couldn&#x27;t fit into any of my clothes...didn&#x27;t want to buy new clothes because I knew once I recovered I would gain my weight back. Saw these and was skeptical BUT they WORKED LIKE A CHARM! I couldn&#x27;t be happier...GREAT product...highly endorse. Thank you HHH :)</li>
            <li> i love this! works well. no more annoying pulling up the pants or no bending because of trying to avoid &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> keeps pants or jeans from riding down</li>
            <li> Keeps my pants in place without choking me</li>
            <li> I was so excited about these. They don&#x27;t hold very well and it bunches no matter how loose the band is. I&#x27;ll just stick to belts.</li>
            <li> My friend showed me this product a few weeks ago and I was intrigued. I&#x27;m extremely short, so I don&#x27;t like to wear belts because they look bulky and make my torso look even shorter than it is. Plus, I have curvy hips and I don&#x27;t like the way belts pinch and create a &amp;#34;muffin top.&amp;#34; This accessory is the PERFECT solution. It clips right onto your belt loops and is adjustable so it&#x27;ll fit no matter where the loops are on your pants (whether on the sides or above the back pockets). This holds my pants up without looking bulky - the front of my jeans stay smooth and I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;plumber&#x27;s crack&amp;#34; in the back when I bend over or go dancing. WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> came fast a little pricey for one .But good idea hope it works .I want to get rid of the opening in the back of jeans plus all ways pulling up my pants .If all is good going to order more.</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps me from pulling up my pants every 5 minutes :) Love me some problem solvers!!! Great product.</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and works great for those pants that are a little too loose in the waist and you don&#x27;t want to wear a belt or have the extra bulk of a belt on your outfit.</li>
            <li> I love these adjustable fitting clips for my pants and not just hiphuggers, I wear one on each side. They have never popped open and they make my pants stay up. I started using these during a weight loss program and have been very thankful for such a great product. I have the black elastic ones and always wear a shirt on outside of pants and they truly help.</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate these stupid pants that sit so low on your hips! The only way to keep them up is to use these hip hugger extensions. This actually makes the top of the jeans smaller so you don&#x27;t have to keep hitching them up. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product, it does indeed hold your jeans up and eliminates the gap.  Depending on the pants, it may bunch up and rub your skin a little, but otherwise no problem.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these because the waist on my pants/jeans are usually too big. I had been wearing a thin belt but that just added bulk and didn&#x27;t give a smooth appearance. It is very easy to adjust and  can&#x27;t be seen when you wear a top that covers your waist. My only criticism is that  the elastic doesn&#x27;t have enough stretch if the belt loops are too close together.</li>
            <li> The product quality was poor and the clamp broke the first time I tried to use it.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with this purchase!  If the belt loops are large the belt just creeps up and causes everything to be out of place!  Definitely not what I expected!  I was going to return it but I&#x27;m sure by the time I pay for more postage plus I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t receive my original postage back....it will cost me more in postage then it&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I really like it.  I can wear my jeans all day without feeling that I have to adjust them.i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> broke the first time I tried to use it!</li>
            <li> I agree with a lot of other reviewers here. If you have evenly spaced loops, it&#x27;ll work like a charm. If not, it just will not be a comfortable wear. It&#x27;s exactly like the dapper snapper for babies and toddlers.</li>
            <li> This item is great! it pulled in the back part of my jeans with no gap.  I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Great idea and easy to move from one pair of pants to another. So much better than a buckle in the front.</li>
            <li> I saw this on TV and thought it was a great idea.  Works like a belt, but without the bulkiness.  I tried it out several different ways, but it did not work as advertised. It stayed on my belt loops but did not stay in place and did not hold my pants up like a belt would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of losing weight and the Hip Hugger lets me wear my too-big pants a lot longer than I ordinarily would be able to. It&#x27;s saved me a LOT of money replacing pants that would eventually have to re-replace when I lose even more weight. And I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the clips popping loose, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> I have navy &amp; white, too! They work great without the bulk in front.</li>
            <li> These are a good buy and It keeps me from pulling up my pants all day long.  I&#x27;d recommend them.  I have one with a silver clip and one with a black clip.  It doesn&#x27;t matter since my shirts cover that area.&lt;br /&gt;Now my friends want to order these.</li>
            <li> This absolutely saves me. I have a bubble butt like Iggy Azalea, and pants are just hard for me. Very hard. If you have a bubble butt, consider doing your butt a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> OMG--what a piece of junk even for the price.  I would rather have paid $5 more and had it not fall apart as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my mom. She tried it on immediately and said it was a little difficult to adjust. After wearing it for a couple days, she told me it still slipped and let the pants dip below, like belts. It could just be the way women in my family are shaped, but it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great in front to not have the big belt buckle.  Takes a little finesse to put it on, but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> The Hollywood Hip Hugger works great! So very easy to use. Wish I had tried it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> complete junk. opened the package (and i ordered two of these things) and placed it on the back of my jeans in the loops and it immediately broke. do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Hidden from view and perfect for someone like me who lost over 30lbs in just a few months through illness. Even the smallest sizes couldn&#x27;t fit - and this has made it possible for me to have something to wear!</li>
            <li> Save your money. Get a piece of elastic and sew clips on either end. This is cheap elastic and the clips are only fair grips.</li>
            <li> When you just don&#x27;t want to wear a belt these are perfect!</li>
            <li> It works exactly as expected.  In fact, I like it so well that I ordered a second one.  I also have an Invisibelt that I like, but, the advantage to the Hip Hugger is that it connects through the back loop to the 2 side loops of your pants and does not come around the front at all.  This is especially nice for trips to the restroom, because it eliminates the need to unfasten and refasten a belt buckle each time.  And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> A great idea and works mainly OK. I like the idea of not having to wear a belt and have the bulk of a buckle, and still have pants that fit well, with no gaps. But, not as &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; as expected. Biggest issue is strength of clips is not great. If elastic is adjusted enough to properly close the gap in pants, the clips someitmes pop open, at unexpected moments.The srpings in the clips aren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent belt replacement for my kids.  They can easily put on or take off their pants without the need to mess with a buckle.  Just make sure you take the hip hugger off before you wash the pants.  Otherwise it can detach during the wash and ruin the clothes.</li>
            <li> a good replacement belt when you are losing weight. I wouldnt recommend trying to use it long term though.</li>
            <li> Just loves these.  perfect because I hate wearing a belt</li>
            <li> Again, this is my third one - I love these as my belts were breaking, and these not only don&#x27;t break, but are adjustable, as my weight fluctuates, and no one knows I&#x27;m wearing any type of belt!</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need a belt with this fashion gadget but I do have one complaint.  If the clips aren&#x27;t closed exactly right the &amp;#34;gadget&amp;#34; can pop off.  I don&#x27;t care because this takes up the gap at the back of the jeans so well.</li>
            <li> This product has worked well for me.  It does what it advertised.  After two months, I am beginning to see some signs of wear, but I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my elderly aunt.  She had lost some weight so the back of her pants would slip a little when she got up from sitting.  She absolutely loved this product.  The strap is flat and doesn&#x27;t show under a shirt.  The only drawback is that the pants must have belt hoops for the clips to attach.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.  I even use it on my grandson&#x27;s pants as he is between sized and they do not make belts for 2 year olds</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but only 2 of my 4 girls liked it. The ones that liked it (ages 14 &amp; 16) wear them almost every day, but the other 2 (ages 12 &amp; 18) thought it was uncomfortable and just got in the way.</li>
            <li> Pretty art work on the box.</li>
            <li> I was concerned by some of the reviews about needing certain belt loop placement to work well.  I am not really sure what that is all about.  This item works with all my jeans regardless of how many back center loops there are or how far forward the side loops are placed.  It is completely adjustable, so I can make it fit every pair in my closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my jeans fit perfectly again!  I have lost some weight but can&#x27;t really afford to replace all my pants just yet.  This product lets me wear all my jeans, both one and two sizes larger than my current size and I don&#x27;t have to keep hiking them up all day.  It is comfortable and eliminates the bulk that belts add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this over invisi-belts any day.  I have two of those and they have started popping open all the time after about a year of light use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to adjust and to clip on to my pants.  I wish I had found this product years ago!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why pants always seem to have extra large &amp;#34;waists&amp;#34;, but they do (I&#x27;d&#x27;ve thought most women have a waistline?). So, these huggers come in handy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have given them 5 stars but my daughters have a problem with them in that they tend to ride up above the jeans. They have to tighten their jeans so much that the extra stretch seems to make the hip hugger ride up and sit against the skin. Not the most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, apart from that, they certainly do make pants fit them better without the bulk of a belt. Since that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re meant to do, I think they&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
            <li> This was a horrible waste of money.....I bought this because it was way cheaper than the invisible belts but I wish I would have just saved my money for the belt.  This broke after roughly 3 uses.  When it did work it worked nicely but it didn&#x27;t keep at all.</li>
            <li> This belt works great! It&#x27;s totally worth every penny! I love how it doesn&#x27;t make the back of the waist line on my pants bunch.</li>
            <li> Good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t really work for me. My pants still fall down.</li>
            <li> Love it. Depend on it. Works for me as it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> I love this product - works great instead of a belt.  It attaches to your belt loops and holds in place so you don&#x27;t have to have a bulky buckle sticking out of your stomach.  However, I think I may have gotten one that is a little defective.  I wore the first one out that I had after a year - but I wore it all the time.  This one, though, has one of the buckles that doesn&#x27;t quite hold together as well as the other one did.  It springs off a lot if I bend over.  I gave it a four star though because I do really like it and I liked the one I had before - this one works too, but just unbuckles more than I want.</li>
            <li> The belt is pretty bulky -- and that defies the whole idea.  And if that wasn&#x27;t enough -- the snaps keep unsnapping, they are not nearly as tough as they should be.  Overall, I wasted my money -- don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> Love! Highly recommend for helping to keep your jeans up in the back.</li>
            <li> the idea is great - but the clasps are strong enough to stay in place - the clasps need to be stronger</li>
            <li> great for those that need to snug in the waist a bit but don&#x27;t want to wear a belt!  wish it was a bit wider so it would sit in the loops better, but works awesome!</li>
