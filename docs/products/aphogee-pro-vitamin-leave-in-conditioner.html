            <li>Not as good as I wished.</li>
            <li>I have tried many leave in conditioners but this one is just great.</li>
            <li>one of the best hair products that I have ever used, I usually I&#x27;m not a fan of leave in conditioners but this one has changed my mind</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it because it leaves my hair full of body and bounce.</li>
            <li>Worked well for my girl&#x27;s hair type which is a 2a 2b type of hair, does have a nice smell to it and it does detangle their hair better than the main an tale leave in detangling spray.</li>
            <li>I have fine /relaxed hair</li>
            <li>i feel and see the huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that its a light spray so I can use it often.</li>
            <li>but I feel it&#x27;s definitely more useful ladies/gentleman who are trying to get healthier hair after neglect  (myself)  </li>

            <li>Oh and the spray bottle makes it super convenient to get in my  hair</li>
            <li>I bought this after watching the Glam Twinz on YouTube and this is one of the many products that I have bought from their advice on growing long healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love this treatment as I&#x27;ve have natural nappy hair and this product helps to alleviate the problems associated with combing and parting nappy hair.</li>
            <li>cant live without this light leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most definitely purchasing this again.</li>
