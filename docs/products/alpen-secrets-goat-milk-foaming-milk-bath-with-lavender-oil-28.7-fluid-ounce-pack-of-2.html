            <li>Love it for the bubbles, though.</li>
            <li>Most bubble bath irritates my skin but milk bath doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and makes your skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I truly did come out of the tub feeling very relaxed and happy.</li>
            <li>I love this for my bath.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it for a bath.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t like that it was mostly chemical.</li>

            <li>The packaging is super cute too!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but not at all overpowering, which is good for those like me who are sensitive to most</li>
            <li>my wife tells me its the best stuff on the market for long luxurious bubble baths.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not at all strong, however, and while I do feel it moisturizes, I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>Maybe the leaked amount was more product than I really needed, but I loved the bubbles.</li>
            <li>Lovely, mild lavender scent and</li>
            <li>I enjoy taking a bath in this foaming milk bath.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would certainly recommend it to anyone and will be ordering again</li>
            <li>My skin feels so nice and soft</li>
            <li>the scent it leaves on your skin last for quite awhile and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It has a true lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin and have an amazing light scent.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely (not too strong) and doesn&#x27;t appear to bother our son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Gives great bubbles and does make your skin soft, but what I expected was mostly goats milk because adding dairy to your tub will do that.</li>
            <li>And it gets you pretty clean to boot</li>
            <li>This is the only bubble bath I own.</li>
            <li>Nice mild smell, made lots of long lasting bubbles, and my skin felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>This two pack is an amazing deal, the bubbles last a long time and you don&#x27;t have to use much to create a nice bubble bath.</li>
            <li>Nice way to relax after a long day!</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is billed as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product but one of the first ingredients is sodium laurel sulfate.  </li>
            <li>(*sigh*) ;-)</li>
            <li>We really like this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I managed to put the lid back on without spilling any more.</li>
            <li>I just used that ine first.</li>
            <li>Scent is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This bubble bath is fantastic and it&#x27;s gentle enough for my kids, so they want to start on the tub for hours now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bubble all that much either.  </li>
            <li>I use about three cap fulls to measure how much I&#x27;m using, and it creates a foamy loveliness.</li>
            <li>Not as much bubbles as I was expecting but</li>
            <li>These bubbles really do stick around for forever.</li>
            <li>I use this after an intense workout cause</li>
            <li>A very inexpensive luxury product.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>It not only calmed him down but also made him fall asleep right after i dressed him, which leaves more relaxing time for mommy!</li>
            <li>Gentle leaving skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I live my bubble baths and this makes it so relaxing.  </li>
            <li>it soothes away my sore muscles, relaxes me and makes my skin so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>After making sure these were not a sign of an insect infestation, I began looking for other causes and ultimately read the warning on the label of the Aspen Secrets Goat Milk bottle to discontinue use if a rash or redness develops.</li>
            <li>Nice thick bubbles and rich scent and not overwhelming &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for lots of bubbles that stay for a whole bath, then look no further.</li>
            <li>Natural lavender scent.</li>
            <li>AND THE BUBBLES ARE SO SOFT AND SILKY.</li>
            <li>I use it for my 5 kids of ages as young as 2, (and we have been using it over a year), as well as for myself.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to those who like natural products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were lots and LOTS of super long lasting bubbles!</li>
            <li>It creates so many bubbles with such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li>and i thought maybe a bubble bath would calm him down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m addicted to the lavender oil, its strong enough to smell and make you relax but not so much to overwhelm you either.</li>
            <li>you can barely smell it</li>
            <li>Also tonight my 2 year old son was being especially cranky</li>
            <li>The spillage had caused the label of the leaking bottle to be unreadable, but at least the second bottle was fine, after I rinsed the product off its bag, I could read the label before setting the bottle (still in its bag)</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin so some bubble baths leave me feeling dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to the lavender scent, but it is just too subtle, hence why it does not get full five stars.</li>

            <li> So if your skin is sensitive, be careful!</li>
            <li> The description does say it is delicately fragranced, and it very much is.</li>
            <li> The only bubble bath I&#x27;ve had that lasts so long.</li>
            <li> it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> once I&#x27;m all dry, and there is no residue left on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> After using it for about a week and a half, I suddenly developed a horrid rash.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Everyday Shea lavender bubble bath as an alternative for a kids&#x27; natural bubble bath product.</li>
            <li> He gets little dry (eczema) patches at times and we haven&#x27;t noticed any issues thus far.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out our eczema prone skin</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the bubbles last a long time.</li>
            <li> One of the two bottles had a loose lid that allowed about 1/3 cup of the product to leak.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, subtle lavender smell.</li>
            <li> There were still bubbles when I drained the tub; that has never happened with any other bubble bath I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> , I just wish it were just a little stronger.</li>
            <li> so get it every few months.  </li>
            <li> The bubbles last for a long time too, way after the water has turned cold.</li>
            <li> There are still bubbles in the tub hours after it drains (though it doesn&#x27;t leave a slick residue.)</li>
            <li> Smooth,great for brushes--easy (scent nice-little bubbles for in bath or using small bowls with water.</li>
            <li> There were still bubbles after adding my usual bath oils and even after using a bar soap.</li>
            <li> Some spots looked like small blood blisters.</li>
            <li> A delicate fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> In the bends of my arms, behind my knees, and on my breasts, I looked as though I had been scalded.</li>
            <li> The rash has been itchy and very ugly, but thank God, after careful  doctoring with antibiotic and allergen cremes, it is almost gone.</li>

            <li> This product is billed as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product but one of the first ingredients is sodium laurel sulfate.  It doesn&#x27;t bubble all that much either.  I would recommend Everyday Shea lavender bubble bath as an alternative for a kids&#x27; natural bubble bath product.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin so some bubble baths leave me feeling dry and itchy.  I&#x27;ve never had that problem with Alpen Secrets Goat Milk.  Nice way to relax after a long day!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for lots of bubbles that stay for a whole bath, then look no further. This bubble bath is fantastic and it&#x27;s gentle enough for my kids, so they want to start on the tub for hours now. (*sigh*) ;-)</li>
            <li> Really nice bubble foam.  Natural lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Nice thick bubbles and rich scent and not overwhelming &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;.  Good product and I will purchase again.  Makes bath time a delight.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! It creates so many bubbles with such a small amount of product. I use about three cap fulls to measure how much I&#x27;m using, and it creates a foamy loveliness. The bubbles last for a long time too, way after the water has turned cold. My skin feels so nice and soft once I&#x27;m all dry, and there is no residue left on the skin at all. The description does say it is delicately fragranced, and it very much is. I was looking forward to the lavender scent, but it is just too subtle, hence why it does not get full five stars. It does have a lovely fragrance, I just wish it were just a little stronger. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you want bubbles in your bath than this is not it..</li>
            <li> Amazing! Leaves skin soft, subtle lavender smell.</li>
            <li> This two pack is an amazing deal, the bubbles last a long time and you don&#x27;t have to use much to create a nice bubble bath. It smells great!</li>
            <li> Nice mild smell, made lots of long lasting bubbles, and my skin felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> Not as much bubbles as I was expecting but the scent it leaves on your skin last for quite awhile and smells really good.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh smell.  Foams well.</li>
            <li> Since using this during my sons bath he no longer has dry/rough bumps on the back of his arms. Very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> These bubbles really do stick around for forever. The only bubble bath I&#x27;ve had that lasts so long. There are still bubbles in the tub hours after it drains (though it doesn&#x27;t leave a slick residue.) The fragrance is not at all strong, however, and while I do feel it moisturizes, I&#x27;ve had better. Love it for the bubbles, though.</li>
            <li> I like this line of milk bath.  Most bubble bath irritates my skin but milk bath doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You have to put a lot of it...&lt;br /&gt;If not:&lt;br /&gt;1.  not enough bubbles&lt;br /&gt;2.  you can barely smell it</li>
            <li> I use this after an intense workout cause it soothes away my sore muscles, relaxes me and makes my skin so incredibly soft! I&#x27;m addicted to the lavender oil, its strong enough to smell and make you relax but not so much to overwhelm you either. Also tonight my 2 year old son was being especially cranky and i thought maybe a bubble bath would calm him down. It not only calmed him down but also made him fall asleep right after i dressed him, which leaves more relaxing time for mommy! I love this product and would certainly recommend it to anyone and will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Smooth,great for brushes--easy (scent nice-little bubbles for in bath or using small bowls with water. Rating great product-for all brush users</li>
            <li> Smells great. I live my bubble baths and this makes it so relaxing.  Nice scent and makes your skin smooth and moist. Great deal for two bottles it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy taking a bath in this foaming milk bath.  Leaves skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> received in find order</li>
            <li> Heavenly!! Does not dry out skin and have an amazing light scent. Oodles of moisturizing bubbles. A very inexpensive luxury product.</li>
            <li> Best bubble bath ever. Lavender is awesome too, very relaxing and skin softening.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS AND THE BUBBLES ARE SO SOFT AND SILKY.</li>
            <li> We really like this stuff!  It smells lovely (not too strong) and doesn&#x27;t appear to bother our son&#x27;s sensitive skin.  He gets little dry (eczema) patches at times and we haven&#x27;t noticed any issues thus far.  The packaging is super cute too!</li>
            <li> Well, first I must explain that the package did not arrive in perfect shape. One of the two bottles had a loose lid that allowed about 1/3 cup of the product to leak. I decided to just open it in the bathtub rather than sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a nice surprise when I realized that each bottle was bagged separately and THEN bagged together. I opened the outer plastic bag under the running water, (some of the product had also leaked from the inner bag into this bigger bag,)  and then I opened the bag holding the leaky bottle. I managed to put the lid back on without spilling any more. The spillage had caused the label of the leaking bottle to be unreadable, but at least the second bottle was fine, after I rinsed the product off its bag, I could read the label before setting the bottle (still in its bag) aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is wonderful! The smell is nice, but not at all overpowering, which is good for those like me who are sensitive to most perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were lots and LOTS of super long lasting bubbles! Maybe the leaked amount was more product than I really needed, but I loved the bubbles. I played and giggled like one of my grandchildren! There were still bubbles after adding my usual bath oils and even after using a bar soap. There were still bubbles when I drained the tub; that has never happened with any other bubble bath I&#x27;ve tried. I truly did come out of the tub feeling very relaxed and happy. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but well worth it. A little goes a long way and the bubbles last a long time. Also has a great fragrance and helps sooth the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this for my bath.  I have a regular order so get it every few months.  It has a true lavender scent.  It does not seem to dy my skin.</li>
            <li> we really love this foaming milk bath, leaves the skin feeling great and makes cleaning the tub a breeze. no residual on the tub.</li>
            <li> Very nice silky bath nice foaming action</li>
            <li> What a great bubble bath! It has a very nice fragrance and LOTS of creamy bubbles. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel itchy, either. All around great.</li>
            <li> This is the only bubble bath I own. I use it for my 5 kids of ages as young as 2, (and we have been using it over a year), as well as for myself. Lovely, mild lavender scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry out our eczema prone skin (I have two ginger babies by the way).</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it for a bath. Also, I tried it as a shower gel. It makes skin softer and smells neutrally which I like. I recommend it to those who like natural products.</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot to get the tub bubbly. The smell is just so-so. I doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Scent is pleasant but not overwhelming. Good ingredients and a good price. Suitable for kids and adults.</li>
            <li> Its creamy and nice. I ordered 4 bottles. Only one was a bit leaky upon arrival. I just used that ine first.</li>
            <li> The product is pleasant and lives up to the reviews--except that, for me, it became a disaster. After using it for about a week and a half, I suddenly developed a horrid rash. In the bends of my arms, behind my knees, and on my breasts, I looked as though I had been scalded. Some spots looked like small blood blisters. After making sure these were not a sign of an insect infestation, I began looking for other causes and ultimately read the warning on the label of the Aspen Secrets Goat Milk bottle to discontinue use if a rash or redness develops. The rash has been itchy and very ugly, but thank God, after careful  doctoring with antibiotic and allergen cremes, it is almost gone. So if your skin is sensitive, be careful!</li>
            <li> Gives great bubbles and does make your skin soft, but what I expected was mostly goats milk because adding dairy to your tub will do that. However, I didn&#x27;t like that it was mostly chemical.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Bath milk addict.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy. Gentle leaving skin feeling soft and silky. A delicate fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there (I take bubble baths that would make Kim Kardasian jealous) and this is some of the best i&#x27;ve found.  Canus makes good stuff too if you can find it.</li>
            <li> ..................my wife tells me its the best stuff on the market for long luxurious bubble baths. great fragrance, tons of bubbles and no oily film. The best thing is Momma is happy...........................</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good. Almost fell asleep in the bath while using this. And it gets you pretty clean to boot</li>
