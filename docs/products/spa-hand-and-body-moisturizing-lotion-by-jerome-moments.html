            <li> I use for legs, arms and face........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good but for the fact it contains PARABENS......SHOULD IT NOT THEN I WOULD CONSIDER CONTINUING OT PURCHASE...AS OTHERWISE AY SWITCH TO  St. Ives THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN PARABENS</li>
            <li> They use this cream at my nail salon.  I&#x27;m so happy I was able to find it online. It has a strong scent at first. So fresh! I love the way my skins feels. It was shipped so so fast too!</li>
            <li> I sooooo like this lotion. A friend gave me a big bottle a while back, and I have used it up. I am now looking to buy some more. It is a wonderful lotion that really moisturizes without feeling like you have a plastic bag on your skin. You can even use it in the summer without your skin over heating (same plastic bag.) I put a little water on my face and then apply the lotion and it feels great. It&#x27;s not heavy and greasy and when you perspire, it doesn&#x27;t make you feel hotter, like your skin is boiling. JP-Spa is a winner. Try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many lotions before, as most other women but this one even my husband will use.  Light fragrance, non-greasy, ok to mix with perfumes without getting over powered.  Its also a great value as most other lotions cost an arm and a leg for 3-4 oz.  When it goes on sale I stock up.  I will be giving these as gifts in the near future.</li>
            <li> Spa Lotion is a super value , really helped moisterize my dry , cracked hands and fingertips .&lt;br /&gt;Wife loves it , use it at the office , the cottage and at home.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for gift giving , its 34.0 oz. size makes it a super value for the price.</li>

            <li> I have very dry hands and body and love this lotion. Stays with you all day and has a nice scent, not over powering.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great feel.  I discovered this lotion at the venue where I dance.  I just had to have some of my own.  I love it.</li>

            <li> I have bought this body cream for years.  I put it on after showering and before I put on my shoes.  No cracked heels.  Also, I put it on  the evening on my hands and feet with gloves and socks respectively -- especially in the winter to avoid cracked and chafed skin.  Great product.  Performs beyond expectations and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great item will buy more of this. The price was OK could be lowered but I still will buy it.</li>
            <li> I have recently brought this lotion in a perfume shop. It has a wonderful smell and you can layer your perfume lotions and sprays with this without the scents mixing together. My skin is really soft and if a put this lotion on after I shower at night before bed, I do not have to reapply in the morning. This is some good stuff! Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Jerome Privee Spa Lotion is one of the BEST lotions that I have ever used! I would absolutely recommend it to everyone no matter what age or ethnic background.

If you want the best of the best without paying an arm and a leg you must try this lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this lotion for a number of years.  I really like it as it does not have a strong scent at all and keeps my skin from getting dried out especially in the winter.  It is not greasy at all either.</li>
            <li> They changed the formula! BOO! I used this for so long, and now it&#x27;s completely different.Runny,and it smells terrible. What happened?!? :(</li>
