            <li>The reason I say it&#x27;s okay is because, for me, it works well as a concealer.</li>
            <li>, many may ask how do you know it was the product</li>
            <li>Totally Love this whitening</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The cream leaves a white-ish residue into the skin and maybe that why its better for lighter skin.</li>
            <li>(Not holding my breathe :)</li>
            <li>(I recommend this for all skin types and Tones) and did I mention, that all of my acne is gone. :-)</li>
            <li>Product came to me melted to the top of container and leaking around the cap as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like geisha makeup.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping. :-)</li>
            <li>I think i just need to use it more often</li>
            <li>My mOm helped me buy this :)</li>
            <li>I jest start using for all most week  </li>
            <li>it rely works :)</li>

            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I really love this product, takes a while to see some changes</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering 2 more and about to order pack of 12 for me and my friends.</li>
            <li>do anyone know of any faster better results with another product?</li>
            <li>Probably buying a 12 unit one is better.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Mena is pretty product that works for fair skin that was damage cuz of discoloration or sun damage</li>
            <li>This dark spot skin cream is the best!</li>
            <li>I saw quite a difference in my dark spots (became lighter)  and was a great moisturiser!  </li>
            <li>i order this product hoping that it will light up my skin .</li>
            <li>.. wat its only $4.00 &amp;dats for two great deal....</li>
            <li>This works great to even out my tone and bring it back to where it&#x27;s supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>But it helps smooth the skin out.</li>
            <li>youre skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered it because I&#x27;d heard such great things about the product.  </li>
            <li>THE FRIENDLY \\&quot;GHOST</li>
            <li>;-) I ordered this product , Because i wanted my skin to be even as well a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>What I read about the cream when applied is true.  </li>
            <li>You think you are getting a jar full, BUT YOU ARE NOT.  </li>
            <li>ðŸ˜Ÿ thought it was full of it</li>
            <li>It takes time to work but the result is really cool  .</li>
            <li>i jus hope it is the same one I rely loved that cream.</li>
            <li>the facial whitening cream is good..</li>
            <li>And over all product works very quickly and its sort of like a powder when you first apply it your face</li>
            <li>It arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>so  quick that it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not doing much to help me out there.</li>
            <li>, the first day I used it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference in the whitening, but it is great for my teenage daughter who has acne.</li>
            <li>My skin already pale so this blended in great with mine.</li>
            <li>Other wise thumbs up.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t belive it also, but it really does :) it shipped pretty fast, 3 days</li>
            <li>i also used it on my sun burns and it lightened it right up .</li>
            <li>Not as effective as expected</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly work like I thought it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product I was on youtube.</li>
            <li>but the cream only comes on the top layer of the container.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I actually had to pry the top off to reveal nothing inside.</li>
            <li>First time writing a review for a product.</li>
            <li>and I have to say at first</li>
            <li>Its thick and luxurious and smells great.</li>
            <li>So Smooth And Soft.....</li>
            <li>it works really well!</li>
            <li>Really apperiate him  and the product!</li>
            <li>The only thing is it&#x27;s so hard to scrub off your face, but it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a big significant or obvious lightening but my overall tone looks great.</li>
            <li>i really do my research before buying things &amp; i made sure i did a lot of searching before i actually bought this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting some positive result</li>
            <li>I tried it, it did absolutely nothing,  I used both until it was completely gone still nothing,not worth a penny</li>
            <li>Thanks ,</li>
            <li>I have real  oily skin and these 2 products</li>
            <li>I just pray it works, I saw tutorials on how to use this cream on YouTube, thank you so much</li>
            <li>it really do wrk doe..</li>
            <li>it will have you lookin extra light.</li>
            <li>well I wont really say acne</li>
            <li>sum brown spots really .well</li>
            <li>and my skin is very mooth.</li>
            <li>lets start from the very beginning , I used this product for about a month before i started having problems ...</li>
            <li>But im very dissapointed and is still having eye problems till this day because of this product....</li>
            <li>It really makes my face brighten up.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I absolutely will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>DONT SPOIL UR SKIN for such cheap products.  </li>
            <li>It didnt do much for my scars and it smells like hair grease</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it much</li>
            <li>and I was really hoping this would help fade them.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i did not see fast results but i did see some results.  </li>
            <li>after a usage of pretty much a month or little more .</li>
            <li>Honestly, Being A Dominican, and Having A Dark Skin Tan, it Did Not Lighten My Face, but Yes it Did Clear My Scars And Pimples</li>
            <li>Have not seen much of a difference in complexion or dark spots, within 2 wks of ordering, as experienced with other topicals.</li>
            <li>After a mix up in the first shipment, the second order arrived within 1 and a half weeks, which was fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Not only does this product not do what it claims, it comes in this container that looks like it would be a full ounce</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>the skin on the top of both of my eyelids become very dry scaly and flaky the skin on the bottom was very sore and red</li>
            <li>I do not believe this product lived up to it reputation or at least to the videos I&#x27;ve seen on line, but I&#x27;m willing to give it some more time to see if it will work as it intended to...to lighten the skin.</li>
            <li>Ive had problems with my chin for the longest and cant seem to get it back right.</li>
            <li>mena is nothing new to me..</li>
            <li>Im  a light caramel toned, African American women.</li>
            <li>The one thing that people usually aren&#x27;t aware of with this cream is not used during the day, its not affective when you&#x27;re out in the sun light.</li>
            <li>I SO RECOMMEND THIS CREAM TO WHITEN EMBARRASSING DARK SPOTS!! :-)</li>
            <li>Leaves your face soft but u will break out haven&#x27;t notice a clear complexion  but face is much smoother and soft</li>
            <li>Well I received mena yesterday, and last night was my first time using it.</li>
            <li>av seen pictures of the cream it look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>This comes in small amounts but for the price what more can you expect.</li>
            <li>I tried this cream religiously for a few months and didnt notice any difference at all, but it does make a good concealer because it stays on the skin long.</li>
            <li>A Day Early (June 7th) , An d Realy Does Make Your Face Soft</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is a clearer representation as too how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li>the skin under my eyes became very elastic  but tightned back up after i stop using this product  </li>
            <li>I perfer a natural look.</li>
            <li>Its been 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li>The cream lightens so far.</li>
            <li>Still a bit too early to see if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>It really started working only after 3 days.</li>
            <li>I order two of the mena cream and used all of my first one and Only applied for maybe 4 nights of the second before I nothiced</li>
            <li>im black with honey colored skin tone, helped fade dark elbows and knees, very moisturizing on face, use it after facials to smooth and soften skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a honey skinned black woman and I have used this cream off and on for about 2 years, mainly to go back to my original skin tone after the summer</li>
            <li>, my eyes were very itchy and dry</li>
            <li>I really like this product but one it only last like 3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li>(major farmers tan)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get that cream no more but av jus ordered the mena cream al only be able to tel if its the same cream is by the smell of the cream.</li>
            <li>Love the product but not happy with packaging.</li>
            <li>This product has really lightened up my dark spots but as far as my complexion in general, it&#x27;s still the same color.</li>
            <li>Those good reviews on mena is fake!</li>
            <li>Does not work for African American skin tones for hyperpigmentated skin from old acne.</li>
            <li>This is Great for winter , i recomend you to use this in winter beacuse at that time its cold and not hot .</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on in day its very thick and doesn&#x27;t disappear easily.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly work like I thought it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product I was on youtube.</li>
            <li> but the cream only comes on the top layer of the container.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I actually had to pry the top off to reveal nothing inside.</li>
            <li> First time writing a review for a product.</li>
            <li> and I have to say at first</li>
            <li> Its thick and luxurious and smells great.</li>
            <li> So Smooth And Soft.....</li>
            <li> it works really well!</li>
            <li> Really apperiate him  and the product!</li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s so hard to scrub off your face, but it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a big significant or obvious lightening but my overall tone looks great.</li>
            <li> i really do my research before buying things &amp; i made sure i did a lot of searching before i actually bought this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting some positive result</li>
            <li> I tried it, it did absolutely nothing,  I used both until it was completely gone still nothing,not worth a penny</li>
            <li> Thanks ,</li>
            <li> I have real  oily skin and these 2 products</li>
            <li> I just pray it works, I saw tutorials on how to use this cream on YouTube, thank you so much</li>
            <li> it really do wrk doe..</li>
            <li> it will have you lookin extra light.</li>
            <li> well I wont really say acne</li>
            <li> sum brown spots really .well</li>
            <li> and my skin is very mooth.</li>
            <li> lets start from the very beginning , I used this product for about a month before i started having problems ...</li>
            <li> But im very dissapointed and is still having eye problems till this day because of this product....</li>
            <li> It really makes my face brighten up.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I absolutely will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> DONT SPOIL UR SKIN for such cheap products.  </li>
            <li> It didnt do much for my scars and it smells like hair grease</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it much</li>
            <li> and I was really hoping this would help fade them.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i did not see fast results but i did see some results.  </li>
            <li> after a usage of pretty much a month or little more .</li>
            <li> Honestly, Being A Dominican, and Having A Dark Skin Tan, it Did Not Lighten My Face, but Yes it Did Clear My Scars And Pimples</li>
            <li> Have not seen much of a difference in complexion or dark spots, within 2 wks of ordering, as experienced with other topicals.</li>
            <li> After a mix up in the first shipment, the second order arrived within 1 and a half weeks, which was fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Not only does this product not do what it claims, it comes in this container that looks like it would be a full ounce</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> the skin on the top of both of my eyelids become very dry scaly and flaky the skin on the bottom was very sore and red</li>
            <li> I do not believe this product lived up to it reputation or at least to the videos I&#x27;ve seen on line, but I&#x27;m willing to give it some more time to see if it will work as it intended to...to lighten the skin.</li>
            <li> Ive had problems with my chin for the longest and cant seem to get it back right.</li>
            <li> mena is nothing new to me..</li>
            <li> Im  a light caramel toned, African American women.</li>
            <li> The one thing that people usually aren&#x27;t aware of with this cream is not used during the day, its not affective when you&#x27;re out in the sun light.</li>
            <li> I SO RECOMMEND THIS CREAM TO WHITEN EMBARRASSING DARK SPOTS!! :-)</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft but u will break out haven&#x27;t notice a clear complexion  but face is much smoother and soft</li>
            <li> Well I received mena yesterday, and last night was my first time using it.</li>
            <li> av seen pictures of the cream it look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This comes in small amounts but for the price what more can you expect.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream religiously for a few months and didnt notice any difference at all, but it does make a good concealer because it stays on the skin long.</li>
            <li> A Day Early (June 7th) , An d Realy Does Make Your Face Soft</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is a clearer representation as too how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li> the skin under my eyes became very elastic  but tightned back up after i stop using this product  </li>
            <li> I perfer a natural look.</li>
            <li> Its been 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li> The cream lightens so far.</li>
            <li> Still a bit too early to see if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It really started working only after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I order two of the mena cream and used all of my first one and Only applied for maybe 4 nights of the second before I nothiced</li>
            <li> im black with honey colored skin tone, helped fade dark elbows and knees, very moisturizing on face, use it after facials to smooth and soften skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a honey skinned black woman and I have used this cream off and on for about 2 years, mainly to go back to my original skin tone after the summer</li>
            <li> , my eyes were very itchy and dry</li>
            <li> I really like this product but one it only last like 3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> (major farmers tan)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get that cream no more but av jus ordered the mena cream al only be able to tel if its the same cream is by the smell of the cream.</li>
            <li> Love the product but not happy with packaging.</li>
            <li> This product has really lightened up my dark spots but as far as my complexion in general, it&#x27;s still the same color.</li>
            <li> Those good reviews on mena is fake!</li>
            <li> Does not work for African American skin tones for hyperpigmentated skin from old acne.</li>
            <li> This is Great for winter , i recomend you to use this in winter beacuse at that time its cold and not hot .</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on in day its very thick and doesn&#x27;t disappear easily.</li>
            <li> When i wake up my skin feels soft and i noticed small white heads completely gone.</li>
            <li> at first cream was difficult to wash off , so i recommend you use something really brisk to scrub it off , but overall it leaves</li>
            <li> but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wishes to clear dark spots.</li>
            <li> Overall, using it twice a day, thin layer then moisturizer over it, has worked wonders, and quickly too.  </li>
            <li> The whole little thing was completely empty.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a cream to use she bought it off a friend Â£10 for a tiny white tub with pink lid thr wasn&#x27;t anything written on the tub.</li>
            <li> This really does not work people, this cream will clog your pores, your face will look dirty filled with black head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m A BLACK African American female</li>
            <li> a dark skin African American and my skin has not been lightened by this product but ance marks have disappeared.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> its smaller then expected hope it work for me</li>
            <li> I have noticed, however, a matte (grey) look after cleaning &amp; applying makeup.</li>
            <li> they where really smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it, but found this to work like a charm if I put a thin layer on my face, and then put on moisturizer over it, usually ponds.</li>
            <li> its original ill order again after using it</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t tell if it is fading the two small dark spots I have been using it on.</li>
            <li> My face was always darker than rest of my body and was dark brownish and my arms are almost white..</li>
            <li> ( If you were born with dark skin it won&#x27;t work for you as whitening product  but will work only it pimple scars and discoloration).</li>
            <li> and I have dark skin on my neck and inner thighs</li>
            <li> The only down side of this cream is that shipping took a month.</li>
            <li> But there was a small amount of the product in the top that I twisted off.</li>
            <li> u only need a little on yo face...</li>
            <li> Its not really a cream or a whitener</li>
            <li> Empty Packages.</li>
            <li> you are curious</li>
            <li> no thanks.....</li>
            <li> Absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> It came when it was expected to.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Its just plain white cream.</li>
            <li> Its very thick, So i mainly use it at night, If i put it on during the day i use Sunscreen with it.</li>
            <li> But other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and it may seem like you dont get enough cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this with other Mena cream</li>
            <li> I have sun damage dark spots and this cream helps lighten my  skin  </li>
            <li> I bought it not to bleach my skin but too get rid of the dark marks on my  face</li>
            <li> I have dark circles around my eyes because I work nightshift and after using it my competition seemed brighter.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a product that helped with my dark spots.</li>
            <li> It  has a thick consistency and it looks white when put on the skin.</li>
            <li> For dark skin it looks grey-white - Not pretty!</li>
            <li> And W.e You Could Lay Down</li>
            <li> Never had a chance to use it since I had an allergic reaction to a previous product.</li>
            <li> I recommend kojie san kojic acid, kills all the dirt and black heads on your face, gets rid of acne and smoothens your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I have a slight melasma on my cheeks and this has worked wonders to even it out</li>
            <li> otherwise it looks odd.</li>
            <li> The little I did use, my dark spots seemed lighter after using it...</li>
            <li> BUT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.IT JUST CAUSED A  MESS</li>
            <li> so I just waited a little longer..</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY..</li>
            <li> but a lot of brownspots and uneven skintone..</li>
            <li> dont waste your time and your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and visit a doctor for any problem</li>
            <li> , i say give it a few days 5 max</li>
            <li> I was originally pale ish</li>
            <li> And the mena is really hard to take off your skin and the bottles are so little</li>
            <li> This product is so small it</li>
            <li> But it is too small.</li>
            <li> YES it is small..</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is a tested product or not ....</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s small but you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> I had small pimple all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> only creates a fake white layer which looks so fake.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> i did not like that the tubes were so small i was scared to use all of it</li>
            <li> It about 1/6 of a bottle of chalky hard smelly paste</li>
            <li> and I hardly have to use concealer or foundation to cover.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all!!!</li>
            <li> It lighten my face got rid of dark spots, EVERYTHING!!!</li>
            <li> the size of a quarter, which sucks.</li>
            <li> shipping sucks because they mail it in a paper</li>
            <li> my complaint is the amount that is in the jars.  </li>
            <li> I currently have 4 packages of mena cream laying around my house because i am afraid to run out.</li>
            <li> it is thick and u will look lke CASPER</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now 2 monthes past estimated delivery date!?</li>
            <li> This item was very small</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> It seriously ligtened my skin to my arms level..</li>
            <li> It does not whiten anything, it leaves an ugly white residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> Fake product very little was in it and it was powder instead of cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve exfoliated and scrubbed my skin to remove this grey-ish look but its very hard to remove it.  </li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> but it came broken.</li>
            <li> , now I&#x27;m slowly getting paler!!</li>
            <li> i wished i would&#x27;ve known about this years ago instead of buying all that expensive stuff for acne..</li>
            <li> the quantity is vary poorly and nothing has changed!</li>
            <li> Bad smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping I want be disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a worthless piece of junk and a rip off.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is so small it the size of a quarter, which sucks. But other than that Im use it and see if it actually works.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft but u will break out haven&#x27;t notice a clear complexion  but face is much smoother and soft</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do a damn thing.</li>
            <li> I just started using it.  But it is too small.</li>
            <li> I Actually Like This Product Because When You Put IT On Your Face And W.e You Could Lay Down And It Like Disappears In Your Pilow Or Something lol Anyways Thanks , And This Actually Came A Day Early (June 7th) , An d Realy Does Make Your Face Soft</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. Never had a chance to use it since I had an allergic reaction to a previous product.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as expected</li>
            <li> I got the product way before I thought, and it seems to be working, I don&#x27;t know yet.  It seems good.</li>
            <li> I love this cream... It actually lightened my skin...My face was always darker than rest of my body and was dark brownish and my arms are almost white.. I wanted to lighten my face...No product worked till now... Mena cream and C20+ lightening serum are the 2 products I was using on face and it is doing wonders on my skin.... I have real  oily skin and these 2 products are working... I love it... I bought a 12 pack product this week.... It seriously ligtened my skin to my arms level.. I cant believe it</li>
            <li> Mena does NOT work, trust me. Those good reviews on mena is fake! This really does not work people, this cream will clog your pores, your face will look dirty filled with black head. I recommend kojie san kojic acid, kills all the dirt and black heads on your face, gets rid of acne and smoothens your skin. I love it! (It also lightens the skin)</li>
            <li> Still trying but I don&#x27;t see any lighting of skin</li>
            <li> The mena wasn&#x27;t in the box it had no seals or nothing.thwart shipping sucks because they mail it in a paper that&#x27;s torn and destroyed with the mena sticking out. And the mena is really hard to take off your skin and the bottles are so little</li>
            <li> its original ill order again after using it</li>
            <li> I wish it had more cream in it , but it does work it lightened up my face i also used it on my sun burns and it lightened it right up . Just got it two days ago so lets see what happens it also very smooth om your skin . Works great !</li>
            <li> This product has really lightened up my dark spots but as far as my complexion in general, it&#x27;s still the same color. I&#x27;m happy it lightened up my scars but my goal was to lighten up my whole complexion a few shades.</li>
            <li> This is Great for winter , i recomend you to use this in winter beacuse at that time its cold and not hot . so the cream will work and your skin will become whiter .</li>
            <li> i order this product hoping that it will light up my skin . after a usage of pretty much a month or little more . i couldn&#x27;t see any difference. the only difference was when you apply the cream. it does lighten up the skin once you wash it away it disappear. may be that what is meant or but this is not what i was looking for .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even cream. It about 1/6 of a bottle of chalky hard smelly paste</li>
            <li> I tried this cream religiously for a few months and didnt notice any difference at all, but it does make a good concealer because it stays on the skin long. However, it doesnt do anything at all for my skin.</li>
            <li> Its not really a cream or a whitener it just makes you look whiter until you take the make up substance off your face</li>
            <li> Empty Packages. Please don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
            <li> Does not work for African American skin tones for hyperpigmentated skin from old acne. Waste of money. Giving one star because I have 2.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it just felt too oily on my skin and I used for two months and did not see any results.</li>
            <li> Does brighten face my face with continued used after 4 days of use. Good product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just pray it works, I saw tutorials on how to use this cream on YouTube, thank you so much</li>
            <li> What I read about the cream when applied is true.  It  has a thick consistency and it looks white when put on the skin. The little I did use, my dark spots seemed lighter after using it... my complaint is the amount that is in the jars.  You think you are getting a jar full, BUT YOU ARE NOT.  I question even it&#x27;s one ounce???  My only suggestion is a clearer representation as too how much product you are getting.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly work like I thought it was supposed to. I thought it was supposed to help lighten scars/blemishes but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not doing much to help me out there. The reason I say it&#x27;s okay is because, for me, it works well as a concealer.</li>
            <li> I WAS SO HAPPY TO TRY THIS PRODUCT BASED ON REVIEWS...BUT IT IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.. IT NEVER WORKED.. I AM OLIVE IN COMPLEXION SO I SHOULD HAVE HAD RESULTS WITH 1 MONTH OF USE. BUT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.IT JUST CAUSED A  MESS ON MY PILLOW WITH THE MASKY WHITE PASTE. NOT HAPPY AT ALL ):</li>
            <li> This dark spot skin cream is the best!, the first day I used it! I notice a difference the next morning... I used all kinds of brighting cream, and nothing works for me, but Mena. I have sun damage dark spots and this cream helps lighten my  skin  believe me this cream is the best! Try it you won&#x27;t be DISAPOINTED !!,&lt;br /&gt;happy Customer&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
            <li> Diz MENA CREAM is something eles I tell you..IF a person who dnt have paytions then nope dis ain&#x27;t for you ..

The trick to dat is lke two or three hours before u do your face put on mena ...then win u do your make up..it will have yo canvas very smooth foundation will Look FLAWLESS..as ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be HONEST I&#x27;m A BLACK African American female my skin tone is lke a carmel..and yes I do have ACNE..GOSH..well I wont really say acne but a lot of brownspots and uneven skintone..Dats were da mena cream come in at..It do fade away sum brown spots really .well aleast mines ...cuz everybody is DIFFERENT..DIFFERENT ..DIFFERENT.

            <li> Not only does this product not do what it claims, it comes in this container that looks like it would be a full ounce but it&#x27;s not. I used this product faithfully for a long period of time. It does not whiten anything, it leaves an ugly white residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well  and my skin is very mooth. Just not enough in a bottle. Other wise thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This product is TERRIBLE. lets start from the very beginning , I used this product for about a month before i started having problems ... my routine was 1. was face 2. apply mena cream all of over face 3. go too sleep 4. wake up and wash face. I ONLY applied at night . After using the product i start having problem with my eyes ... the skin on the top of both of my eyelids become very dry scaly and flaky the skin on the bottom was very sore and red , my eyes were very itchy and dry ALSO it created bags with lines under my eyes , many may ask how do you know it was the product might i add i have never had any of these symptoms a day in my life and i didnt start getting them till i used this product ...... I have bags under my eye and i&#x27;m only 19. I order two of the mena cream and used all of my first one and Only applied for maybe 4 nights of the second before I nothiced it was The MENA CREAM causing all my eye problems .... &amp;&amp; its not Allergy i have never had any none allergies in my life Also while using the MENA CREAM the skin under my eyes became very elastic  but tightned back up after i stop using this product  Also i didnt notice any lighting while using it either ... I bought it not to bleach my skin but too get rid of the dark marks on my  face IT DIDNT WORK .... if you buy before using i would ask your doctor ... Im not sure if this is a tested product or not .... But im very dissapointed and is still having eye problems till this day because of this product.... I TOTALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT !!!!</li>
            <li> Totally Love this whitening cream.&lt;br /&gt;It works great, noticed a difference right away on applied areas ðŸ˜€&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I&#x27;m not rating it a 5 star&lt;br /&gt;Is because the amount in the container is 1oz ðŸ˜Ÿ thought it was full of it but the cream only comes on the top layer of the container.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had a bigger size .</li>
            <li> I bought this product saw a review on youtube thought it would work, but instead It burned my skin. Not worth it at all!!!</li>
            <li> It really makes my face brighten up. IT&#x27;s small but you don&#x27;t need a lot. I have dark circles around my eyes because I work nightshift and after using it my competition seemed brighter. Everyone at work could notice. It&#x27;s like white foundation. My skin already pale so this blended in great with mine. And I used it between my legs where its darker. I know it says for your face but you can use it anywhere. But its great stuff. I love it.</li>
            <li> When I opened the container there was nothing inside. The whole little thing was completely empty. But there was a small amount of the product in the top that I twisted off. I actually had to pry the top off to reveal nothing inside. Maybe that is the way it was supposed to be. Anyway, I absolutely will not purchase again. Really can&#x27;t tell if it is fading the two small dark spots I have been using it on.</li>
            <li> Not at all. Its white cream, is that the white? Didnt work for me. Its just plain white cream. Bad smell</li>
            <li> This cream is EXCELLENT!! it works!! i wished i would&#x27;ve known about this years ago instead of buying all that expensive stuff for acne.. The only thing is it&#x27;s so hard to scrub off your face, but it&#x27;s wonderful. It lighten my face got rid of dark spots, EVERYTHING!!! I just went and ordered the mena extra mineral white cream and their soap to this!! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Very good product. Love it !!!! . It takes time to work but the result is really cool  . Love it</li>
            <li> First time writing a review for a product. It arrived fairly quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on in day its very thick and doesn&#x27;t disappear easily. I put it on at night.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, they said it was going to be 3 G of cream, there wasn&#x27;t even enough cream to fill up the lid. This is a worthless piece of junk and a rip off. I suggest you don&#x27;t oder this product from here.</li>
            <li> Honestly, Being A Dominican, and Having A Dark Skin Tan, it Did Not Lighten My Face, but Yes it Did Clear My Scars And Pimples</li>
            <li> Just received my cream today its smaller then expected hope it work for me Ive had problems with my chin for the longest and cant seem to get it back right. Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> Have not seen much of a difference in complexion or dark spots, within 2 wks of ordering, as experienced with other topicals. I have noticed, however, a matte (grey) look after cleaning &amp; applying makeup. I perfer a natural look.</li>
            <li> I got the cream and looked at Youtube videos on how to apply and use this cream. Its been 2 weeks so far and I see  no results besides a white residue that has been left on my skin. I use it for my underarms lightening and apply a generous amount every night. My under arm darkness is still there. The cream leaves a white-ish residue into the skin and maybe that why its better for lighter skin. For dark skin it looks grey-white - Not pretty! I&#x27;ve exfoliated and scrubbed my skin to remove this grey-ish look but its very hard to remove it.  I will give it another 2 weeks and try it on my knees to see if there&#x27;s a difference. (Not holding my breathe :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I wear it daily and have noticed all my spots are fading. I am a dark skin African American and my skin has not been lightened by this product but ance marks have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Im  a light caramel toned, African American women. ;-) I ordered this product , Because i wanted my skin to be even as well a healthy glow. Mena cream has done just that. It&#x27;s small and it may seem like you dont get enough cream. But the way i use it, I pick it up and dab/rub it on my face, like a stick of coco butter. It will last a while if you do it like that. Its very thick, So i mainly use it at night, If i put it on during the day i use Sunscreen with it. Awesome product, I will buy more. (I recommend this for all skin types and Tones) and did I mention, that all of my acne is gone. :-)</li>
            <li> I dint like it at all.plz don&#x27;t order it I bought mine and applied it on my face next day I had small pimple all over my forehead.DONT SPOIL UR SKIN for such cheap products.  It does not whiten ur skin only creates a fake white layer which looks so fake.</li>
            <li> Product came to me melted to the top of container and leaking around the cap as well. Love the product but not happy with packaging.</li>
            <li> It didnt do much for my scars and it smells like hair grease no thanks.....give it a try might work for you though</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e used this product for almost a year and it doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money people. I wish there was a product that helped with my dark spots.</li>
            <li> great experience when i first tried it. im black with honey colored skin tone, helped fade dark elbows and knees, very moisturizing on face, use it after facials to smooth and soften skin.  And it SMELLS LIKE A DREAM!!</li>
            <li> It is horrible! I got it to use for my legs, it&#x27;s chalky leaves a white residue and made me itch. I&#x27;ll stick to Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a honey skinned black woman and I have used this cream off and on for about 2 years, mainly to go back to my original skin tone after the summer (major farmers tan) and I have to say at first, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it, but found this to work like a charm if I put a thin layer on my face, and then put on moisturizer over it, usually ponds. This works great to even out my tone and bring it back to where it&#x27;s supposed to be.  Also, I have a slight melasma on my cheeks and this has worked wonders to even it out and I hardly have to use concealer or foundation to cover. Overall, using it twice a day, thin layer then moisturizer over it, has worked wonders, and quickly too.  Within one week melasma has lightened and my face tan is already starting to go away and is matching my neck (whew)</li>
            <li> The cream lightens so far.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the best quality product advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just white cream I rubbed on my face. It&#x27;s more like geisha makeup. Not what I wanted. I used it for about a month. Absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> This product came from Thailand so I had to wait longer than I wanted. I was so excited when I ordered it because I&#x27;d heard such great things about the product.  I was anxious to get my hands on it. It came when it was expected to. Its thick and luxurious and smells great. I&#x27;ve tried it for 2days now. Still a bit too early to see if it&#x27;s working. If feels great on skin.  It was packaged and recvd as advertised. So happy to have it.  I bought two and thrilled to have and use. Here&#x27;s hoping. :-)</li>
            <li> The cream was a wonderful product. I saw quite a difference in my dark spots (became lighter)  and was a great moisturiser!  After a mix up in the first shipment, the second order arrived within 1 and a half weeks, which was fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I tried it, it did absolutely nothing,  I used both until it was completely gone still nothing,not worth a penny&lt;br /&gt;please dont waste your time and your money</li>
            <li> the quantity is vary poorly and nothing has changed! horrible!!! this could actually be makeup for halloween. dont waist your money!!</li>
            <li> Mena is pretty product that works for fair skin that was damage cuz of discoloration or sun damage and it whiten skin. ( If you were born with dark skin it won&#x27;t work for you as whitening product  but will work only it pimple scars and discoloration).</li>
            <li> A great price for the product. I used this cream at night. When i wake up my skin feels soft and i noticed small white heads completely gone. I like it...it works for me. I haven&#x27;t seen a big significant or obvious lightening but my overall tone looks great.</li>
            <li> Well I received mena yesterday, and last night was my first time using it. I&#x27;m just hoping I want be disappointed and I get the results that im looking for.</li>
            <li> did nothing for me, no change. was delivered on time, but  no change that I seen</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference in the whitening, but it is great for my teenage daughter who has acne.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything like the product indicated. Just left my face feeling and looking like i was a mummy. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it much but i have seen some results on getting my skin lightener. I think i just need to use it more often so i can see results. It did take a while to get here.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. I wish I send it back.</li>
            <li> My Aunt Loves This Product.It makes The Skin So Smooth And Soft.....Perfect For Nighttime Use.The Face Looks Rejuvenated And Refreshed In The Mornings!</li>
            <li> This item was very small and I was fooled into thinking that the cream was in a container. I soon realized that the cream was only on  the surface of the container. No changes were made to my marks that would  require me to repurchase. The white &amp;#34;Gersha&amp;#34; face look I had, could  only have been removed by thorough washing.</li>
            <li> My mOm helped me buy this :) I was originally pale ish and I got tanner, now I&#x27;m slowly getting paler!! Or back to&lt;br /&gt;My color ^____^ I&#x27;m 13,and girls my age wanting to buy this, buy it! It works! I didn&#x27;t belive it also, but it really does :) it shipped pretty fast, 3 days</li>
            <li> Fake product very little was in it and it was powder instead of cream</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it as often as I am suppose to. So I don&#x27;t know if it lightens the skin. But it helps smooth the skin out. The texture of it I should say</li>
            <li> This cream puts a white mask on your face, that&#x27;s it! I&#x27;m wondering if that is the idea of brightening your skin. If it is, that&#x27;s not what I want.  I have acne post marks and I was really hoping this would help fade them. If it fades or not, I will have to keep using to see.</li>
            <li> i really do my research before buying things &amp; i made sure i did a lot of searching before i actually bought this. I currently have 4 packages of mena cream laying around my house because i am afraid to run out. it works really well!</li>
            <li> I do not believe this product lived up to it reputation or at least to the videos I&#x27;ve seen on line, but I&#x27;m willing to give it some more time to see if it will work as it intended to...to lighten the skin.</li>
            <li> I jest start using for all most week  and I start saying the result. It make my skin got lighter but i am hoping to get to the point where i want to be since my skin are in different shed.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a cream to use she bought it off a friend Â£10 for a tiny white tub with pink lid thr wasn&#x27;t anything written on the tub. Her friend used to sell em. I had alot of scars on my face it got rid of all the scars and lightened my skin the cream my sister got me looks like the mena cream I can&#x27;t get that cream no more but av jus ordered the mena cream al only be able to tel if its the same cream is by the smell of the cream. av seen pictures of the cream it look exactly the same. i jus hope it is the same one I rely loved that cream. I will write a review on it if it is the same cream if it is trust me it rely works :)</li>
            <li> Takes 2 or more Weeks to see results but it works</li>
            <li> Nice cream, it makes my face a bit powdery but it works. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the facial whitening cream is good.. and I&#x27;m getting some positive result .hopefully I may recommend to my friends.this product may be good for my face.</li>
            <li> Seeing results in texture of skin...bumps on face are smoothing. Very impressed by the results within a week of use.</li>
            <li> the product was advertised for all skin tones, but when you put it on it doesnt rub into your skin, leaving you looking ashy and moon-faced...</li>
            <li> My face is so beautiful now!! I really like this product but one it only last like 3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this with other Mena cream and actually it didn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money and visit a doctor for any problem</li>
            <li> This comes in small amounts but for the price what more can you expect. The one thing that people usually aren&#x27;t aware of with this cream is not used during the day, its not affective when you&#x27;re out in the sun light. For best results use it at night and make sure you protect your skin with sun screen when you do go out. If you maintain a routine this cream will work well for you, if not you will not see results.</li>
            <li> Excellent is awesome I love it..</li>
            <li> at first cream was difficult to wash off , so i recommend you use something really brisk to scrub it off , but overall it leaves youre skin feeling smooth and it does work , i say give it a few days 5 max and u will see results .</li>
            <li> Paid but never got my product! I figured my be it was lost or something so I just waited a little longer..it&#x27;s now 2 monthes past estimated delivery date!?</li>
            <li> So far so good! I can see a bit of lightening and its only been a week</li>
            <li> I really love this product, takes a while to see some changes but I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wishes to clear dark spots. Just wish I bough a bigger unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 2 for trial. It really started working only after 3 days. I ended up ordering 2 more and about to order pack of 12 for me and my friends. But to even out face and hand color you have to use it on your hand aswell otherwise it looks odd.</li>
            <li> i did not see fast results but i did see some results.  i did not like that the tubes were so small i was scared to use all of it so  quick that it wouldn&#x27;t work. do anyone know of any faster better results with another product?</li>
            <li> The only down side of this cream is that shipping took a month. But let me tell you this cream does miracles its been ONLY 2 DAYS AND I ALREADY SEE RESULTS!!!!! im Hispanic med skin tone and I have dark skin on my neck and inner thighs and I already see a difference. This is my first time using a whitening cream and will DEFINATELY BE ORDERING MORE!!!! I SO RECOMMEND THIS CREAM TO WHITEN EMBARRASSING DARK SPOTS!! :-)</li>
            <li> they where really smaller than expected.  ðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Came with pieces of hair in it.</li>
            <li> I did receive it but it came broken.</li>
            <li> Very small but it seems to work... Probably buying a 12 unit one is better. The 2 units lasted me about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This product is very great and the shipper is very very nice! Really apperiate him  and the product! He went out of his way to send this to my house in Fed ex rather than ups! And over all product works very quickly and its sort of like a powder when you first apply it your face but it absorbs and leaves the skin very smooth!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    </ol>
