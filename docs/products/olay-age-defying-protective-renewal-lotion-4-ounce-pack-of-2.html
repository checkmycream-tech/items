            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and love the results!</li>
            <li>Got a nice deal.  </li>
            <li>It did have that nice olay smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer for the face, with some sunscreen added, and it smells good, too.</li>
            <li>My favorite day lotion.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED THIS FOR MANY YEARS, EVER</li>
            <li>WHEN I AM 59 SOON TO BE 60 LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It is oil free and amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky smooth and firms it up nicely.</li>
            <li>Way more than I should have</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will try to find out if Olay has changed this product before I order any more.</li>
            <li>Nice as other olay product, it comes in perfect package.</li>
            <li>My skin still looks pretty good andI use this stuff.</li>
            <li>good stuff acts reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This product says it does not clog pores and is oil free.</li>
            <li>Great lightweight lotion for daily use.</li>
            <li>for the reviewer who says it clogs pores, I don&#x27;t find that to be true for me.</li>
            <li>I secretly love the &amp;#34;shock and awe&amp;#34; reaction of strangers who first hear my real age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who knows for sure if this lotion is the reason my face looks so young?</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Hope it will work as good as other Olay products.</li>
            <li>Absorb right away.</li>
            <li>and this is a great everyday face lotion -- not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s almost 60 years old, and has better skin that some women 10 to 15 years younger than her.&lt;br /&gt;I got this for her after she spent the better part of last year looking for this particular item in local stores, I was happy to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a short time but have noticed a nice improvement in the health of my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this...</li>
            <li>1/7/16 Received a new bottle of this today and am returning it.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m at a club, young men approach me thinking I&#x27;m close to their age (guessing my age anywhere between 22-35)!</li>
            <li>So I have been aware that this current Olay product is not what it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how long ago I bought my first bottle of this product - but it has to be over a decade ago if not longer.</li>
            <li>hope this seller still stocks the item when we&#x27;re ready to re-order because I will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
            <li>Proctor and Gamble should own up to the false advertising they are now engaged in.  </li>
            <li>Looking for a substitute, I tried several other Olay products available at the drug store with similar results.  </li>
            <li>I tried doing a search online and am only finding the old version.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the words &amp;#34;Age Defying&amp;#34; are no joke, as I am in my mid 40s now and look far younger than my years.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Got this for my mom. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Got a nice deal.  Smells good.  As a dude, I&#x27;m picky about not using feminine smells and this works.</li>
            <li> My favorite day lotion.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR MANY YEARS, EVER SINCE I WAS A TEEN. HAVE BEEN TOLD I LOOK 42 WHEN I AM 59 SOON TO BE 60 LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how long ago I bought my first bottle of this product - but it has to be over a decade ago if not longer. Apparently, the words &amp;#34;Age Defying&amp;#34; are no joke, as I am in my mid 40s now and look far younger than my years. When I mention to people I meet that I have one teenage and one grown son, they gasp in disbelief. When I want to buy a drink or a bottle of wine, I get carded. If I&#x27;m at a club, young men approach me thinking I&#x27;m close to their age (guessing my age anywhere between 22-35)! I secretly love the &amp;#34;shock and awe&amp;#34; reaction of strangers who first hear my real age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows for sure if this lotion is the reason my face looks so young? But I&#x27;ve been slathering it on twice a day (almost without fail) for years and hey, I dread the day I find it&#x27;s been discontinued! I&#x27;d probably go to every store and buy everything left in stock and try to freeze the extra bottles LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the reviewer who says it clogs pores, I don&#x27;t find that to be true for me. I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Being a person who has always struggled with acne, this is the ONLY moisturizer I can slather on without concern over causing a new breakout or making an existing breakout worse (foods definitely affect my skin). Other brands and types - even those specifically stating &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;non-acnegenic&amp;#34; (etc.) - have all been problematic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/7/16 Received a new bottle of this today and am returning it. The outer box does not match the photo - did Olay change its design? I tried doing a search online and am only finding the old version. This bottle, sold by &amp;#34;Top to Bottom Care&amp;#34; not only makes me nervous it might be a knockoff, but also it expires 3 months from now! Taking off one star. I will purchase locally instead.</li>
            <li> This lotion does NOT clog pores. It is oil free and amazing. It makes my skin feel silky smooth and firms it up nicely. It&#x27;s perfect for day wear! I highly recommend this... I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and love the results!</li>
            <li> This product says it does not clog pores and is oil free. It clogged my pores really bad and it did not help my wrinkles. Switching to something else. I used this for atleast 8 months. Way more than I should have but I must have been using it for the spf protection alone since it did nothing else. It did have that nice olay smell.</li>
            <li> been using for years,not too heavy,non irritating..and it works to take the tight dry feeling away end of each day.</li>
            <li> Olay has great product...been using it for years...very satisfied..good stuff acts reasonable price. Love it. Received on time...great service. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Used this for at least 20 years.  So I have been aware that this current Olay product is not what it used to be.  The last bottle gave me a bad break out.  Am now afraid to use.... Looking for a substitute, I tried several other Olay products available at the drug store with similar results.  Don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on at Olay.  Proctor and Gamble should own up to the false advertising they are now engaged in.  This is all bait and switch.  Bait with the traditional names and labels.  But change the formulas and hope no one notices.  While they are &amp;#34;upgrading&amp;#34; the Olay product line, they are also raising the prices dramatically.  BOOOOO</li>
            <li> Absorb right away. Less greasy that Olay Complete Lotion for combination skin.  My nose doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like it used to be when I run my fingers over it.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight lotion for daily use. Works well on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> This Olay product restores moisture to my face instantly and includes sunscreen in the formula, as well.</li>
            <li> good price and a coupon too.</li>
            <li> I never use anything else</li>
            <li> My mother swears by this product, and if her skin is any proof, it must be doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s almost 60 years old, and has better skin that some women 10 to 15 years younger than her.&lt;br /&gt;I got this for her after she spent the better part of last year looking for this particular item in local stores, I was happy to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has no complaints about the product itself, the shipping or the packaging - which is a big deal considering how picky my mother can be.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this seller still stocks the item when we&#x27;re ready to re-order because I will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a short time but have noticed a nice improvement in the health of my skin. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I often have dry skin and this is a great everyday face lotion -- not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> Nice as other olay product, it comes in perfect package. Hope it will work as good as other Olay products.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the same Olay I have been using for years, the same one the box shows, which says it contains beta hydroxy complex. So, I ordered 3 of them, but they are not the same as shown online. They do not say beta hydroxy complex on the box or on the front of the bottle. The beta hydroxy is supposed to be the age defying ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;If you read the list of ingredients, beta hydroxy is one of them, but perhaps the content is not enough to advertise it anymore. I will try to find out if Olay has changed this product before I order any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer for the face, with some sunscreen added, and it smells good, too.</li>
            <li> t I guess this has a sun block maybe. My skin still looks pretty good andI use this stuff.</li>
