    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That is impressive.</li>
            <li>If it smelled like real nice lavender it would have been awesome.</li>
            <li>And she loved it!</li>
            <li>it may work great</li>
            <li>While I feel it does a great job controlling odor</li>
            <li>And she&#x27;d been complaining about how Tom&#x27;s of Maine isn&#x27;t good at keeping BO at bay.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I worked up a good sweat too and</li>
            <li>Really good for the pits and healthy and best of all no ALUMINUM and my pits have never felt as clean as they do now.</li>
            <li>im off to buy more!</li>
            <li>I love this scent of Ozone Layer Deodorant!</li>
            <li>It has some great features, it went on smoothly, was moisturizing, and kept any body odor away all day (</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and I can&#x27;t detect any sweat smell, even after 8+ hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was received in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The smell kind of permeates too.</li>
            <li>Im completely thrilled with my purchase and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best deodorant I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and guarantees to eliminate all body odor!</li>
            <li>but I will say I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer :)</li>
            <li>I would love to give this 5 stars</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m giving it 4 because I do believe it could have more Lavender oil to help with the smell without hurting the product.</li>
            <li>I would love to see them come up with a solution to get rid of the &amp;#34;ozone&amp;#34; smell because I feel like they are on to something here, it just isn&#x27;t quite there for me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again because Crystal works great and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>More like citronella.</li>
            <li>(There&#x27;s a youtube video of a girl who keeps saying \\&quot;I smell like beef,\\&quot; which we find hilarious.</li>
            <li>(Love the lavender)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my sweat smell was overpowering or the smell from this was overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, but it&#x27;s better than body odor,</li>
            <li>but this was a strong scent that stuck with me all day.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell that takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>The smell lasts for a while and is quite strong.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the fact that there are no bad ingredients.</li>
            <li>I sound like I might be over selling it</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, in conclusion, this deodorant really works as advertised and is effective in neutralizing odor, but it needs improving when it comes to the lavender scent and the packaging (no expiration date).</li>
            <li>The lavender is very very strong and doesn&#x27;t smell much like lavender.</li>
            <li>Today is my 2nd day using this product and I must say while I&#x27;m not in love with the smell it has, I dearly think it could use more Lavender oil, that this WORKS!  </li>
            <li>She was really excited and can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>A+ this is an amazing product I recommend it to anyone who loves to stay fresh and help keep it natural</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender at all, it smells more like citronella to me and my super sensitive pregnant sense of smell.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved this stuff,but now that I have used it for a while I would  give this 3 1/2 stars if possible.  </li>
            <li>, i absolutely have to have a strong deodorant, even if im just sitting around, but</li>
            <li>Hope you like this as much as we do!!  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of an all natural, 3 ingredient deodorant.</li>
            <li>U specifically chose this line because I wanted a better smelling natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product and have been greatly let down.</li>
            <li>One thing i will point out is that it works much better if you start with clean, dry armpits, i swiped some on as soon as i opened it and thought, &amp;#34;aw</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of citronella in the first place</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so far so good, have yet to find a true alll natural deodorant that actually works and ozone layer is the first, thanks!</li>
            <li>i was sweating out mixed with the lavender making a more citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure results will be different for everyone based on your skin&#x27;s chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thats a mighty big claim, but i figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>So 2 stars because it works a little better than the natural alternatives, but too many negatives for me to want to continue using.</li>
            <li>pure torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually feels very light and natural on my skin, almost as if I weren&#x27;t using any deodorant at all.</li>
            <li>That almost makes it seem more like some kind of weird smelling perfume than a deodorant.     </li>
            <li>I really appreciated what they were trying to do when they made this...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>However, the smell is really off-putting to her.</li>
            <li>Well, the original phrase was actually &amp;#34;bees never forget&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and I am sweating a lot more lately at 31 weeks pregnant).</li>
            <li>main quibble is the smell.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this deodorant as it is only three ingredients (doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that!) and sounds quite different than other natural deodorants I have tried.  </li>
            <li>but then the next day i took a shower first and kept checking ALL DAY and was really amazed.</li>
            <li>it smelled more like citronella after id been wearing it for a few hours</li>
            <li>The ozone odor was very evident all day long.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s supposed to be lavender, it actually has a strong smell of citronella (perhaps due to a chemical reaction between the lavender oil and the oxygen?).</li>
            <li>This deodorant works really well for my young daughter who was starting to have body odor issues.</li>
            <li>I have been using natural deodorants for about three years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried myriad natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>Even ones that were specifically made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But thought I would give this one the old college try.</li>
            <li>So, depending on how sensitive you are to citronella, and if you like it at all, you may want to get the unscented version.</li>
            <li>but honestly this stuff smells worse than BO.</li>
            <li>but when I was pregnant with my 1st child I was told I had a bacteria overgrowth causing dark skin under my arms and for 4 years I&#x27;ve been trying everything to get rid of them</li>
            <li>, I put this on the 1st night I received and 24hours later that dark skin is almost GONE :)  to help cover up the smell of the deodorant though I did use a Lavender Essential oil spray I have</li>
            <li>have used every major brand</li>
            <li>and I might try it again when I am not pregnant to see if my nose is just too sensitive right now but for the time being this definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Product seemed to work well, but I soon developed an underarm rash that spread several inches in all directions.</li>
            <li>But for normal, everyday use, it works very well.</li>
            <li>first picked up a stick of it at the Farmers market in down town Southport, NC</li>

            <li> first picked up a stick of it at the Farmers market in down town Southport, NC</li>
            <li> … It was a little rough to put on at first and not the smoothest</li>
            <li> Skeptical as I was at first, I must say this deodorant really works as advertised.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after application, it didnt really smell like lavender (the scent i ordered)</li>
            <li> so I am past the detoxing stage though if you are currently using conventional deodorants it will take you a week or two to detox and really tell if something works.  </li>
            <li> It did not smell like lavender at all and the strange smell it gave was with me all day.  </li>
            <li> Being the idiot that I am, I was ignorant to this well known fact, and sure enough as soon as I took one step outside, the bees came back for what was theirs.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s supposed to last for a while, but in real-life, everyday usage, I&#x27;m not sure how much bang for the buck</li>
            <li> works well, but makes my underarms feel uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li> When my boyfriend&#x27;s sister put it on I could smell it down the hallway hours later.</li>
            <li> Have you ever had hundreds of bees crawling all over your armpits, with their tiny little insect arms pawing at your skin?  </li>
            <li> It does last longer than Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but you might still find yourself smelling a little funky a few hours later.</li>
            <li> but I am really not.</li>
            <li> The one I usually use is Green Tidings, which is amazing, but a little pricey, so I saw this one and wanted to try it out because it was alot less expensive and the reviews on it were 50/50.  </li>
            <li> Might try one of Ozone Layer&#x27;s other scents to see if it&#x27;s less pungent.</li>
            <li> On my body, its effect seems to be strongest for about 9-10 hours, after which the oxygen starts to lose its efficacy and gives off a slight ammonia-like odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something else I find odd about this deodorant</li>
            <li> Super sticky and a strong sickly smell IMO :(</li>
            <li> I was afraid that if someone got too close to me that I would smell funny to them even though I had perfume on.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because i haven&#x27;t had luck with any other natural deodorants</li>
            <li> With Green Tidings, I do not have to reapply.  </li>
            <li> So, I will be sticking to my Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> that makes me feel anxious.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter and I, as a replacement for YLO&#x27;s expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not an equal.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also quite small for the price.</li>
            <li> And some had such a weird smell that they made my sweat smell worse.</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t get past the smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never laughed so hard in my life;</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a less expensive organic deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I remember hearing the word &amp;#34;ozone&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; in the same sentence in a news broadcast in the 90s, so it must be bad</li>
            <li> Used it one day and got up the next morning and had really bad BO ..</li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely go with the unscented version next time as I&#x27;m not too crazy about smelling like insect repellent.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to put on as it as hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost worse to me than pit-smell</li>
            <li> But this is so hard it&#x27;s impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed I&#x27;ll go back to my crystal..</li>
            <li> Did not work at all and made me smell weird.</li>
            <li> Difficult to rub on my underarm skin.</li>
            <li> If I have a physical work day or workout though, it can be used as a touch up and destroys nasty odors on the spot.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT smell like lavender at all, it stinks</li>
            <li> Even thien it wasnt unpleasant or anything.</li>
            <li> FAILED miserably.</li>
            <li> Awful even my husband commented , thinking I had bad BO</li>

            <li> Product seemed to work well, but I soon developed an underarm rash that spread several inches in all directions. The ozone odor was very evident all day long.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated what they were trying to do when they made this... BUT from reading the package, you&#x27;ll see that this is basically a stick of bees wax.  So, whats the problem, you might ask?  Well, you remember that phrase, &amp;#34;An elephant never forgets?&amp;#34;  Well, the original phrase was actually &amp;#34;bees never forget&amp;#34;.  They know you have their beeswax.  Being the idiot that I am, I was ignorant to this well known fact, and sure enough as soon as I took one step outside, the bees came back for what was theirs.  Have you ever had hundreds of bees crawling all over your armpits, with their tiny little insect arms pawing at your skin?  I&#x27;ve never laughed so hard in my life; pure torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ozone?  I thought that was harmful?  I remember hearing the word &amp;#34;ozone&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; in the same sentence in a news broadcast in the 90s, so it must be bad and I&#x27;m not even going to do any further research.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible!!!</li>
            <li> I smelled like bug spray. I was sticky all day and noticed the smell perspiration. I did not do anything strenuous while wearing this, and for this, I am thankful. It sucks!</li>
            <li> Did not like the scent of this at all!</li>
            <li> Did not work at all and made me smell weird.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of an all natural, 3 ingredient deodorant. But this is so hard it&#x27;s impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> Today is my 2nd day using this product and I must say while I&#x27;m not in love with the smell it has, I dearly think it could use more Lavender oil, that this WORKS!  TMI - but when I was pregnant with my 1st child I was told I had a bacteria overgrowth causing dark skin under my arms and for 4 years I&#x27;ve been trying everything to get rid of them, I put this on the 1st night I received and 24hours later that dark skin is almost GONE :)  to help cover up the smell of the deodorant though I did use a Lavender Essential oil spray I have but I will say I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer :)&lt;br /&gt;In that regard I would love to give this 5 stars but I&#x27;m giving it 4 because I do believe it could have more Lavender oil to help with the smell without hurting the product.</li>
            <li> Oh lord, this one&#x27;s going back! Lavender?  NO, it smells like sheet rock mud, &amp; the smell stays on you for hours! Having a lot of contractors in the family means I KNOW what I&#x27;m talking about in this area. Feels waxy (of course it does have beeswax in it) and I couldn&#x27;t overcome the smell. Notice I didn&#x27;t say scent or fragrance. Return</li>
            <li> The lavender is very very strong and doesn&#x27;t smell much like lavender. After about one week of using this product I began to smell horrible and I had to switch to a different deodorant. I had high hopes for this product and have been greatly let down.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this deodorant as it is only three ingredients (doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that!) and sounds quite different than other natural deodorants I have tried.  I have been using natural deodorants for about three years so I am past the detoxing stage though if you are currently using conventional deodorants it will take you a week or two to detox and really tell if something works.  Anyways, as soon as this deodorant arrived in the mail I applied it as I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!  It has some great features, it went on smoothly, was moisturizing, and kept any body odor away all day (and I am sweating a lot more lately at 31 weeks pregnant). This is not an antiperspirant but  I couldn&#x27;t smell any body odor by that evening or even the next morning.  The problem I had with it was the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender at all, it smells more like citronella to me and my super sensitive pregnant sense of smell.  I am not a fan of citronella in the first place but this was a strong scent that stuck with me all day.  I am putting this away for now and I might try it again when I am not pregnant to see if my nose is just too sensitive right now but for the time being this definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I would love to see them come up with a solution to get rid of the &amp;#34;ozone&amp;#34; smell because I feel like they are on to something here, it just isn&#x27;t quite there for me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was received in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Difficult to rub on my underarm skin. Strong smell that takes some getting used to. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again because Crystal works great and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this a gigher rating! Seriously. I&#x27;ve tried myriad natural deodorants. From homemade, to store bought, and others from amazon. NONE of them helped with odor, and every one iritated my skin. Even ones that were specifically made for sensitive skin. And some had such a weird smell that they made my sweat smell worse. However, I am ecstatic over this deodorant. It smells amazing, and I can&#x27;t detect any sweat smell, even after 8+ hours. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works really well but I honesty don&#x27;t smell one hint of lavender. More like citronella.</li>
            <li> It works,  but I have to use scented body powder to mask the ozone smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a less expensive organic deodorant.  The one I usually use is Green Tidings, which is amazing, but a little pricey, so I saw this one and wanted to try it out because it was alot less expensive and the reviews on it were 50/50.  This one does not last. I found myself reapplying it every 2 hours. With Green Tidings, I do not have to reapply.  So, I will be sticking to my Green Tidings.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all. Super sticky and a strong sickly smell IMO :( they did refund my money.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wears this scent, and the coconut scent. When we go to the beach she puts on coconut.     Hope you like this as much as we do!!  ;)</li>
            <li> this smells awful !  it may work great but you won&#x27;t get past the smell!</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a gag gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister. (There&#x27;s a youtube video of a girl who keeps saying \\&quot;I smell like beef,\\&quot; which we find hilarious. And she&#x27;d been complaining about how Tom&#x27;s of Maine isn&#x27;t good at keeping BO at bay.) And she loved it! She was really excited and can&#x27;t wait to try it. I&#x27;ll edit once she has to tell you how it works.    EDIT:  So I wound up ordering one for myself out of anticipation. It does last longer than Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but you might still find yourself smelling a little funky a few hours later. I would not want to use this to go to the gym-- so it doesn&#x27;t make the cut for an every day deodorant.   There&#x27;s also something about the way it smells (I guess the \\&quot;ozone\\&quot;) that makes me feel anxious. It&#x27;s almost worse to me than pit-smell so I don&#x27;t know what to make of it. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t go away either. If it does go away, it&#x27;s because my pits stink.   The smell kind of permeates too. When my boyfriend&#x27;s sister put it on I could smell it down the hallway hours later. That almost makes it seem more like some kind of weird smelling perfume than a deodorant.     So 2 stars because it works a little better than the natural alternatives, but too many negatives for me to want to continue using.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this stuff,but now that I have used it for a while I would  give this 3 1/2 stars if possible.  While I feel it does a great job controlling odor and I like how it feels when it goes on, I am not a big fan of the way it smells by itself.  Also, it seems to get into my clothing and is tougher to wash that smell out.  If I have a physical work day or workout though, it can be used as a touch up and destroys nasty odors on the spot.  That is impressive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I personally didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that there are no bad ingredients. One application lasted all day. This is what I will be using from now on. (Love the lavender)</li>
            <li> Really good for the pits and healthy and best of all no ALUMINUM and my pits have never felt as clean as they do now. I dont know what i would do if i had never discovered this gem.</li>
            <li> so far so good, have yet to find a true alll natural deodorant that actually works and ozone layer is the first, thanks!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works really well for my young daughter who was starting to have body odor issues. However, the smell is really off-putting to her. There is seemingly no lavender scent to it. It reminds me of a lemony cleaner, like Pledge or Clorox. It&#x27;s strong, but it&#x27;s better than body odor, yeah? I wouldn&#x27;t mind it on me, but she doesn&#x27;t care for it. Might try one of Ozone Layer&#x27;s other scents to see if it&#x27;s less pungent.</li>
            <li> It does NOT smell like lavender at all, it stinks and I won&#x27;t use it.  If it smelled like real nice lavender it would have been awesome.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how well this stuff works! I was skeptical because i haven&#x27;t had luck with any other natural deodorants, i absolutely have to have a strong deodorant, even if im just sitting around, but somehow this stuff does what it claims it will. It claims it destroys the anaerobic bacteria that causes odor with the oxygen its infused with or something...thats a mighty big claim, but i figured it was worth a shot. One thing i will point out is that it works much better if you start with clean, dry armpits, i swiped some on as soon as i opened it and thought, &amp;#34;aw they got me again&amp;#34; but then the next day i took a shower first and kept checking ALL DAY and was really amazed. I worked up a good sweat too and im telling you this stuff WORKS, im never going back to standard deodorant. My only complaint is that after application, it didnt really smell like lavender (the scent i ordered) it smelled more like citronella after id been wearing it for a few hours but it might just be me and my bodys ph or the type of toxins etc i was sweating out mixed with the lavender making a more citrus smell. Even thien it wasnt unpleasant or anything. Im completely thrilled with my purchase and im off to buy more!</li>
            <li> wanted to like it but honestly this stuff smells worse than BO. Awful even my husband commented , thinking I had bad BO</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter and I, as a replacement for YLO&#x27;s expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not an equal. Doesn&#x27;t work so well</li>
            <li> I love this scent of Ozone Layer Deodorant! It is easy to apply and guarantees to eliminate all body odor! I play a lot of tennis and it also seems to work as a bug repellent!</li>
            <li> A+ this is an amazing product I recommend it to anyone who loves to stay fresh and help keep it natural</li>
            <li> This oxygen infused deodorant did not work well at all.  It was difficult to put on as it as hard but once you kept rubbing in to your pits it started to go on alright.  It did not smell like lavender at all and the strange smell it gave was with me all day.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my sweat smell was overpowering or the smell from this was overpowering.  I was afraid that if someone got too close to me that I would smell funny to them even though I had perfume on.  My perfume got overpowered by this deodorant.  I won&#x27;t be using this product again although I wanted to try something different than the Crystal.  But thought I would give this one the old college try.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells like deet.... U specifically chose this line because I wanted a better smelling natural deodorant. FAILED miserably. Wish I could return it</li>
            <li> Do not like this deordant .. Used it one day and got up the next morning and had really bad BO ..The smell was awful..Was very disappointed I&#x27;ll go back to my crystal.. I can use it one morning and the next day still no odor. Think I will try to get my money back..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best deodorant I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I first picked up a stick of it at the Farmers market in down town Southport, NC… It was a little rough to put on at first and not the smoothest but once you use it a couple days in a row you don’t even notice.&lt;br /&gt;I have used every major brand and they do not come close… I was shocked at how well it kept me smelling literally all day and night… It even made my shirts smell good. I sound like I might be over selling it but I am really not. My wife also loves it!</li>
            <li> works well, but makes my underarms feel uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li> Skeptical as I was at first, I must say this deodorant really works as advertised. It&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It actually feels very light and natural on my skin, almost as if I weren&#x27;t using any deodorant at all. I haven&#x27;t yet exercised after putting it on and so I can&#x27;t vouch for its effectiveness when/if sweating a lot. But for normal, everyday use, it works very well. On my body, its effect seems to be strongest for about 9-10 hours, after which the oxygen starts to lose its efficacy and gives off a slight ammonia-like odor. I&#x27;m sure results will be different for everyone based on your skin&#x27;s chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main quibble is the smell. While it&#x27;s supposed to be lavender, it actually has a strong smell of citronella (perhaps due to a chemical reaction between the lavender oil and the oxygen?). If I buy a product that&#x27;s supposed to smell like lavender, that&#x27;s what I want to smell. The smell lasts for a while and is quite strong. My wife jokingly asked me if it&#x27;s already mosquito season after I walked by her: she thought I was wearing one of those mosquito repellents. So, depending on how sensitive you are to citronella, and if you like it at all, you may want to get the unscented version. I&#x27;ll definitely go with the unscented version next time as I&#x27;m not too crazy about smelling like insect repellent. But then again, the smell might have the added benefit of keeping bugs away (wink, wink).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else I find odd about this deodorant is there&#x27;s no expiration date anywhere on the bottle. The bottle is also quite small for the price. I know on paper it&#x27;s supposed to last for a while, but in real-life, everyday usage, I&#x27;m not sure how much bang for the buck we&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in conclusion, this deodorant really works as advertised and is effective in neutralizing odor, but it needs improving when it comes to the lavender scent and the packaging (no expiration date). For this reason, I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars.</li>
