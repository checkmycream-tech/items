            <li>Earth Lip Balm is so Rich in Moisture</li>
            <li>This original is just that what he searches for.</li>
            <li>Beauty by Earth sent me a four pack of Unflavored Original Beeswax Lip Balm.</li>
            <li>So excited about these.</li>
            <li>I love the unscented--it really is unscented, it feels fine on my lips, doesn&#x27;t taste like anything, and doesn&#x27;t lead to break outs or anything, and no cancerous sunscreen included.</li>
            <li>PLUS I am happy they have alternatives to the normal mint balms you run into normally.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s all natural :-)</li>
            <li>The opinions stated in this review are 100% my own and were not in any way influenced by anything other than my own opinion</li>
            <li>A good price for a 4 pack and moisturizes better that other brand names.</li>
            <li>soft and buttery, this balm feels amazingly pampering going on, without greasy feeling!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking for a good quality lip balm.</li>
            <li>Natural and effective.</li>
            <li>The peppermint and 4 flavored pack is lighter with more of a coconut oil slickness and a pleasant sweetness (although a little distracting).</li>
            <li>Like other Beauty by Earth lip balms, this gives great moisture and protection to your lips.  </li>
            <li>i got it rather quickly from the day</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important because many natural lip balms contain soy, and I&#x27;m soy intolerant.</li>
            <li>Moisturized my lips quickly.</li>
            <li>And I love that the ingridents are all natural!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my fourth day of using it, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>They leave your lips soft and smooth , look no further for a great lip balm here it is ,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love their lip balms and they are all natural!</li>
            <li>The texture is very silky smooth.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try natural chapsticks and these were absolutely perfect , just what I needed , they helped healed my lips after a few usages and they keep them moisturized</li>
            <li>It is light and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The balm glides on smooth and really moisturizes your lips.</li>
            <li>and i love that it&#x27;s all natural because my kid has an obsession with lip balm and his lips are always chapped.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is the vanilla bean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received several promo offers and discounts and have been SOOOOO happy with the lip balms we&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Also I love the fact that it is 100% Natural and made in the USA.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s organic and natural which makes it even better.</li>
            <li>love that these are all natural</li>
            <li>And it is safe to use because it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love that these lip balms are all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry I gave you 3 stars, as you have other wonderful products and great service,  but this one didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>I bought all of them after my first purchase, (peppermint) because members of my family quickly squirreled them all away.</li>
            <li>The original plain (no flavor) is also nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need anything other than a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>Much smoother than the original peppermint</li>
            <li>They are just the right consistency, I find some lip balms to be to greasy, and these were just right.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I liked everything but the flavor (and felt the mint was actually drying, and wasn&#x27;t interested in flavor) and noted that in a review.</li>
            <li>I was able to use a coupon, which was great, because I am unlikely to spend $10 on four lip balms, but I just happen to make my own and recently made a very large batch.</li>
            <li>love using products that are 100% Natural and the Pure Beeswax Lip Care with Aloe Vera &amp; Vitamin E</li>
            <li>or you get a natural product that feels good - but only kinda works.</li>
            <li>The honey ones are better but if you like a more unscented plain one</li>
            <li>There are just so many things great about this lip balm I definitely recommend it and definitely plan to continue purchasing this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>It leaves my lips so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great flavors, long lasting, all natural, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>It does&#x27;t have a funny flavor or scents anything like that</li>
            <li>I think that stating an eco-friendly mission to use recycled products would promote a healthy company image, especially with the name Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li>All of the varieties work very well!  </li>
            <li>They really do the job!</li>
            <li>No uncomfortable dryness.  </li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>It feels like it does a good job moisturizing my lips without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li>this is so smooth and nourishes my lips like no other.</li>
            <li>Its unflavored so you don&#x27;t really have to worry about not liking one kind or the other.</li>
            <li>They make my lips super soft.</li>
            <li>The honey flavor turns my stomach a little, but the vanilla bean is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very soothing without being greasy, and I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I put it on my poor, hayfever-chapped nose, too, to great</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Really hydrates your lips</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not irritating my nose</li>
            <li>My husband really likes them too.</li>
            <li>Earth Lip Balm is really help keep my lips moisturized</li>
            <li>I found that the roll out mechanism worked well and the unflavoured ones worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about my lip balms</li>
            <li>It still feels very moisturizing and nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing without being greasy or waxy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really, really like this balm.  </li>
            <li>and I do not have a need to re-apply for hours after the initial application.&lt;br /&gt;Applies smoothly without caking and</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly, no flavor or scent, makes lips feel nice.</li>
            <li>I love the all natural ingredients and simple packaging as well.</li>
            <li>Without flavors, plain, and I liked it.</li>
            <li>It also lasts for more than 30 minutes like other chapsticks we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I cannot stand heavy smell on my lips to the point when I can get headache, but this one could use a tiny bit  of something pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and absolutely scent and flavor-free, not thick or clumpy like some lip balms.</li>
            <li>May be a little bit too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, but overall good product.</li>
            <li>The unflavored is just as good, especially if you like to add a little flavored gloss over it.  </li>
            <li>My new carmex!</li>
            <li>Stay on through the night too,  My new lip balm!</li>
            <li>My fiance and I are Chapstick addicts and due to our really dried lips always look for the products with the best ingredients that will provide lasting moisture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have not had a chance to try this item yet, but I have high hopes....</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Like the other flavors, I can not say enough nice things about how this product works.</li>
            <li>This lip balm goes on very smooth and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li>We tried to go back to regular Chapstick and that only brought to appreciate this product even more!</li>
            <li>I was very excited and had very high expectations for this lip balm, as I loved other products of this company,  but unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>these,very high quality,glides on very well,no taste.lips are baby soft and kissable</li>
            <li>Just like their other lip balms, this product goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>By Earth Lip Balms have become my new Favorites!&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
            <li>This product came at a great time,  I  am suffering from a cold and have really chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>I love these, they are soft and provide environmental protection without being heavy wear or taste.</li>
            <li>Kept my lips very soft and did not feel too waxy.</li>
            <li>while I do use the flavored types of this brand of lip balm for my lips (best i&#x27;ve found by the way), I found that this unflavored works particularly well for treating my knuckles which get dry and will start cracking in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li>I also love that this is a small business.</li>
            <li>Very basic formula that really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I had never thought about using natural lip balms before I&#x27;m certainly glad that I&#x27;ve been introduced to them as I will be putting less undesirable chemicals in my body whilst achieving the same benefits of normal lip balms.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a product that I would highly recommend, and would use on a regular basis with the right price point and/or promos.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t reach for the lip balm as quick to rehydrate as I do with some other brands.</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>It also has no harsh fragrance  </li>
            <li>I like the unflavored for my sensitive lips.</li>
            <li>but they feel so soft and don&#x27;t hurt anymore.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your lips soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too waxy and not too soft.  </li>
            <li>Made my lips feel so soft and healed from the chapping problem</li>
            <li>but my lips are soft</li>
            <li>and it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Leaves my lips protected and soft.</li>
            <li>I am thankful that I stumbled upon this product by searching Amazon for lip balms with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This balm is 100% natural, has no soy, junk, petroleum, or Parabens</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 100% Natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of overly scented and flavored lip products which can sometimes be overpowering, turning me off to a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is awesome not to thick not to thin.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and an excellent base for lipstick or lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Next thing I knew, the company sent me an email about this new one, and I got it and HURRAY!</li>
            <li>, it is 100% natural and pure beeswax lip care with aloe vera &amp; vitamin E to condition and to epair dry</li>
            <li>I actually feel like I use it less because its such a good quality and actually keeps my lips hydrated for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>These really make my dry severely chapped lips soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several weeks and it seems to have fixed my lesion scabbing issue, whoopee!</li>
            <li>I wear it plain some days or over my lipstick on other days, because I love the feel and</li>
            <li>You can instantly feel relief on your lips directly after putting it on.</li>
            <li>left my lips completely soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>I like that there are only natural ingredients as I&#x27;m trying to eliminate many unhealthy products from my beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li>so it lasts much longer than other brands, I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li>He said it lasts much longer than other lip balms.</li>
            <li>This one is GREAT for when you are having a cold or allergies because it has absolutely NO</li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s GMO free, colorless and suggested as a lipstick base.  </li>
            <li>Beauty By Earth balms are the only balms I&#x27;ve found that can keep my lips from cracking, bleeding, peeling, and generally being miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my lips feeling soft and refreshed all day long.</li>
            <li>It makes my dry chapped lips feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry, cracked lips and this balm makes them so soft.  </li>
            <li>I usually prefer flavored lip balm, however, i really appreciate the soft feel without the added taste of a flavor balm.</li>
            <li>Though it has a slight honey smell and doesn&#x27;t taste bad, it&#x27;s very very good and being as close to nothing tasting and smelling as you can get.</li>
            <li>The tubes are standard chapstick size and aren&#x27;t too soft or hard in the tube, so they apply easily without mess.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This lip balm is just naturally effective.</li>

            <li> I recently purchased a four pack of Beauty by Earth Unflavored &amp; Unscented Lip Balm and am very happy with my decision.</li>

            <li> Earth Lip Balm is so Rich in Moisture</li>
            <li> This original is just that what he searches for.</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth sent me a four pack of Unflavored Original Beeswax Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> So excited about these.</li>
            <li> I love the unscented--it really is unscented, it feels fine on my lips, doesn&#x27;t taste like anything, and doesn&#x27;t lead to break outs or anything, and no cancerous sunscreen included.</li>
            <li> PLUS I am happy they have alternatives to the normal mint balms you run into normally.</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s all natural :-)</li>
            <li> The opinions stated in this review are 100% my own and were not in any way influenced by anything other than my own opinion</li>
            <li> A good price for a 4 pack and moisturizes better that other brand names.</li>
            <li> soft and buttery, this balm feels amazingly pampering going on, without greasy feeling!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking for a good quality lip balm.</li>
            <li> Natural and effective.</li>
            <li> The peppermint and 4 flavored pack is lighter with more of a coconut oil slickness and a pleasant sweetness (although a little distracting).</li>
            <li> Like other Beauty by Earth lip balms, this gives great moisture and protection to your lips.  </li>
            <li> i got it rather quickly from the day</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important because many natural lip balms contain soy, and I&#x27;m soy intolerant.</li>
            <li> Moisturized my lips quickly.</li>
            <li> And I love that the ingridents are all natural!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth day of using it, and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> They leave your lips soft and smooth , look no further for a great lip balm here it is ,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love their lip balms and they are all natural!</li>
            <li> The texture is very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try natural chapsticks and these were absolutely perfect , just what I needed , they helped healed my lips after a few usages and they keep them moisturized</li>
            <li> It is light and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The balm glides on smooth and really moisturizes your lips.</li>
            <li> and i love that it&#x27;s all natural because my kid has an obsession with lip balm and his lips are always chapped.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far is the vanilla bean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several promo offers and discounts and have been SOOOOO happy with the lip balms we&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Also I love the fact that it is 100% Natural and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s organic and natural which makes it even better.</li>
            <li> love that these are all natural</li>
            <li> And it is safe to use because it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love that these lip balms are all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I gave you 3 stars, as you have other wonderful products and great service,  but this one didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I bought all of them after my first purchase, (peppermint) because members of my family quickly squirreled them all away.</li>
            <li> The original plain (no flavor) is also nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need anything other than a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> Much smoother than the original peppermint</li>
            <li> They are just the right consistency, I find some lip balms to be to greasy, and these were just right.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> I liked everything but the flavor (and felt the mint was actually drying, and wasn&#x27;t interested in flavor) and noted that in a review.</li>
            <li> I was able to use a coupon, which was great, because I am unlikely to spend $10 on four lip balms, but I just happen to make my own and recently made a very large batch.</li>
            <li> love using products that are 100% Natural and the Pure Beeswax Lip Care with Aloe Vera &amp; Vitamin E</li>
            <li> or you get a natural product that feels good - but only kinda works.</li>
            <li> The honey ones are better but if you like a more unscented plain one</li>
            <li> There are just so many things great about this lip balm I definitely recommend it and definitely plan to continue purchasing this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> It leaves my lips so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great flavors, long lasting, all natural, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t have a funny flavor or scents anything like that</li>
            <li> I think that stating an eco-friendly mission to use recycled products would promote a healthy company image, especially with the name Beauty by Earth.</li>
            <li> All of the varieties work very well!  </li>
            <li> They really do the job!</li>
            <li> No uncomfortable dryness.  </li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> It feels like it does a good job moisturizing my lips without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> this is so smooth and nourishes my lips like no other.</li>
            <li> Its unflavored so you don&#x27;t really have to worry about not liking one kind or the other.</li>
            <li> They make my lips super soft.</li>
            <li> The honey flavor turns my stomach a little, but the vanilla bean is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very soothing without being greasy, and I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I put it on my poor, hayfever-chapped nose, too, to great</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Really hydrates your lips</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not irritating my nose</li>
            <li> My husband really likes them too.</li>
            <li> Earth Lip Balm is really help keep my lips moisturized</li>
            <li> I found that the roll out mechanism worked well and the unflavoured ones worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about my lip balms</li>
            <li> It still feels very moisturizing and nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing without being greasy or waxy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really, really like this balm.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have a need to re-apply for hours after the initial application.&lt;br /&gt;Applies smoothly without caking and</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, no flavor or scent, makes lips feel nice.</li>
            <li> I love the all natural ingredients and simple packaging as well.</li>
            <li> Without flavors, plain, and I liked it.</li>
            <li> It also lasts for more than 30 minutes like other chapsticks we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand heavy smell on my lips to the point when I can get headache, but this one could use a tiny bit  of something pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and absolutely scent and flavor-free, not thick or clumpy like some lip balms.</li>
            <li> May be a little bit too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, but overall good product.</li>
            <li> The unflavored is just as good, especially if you like to add a little flavored gloss over it.  </li>
            <li> My new carmex!</li>
            <li> Stay on through the night too,  My new lip balm!</li>
            <li> My fiance and I are Chapstick addicts and due to our really dried lips always look for the products with the best ingredients that will provide lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to try this item yet, but I have high hopes....</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Like the other flavors, I can not say enough nice things about how this product works.</li>
            <li> This lip balm goes on very smooth and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> We tried to go back to regular Chapstick and that only brought to appreciate this product even more!</li>
            <li> I was very excited and had very high expectations for this lip balm, as I loved other products of this company,  but unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> these,very high quality,glides on very well,no taste.lips are baby soft and kissable</li>
            <li> Just like their other lip balms, this product goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> By Earth Lip Balms have become my new Favorites!&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
            <li> This product came at a great time,  I  am suffering from a cold and have really chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> I love these, they are soft and provide environmental protection without being heavy wear or taste.</li>
            <li> Kept my lips very soft and did not feel too waxy.</li>
            <li> while I do use the flavored types of this brand of lip balm for my lips (best i&#x27;ve found by the way), I found that this unflavored works particularly well for treating my knuckles which get dry and will start cracking in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> I also love that this is a small business.</li>
            <li> Very basic formula that really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I had never thought about using natural lip balms before I&#x27;m certainly glad that I&#x27;ve been introduced to them as I will be putting less undesirable chemicals in my body whilst achieving the same benefits of normal lip balms.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a product that I would highly recommend, and would use on a regular basis with the right price point and/or promos.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t reach for the lip balm as quick to rehydrate as I do with some other brands.</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> It also has no harsh fragrance  </li>
            <li> I like the unflavored for my sensitive lips.</li>
            <li> but they feel so soft and don&#x27;t hurt anymore.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your lips soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too waxy and not too soft.  </li>
            <li> Made my lips feel so soft and healed from the chapping problem</li>
            <li> but my lips are soft</li>
            <li> and it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Leaves my lips protected and soft.</li>
            <li> I am thankful that I stumbled upon this product by searching Amazon for lip balms with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This balm is 100% natural, has no soy, junk, petroleum, or Parabens</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 100% Natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of overly scented and flavored lip products which can sometimes be overpowering, turning me off to a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is awesome not to thick not to thin.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and an excellent base for lipstick or lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Next thing I knew, the company sent me an email about this new one, and I got it and HURRAY!</li>
            <li> , it is 100% natural and pure beeswax lip care with aloe vera &amp; vitamin E to condition and to epair dry</li>
            <li> I actually feel like I use it less because its such a good quality and actually keeps my lips hydrated for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> These really make my dry severely chapped lips soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several weeks and it seems to have fixed my lesion scabbing issue, whoopee!</li>
            <li> I wear it plain some days or over my lipstick on other days, because I love the feel and</li>
            <li> You can instantly feel relief on your lips directly after putting it on.</li>
            <li> left my lips completely soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I like that there are only natural ingredients as I&#x27;m trying to eliminate many unhealthy products from my beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts much longer than other brands, I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> He said it lasts much longer than other lip balms.</li>
            <li> This one is GREAT for when you are having a cold or allergies because it has absolutely NO</li>
            <li> So glad it&#x27;s GMO free, colorless and suggested as a lipstick base.  </li>
            <li> Beauty By Earth balms are the only balms I&#x27;ve found that can keep my lips from cracking, bleeding, peeling, and generally being miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my lips feeling soft and refreshed all day long.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry chapped lips feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry, cracked lips and this balm makes them so soft.  </li>
            <li> I usually prefer flavored lip balm, however, i really appreciate the soft feel without the added taste of a flavor balm.</li>
            <li> Though it has a slight honey smell and doesn&#x27;t taste bad, it&#x27;s very very good and being as close to nothing tasting and smelling as you can get.</li>
            <li> The tubes are standard chapstick size and aren&#x27;t too soft or hard in the tube, so they apply easily without mess.  </li>
            <li> They are made of 100% natural ingredients with no petroleum, parabens, mineral oil, soy or any other undesirable</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it lasted longer than I expected!  </li>
            <li> Keeps my lips protected, unscented (a big plus), and long lasting!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are plenty to last awhile or to share with family or friends (in my case I shared with my kids), and this keeps lips supple and moistened, taking care of dry cracked lips in an instant!</li>
            <li> The product provided a lot of moisturization to my lips and it is also long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about how long it would last throughout the day and</li>
            <li> I have dry skin/lips and constantly bite my lips which makes them even drier.</li>
            <li> As long as the price stays on point I will be a forever buyer.</li>
            <li> it contains few ingredients &amp; is natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will cause a long unhealed lip lesion to heal.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no flavor and long lasting to boot</li>
            <li> My lips get dry and chapped because I travel so much on long flights from US to Japan to visit family.  </li>
            <li> After one day of using this lip balm, my lips were dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> My lips are not just dry, but they are suuuuper dry.</li>
            <li> Helps my lips when the weather is dry.  </li>
            <li> make my lips feel so soft!&lt;br /&gt;Soothes dry lips in one application</li>
            <li> It kept my lips from chapping as I&#x27;m always dry mouthed and lips dry all the time.</li>
            <li> I used the Peppermint balm all winter, and my lips stayed soft and didn&#x27;t chap like usual.</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily and can not wait to try their other items as well!</li>
            <li> and this item in less than 7 days not only healed them</li>
            <li> I can wear it from meal to meal without getting that odd mid lip build up.</li>
            <li> He also works in the sun all day and his lips get very dry.</li>
            <li> No clumpy feeling like when you put other brands on, and it stayed on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Some of the natural flavors of ingredients come through, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> If you have dead skin on lips, exfoliate with simple sugar/olive or coconut oil scrub, before applying lip balm.</li>
            <li> sometimes had rough bits in it.  </li>
            <li> I like that there is no smell and really no taste either.  </li>
            <li> product-- absolutely NO chemicals in it aside from the ingredients.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Simply apply it to my knuckles and I get almost immediate no sting relief, depending on how bad I let them get, they&#x27;re either completely healed or vastly improved by the next day.</li>
            <li> After trying these I ended up tossing my other Blistex and Burts Bees to the trash.</li>
            <li> This one seems dryer than the other ones.</li>
            <li> ,it didnt feel waxy like a lot of other lip balms.very convient size .I</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled--recently I was looking for a lip balm without carcinogenic sun screen and came across this brand in mint and other flavors, so thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> Due to the simplicity of the balm</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, Chapstick, Carmex, Josie Marin, IT Cosmetics, and plenty of other lip balms.  </li>
            <li> and it came in time as I was out of my other brand.</li>
            <li> Take the time to dig up my reviews of the other two flavor packs offered by this company to fully understand my review.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve tried the other flavors.</li>
            <li> balm tube is 0.15oz in size and this makes them average sized.</li>
            <li> I had terribly chapped lips this past winter and spent a lot of money on natural lip balms trying to replace the chap stick I&#x27;ve used for years that just didn&#x27;t cut it any more.</li>
            <li> I would say these are average lip balms.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of my lipstick to as a gloss or sometimes underneath for a base.</li>
            <li> but it still had an odd flavor to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although they are different in nature the application is the same as your standard lip balm; apply  as needed to dry or chapped lips or as a base for lip colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with all natural products with non-toxic chemicals!</li>
            <li> I always have chapped lips year round</li>
            <li> Either it&#x27;s too heavy, flavored, tinted, or smells like a girl.</li>
            <li> Always have one in my car, purse and a few in the house.</li>
            <li> Plain lip balm.</li>
            <li> just came back to NY from Las Vegas and going from that dry heat to this cold crappy weather, KILLED MY LIPS!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my experience has been different.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes well- at least a few hours before I realize that I need to re-moisturize.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find plain products with out all the added stuff that works...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to press hard on the tube to dispense it on your lips.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> and I use it at least three times a day.</li>
            <li> Just feels thick on my lips.  </li>
            <li> No gunky thick application.  </li>
            <li> My friend and husband prefer the lighter sweeter ones and I like the smoother subtle ones.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to lip balm</li>
            <li> product set is presented in a thin cardboard boxes and contains 4 unflavoured balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> I have had terribly chapped lips the last few months and have been going through chapstick like crazy.</li>
            <li> but sometimes you just want something plain and simple....but not filled with nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this lip balm.</li>
            <li> It was so cold and windy while I was there.  </li>
            <li> I always hated how Burts would come off in chunks on my lips sometimes and the texture and taste was very unappealing to me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am VERY disappointed and am returning the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Iam never using anything else this works wounders!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. You can instantly feel relief on your lips directly after putting it on. Its unflavored so you don&#x27;t really have to worry about not liking one kind or the other. The price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I got a pack of honey &amp; vanilla lip balms and this pack.  This one is GREAT for when you are having a cold or allergies because it has absolutely NO irritants!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soothing without being greasy, and I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I put it on my poor, hayfever-chapped nose, too, to great effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell, no color, no taste, no after-taste. Natural. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Really hydrates your lips and i love that it&#x27;s all natural because my kid has an obsession with lip balm and his lips are always chapped. We both love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it goes on smooth and it is unscented.  Best of all, it has ingredients that is not harmful for your body :)</li>
            <li> You want a good lip balm you MUST get these they are awesome</li>
            <li> This product came at a great time,  I  am suffering from a cold and have really chapped lips.  I applied the product and immediately noticed relief.  The product provided a lot of moisturization to my lips and it is also long lasting.  I  don&#x27;t have to keep reapply it after eating or drinking.  It also has no harsh fragrance  so it&#x27;s not irritating my nose</li>
            <li> love these, have one in my car, purse, work, and gave one to mother in law! Awesome</li>
            <li> left my lips completely soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this.  Price was great so I guess I shouldnt complain.  Just feels thick on my lips.  I got the unflavored kind but it still had an odd flavor to it.  Maybe the flavored would be a lot better.  Shipping was great tho and packaging was good.</li>
            <li> Because of the many, many excellent reviews of this product, I figured it would work as well for me.  Unfortunately, my experience has been different.  After one day of using this lip balm, my lips were dry and flaky.  Needless to say, I am VERY disappointed and am returning the product.</li>
            <li> this chapstick is amazing. It leaves my lips so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So..... I have a lip balm/chap stick addiction. I have about 16 lip balms from this brand and a variety of their flavors. Several not included in my picture. and I did share 1 tube with my mother who LOVES it as well. After trying these I ended up tossing my other Blistex and Burts Bees to the trash. Great flavors, long lasting, all natural, and smooth. I always hated how Burts would come off in chunks on my lips sometimes and the texture and taste was very unappealing to me. I went on a hunt one day for an alternative and am VERY glad I found Beauty By Earth. Beauty by Earths lip balm is the only brand over the years that I have actually used the entire tube of. PLUS I am happy they have alternatives to the normal mint balms you run into normally. As long as the price stays on point I will be a forever buyer.</li>
            <li> Without flavors, plain, and I liked it. May be a little bit too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, but overall good product.</li>
            <li> This flavor to me is obviously none. This one seems dryer than the other ones. My favorite so far is the vanilla bean.</li>
            <li> Smooth going on, no smell no grease ease of use and not yucky after taste now I can use this and not worry about offending anyone with a horrid smell.I recieved this as a promotion to test and review. The opinions stated in this review are 100% my own and were not in any way influenced by anything other than my own opinion</li>
            <li> This product works great and I use it at least three times a day. I like the unflavored for my sensitive lips. My husband really likes them too.</li>
            <li> I liked that these had no scent to them because certain scents get to me. I was very impressed with how well my lips felt moisturized. The texture is very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try these lipbalms, and they did not disappoint.  They are just the right consistency, I find some lip balms to be to greasy, and these were just right.</li>
            <li> What a find!  Beauty by Earth Lip Balm is so lovely - smooth, no bad taste, no chunking of the balm - stays smooth.  I had so many I passed  a couple of tubes to my family and they all love it too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like the unscented but found it is very nice and you don&#x27;t even realize it is on. After eating, it was still on! I was amazed at that. I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of unflavored but feels goods on your lips</li>
            <li> It has good rich feeling to put on your lips!  I use this one because my wife got it!  One box comes with 4 of lip balms so my wife and I keep extra at the house and in our bags.  It does&#x27;t have a funny flavor or scents anything like that so I think everybody likes it.</li>
            <li> I love how great the Original Unflavored Beauty by Earth Lip Balm works on my chapped lips getting hydrated again . The Beauty by Earth Lip Balm is so Rich in Moisture plus it is organic and doesn&#x27;t have all those chemicals . I recommend this product and love it . I got this product as a review .</li>
            <li> Great products and great customer relations. I&#x27;ve received several promo offers and discounts and have been SOOOOO happy with the lip balms we&#x27;ve purchased. Great company with a personal feel.</li>
            <li> Lip smacking lip balm.My lips are not just dry, but they are suuuuper dry.This lip bomb made my lips, lip smackingly moist.I like that it had no smell to it,it didnt feel waxy like a lot of other lip balms.very convient size .I keep 1 at work and ar home.This is my honest unbiased opinion.glad I got it for a good price.</li>
            <li> soft and buttery, this balm feels amazingly pampering going on, without greasy feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty to last awhile or to share with family or friends (in my case I shared with my kids), and this keeps lips supple and moistened, taking care of dry cracked lips in an instant!</li>
            <li> Chapsticks weren&#x27;t working for me so I decided to try natural chapsticks and these were absolutely perfect , just what I needed , they helped healed my lips after a few usages and they keep them moisturized , not too shiny, just perfect , would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I always have chapped lips year round and this item in less than 7 days not only healed them but they feel so soft and don&#x27;t hurt anymore.  I have been using it daily and can not wait to try their other items as well!</li>
            <li> If you have dead skin on lips, exfoliate with simple sugar/olive or coconut oil scrub, before applying lip balm. I got both mint, and unflavored...both work the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using BBE Lip Balm for a while now and I really enjoy it! A little goes a long way so it lasts much longer than other brands, I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I are Chapstick addicts and due to our really dried lips always look for the products with the best ingredients that will provide lasting moisture. This Chapstick is amazing and just leaves our lips with the perfect amount of moisture, conditioning and softness. I highly recommend. We tried to go back to regular Chapstick and that only brought to appreciate this product even more! This company overall has great products.</li>
            <li> These lip balm leave your lips smooth and not flaky</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, no flavor or scent, makes lips feel nice.</li>
            <li> these are amazing they smell womderful and keep my lips so moist and it stays on a long time so don&#x27;t have to reapply as often very good deal for the discounted price love it</li>
            <li> These are great, and perfect for my son who hates smelly lip balm</li>
            <li> Totally in love. I&#x27;ve used the flavored lip balms from Beauty by Earth (which I love) but sometimes you just want something plain and simple....but not filled with nasty chemicals. This lip balm is the answer. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of BBE.  I have used their peppermint balm before and love it.  The unflavored is just as good, especially if you like to add a little flavored gloss over it.  I like the feel of my lips with this balm...  They feel conditioned but not oily.  The moisture goes deep and I don&#x27;t have to reapply often.  I liked these so much, I shared some with friends.  I would recommend these to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, BBE!</li>
            <li> They work.  This is a good lip balm that works.  Makes my lips smooth.  Helps my lips when the weather is dry.  And I love that the ingridents are all natural!!</li>
            <li> This is such great product. I use it under lipstick for it lay better. I also use alone to keep my lips from getting chapped. I like that also comes with four of them in package so I can put them in different places so always have them on hand.</li>
            <li> Awesome lip Balm. It leaves your lips soft without feeling greasy. I love the all natural ingredients and simple packaging as well.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a four pack of Beauty by Earth Unflavored &amp; Unscented Lip Balm and am very happy with my decision. I have had terribly chapped lips the last few months and have been going through chapstick like crazy. I feel like Beauty by Earth Lip Balm is really help keep my lips moisturized and I don&#x27;t reach for the lip balm as quick to rehydrate as I do with some other brands. Also I love the fact that it is 100% Natural and made in the USA. There are just so many things great about this lip balm I definitely recommend it and definitely plan to continue purchasing this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I used the Peppermint balm all winter, and my lips stayed soft and didn&#x27;t chap like usual. The original balm is equally good, and I recommend this product in good conscience. The balm softened as soon as it touched my lips making it easy to apply. It felt like it melted into the skin, but didn&#x27;t disappear entirely. I also love that this is a small business.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture and feel. Not greasy at all. I am addicted to lip balm and I have to honestly say this is in my top 3!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was received exclusively for reviewing purposes. The evaluation of the product had been conducted independently with no external influences from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product set is presented in a thin cardboard boxes and contains 4 unflavoured balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each balm tube is 0.15oz in size and this makes them average sized. They are made of 100% natural ingredients with no petroleum, parabens, mineral oil, soy or any other undesirable chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are different in nature the application is the same as your standard lip balm; apply  as needed to dry or chapped lips or as a base for lip colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I found that the roll out mechanism worked well and the unflavoured ones worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had never thought about using natural lip balms before I&#x27;m certainly glad that I&#x27;ve been introduced to them as I will be putting less undesirable chemicals in my body whilst achieving the same benefits of normal lip balms.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product forms reduced price  i got it rather quickly from the day i ordered it. When i opened the package I wad pleased with the structure of the tube and the sticker both women and man can use them i has a nice scent and keeps your lips smooth i recomend.</li>
            <li> received for discounted price for my review&lt;br /&gt;love these,very high quality,glides on very well,no taste.lips are baby soft and kissable</li>
            <li> I absolutely love  Beauty by Earth lip balm.  My lips get dry and chapped because I travel so much on long flights from US to Japan to visit family.  Once I started using the  Beauty by Earth lip balm, my lips no longer get chapped from being on the flights.  This winter I also flew to S. Korea to visit my daughter and son-in-law (He is in the Army and they are currently stationed there).  It was so cold and windy while I was there.  If it weren&#x27;t for my  Beauty by Earth lip balm there is no doubt that my lips would have been cracked...but not this time.  Excellent lip balm that I will no longer be without.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like flavored balm so this product is perfect for me!  I received it at a promotional price which was a bonus, but when I&#x27;m in the market again, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.  Keeps my lips protected, unscented (a big plus), and long lasting!</li>
            <li> So good. Absolutely no flavor and long lasting to boot</li>
            <li> Very nice product, really heals chapped lips. satisfied with my purchase and with the seller!!</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm! My husband can never find one he likes. Either it&#x27;s too heavy, flavored, tinted, or smells like a girl. This original is just that what he searches for. Plain lip balm. It is light and is very moisturizing. I don&#x27;t need anything other than a good moisturizer so this is perfect for me. It also lasts for more than 30 minutes like other chapsticks we&#x27;ve tried. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking for a good quality lip balm.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.  It makes my dry chapped lips feel soft and moisturized.  It also makes a great base for lip color.  This lip balm is so good I will not lose it before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  I am allergic to basically everything and I can wear this on my chapped lips just fine.  It helps sooth and soften my lips and does not break me out.</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth has the formula just right.  It&#x27;s not too waxy and not too soft.  I&#x27;m really picky about my lip balms and I like this.  It feels good!</li>
            <li> Unscented! Unflavored! Its hard to find plain products with out all the added stuff that works...this works great. I love it.</li>
            <li> My lips feel wonderful. Awesome product and very nice seller</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to try this item yet, but I have high hopes....</li>
            <li> My new carmex! Love it</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase from this company.  There service and products are spectacular!. My favorite is still the peppermint flavor , but on days or nights where you just need an unscented awesome lip balm this is it! I love their lip balms and they are all natural!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip stuff. I will never buy anything else again. I like the unflavored version. It still feels very moisturizing and nice!&lt;br /&gt;I have already ordered every flavor pack they make and more. I highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled--recently I was looking for a lip balm without carcinogenic sun screen and came across this brand in mint and other flavors, so thought I&#x27;d try it. I liked everything but the flavor (and felt the mint was actually drying, and wasn&#x27;t interested in flavor) and noted that in a review. Next thing I knew, the company sent me an email about this new one, and I got it and HURRAY! This is it! I love the unscented--it really is unscented, it feels fine on my lips, doesn&#x27;t taste like anything, and doesn&#x27;t lead to break outs or anything, and no cancerous sunscreen included. What a responsive company, and great product. I&#x27;m about to buy a lot (I am a lip balm addict, needing tubes everywhere I go) and will give it away as well. (If it&#x27;s helpful to know, I used Lip Trip for many years, and Carmex before that.) Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This balm is great!  It is smooth and keeps my lips healthy.  I love it!  And it&#x27;s organic and natural which makes it even better.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, I am picky when it comes to lip balm and this works perfect. i like the unscented and uncolored. great product won&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great chapsticks...great ingrediants...love these!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and feels nice on my lips. I would buy this again. Hugs, Sue</li>
            <li> This lip balm goes on very smooth and it is long lasting. A 4 pack should last quite a while. The unscented/unflavored is great for using right before bed.</li>
            <li> this is so smooth and nourishes my lips like no other. I replaced my EOS with this!</li>
            <li> Made my lips feel so soft and healed from the chapping problem</li>
            <li> awesome on my huge lips</li>
            <li> It applies so smoothly, does a wonderful job, and is totally soy-free! That&#x27;s important because many natural lip balms contain soy, and I&#x27;m soy intolerant. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lip balms over the years, and Beauty by Earth is officially my favorite.  I may be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Feels great on, just dont care for the flavors but my lips are soft</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.  Will re-order for sure.</li>
            <li> Would purchase these again. They truly have no taste or scent. Also keep your lips silky smooth for hours. Glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and is the best lip balm that I have found to do the job, whether it&#x27;s in Windy conditions, sunny conditions, whatever the condition may be, count on this product to the job.</li>
            <li> love that these are all natural they feel great on..love how they make on lips feel..will order again</li>
            <li> Been looking for an all-natural lip balm. Came across Beauty by Earth. I like that it contains few ingredients &amp; is natural. Delivery was fast. Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> A good chapstick. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are soft and provide environmental protection without being heavy wear or taste. Very good.</li>
            <li> This is another great product by this company. Just like their other lip balms, this product goes on smoothly.  It feels like it does a good job moisturizing my lips without feeling heavy.  For those who don&#x27;t want a &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; this would be a great pic for you. I have yet to try it, but it would probably allow lip stick to go on smoother.</li>
            <li> This is, without doubt, the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;ve been using Blistex for years because it is excellent, but this product from&lt;br /&gt;Beauty by Earth is even better!  And it is safe to use because it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Much smoother than the original peppermint and I like it better - though the coating is heavier.  The peppermint and 4 flavored pack is lighter with more of a coconut oil slickness and a pleasant sweetness (although a little distracting). I didn&#x27;t like that peppermint and 4 flavored sometimes had rough bits in it.  So its personal preference.  My friend and husband prefer the lighter sweeter ones and I like the smoother subtle ones.  The honey flavor turns my stomach a little, but the vanilla bean is nice.  The original plain (no flavor) is also nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> The moment I used this lip balm, I knew it was different! It felt like silk gliding across my lips. It leaves my lips feeling soft and refreshed all day long. I am a serial chapstick user and I think this is my all time favorite. There is nothing that I don&#x27;t like about it. I usually prefer flavored lip balm, however, i really appreciate the soft feel without the added taste of a flavor balm. BUT I cannot wait to try the flavors!</li>
            <li> Great lip balm. Love that it&#x27;s unscented and unflavoved. I&#x27;m not a fan of overly scented and flavored lip products which can sometimes be overpowering, turning me off to a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is awesome not to thick not to thin. Very moisturizing without being greasy or waxy.</li>
            <li> Beauty by Earth sent me a four pack of Unflavored Original Beeswax Lip Balm. I was able to use a coupon, which was great, because I am unlikely to spend $10 on four lip balms, but I just happen to make my own and recently made a very large batch. I must say, my own lip balm leaves a greasy feeling to my lips, and Beauty by Earth lip balm does not. This lip balm is made of the purest ingredients. It is non-greasy and an excellent base for lipstick or lip gloss. It is lightweight and absolutely scent and flavor-free, not thick or clumpy like some lip balms. By the way, the packaging is very interesting. It looks like a recycled cardboard box, but it doesn&#x27;t say that it is recycled. I think that stating an eco-friendly mission to use recycled products would promote a healthy company image, especially with the name Beauty by Earth. Overall, this is a product that I would highly recommend, and would use on a regular basis with the right price point and/or promos.</li>
            <li> i am absolutely in love with the beauty by earth skin care line. It makes my lips feel smooth and I love that it&#x27;s all natural :-)</li>
            <li> I love that this is unflavored and it doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel smothered.  4 sticks will last Mr quite a while!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It moisturizes well- at least a few hours before I realize that I need to re-moisturize. It glides on smooth. I prefer this lip balm over Burt&#x27;s Bees because it&#x27;s softer and not grainy. You don&#x27;t need to press hard on the tube to dispense it on your lips. It&#x27;s also nice that this lip balm has no scent. Sometimes I like to layer color over my lip balm, and it doesn&#x27;t always work well when the lip balm has a scent as well as the lipstick or colored lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Very nice lip balm. Does not have a greasy feel. I also love that it has no scent or odor and it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was very excited and had very high expectations for this lip balm, as I loved other products of this company,  but unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t work for me. The unscented smell has unscented smell, I don&#x27;t know how else to say it. I wish I ordered vanilla and honey one. I cannot stand heavy smell on my lips to the point when I can get headache, but this one could use a tiny bit  of something pleasant. The texture also didn&#x27;t impress me with density and ability to protect my lips, and it wasn&#x27;t even winter when I got them. I&#x27;m sorry I gave you 3 stars, as you have other wonderful products and great service,  but this one didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I had terribly chapped lips this past winter and spent a lot of money on natural lip balms trying to replace the chap stick I&#x27;ve used for years that just didn&#x27;t cut it any more. This one was the winner. I was so happy to find it. I&#x27;ve tried both the peppermint and this unflavored one...I like the peppermint better, but that&#x27;s probably because I habitually put it on after brushing my teeth with minty toothpaste. Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li> I would say these are average lip balms. If you don&#x27;t like flavored lip balm, these would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Got this for a good price to review and I&#x27;m happy with it! The honey ones are better but if you like a more unscented plain one then this is the one for you! Its a high quality product and comes in a great package! This would make a great gift for someone, It&#x27;s a great pampering item!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balms. A good price for a 4 pack and moisturizes better that other brand names. I gave my  daughter and sister one each and they were just as impressed. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great, great chapstick! Ingredients are best possible and my favorite part is there&#x27;s no GMO&#x27;s, feels lovely!</li>
            <li> The Original flavor is really nice if you just want a smooth and effective lip balm option.  The lack of flavoring works great because there is no taste to interfere with your coffee or snack.  :)  I think it&#x27;s a MUST staple!</li>
            <li> One of the best lip balm&#x27;s I have tried.  All of the varieties work very well!  Stay on through the night too,  My new lip balm!</li>
            <li> Nice feeling on the skin upon application and the moisture lasts well.  I like that there is no smell and really no taste either.  I like that there are only natural ingredients as I&#x27;m trying to eliminate many unhealthy products from my beauty regimen.  I&#x27;ve shared a lip balm with each of my daughters and they have been pleased with the balm as well. Very nice product!!</li>
            <li> I love that these lip balms are all natural ingredients. The balm glides on smooth and really moisturizes your lips. I like to use them over my lip stain, which tends to be drying, and they work great!</li>
            <li> Like other Beauty by Earth lip balms, this gives great moisture and protection to your lips.  The natural ingredients are wonderful at retaining moisture in your lips without preventing your lips from breathing.  The formula is light and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky.  The tubes are standard chapstick size and aren&#x27;t too soft or hard in the tube, so they apply easily without mess.  Beauty By Earth balms are the only balms I&#x27;ve found that can keep my lips from cracking, bleeding, peeling, and generally being miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack of lip balms is unflavored.  Some of the natural flavors of ingredients come through, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.  If you want a healing balm for your lips that has no added scent or flavor, this is a great choice.  The lack of sweetness means you won&#x27;t be tempted to lick your lips, which exasperates chapping lips.  Due to the simplicity of the balm it&#x27;s great for men and women.  This is a great no-nonsense, practical lip balm for any lips that need some TLC.</li>
            <li> Great product-- absolutely NO chemicals in it aside from the ingredients. Very basic formula that really works! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love these.  They worked so great!  Moisturized my lips quickly.</li>
            <li> I received Beauty by Earth Lip Balm and I can say I truly love it . My grandson loves it also when I can&#x27;t find it I know he&#x27;s got it.I just love love it thank you for the opportunity to try it.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is great, very moisturizing, love the fact it has no &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; in the ingredients, this is very important to me. Kept my lips very soft and did not feel too waxy. Great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect lip balm.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and keeps lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> They really do the job! They make my lips super soft. If I don&#x27;t want to deal with a smell or flavored lip balm I reach for these. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband since he hates anything scented. He also works in the sun all day and his lips get very dry. He loves this!  He said it lasts much longer than other lip balms. Would def recommend!</li>
            <li> Just received Beauty by Earth Lip Balm The Original...today and am immediately impressed with the quality.  So glad it&#x27;s GMO free, colorless and suggested as a lipstick base.  I&#x27;m hoping it will cause a long unhealed lip lesion to heal. Have been using this product for several weeks and it seems to have fixed my lesion scabbing issue, whoopee!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Leaves my lips protected and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm, it&#x27;s all I will use. I also like their flavored balms!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and shiny! I love that it&#x27;s unscented so everyone can use it and it doesn&#x27;t color your lips. You can never go wrong with all natural products with non-toxic chemicals! My kids and Husband all love this product and we have one in every room! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love these!  I have really dry, cracked lips and this balm makes them so soft.  I was worried about how long it would last throughout the day and I was surprised that it lasted longer than I expected!  Thanks making an awesome lip balm!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It makes my lips fell smooth and helps them from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this balm.  It is the most effective lip balm I have ever used.  Over the years I have tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, Chapstick, Carmex, Josie Marin, IT Cosmetics, and plenty of other lip balms.  They were okay.  Some products work better for some people than for others.  For me, the Beauty By Earth Lip Balm provided a noticeable improvement within 24 hours.  I&#x27;m on my fourth day of using it, and I am very pleased.  No uncomfortable dryness.  No need to reapply constantly throughout the day.  No gunky thick application.  No chemical ingredients that are tongue twisters to pronounce.  I am thankful that I stumbled upon this product by searching Amazon for lip balms with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smooth and better feel than ChapStick. Truly unscented.</li>
            <li> Simple yet efficient product. There are some days where I prefer not to use scented or flavored chap sticks or glosses and this is perfect for those days</li>
            <li> This lip balm is just naturally effective. That&#x27;s hard to find. In my experience you get the harsher chemical based product because it just gets the job done or you get a natural product that feels good - but only kinda works. Beauty by Earth has accomplished a beautiful merge of both. Natural and effective. Love my lip balm cause it gets the job done but I can feel good that I&#x27;m using awesome an earthly product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased  Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Vanilla Bean and Honey Lip Balms and loved them so much that had to try the unscented version.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to say the unscented version is every bit as wonderful as the ones I currently own!!&lt;br /&gt;I love using products that are 100% Natural and the Pure Beeswax Lip Care with Aloe Vera &amp; Vitamin E make my lips feel so soft!&lt;br /&gt;Soothes dry lips in one application and I do not have a need to re-apply for hours after the initial application.&lt;br /&gt;Applies smoothly without caking and the tubes offer a generous amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;Beauty By Earth Lip Balms have become my new Favorites!&lt;br /&gt;A+++ Recommendation!</li>
            <li> These really make my dry severely chapped lips soft and moisturized. I like that its unscented so when you eat something you dont get any taste of your chapstick with your food.</li>
            <li> This is a pure, non-chemical, good for you way to keep your lips in shape!</li>
            <li> So excited about these. I&#x27;m a huge ChapStick person. Always have one in my car, purse and a few in the house. These lip balms make my lips so smooth. I actually feel like I use it less because its such a good quality and actually keeps my lips hydrated for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I used my Earth Lip Balm I received today and it came in time as I was out of my other brand. I was impressed with this product, it was very smooth going on. No clumpy feeling like when you put other brands on, and it stayed on for a long time. It kept my lips from chapping as I&#x27;m always dry mouthed and lips dry all the time. I use it on top of my lipstick to as a gloss or sometimes underneath for a base. This balm is 100% natural, has no soy, junk, petroleum, or Parabens</li>
            <li> Great lip balm!  I like the quality and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Take the time to dig up my reviews of the other two flavor packs offered by this company to fully understand my review. There is nothing wrong with this lip balm. Like the other flavors, I can not say enough nice things about how this product works. I can wear it from meal to meal without getting that odd mid lip build up. I wear it plain some days or over my lipstick on other days, because I love the feel and the light gloss effect it gives. To top it all off, the company was amazing at their customer service. I was informed every step of the way, with polite cheery emails, and giving information after shipping that really helped me understand the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s why I give this 4 out of 5 stars. - I&#x27;ve tried the other flavors. I bought all of them after my first purchase, (peppermint) because members of my family quickly squirreled them all away. Wanting a variety, I tried them all. In quality, this one ranks with the others for all the same reasons. But, I want to be fair and honest on my review. It&#x27;s just not my favorite. It&#x27;s not any of our favorites. It&#x27;s a fill in for when we can&#x27;t find a flavor, any flavor. Though it has a slight honey smell and doesn&#x27;t taste bad, it&#x27;s very very good and being as close to nothing tasting and smelling as you can get. Still glosses without the build up, still lasts and is still used but it&#x27;s not for a family like us, who enjoys that addition of peppermint, honey or vanilla. I hope this review helps someone who&#x27;s looking for what this is, a great product with almost zero taste and smell.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know this is lip balm lol, and while I do use the flavored types of this brand of lip balm for my lips (best i&#x27;ve found by the way), I found that this unflavored works particularly well for treating my knuckles which get dry and will start cracking in the cold winter months. Simply apply it to my knuckles and I get almost immediate no sting relief, depending on how bad I let them get, they&#x27;re either completely healed or vastly improved by the next day. I am a fan</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. It gives me the moisture I need. I love that it is all natural. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! This is making my lips soooo soft!!&lt;br /&gt;I just came back to NY from Las Vegas and going from that dry heat to this cold crappy weather, KILLED MY LIPS!&lt;br /&gt;THANK GOD FOR THIS! It&#x27;s an awesome feeling to kiss my husband and not have them hurt!!</li>
            <li> My lips definitely pucker up for this lip balm!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite lip moisture.. I really like this!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this lip balm as it reminds me of EOS without the flavor. It is conveniently packed. There isn&#x27;t a yucky after taste and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I also like that out of all lip balms I can even skip a day. I have dry skin/lips and constantly bite my lips which makes them even drier. I never know a lip balm to be so effective like Beauty by Earth...</li>
            <li> Best lip balm out there as far as I&#x27;m concerned , it is 100% natural and pure beeswax lip care with aloe vera &amp; vitamin E to condition and to epair dry chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These are amazing I will never need to find another lip balm again . I have tried so many different ones expensive and low cost none of them compare to these . They leave your lips soft and smooth , look no further for a great lip balm here it is ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this product , happy happy lips.</li>
            <li> Really nice lip balm. It&#x27;s definitely unflavored and glides on smoothly and the best part it&#x27;s 100% Natural. Love it! I&#x27;m going to add these to my top finds.</li>
