            <li>Fun tropical smell, good shave and great price</li>
            <li>The cost eventually wound up being more than just buying the handle with replaceable heads, but venus is certainly the best razor I&#x27;ve found to date</li>

            <li>Venus razors are very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I love this type of razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li>Okay Razors.</li>
            <li>My favorite venus razors.</li>
            <li>My favorite disposable razor on the market.</li>
            <li>Love these razors.</li>
            <li>Ok razors.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend venus razors more, I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li>smooth and close shave every time!</li>
            <li>Hated,nothing more to say.....</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li>I love these razors; they glide easily without any cuts.</li>
            <li>Great price but seemed old, the strips weren&#x27;t goody anymore.</li>
            <li>They are so much better than the others available.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>These work for fine.  </li>
            <li>The price and fast delivery make these a nice option.</li>
            <li>Great disposable razors for daily use.</li>
            <li>They glide smoothly with no tugging or pulling of my skin, I end up with smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The razor gives such a good shave, comfortable!</li>
            <li>The razor gives such a good shave, comfortable!</li>
            <li>These are great at first, nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors since they come out, they leave my legs super smooth and nick free every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes, I am &#x27;environmentally friendly&#x27; but I&#x27;m 68 and have some artheritis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather just spend double the money on a good razor.</li>
            <li>Because these are excellent razors, I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li>Because these are excellent razors, I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li>I love the vibrant colors and the price for S&amp;S.</li>
            <li>Besides sleek look and colors, with Venus Tropical razors I enjoyed a very smooth shave after a long time.</li>
            <li>these really make it easy for young pre-teens to shave safely and comfortably with a bit of colorful delight and fragrant whimsy.</li>
            <li>The Venus tropical is very safe for me to use and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have used Venus razors for over ten years, but never the disposable kind.</li>
            <li>I snagged these when the price was right, $1 cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I had been paying a couple dollars more at my local store, and that adds up over the course of a year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it varies by individual</li>
            <li>This razor works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Gillette Venus!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with sensitive skin and all the fun that goes along with it.  </li>
            <li>#34;get at&amp;#34; some intimate areas.</li>
            <li>Purchased at discount in order to test, it;s a Gillette product and shaves very closely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this many problems with cuts with any other razor before.</li>
            <li>Good, for the price point I purchased at, but overall I like the Mach 3 blades (replaceable) better because they stay sharp longer, and I am putting less into the landfill.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use this every day, but when I do use it, it is very gentle on my skin and cuts clean and sharply.</li>
            <li>These are just as comfortable and gentle, not prone to causing nicks and one lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li>Decent razors for the price</li>
            <li>Highly recommend (this is R&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any man or woman who needs to &amp;</li>
            <li>Add mature dry sensitive and fair skin and this has been a terrific addition to the other &#x27;beauty&#x27; products available with Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>Its beyond me how such gentle razors can &#x27;gently cut&#x27; too!</li>
            <li>Though not a woman, I need to shave some pretty intimate areas for medical reasons.  </li>
            <li>I love the nicer razors, but I can never keep track one long enough to use the replacement cartridges so I was wasting money.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it would be a smooth shave other times it would cut me.</li>
            <li>ALSO, they are not annoying like other sophisticated razors that come coated with soapy strips that become sticky, gooey and messy!</li>
            <li>My wife shaved her legs with this and they felt very soft.</li>
            <li>Glide and soft!</li>
            <li>With these razors, I have found that I usually do not need to shave but</li>
            <li>Get dull super quickly.</li>
            <li>To keep your razor sharp longer (save money), make sure to completely rinse, and dry the blade portion with a towel in-between uses.</li>
            <li>They are gentle simply put.</li>
            <li>every 2-3 days, so they last much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other &#x27;Venus&#x27; razors in the past and really liked them . . .</li>
            <li>These are great because the quality is similar to the cartridge razors, but they are inexpensive and disposable so I don&#x27;t need to feel bad if I lose one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the close shave, and the blades take quite a while to dull down.  </li>
            <li>Not long lasting or thorough!</li>

            <li> Not long lasting or thorough!</li>
            <li> usually purchase the reusable heads for my venus base but needed to travel and these are perfect for that.</li>
            <li> They do not last long.</li>
            <li> But they get dull much faster than the Gillette Daisies</li>
            <li> Keeping these dry will extend their desired lifetime.</li>
            <li> They are FAR better than some other brutal disposable razors.</li>
            <li> But just like another reviewer mentioned, I did get cut/bleeds in a few spots which I noticed only after I had stepped out of the shower.</li>
            <li> As expected and saved us a run to the store</li>
            <li> The wide razor head helps eliminate cuts.  </li>
            <li> but I get a month of shaving out of each razor before the blade dulls.</li>
            <li> just seems to wide..</li>
            <li> and i still had plenty of rough spots when i was done.</li>
            <li> As with all razors, do not let them stay wet for a prolonged period of time.</li>
            <li> My wife is Indian and being Indian usually results in fast and thick hair growth.</li>
            <li> not as sharp as I thought.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use them for a while and hopefully won&#x27;t face this problem to the point where I have to look for other razors.</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed this with any other razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand these - they don&#x27;t get a close cut on my legs which aren&#x27;t particularly big or small- the blade area</li>
            <li> If I shave daily, I would say these take 7-10 days to dull down.  </li>
            <li> they cut me at least 5 times in different places.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it just drip dry because it will build up mineral deposits from the water and dull it faster.</li>
            <li> I like these well, but wish they had a pivoting head, got a few nicks</li>
            <li> The razor wasn&#x27;t sharp and was completely dull within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I think razors are too expensive in general</li>
            <li> A little hard to get into bikini areas and around the knees.</li>
            <li> It no longer has the thick lube strip and is now too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews</li>

            <li> not as sharp as I thought.  need to go over the area and touch up sometimes, but no razor burn.</li>
            <li> The cost eventually wound up being more than just buying the handle with replaceable heads, but venus is certainly the best razor I&#x27;ve found to date</li>
            <li> Great price but seemed old, the strips weren&#x27;t goody anymore.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t shave very well. The razor wasn&#x27;t sharp and was completely dull within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> These are good for legs, I feel like they made them smooth. Not good for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time. Besides sleek look and colors, with Venus Tropical razors I enjoyed a very smooth shave after a long time. They are FAR better than some other brutal disposable razors. They are gentle simply put. But just like another reviewer mentioned, I did get cut/bleeds in a few spots which I noticed only after I had stepped out of the shower. Its beyond me how such gentle razors can &#x27;gently cut&#x27; too! Will continue to use them for a while and hopefully won&#x27;t face this problem to the point where I have to look for other razors. ALSO, they are not annoying like other sophisticated razors that come coated with soapy strips that become sticky, gooey and messy!</li>
            <li> Gillette razors are the best and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> These are great!  Very few nicks when using them!</li>
            <li> Great razors and a good buy.</li>
            <li> I like these well, but wish they had a pivoting head, got a few nicks</li>
            <li> I love this type of razor from Gillette. I have used them for years.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife.. She loves the razors..</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t damaged and are of good quality. Glad I made this purchase! :)</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, I bought 3 packs !!!. They are the best  razors, don&#x27;t cut you. Glide and soft! Love these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with sensitive skin and all the fun that goes along with it.  Several years ago, I had a severe reaction to something on my legs and never could determine if it was specifically the shaving cream, low-quality razors, or lotion that I used at the time.  After eliminating each one at a time to try to find the cause, I decided to overhaul my shaving/skin care routine.  I found a shaving cream I didn&#x27;t react to, and I started using these razors, and following up with some simple cocoa butter.  It took awhile for my skin to recover, but it did.  I am now a very loyal buyer of these razors and hope they never stop making them because I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them!  I love the close shave, and the blades take quite a while to dull down.  If I shave daily, I would say these take 7-10 days to dull down.  With these razors, I have found that I usually do not need to shave but every 2-3 days, so they last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve found for these razors.  I had been paying a couple dollars more at my local store, and that adds up over the course of a year.  Will continue buying them via Amazon from here on out.</li>
            <li> Okay Razors. The &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; lasted maybe 1 day after opening. The shave itself was mediocre. The price and fast delivery make these a nice option.</li>
            <li> Great disposable razors for daily use.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews but I hate these so much I had to. Everytime I use them they cut me at least 5 times in different places. I know &#x27;how&#x27; to shave and I&#x27;ve never had this many problems with cuts with any other razor before. I&#x27;d rather just spend double the money on a good razor. Won&#x27;t buy again, always cut me and leaves my skin with rashes.</li>
            <li> My favorite venus razors. They are so much better than the others available.</li>
            <li> Fun tropical smell, good shave and great price</li>
            <li> I like the feel of these razors in your hand. Easy to hold. The bright, fun colors make them cheery and easy to find in my drawer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other &#x27;Venus&#x27; razors in the past and really liked them . . . the one advantage to the TROPICAL is that it is disposable. These are just as comfortable and gentle, not prone to causing nicks and one lasts longer than expected. Yes, I am &#x27;environmentally friendly&#x27; but I&#x27;m 68 and have some artheritis.  Add mature dry sensitive and fair skin and this has been a terrific addition to the other &#x27;beauty&#x27; products available with Amazon prime. I write reviews because I read reviews . . . a definite advantage when purchasing untried products. I do not enjoy &#x27;real&#x27; shopping so this has become a great &#x27;go to&#x27; for me. Thank you for the reviews that help with my decisions!</li>
            <li> I am also happy with this purchase. I love the colors! The razor gives such a good shave, comfortable! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. dj</li>
            <li> Venus razors are very comfortable in my hand.  They glide smoothly with no tugging or pulling of my skin, I end up with smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It no longer has the thick lube strip and is now too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love these razors; they glide easily without any cuts. I love the vibrant colors and the price for S&amp;S.</li>
            <li> Great!  I think razors are too expensive in general but these do the job and we&#x27;re priced fairly.</li>
            <li> I am also happy with this purchase. I love the colors! The razor gives such a good shave, comfortable! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. dj</li>
            <li> As expected and saved us a run to the store</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter who just started shaving. Great product.</li>
            <li> The wide razor head helps eliminate cuts.  The blades stay sharp longer than other brands. My favorite disposable razor on the market.</li>
            <li> Love these razors. This is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen for these razor blades</li>
            <li> I mean, its like shaving myself with a piece of silk. It lasts forever, does a great job and was priced well below any I&#x27;ve seen in stores. Highly recommend (this is R&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> Though not a woman, I need to shave some pretty intimate areas for medical reasons.  The Venus tropical is very safe for me to use and lasts a long time.  Highly recommend for any man or woman who needs to &amp;#34;get at&amp;#34; some intimate areas.</li>
            <li> Ok razors. They do not last long.</li>
            <li> I snagged these when the price was right, $1 cheaper than Walmart. I&#x27;m sure it varies by individual but I get a month of shaving out of each razor before the blade dulls.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair but for some reason, a day after using this razor my hair feels rougher and thicker than ever.  I&#x27;ve never noticed this with any other razor.</li>
            <li> I have used Venus razors for over ten years, but never the disposable kind. I picked up a 3 pack for under $4 which was a great deal. I am so disappointed by the quality of these razors. The razor gave me an awful razor burn and raised itchy bumps along my legs. Awful, will be swit ching back to the regular Venus embrace line.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  I&#x27;ve been using these for several years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors since they come out, they leave my legs super smooth and nick free every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase the reusable heads for my venus base but needed to travel and these are perfect for that. I can leave one in my suit case and one in my shower at home and still have a spare. I can&#x27;t recommend venus razors more, I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Because these are excellent razors, I have fine thin hair and it is hard to shave well but Gillette Venus razors work!</li>
            <li> Good, for the price point I purchased at, but overall I like the Mach 3 blades (replaceable) better because they stay sharp longer, and I am putting less into the landfill. TIP: To keep your razor sharp longer (save money), make sure to completely rinse, and dry the blade portion with a towel in-between uses. Don&#x27;t let it just drip dry because it will build up mineral deposits from the water and dull it faster.</li>
            <li> Great razors! Very happy with the blades and like the bright colors. Great price with S&amp;S from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife is Indian and being Indian usually results in fast and thick hair growth. My wife shaved her legs with this and they felt very soft. I know the hair will grow back in the next day or two and will report back.</li>
            <li> Purchased at discount in order to test, it;s a Gillette product and shaves very closely.</li>
            <li> Decent razors for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheaper ones and won&#x27;t do that again.  These don&#x27;t cut me and they work.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it would be a smooth shave other times it would cut me. But they worked. Don&#x27;t plan on buying again. I now use the axe razors.</li>
            <li> smooth and close shave every time! If you have prime I think it&#x27;s cheaper to buy on Amazon than at the drug store!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these because of the tropical fragrance... these really make it easy for young pre-teens to shave safely and comfortably with a bit of colorful delight and fragrant whimsy.</li>
            <li> Hated,nothing more to say.....giving one star for the colors....</li>
            <li> the handles are freaking scented.  get some.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> This razor works exactly as described. It&#x27;s perfect for shaving legs and underarms in the shower - no nicks or razor burn at all. Thanks, Gillette Venus!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use this every day, but when I do use it, it is very gentle on my skin and cuts clean and sharply.</li>
            <li> This is the VERY BEST RAZOR I&#x27;VE EVERY USED.  I only bought this from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t get to the store, and lost my regular razor.  I&#x27;m SUPER happy with these razors, inexpensive but gives the very best shave for my legs and underarms ever, with NO nicks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand these - they don&#x27;t get a close cut on my legs which aren&#x27;t particularly big or small- the blade area just seems to wide..I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re ok. make a weird clicking noise while you&#x27;re shaving and i still had plenty of rough spots when i was done. not the greatest, but they did the job.</li>
            <li> These work for fine.  A little hard to get into bikini areas and around the knees.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor. As with all razors, do not let them stay wet for a prolonged period of time. Keeping these dry will extend their desired lifetime.</li>
            <li> These are great at first, nice and sharp. But they get dull much faster than the Gillette Daisies I was buying before. 3-4 uses for the Venus as opposed to 10 or so for the Daisy</li>
            <li> Because these are excellent razors, I have fine thin hair and it is hard to shave well but Gillette Venus razors work!</li>
            <li> These razors are great.  I love the nicer razors, but I can never keep track one long enough to use the replacement cartridges so I was wasting money.  These are great because the quality is similar to the cartridge razors, but they are inexpensive and disposable so I don&#x27;t need to feel bad if I lose one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades provide a close shave and I&#x27;ve never had a cut. Also, the colors are bright and cheery!</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love a deal and these get the task at hand, or task on legs done at a great price</li>
            <li> I realy like these razor they work great</li>
            <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
            <li> Get dull super quickly.</li>
            <li> Not long lasting or thorough!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product and it&#x27;s quality!</li>
            <li> I wish the blade part was bigger.</li>
