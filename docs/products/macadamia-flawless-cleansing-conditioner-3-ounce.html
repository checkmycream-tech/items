    <ol>
            <li>Excellent service.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Use a couple time a week and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Awesome.  </li>
            <li>So happy I found this product, never switching!</li>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>we both love it!!  </li>
            <li>is great for fine hair and it conditions and cleans all at once with no lather --its great!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I really loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly oily hair and scalp</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Smooths through the hair very easily and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I need to order more!</li>
            <li>However this is the perfect size if you are trying this out for the first time.</li>
            <li>and it is styled into a longer, layered bob which looks SO much better now that I have been using these products!</li>
            <li>But a really nice product nonetheless.</li>
            <li>One of the best, cleanest conditioners I ever used, soft foam.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li>The texture is very light and not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling awesome and clean and exceptionally shiny.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>My shipping was on time : )</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>u will love this.</li>
            <li>I wake up the next morning and my hair is still awesome!</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this since ive seen great reviews on this particular product.</li>
            <li>this is a must have for beautiful soft hair</li>
            <li>I also bought the Macadamia Rejuvenating Shampoo and Macadamia Moisturizing Rinse (also excellent) which I use in repertoire every other time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like I run out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>Even for fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the way it feels (it&#x27;s super creamy but doesn&#x27;t sud and therefore strip my hair).  </li>
            <li>I do have quite a bit of damage on the front sides of my hair from overuse of the curling iron, so need something to moisturize and smooth it out.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning my hair without making my scalp itchy and dry.</li>
            <li>It smells like bananas and leaves my hair shiny and full of volume and bounce.</li>
            <li>Just a couple quick pumps of the dispenser.</li>
            <li>Run a quick comb through and I could go out for the day.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, but it leaves my curly hair tangle free and looking amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try at your own risk, I have only had this same burning tingling experience once before, and it was with Wen, another popular cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>Rinses fast and clean, with no detectable residue.</li>
            <li>Also, this is the first te purchasing products through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more items through your company</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel really clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for the 2nd time today and loved it, will be buying a bigger size.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>ive used a few different cleansing conditioners before with not so great results.</li>
            <li>Very convenient while still conditioning.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell so its gentle on those with allergiesto perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and my daughter has stick straight hair</li>
            <li>and I find my hair doesn&#x27;t break or pull out as much either.  </li>
            <li>but I was very surprised the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>Yes, I have to use a large amount of product for it to cleanse properly, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate and my hair just kept getting frizzier despite anti-frizz products and Wen&#x27;s claim that their products would fix that.</li>
            <li>I usually have to douse my head in conditioner to be able to get a brush through my hair.</li>
            <li>It does come in a smaller travel size; you might buy that first to see how it works.</li>
            <li>product made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair responded so well to this, felt soft again</li>
            <li>my hair felt soft, clean, and my head a little tingly.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling very soft and had a lot of body and movement.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin and am prone to itchy rashes from various skincare products.</li>
            <li>only complaint would be that it should definitely contain more product for the price.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it will be harder to rinse out and may result in the greasy stringies.</li>
            <li>So those with fine hair - Use a very small amount</li>
            <li>Other products did not do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It left my hair feeling very soft and didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> These bottles don&#x27;t last long though.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t seem like it will last very long.  </li>
            <li> I use other products as well (LUSH R &amp; B leave-in conditioner and Instanatural Hair serum which is a mix of argan, coconut and other oils).</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> It was really intense burning after I used it, and as my hair dried, the feeling got less and less however after 6 hours</li>
            <li> It did actually work but left my hair a bit dull and oily.</li>
            <li> I bought enough to last at least 2 months.  </li>
            <li> As it claims, it does cut blow drying time in half for me.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you start out using less of the product than they recommend, and work your way up.</li>
            <li> small size of Macadamia Cleansing Conditioner popped up in my recommendations, and I decided to give it a try as I have been curious about the Macadamia line anyway.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and 3 oz</li>
            <li> But, a little practice and I learned to &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Wasted a bit, which I didn&#x27;t like considering the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is slightly green &amp; nutty, not overwhelming,and does not aggravate my allergies.</li>
            <li> However found it to be VERY HEAVY</li>
            <li> and my hair is now dry, my scalp still feels tingly and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> this is thick and foamlike and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the job.</li>
            <li> I would buy this expensive product if it were not for the uncomfortable tingling/burning feeling it left on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I heard about this product since it&#x27;s Shampoo &amp; Conditioner all in one</li>
            <li> I was growing increasingly frustrated because they are quite expensive and my hair would feel different each time I used them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unsettling to me</li>
            <li> its a bit expensive</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED!</li>
            <li> I began to think I just had really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OBSESSED with this cleansing conditioner!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I bought enough to last at least 2 months.  Also, this is the first te purchasing products through Amazon.  Excellent service.  Will definitely purchase more items through your company</li>
            <li> is great for fine hair and it conditions and cleans all at once with no lather --its great!</li>
            <li> I received a 3 oz sample of this and although I have the oiliest hair on earth (looks unwashed halfway through the day) this took all the grime out. Left my hair feeling awesome and clean and exceptionally shiny. I would buy this expensive product if it were not for the uncomfortable tingling/burning feeling it left on my scalp. It was really intense burning after I used it, and as my hair dried, the feeling got less and less however after 6 hours and my hair is now dry, my scalp still feels tingly and uncomfortable. It&#x27;s unsettling to me and I have only read one review where this happened to someone else. I am therefore giving it away. Try at your own risk, I have only had this same burning tingling experience once before, and it was with Wen, another popular cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I usually have to douse my head in conditioner to be able to get a brush through my hair. Yes, I have to use a large amount of product for it to cleanse properly, but it&#x27;s worth it. I went thru this size bottle within a week but will be purchasing it in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Very convenient while still conditioning. However found it to be VERY HEAVY So those with fine hair - Use a very small amount</li>
            <li> It did actually work but left my hair a bit dull and oily. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this since ive seen great reviews on this particular product. ive used a few different cleansing conditioners before with not so great results. this is thick and foamlike and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the job. my hair felt soft, clean, and my head a little tingly. it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell so its gentle on those with allergiesto perfumes. its a bit expensive but I like it so much im definitely getting this again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It makes my hair cleaner and shinier than shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m in a hurry. These bottles don&#x27;t last long though. It seems like I run out very quickly.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite cleansing conditioner. First, it doesn&#x27;t take much. Just a couple quick pumps of the dispenser. The texture is very light and not greasy feeling. Smooths through the hair very easily and has a pleasant scent. Rinses fast and clean, with no detectable residue. As it claims, it does cut blow drying time in half for me. I love that. It left my hair feeling very soft and didn&#x27;t weigh it down. The only problem I had with it is that, it keeps dispensing a bit after I let up on the button. Wasted a bit, which I didn&#x27;t like considering the price. But, a little practice and I learned to &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Will never use anything else this is a must have for beautiful soft hair I have curly hair and my daughter has stick straight hair we both love it!!  Have been using this product for about 6 months . My shipping was on time : )</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. Makes my hair feel really clean and soft.  I have long thick hair and 3 oz just doesn&#x27;t seem like it will last very long.  But a really nice product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I heard about this product since it&#x27;s Shampoo &amp; Conditioner all in one but I was very surprised the first time I tried it I really loved it.  It left my hair feeling very soft and had a lot of body and movement.  I just used it for the 2nd time today and loved it, will be buying a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Especially for color traded hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I was hesitant at first, but it leaves my curly hair tangle free and looking amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that it should definitely contain more product for the price.</li>
            <li> Use a couple time a week and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I love the smell, the way it feels (it&#x27;s super creamy but doesn&#x27;t sud and therefore strip my hair).  I need to order more!</li>
            <li> Left review on larger size. I bought this for travel purposes. However this is the perfect size if you are trying this out for the first time.</li>
            <li> If u have curly hair  u will love this.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this again. I have always had coarse, wavy and frizzy hair. Other products did not do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product made my hair soft and shiny. My husband even noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OBSESSED with this cleansing conditioner!! OBSESSED! I have fine, color-treated hair. It is a daily struggle to have any volume. Since using this product those days are gone! It smells like bananas and leaves my hair shiny and full of volume and bounce. I wake up the next morning and my hair is still awesome! Run a quick comb through and I could go out for the day. So happy I found this product, never switching!</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. My hair feels like silk after I use it and it still has body. I have long hair and I find my hair doesn&#x27;t break or pull out as much either.  I bought a 3 oz can but next time I&#x27;m going to the 8 oz</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Even for fine hair.</li>
            <li> One of the best, cleanest conditioners I ever used, soft foam.</li>
            <li> I started out using Wen Cleansing Conditioners with mixed results from different scents. I was growing increasingly frustrated because they are quite expensive and my hair would feel different each time I used them. I live in a humid climate and my hair just kept getting frizzier despite anti-frizz products and Wen&#x27;s claim that their products would fix that. I began to think I just had really bad hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small size of Macadamia Cleansing Conditioner popped up in my recommendations, and I decided to give it a try as I have been curious about the Macadamia line anyway. I could not even believe the improvement and cannot describe the relief! My hair responded so well to this, felt soft again (it had begun to feel like straw with continued use of Wen). I do have quite a bit of damage on the front sides of my hair from overuse of the curling iron, so need something to moisturize and smooth it out. I use other products as well (LUSH R &amp; B leave-in conditioner and Instanatural Hair serum which is a mix of argan, coconut and other oils). I also bought the Macadamia Rejuvenating Shampoo and Macadamia Moisturizing Rinse (also excellent) which I use in repertoire every other time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is slightly green &amp; nutty, not overwhelming,and does not aggravate my allergies. My hair is fine but I have lots of it and it is styled into a longer, layered bob which looks SO much better now that I have been using these products!</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily hair and scalp and I was concerned that this might be too conditioning and would just leave it greasy and stringy. I was wrong. It does a great job of cleaning my hair without making my scalp itchy and dry. I would suggest you start out using less of the product than they recommend, and work your way up. If you use too much it will be harder to rinse out and may result in the greasy stringies. Also, I have very sensitive skin and am prone to itchy rashes from various skincare products. I have had no problem at all with this product. It does come in a smaller travel size; you might buy that first to see how it works.</li>
