            <li>Probably more a reflection on my problem instead of the product so the search continues.</li>

            <li>This cream works super well and absorbs really quickly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream definitely works a lot better than the rest of the creams out there to make sure your feet look fabulous for summer.  However, you have to make sure that you apply it everyday or else it will be back to square one.  My podiatrist used this cream on me at his office and that is why I bought it. Definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a foot cream that didn&#x27;t leave my feet oily. And I can never find one that doesn&#x27;t smell like peppermint! So I was delighted when I received this bottle and the smell is nice but neutral, and the lotion literally COMPLETELY absorbs. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff. Non greasy, lovely scent and best of all, it works.</li>
            <li> Love it. It was recommended by my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product that really does soothe the feet.  I apply it just before getting in bed and instead of dry, cracked skin, I have soft, skin on my feet plus the lotion smells really good.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. That is all i have to say an di hate that you force me to type excess</li>
            <li> MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED IT</li>
            <li> This cream is too watery.  Even when I shake it up, it comes out as a loose liquid.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream but my callouses are extra tough and I haven&#x27;t had a miracle occur..but, with that said...I&#x27;m going to keep using it and hope that in time it will solve the problem.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried several foot creams. He did a web search for this one after using it one time. This cream leaves his dry cracked heels softer than any other cream he has used. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on super dry feet.  This is hands down the best foot cream I have ever found.  We originally purchased it from the Foot Doctor&#x27;s office and found the price online with prime shipping identical.</li>
            <li> bought a few for gifts</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my 90 year old mother for $18.00 in her podiatrist office.  They recommended it to soften the calluses on the her feet..  It has worked effectively, but it did take time and applying it consistently.  She uses it every night before bed and she doesn&#x27;t complain of her feet hurting anymore. She&#x27;s been using it for about 6 months now.  It took about 3 months to soften the affected areas.  It is a much better value to buy it here considering continued use.</li>
            <li> Do you have dry, cracked, flaky, thick skin on your heels?  Ew, gross.  Use this stuff and you won&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> This is very good for dry feet. I first bought this at my podiatrists office a while back and it works great.</li>
            <li> This cream works super well and absorbs really quickly.  It works much better than regular lotion.  It does not leave the feet feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This was originally recommended by my podiatrist some time ago and I have decided to find it on my own.  I have used this with great results.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this cream at the podiatrist&#x27;s office. It&#x27;s smooth, not greasy, softens and smells great. I was happy to find it online in a slightly larger size for the same price. I&#x27;m not sure what the miracle ðŸ˜‡ is, but it&#x27;s definitely a nice product.</li>
            <li> Love this foot cream!</li>
            <li> Great for corrective worn heels</li>
            <li> Discovered this product several years ago....purchased at a podiatrist office.&lt;br /&gt;After a number of online searches over the years....I re-discovered it on amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitive....you need no other for foot care....</li>
            <li> Works sweet softens feet like happy treat.......o.k. so im not a poet, but, this simply works and has done a great job on my poor old stumps and would buy again.</li>
            <li> While this is probably a good moisturizer, it didn&#x27;t seem to help much with my cracked heels. But to be fair, I&#x27;ve tried other products that folks have said was the only thing that worked for them and didn&#x27;t seem to get the same results. Probably more a reflection on my problem instead of the product so the search continues.</li>
            <li> My mother in law uses this for years. I started using it. Its great and good for between pedicures. Its the only thing that works. I tried urea cream which may work better, but that is so expensive and has a shelf life that is too short for me. I tried this and it works great is a reasonable price. I have very rough elbows (thank you Dad!) and I use this and my face cream on my elbows each day. Only thing that keeps them semi-normal. I have used for several years and go back to this product all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 years, make your feet so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I keep ordering it and you should too</li>
