    <ol>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great for a product like this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for medium hair.</li>
            <li>I use this to spike up my hair yet have my hair be adjustable during the day and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is gatsby man, the best product out in the market</li>
            <li>awesome hair wax</li>
            <li>Best styler I&#x27;ve used for wavy, colored hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair gel I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)Ideal for medium length hair but probably not the best gel for longer hairs.</li>
            <li>product smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome...</li>
            <li>This is another wonderful product for your hair.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been looking for the best hair product.</li>
            <li>The best is the pink/red one though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the best products that I have used.</li>
            <li>However, this one is the one that I like the best.</li>
            <li>And this product does great!</li>
            <li>and I like Gatsby&#x27;s Moving Rubber hair wax the best.</li>
            <li>Very Good product.</li>
            <li>so happy this formula works for me, and it works so perfect</li>
            <li>Great product, I have been using it for couple months now, and it must be the best hair wax I have used.</li>
            <li>When it is shorter than 2 inches, I find that this is the ideal product.</li>

            <li>Plus it has this great fruity scent to it.</li>
            <li>This one works great and smells great too.</li>
            <li>What also great is that you can reshape your hair anytime in the day by just moisting your hand with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The great thing about this product is that this is not a grease or petroleum based wax</li>
            <li>It is incredible how good these products are if you use them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m indian, and it works great with my hair</li>

            <li>I have medium length hair that&#x27;s not oily and this product works great in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was so happy to get this.</li>
            <li>Works great and smells great.</li>
            <li>The container design is also attractive.</li>
            <li>The hold is medium at best though I believe it would probably work better with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, fruity smell which goes away once it dries.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, it goes on great and is truly amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and tames my hair ^^</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good and looks good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Good spike and feel</li>
            <li>Also, this stuff smells AMAZINGLY good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>hair sticks up a lot around the crown because it&#x27;s fairly fine/thin.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, works well.</li>
            <li>This product smells as good as it works.</li>
            <li>Good hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells really good, feels good on the hair.</li>
            <li>It provides good volume and smells good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, the product is great for giving volume to my bangs and top layers.</li>
            <li>Works great, make sure to warm up in your hands before applying or else you&#x27;ll have clumpy hair.</li>
            <li>Grear product, our favorite brand!</li>
            <li>I hope to experiment more and see how it fares!</li>
            <li>Good product if you use wax with very light apple aroma.</li>
            <li>its amazing what it does to my hair</li>
            <li>This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you have light hair that is about shoulder-length, this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li>It brings a nice shine to my hair as well as volume.</li>
            <li>tidy.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nice, i guess.</li>
            <li>recommend this for anyone who wants to get that awesome bedhead/surfer look.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t keep it in a warm place or else the gel will melt and it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I honestly would recommend someone on the borderline of buying this, to buy this.</li>
            <li>He actually liked it a lot, and adapted well to using it.</li>
            <li>The apple aroma is pleasant and not sickening.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, and washes out clean.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light green-apple scent.</li>
            <li>I have used many ones including the popular Axe ones.</li>
            <li>Using this stuff is more cost effective.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t for the stickyness and the difficulty in getting it out of your hair, I think this product would work great, as it does everything else right.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, great volume and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I will try their stronger products to see if they work better for me because it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I find this to have more hold and definition than the Lucido line, which is for females.</li>
            <li>im glad I bought gatsby.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best wax I ever used!</li>
            <li>hair looks nature healthy and textured.</li>
            <li>I love Gatsby products.</li>
            <li>Kiehls Creative Cream Wax</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t permanently keep my hair stuck in one position, but instead I&#x27;m able to fix my hair through out the day just in case something happens.</li>
            <li>More specifically I get my hair cut with scissors</li>
            <li>It holds much better throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Aveda Men &#x27;pure-formanceâ„¢&#x27; Grooming Clay is a much better product and washes out easier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more like a cream than Fibre is.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not sticky and has a matte finish.</li>
            <li>It basically gives any hair style you want more stiffness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products and this rates in the top...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff-</li>
            <li>and love that it&#x27;s not $20</li>
            <li>smells like apples :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed that i only used a pea drop of Gatsby</li>
            <li>/&gt;i really love it and will be buying it from now on....</li>
            <li>love gatsby brand, i&#x27;ve been using this for years</li>
            <li>Always love Gatsby products.</li>
            <li>It moves and swirls like the many snake heads of Medusa.</li>
            <li>sure to check on their website because they have a style guide on how to use each type of their product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got all of my stylists to use them and they love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I could be able to run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied, would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably get a more stiffer Gatsby paste, but all the \\&quot;Moving</li>
            <li>But it is very shapeable and smells great.</li>
            <li>This may be appealing to both men and women users of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve left at the bottom advice for people who are like me who are seeking to get the best products for their hair.</li>
            <li>The more you use, the heavier and shinier your hair gets.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.</li>
            <li>Works better with hair length as seen on the label and shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>hair to be restyled after having it on for some time.&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves hair looking mostly natural.&lt;br /&gt;-Only</li>
            <li>For the record, my hair is about 2 inches on top after a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I also found was that if you have a better wax, then you can go longer without getting a haircut, which can cost 15-50 dollars a month.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can mix the products and reshape your hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Not as it use to be where it was more like a cream consistency</li>
            <li>This is currently my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>like apple, which is great, pretty good holding power and my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t give that much shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Its hold is pretty good</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Ordered and got what I wanted, good quality fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Nice product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>packages always come very quickly and I always am satisfied with Gatsby products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While getting acquainted with the product, I was able to put my hair in many amusing and surprisingly gravity-defying positions, but the stresses of the show would inevitably cause my &#x27;do</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the best for fine hair due to the lack of hold, but I still like it, because it smells the best out of all the products and gives a completely natural look while washing out super easy.</li>
            <li>Great natural looking hold&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>This wax is awesome for medium to medium long hair and its even more awesome if you mix it with gatsby cool wet.</li>
            <li>Good item fast delivery.</li>
            <li>First off let me just say that I love the Gatsby products!</li>
            <li>Makes spiking the hair easy to do, but I don&#x27;t spike it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.  </li>
            <li>It has plenty of hold to easily form my sometimes unwilling hair into the style I want.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and to wash out.</li>
            <li>- I damp my hair before putting in any hair styling, so with that in mind, applying this product was easy.</li>
            <li>The product itself has a cream-like consistency, and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It also smells strongly of apples.</li>
            <li>Strong hold yet</li>
            <li>First of all, this item smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>But this is true of most hair gels.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if it can hold perfectly for those first 5 minutes because I&#x27;m looking for something to hold for the ENTIRE DAY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very strong  for some parts of my hair but is perfect for others.</li>
            <li>I did a little research before making my purchase deciding which product would be best for me and my desired hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Great for a Visual Kei style!</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble finding something that can control my hair and thus does the best job out of anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>It works best if you take two finger fulls and rub them between your hands and then work it into towel dried hair before you style.</li>
            <li>This wax, smells delicious, its got a green apple aroma that smells sooooooooooooooo</li>
            <li>Thankfully it&#x27;s available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily, along with a leave in conditioner, and it holds my hair great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light.</li>
            <li>great for short to med length hair.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I like the styling effect and the light apple fragrance.</li>
            <li>The gel is smooth but NOT OILY.</li>
            <li>like green the best, and i&#x27;ve tried all the others.  </li>
            <li>noticed, as well, that the left-over curl from my rollers reacted more to the Gatsby, making them separate and turn into more defined straight</li>
            <li>I will update if it does more good to my hair in future experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to get the right product (color Gatsby) for your hair length &amp; needs.</li>
            <li>if I spelt that right) gel one, but it holds better.</li>
            <li>The product can be washed off easily in the shower, and some quick soap and water to remove from your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It not only gives you your hair a great look, but it is super to apply.</li>
            <li>Lasts long, smells great &amp; works.</li>
            <li>When I tried this stuff out the first time i was wondering how they could call this wax when it looks and feels more like creme.  </li>
            <li>I combine this with blow drying gel, and blow dry my hair, and it gives me great volume.</li>
            <li>Takes two or three washes for your hair to feel clean again.</li>
            <li>first I was worried, because I knew that a hair product like this would probably not be likely to benefit my hair type, but surprisingly it helped sculpt my hair in ways that i would otherwise need a pin for, it also helps stretch my hair a bit more.</li>
            <li>and then when I go on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Seems to have a better hold on my waves throughout the day without much need</li>
            <li>Good product for short hairs.</li>
            <li>I have every colour of Moving Rubber there is and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li>And after using the trial size, I&#x27;ve decided to purchase the full size</li>
            <li>dime-sized amount applied to a full head of thick/medium-length hair does wonders.</li>
            <li>only good thing I can say about this product is it&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li>For me having short hair and only parting it to one side this was the perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I mean wax) would be the best solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like super sweet apples that I&#x27;d like to eat.</li>
            <li>Smells like apples and washes out pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product if you don&#x27;t want extreme hold.</li>
            <li>that I was almost gonna cut my hair bold one day because of the frustuation.</li>
            <li>Seems more appropriate for short hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl but was super intrigued by the tutorials put out by Gatsby.</li>
            <li>I have searched far and wide for a hair product that would work best for my hair.</li>
            <li>The now&lt;br /&gt;To get it out really quick, if you&#x27;re loyal to the gatsby line</li>
            <li>You will have a new favorite, too, if you order this.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very viscous and &#x27;rubs in&#x27; really easily.  </li>
            <li>Anyway other than that i&#x27;m pretty happy with what I bought.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well in most situations and it smells like green apples, which is a pleasant plus.</li>
            <li>definetely looks more natural than the purple.</li>
            <li>You have to try it, its so worth it and for the price its a no brainer.</li>
            <li>It adds volume, and texture since I like my hair to be on the messy side (out of bed look), I&#x27;ve tried so many hair styling wax (Garnier Fructis, The Body Shop Beeswax, Short Sexy Hair, and that blue Manipulator, just to name some) and this Gatsby works best for me.</li>
            <li>But it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>This hair spray is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but there is a lot of it so most hair products fall flat.</li>
            <li>Gives my usually flat hair more of a light and airy/beachy surfer look.</li>
            <li>I got this pretty quick</li>
            <li>The hold is also strong and pliable, so on the rare occasion my hair might get a bit messed up, it was easy to get my hair back to how I like it.</li>
            <li>i think but for the quality is well worth it ;)</li>
            <li>It has great hold and gives my hair a shape it usually doesn&#x27;t get on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great like green apples!</li>
            <li>No hard stuff with gel and not the cheap axe hair wax stuff.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s just because I have really fine hair, but the pink Gatsby works better for me even when my hair is medium length...</li>
            <li>product however works best probably on Asian hairstyle, and it works better with very dry hair (not towel dry).</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair wax out of all brands, i like the green one better than the purple</li>
            <li>Not as good as the black one.</li>
            <li>I have tried all of the gatsby waxes, and I definitely like the green the best, but it depends on your style.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to avoid having that wet gel look that so many junior high kids sport, and have a smoother and more matte look.</li>
            <li>it holds pretty well and works well with fringe hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Gives light hold with a natural finish.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as described and holds just as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Medium - My bangs are about to my eyes and my sides are tapered&lt;br /&gt;Products I am comparing it to: Kiehl&#x27;s Creative Cream Wax, American Crew Fiber, Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream</li>
            <li>It has more hold, leaves my hair stickier, and clumps a bit, especially in the bangs.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it looks like a cream at first</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different gels, pomades, waxes and cremes</li>
            <li>I first got some when visiting Hong Kong a few years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>There are no hassles or touching up required for me; I just rub some on my fingertips and run my fingers through my hair multiple times before forming.</li>
            <li>I first found this hair wax while traveling in Japan.</li>
            <li>it works pretty well</li>
            <li>locally - American Crew has too many parabens for my taste</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t use much, maybe a pinky tips worth.</li>
            <li>Always loved this green gatsby.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft wax in the container, but after you put a little on your palm and rub your hands together, then run your hands through your hair, it provides great all day hold.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something like Fiber by American Crew, but it&#x27;s way more easier to apply and gives you more control all day long.</li>
            <li>Whatever the formula is, it works better than the domestic stuff, which I find falls off easily and doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, can&#x27;t get these at any of the Japanese markets in Southern California (that i&#x27;ve checked..)</li>
            <li>There might be better products that I&#x27;m unaware about, but for the price this works very well.</li>
            <li>To get an ideal styling with Crew Fiber I would have to hair dry my hair but leave it slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this could actually work nearly as well on my hair with the right products :)</li>
            <li>On top of that, the product feels a bit sticky and dry in your hair which can easily make your hands feel the same if you need to tweak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Performance: I have very soft and silky hair, which was cut short (thus the purchase of this product :)) I do have quite a bit of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair forms and shapes up nicely in the style that I want it to, and stays that way with a little bit of hair spray.</li>
            <li>so I need a little more than most people with regular fine asian hair.</li>
            <li>Anything you like that isn&#x27;t very strong and won&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
            <li>Hopefully other buyers will be weary as the wax tends to really stick to your hair, however extremely easy to wash off, and even okay for daily or extended use.</li>
            <li>This has a much stickier residue and for some reason doesn&#x27;t give as nice as a texture unless my hair is blow dried.</li>
            <li>Does not move much</li>
            <li>Bought this for my grandson he said it works very well</li>
            <li>My hair: Straight and very fine&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like it&#x27;s gonna be used Bella fast</li>
            <li>Stuff doesnt get flakey if touched, very waxing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t apply much</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy but it holds like much greasier maximum strength hair gels.</li>
            <li>If you want your hair to hold really well</li>
            <li>tried to use Gatsby for my attempt at heat-free straight hair, using rollers, straightening serum, and a night-time wrap.</li>
            <li>give this a  four-star rating because I know that it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault that it hasn&#x27;t taken as much effect as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I read on the Gatsby FAQ that it solidifies gradually with air exposure, and that the properties within this product can separate with too much heat and no longer usable.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, no doubt about it, and I really love the smell of gatsby (perhaps even addicted), but its really not for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I have about 1 1/2 to 2 inches or so of light Asian hair that I form into a fauxhawk.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and will continue to use this product exclusively!</li>
            <li>, even after intense workouts&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Every time I would try to rinse the product out of my hair each night, it would still feel very well</li>
            <li>but you need hairspray to hold it up if you&#x27;re planning to go out the whole day.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Not only you will find some useful tips, but also a chuckle and some fun</li>
            <li>Gives you nice volume and last all day and next day too probably.</li>
            <li>nice (green apple)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br</li>
            <li>With all the strong reviews and videos about this stuff, I was expecting really strong hold on my thick medium length hair.</li>
            <li>It did so much better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl with short hair, this product works great for short to medium long hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super frustrating messing with your hair &amp;#34;here and there&amp;#34; and getting that perfect look, check the mirror 10 minutes later and your hair is gone flat.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a hair product with strong hold, that doesn&#x27;t loose effect over the day, and that doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or oily look or build up....</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t look real, and the texture effect you just created won&#x27;t move free by itself (think windy-day and how each individual hair strand flows naturally)</li>
            <li>same as my comment, i love this product but green wasn&#x27;t for me, i just bought the purplish pink one and see how that goes :) but overall straight up dragon ball z look, and how i love it</li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t help that much when I&#x27;m sweating or with humidity when it comes to the hold, but in general it&#x27;s fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get fooled by its runny texture of the product, it works wonder with just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>So, I have African American hair, mostly curly and coily.</li>
            <li>This particular gatsby pot may be watery for some, I like this one in particular because it is Lasts all day even if I play with my hair</li>
            <li>But I personally can&#x27;t get over its flaws and have since moved onto another product that, personally, works better.</li>
            <li>fact, I would say that not only does this stuff last throughout the day, but it looks better as the day wears on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>price on amazon is better than the prices at our local japanese stores in nyc.  </li>
            <li>Provides decent hold for medium-length hair after towel drying post-shower.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different hair products for over ten years</li>
            <li>It adds a reasonable, but not excessive, amount of shine.</li>
            <li>(Not too much or your hair won&#x27;t be soft anymore!)</li>
            <li>One application lasts me the entire day (and then some) and it&#x27;s surprising how long your hair will stay the same (if there&#x27;s no wind or anything).</li>
            <li>highly recomend it to anywone with short-medium hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>you are looking for some high quality wax, this is it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend both products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am writing this without having tried the really high end products.</li>
            <li>It works well, adds texture, has a nice smell to it, and has a different quality to it than other hair products.</li>
            <li>can achieve the same sort of styling with Gatsby Air Rise, but get better results with less meticulous setup (right dampness).  </li>
            <li>Does not wash out as easy as some other products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think the wax is strong, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;ll fix your hair in place you may wish to find some other wax or get a hair spray.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t gunk up your hair like the other ones and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other things to note, it has a strong green apple scent which I think is a refreshing difference to the cologne-like smells of other hair products.</li>
            <li>The green one is my favorite of all the gatsby product.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I most likely inherited the bald gene from my grandfather passed down via my mom (whose scalp is 85%+ visible,</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty wet, but quickly dries into a natural finish.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be pretty long, so when I went to my stylist to have it cut for the show, she suggested we push the limits of the appropriate length of the era, and just product it down within an inch of its life.  </li>
            <li>This can be a con for some, but if you look at it differently, it allows the product to hold better in humid or wet conditions like during the rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used a different brand wax and as expected it netting okay results.  </li>
            <li>This product is kind of expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I rub the product over my palms sufficiently, so it is not due to too much product in one area.</li>
            <li>no matter how much she dyes her hair), and since my hair is very soft, very thin, and cant defy gravity, its a tremendous disadvantage for me as the years go by and more hair falls off.</li>
            <li>The reason I like their products is that they doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like glue or sticky as pomades, yet able to shape your hair looking natural; it is no wonder it is called \\&quot;moving rubber\\</li>
            <li>My front bangs are long and Sebastian isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>Ive been using so many waxes, gels, hairsprays, excessive time etc,</li>
            <li>My hair (on top, where I style it) will usually be between 1.5 inches to 3 inches.</li>
            <li>This is that very product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than one fingertip&#x27;s worth of this creamy-like stuff is enough for my hair for the entire day.</li>
            <li>After many attempts, I have yet to master the looks I see in the Gatsby video tutorials and various other tutorials.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use less, because if I used less the hold wouldn&#x27;t be good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Gatsby colors (hold types) and liked those too, but this is less sticky than the purple and works for my short (1&amp;#34; to 2&amp;#34;) hair.</li>
            <li>Also, it is pretty sticky, so make sure you use it in the few minutes just barely before your hair gets dry</li>
            <li>Crew Fiber does an okay job of that, but it loses hold over the day, it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, and it clumps a bit in the hair.  </li>
            <li>hair still feels soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to keep my hair up for an entire day.</li>
            <li>but yet still look naturally flowing, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wild and spiky</li>
            <li>Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium</li>
            <li>part of all is that it doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent in it, so it works well for a girl like me.</li>
            <li>Hair looks natural and not goopy.</li>
            <li>I saw a whole bunch of reviews talking about how well it works for Asian men&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>Not so much with short cropped hair.</li>
            <li>This wax is also natural looking.</li>
            <li>It holds real well and can easily last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>good and a small amount is really enough to hold long hair&lt;</li>
            <li>Make sure not to use too much; your hair might take on a thick gooey texture, and if not spread out enough will cake up.</li>
            <li>;  This was perfect for preventing annoying flyways and controlling any frizziness.</li>
            <li>I really like that I don&#x27;t need my hair to be a certain level of damp compared to the American Crew Fiber I was using before, but I find that the hold is not as strong as I would like it (very thick, straight, coarse hair).  </li>
            <li>I have really flat and straight hair</li>
            <li>For a long time, I looked for a hair product that gave my hair enough hold but was light enough to not clump up</li>
            <li>so I really recommend it for those that need something to lay the edges flat and stick through the day!</li>
            <li>My hair is capable of doing many different things, as it is not as kinky and hard to deal with, in comparison to those who have similar hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Does wonders for my hair keeps it back or even up high.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected from my first Gatsby product.</li>
            <li>After I blow dry it, I put very shiny pomade on because this product has a matte look which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
            <li>wax applies really easily; some hair products are really thick and requires a lot of work to be applied to your hair, but Gatsby isn&#x27;t like that at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember to keep this product in cool places, and to seal it TIGHTLY the moment you&#x27;re done with it!</li>
            <li>Only use a tiny wax to try them out first, and apply from roots to add volume and the hold last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic without causing hard or sticky hair and the green apple smell is super yummy.  </li>
            <li>i used 1 tip of a finger on my long hair and wow !!&lt;</li>
            <li>There are plenty of tutorials online, and some by Gatsby themselves to help you get a general idea of what you can do with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair is medium long,  so I only need as much as the tip of my finger.  </li>
            <li>It holds, but is soft enough to shape it around.</li>
            <li>It holds its natural texture, yet formed shape, the entire day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely stronger than gel (while leaving my hair soft and \\&quot;moveable\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>If you have money to spend, you might want to look into those, but as far as the moderately priced products go, this item does the job.</li>
            <li>This green gatsby hair product, and the other color varieties, provides great hold without being overly shiny or hard.  </li>
            <li>After my first tub ran out, I was using other hair products that just did not do the same thing.</li>
            <li>In the shower, you really have to rub it out of your hair and scalp, unlike other hair products I&#x27;ve used which often just melt in the water.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to manipulate in my hands and only a small dime sized amount or less is needed to style my hair.</li>
            <li>I wet my hair first with a little water, apply cool wet to make your hair look cool and a little wet, then apply gatsby air rise to hold your hair however you want it.</li>
            <li>Check out the description as the different products Gatsby offers have different hold and shine ratings.</li>
            <li>The first time that I opened the container, I immediately smelled the sour apple scent and wanted the put the entire thing in my mouth</li>
            <li>I first bought this when I was having little luck finding hair wax or creme</li>
            <li>It smells great like green apple candies though it can start to smell more...chemical or weird when left unused for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looks totally natural yet it still holds for a long time.</li>
            <li>At first bought this along with the pink one, wondering which one would be better for my hair, but then i realized both are just not good enough to even come close to styling my hair without the heavy use of hairspray.</li>
            <li>Only use this for hanging out or social stuff never any athletic events.</li>
            <li>After I get a small dab, I make sure to furiously rub between my palms to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; the wax and literally make my hair messy by tossing it all over</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than the Crew Fibre I&#x27;ve used for the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next time I need to use less haha.</li>
            <li>(so that it&#x27;s still just a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of tough to wash out...</li>
            <li>Hair has a little bit of a sticky feel to it unless you really rub it in&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>

            <li> The great thing about this product is that this is not a grease or petroleum based wax</li>

            <li> I have medium length hair that&#x27;s not oily and this product works great in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was so happy to get this.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great.</li>
            <li> The container design is also attractive.</li>
            <li> The hold is medium at best though I believe it would probably work better with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, fruity smell which goes away once it dries.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, it goes on great and is truly amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and tames my hair ^^</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells good and looks good.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Good spike and feel</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff smells AMAZINGLY good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> hair sticks up a lot around the crown because it&#x27;s fairly fine/thin.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, works well.</li>
            <li> This product smells as good as it works.</li>
            <li> Good hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells really good, feels good on the hair.</li>
            <li> It provides good volume and smells good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, the product is great for giving volume to my bangs and top layers.</li>
            <li> Works great, make sure to warm up in your hands before applying or else you&#x27;ll have clumpy hair.</li>
            <li> Grear product, our favorite brand!</li>
            <li> I hope to experiment more and see how it fares!</li>
            <li> Good product if you use wax with very light apple aroma.</li>
            <li> its amazing what it does to my hair</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li> If you have light hair that is about shoulder-length, this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li> It brings a nice shine to my hair as well as volume.</li>
            <li> tidy.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s nice, i guess.</li>
            <li> recommend this for anyone who wants to get that awesome bedhead/surfer look.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t keep it in a warm place or else the gel will melt and it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I honestly would recommend someone on the borderline of buying this, to buy this.</li>
            <li> He actually liked it a lot, and adapted well to using it.</li>
            <li> The apple aroma is pleasant and not sickening.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, and washes out clean.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant light green-apple scent.</li>
            <li> I have used many ones including the popular Axe ones.</li>
            <li> Using this stuff is more cost effective.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t for the stickyness and the difficulty in getting it out of your hair, I think this product would work great, as it does everything else right.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great volume and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I will try their stronger products to see if they work better for me because it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I find this to have more hold and definition than the Lucido line, which is for females.</li>
            <li> im glad I bought gatsby.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best wax I ever used!</li>
            <li> hair looks nature healthy and textured.</li>
            <li> I love Gatsby products.</li>
            <li> Kiehls Creative Cream Wax</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t permanently keep my hair stuck in one position, but instead I&#x27;m able to fix my hair through out the day just in case something happens.</li>
            <li> More specifically I get my hair cut with scissors</li>
            <li> It holds much better throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Aveda Men &#x27;pure-formanceâ„¢&#x27; Grooming Clay is a much better product and washes out easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more like a cream than Fibre is.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not sticky and has a matte finish.</li>
            <li> It basically gives any hair style you want more stiffness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products and this rates in the top...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff-</li>
            <li> and love that it&#x27;s not $20</li>
            <li> smells like apples :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed that i only used a pea drop of Gatsby</li>
            <li> /&gt;i really love it and will be buying it from now on....</li>
            <li> love gatsby brand, i&#x27;ve been using this for years</li>
            <li> Always love Gatsby products.</li>
            <li> It moves and swirls like the many snake heads of Medusa.</li>
            <li> sure to check on their website because they have a style guide on how to use each type of their product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got all of my stylists to use them and they love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could be able to run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied, would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably get a more stiffer Gatsby paste, but all the \\&quot;Moving</li>
            <li> But it is very shapeable and smells great.</li>
            <li> This may be appealing to both men and women users of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve left at the bottom advice for people who are like me who are seeking to get the best products for their hair.</li>
            <li> The more you use, the heavier and shinier your hair gets.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.</li>
            <li> Works better with hair length as seen on the label and shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> hair to be restyled after having it on for some time.&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves hair looking mostly natural.&lt;br /&gt;-Only</li>
            <li> For the record, my hair is about 2 inches on top after a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I also found was that if you have a better wax, then you can go longer without getting a haircut, which can cost 15-50 dollars a month.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can mix the products and reshape your hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Not as it use to be where it was more like a cream consistency</li>
            <li> This is currently my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> like apple, which is great, pretty good holding power and my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t give that much shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Its hold is pretty good</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Ordered and got what I wanted, good quality fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> packages always come very quickly and I always am satisfied with Gatsby products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While getting acquainted with the product, I was able to put my hair in many amusing and surprisingly gravity-defying positions, but the stresses of the show would inevitably cause my &#x27;do</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best for fine hair due to the lack of hold, but I still like it, because it smells the best out of all the products and gives a completely natural look while washing out super easy.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking hold&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome for medium to medium long hair and its even more awesome if you mix it with gatsby cool wet.</li>
            <li> Good item fast delivery.</li>
            <li> First off let me just say that I love the Gatsby products!</li>
            <li> Makes spiking the hair easy to do, but I don&#x27;t spike it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.  </li>
            <li> It has plenty of hold to easily form my sometimes unwilling hair into the style I want.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and to wash out.</li>
            <li> - I damp my hair before putting in any hair styling, so with that in mind, applying this product was easy.</li>
            <li> The product itself has a cream-like consistency, and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It also smells strongly of apples.</li>
            <li> Strong hold yet</li>
            <li> First of all, this item smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> But this is true of most hair gels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if it can hold perfectly for those first 5 minutes because I&#x27;m looking for something to hold for the ENTIRE DAY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very strong  for some parts of my hair but is perfect for others.</li>
            <li> I did a little research before making my purchase deciding which product would be best for me and my desired hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> Great for a Visual Kei style!</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding something that can control my hair and thus does the best job out of anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> It works best if you take two finger fulls and rub them between your hands and then work it into towel dried hair before you style.</li>
            <li> This wax, smells delicious, its got a green apple aroma that smells sooooooooooooooo</li>
            <li> Thankfully it&#x27;s available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily, along with a leave in conditioner, and it holds my hair great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light.</li>
            <li> great for short to med length hair.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like the styling effect and the light apple fragrance.</li>
            <li> The gel is smooth but NOT OILY.</li>
            <li> like green the best, and i&#x27;ve tried all the others.  </li>
            <li> noticed, as well, that the left-over curl from my rollers reacted more to the Gatsby, making them separate and turn into more defined straight</li>
            <li> I will update if it does more good to my hair in future experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to get the right product (color Gatsby) for your hair length &amp; needs.</li>
            <li> if I spelt that right) gel one, but it holds better.</li>
            <li> The product can be washed off easily in the shower, and some quick soap and water to remove from your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It not only gives you your hair a great look, but it is super to apply.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, smells great &amp; works.</li>
            <li> When I tried this stuff out the first time i was wondering how they could call this wax when it looks and feels more like creme.  </li>
            <li> I combine this with blow drying gel, and blow dry my hair, and it gives me great volume.</li>
            <li> Takes two or three washes for your hair to feel clean again.</li>
            <li> first I was worried, because I knew that a hair product like this would probably not be likely to benefit my hair type, but surprisingly it helped sculpt my hair in ways that i would otherwise need a pin for, it also helps stretch my hair a bit more.</li>
            <li> and then when I go on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a better hold on my waves throughout the day without much need</li>
            <li> Good product for short hairs.</li>
            <li> I have every colour of Moving Rubber there is and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> And after using the trial size, I&#x27;ve decided to purchase the full size</li>
            <li> dime-sized amount applied to a full head of thick/medium-length hair does wonders.</li>
            <li> only good thing I can say about this product is it&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> For me having short hair and only parting it to one side this was the perfect fit.  </li>
            <li> and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I mean wax) would be the best solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like super sweet apples that I&#x27;d like to eat.</li>
            <li> Smells like apples and washes out pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product if you don&#x27;t want extreme hold.</li>
            <li> that I was almost gonna cut my hair bold one day because of the frustuation.</li>
            <li> Seems more appropriate for short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl but was super intrigued by the tutorials put out by Gatsby.</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for a hair product that would work best for my hair.</li>
            <li> The now&lt;br /&gt;To get it out really quick, if you&#x27;re loyal to the gatsby line</li>
            <li> You will have a new favorite, too, if you order this.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very viscous and &#x27;rubs in&#x27; really easily.  </li>
            <li> Anyway other than that i&#x27;m pretty happy with what I bought.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well in most situations and it smells like green apples, which is a pleasant plus.</li>
            <li> definetely looks more natural than the purple.</li>
            <li> You have to try it, its so worth it and for the price its a no brainer.</li>
            <li> It adds volume, and texture since I like my hair to be on the messy side (out of bed look), I&#x27;ve tried so many hair styling wax (Garnier Fructis, The Body Shop Beeswax, Short Sexy Hair, and that blue Manipulator, just to name some) and this Gatsby works best for me.</li>
            <li> But it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but there is a lot of it so most hair products fall flat.</li>
            <li> Gives my usually flat hair more of a light and airy/beachy surfer look.</li>
            <li> I got this pretty quick</li>
            <li> The hold is also strong and pliable, so on the rare occasion my hair might get a bit messed up, it was easy to get my hair back to how I like it.</li>
            <li> i think but for the quality is well worth it ;)</li>
            <li> It has great hold and gives my hair a shape it usually doesn&#x27;t get on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great like green apples!</li>
            <li> No hard stuff with gel and not the cheap axe hair wax stuff.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s just because I have really fine hair, but the pink Gatsby works better for me even when my hair is medium length...</li>
            <li> product however works best probably on Asian hairstyle, and it works better with very dry hair (not towel dry).</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair wax out of all brands, i like the green one better than the purple</li>
            <li> Not as good as the black one.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the gatsby waxes, and I definitely like the green the best, but it depends on your style.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid having that wet gel look that so many junior high kids sport, and have a smoother and more matte look.</li>
            <li> it holds pretty well and works well with fringe hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Gives light hold with a natural finish.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as described and holds just as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Medium - My bangs are about to my eyes and my sides are tapered&lt;br /&gt;Products I am comparing it to: Kiehl&#x27;s Creative Cream Wax, American Crew Fiber, Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream</li>
            <li> It has more hold, leaves my hair stickier, and clumps a bit, especially in the bangs.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it looks like a cream at first</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different gels, pomades, waxes and cremes</li>
            <li> I first got some when visiting Hong Kong a few years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> There are no hassles or touching up required for me; I just rub some on my fingertips and run my fingers through my hair multiple times before forming.</li>
            <li> I first found this hair wax while traveling in Japan.</li>
            <li> it works pretty well</li>
            <li> locally - American Crew has too many parabens for my taste</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t use much, maybe a pinky tips worth.</li>
            <li> Always loved this green gatsby.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft wax in the container, but after you put a little on your palm and rub your hands together, then run your hands through your hair, it provides great all day hold.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something like Fiber by American Crew, but it&#x27;s way more easier to apply and gives you more control all day long.</li>
            <li> Whatever the formula is, it works better than the domestic stuff, which I find falls off easily and doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, can&#x27;t get these at any of the Japanese markets in Southern California (that i&#x27;ve checked..)</li>
            <li> There might be better products that I&#x27;m unaware about, but for the price this works very well.</li>
            <li> To get an ideal styling with Crew Fiber I would have to hair dry my hair but leave it slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this could actually work nearly as well on my hair with the right products :)</li>
            <li> On top of that, the product feels a bit sticky and dry in your hair which can easily make your hands feel the same if you need to tweak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance: I have very soft and silky hair, which was cut short (thus the purchase of this product :)) I do have quite a bit of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair forms and shapes up nicely in the style that I want it to, and stays that way with a little bit of hair spray.</li>
            <li> so I need a little more than most people with regular fine asian hair.</li>
            <li> Anything you like that isn&#x27;t very strong and won&#x27;t weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> Hopefully other buyers will be weary as the wax tends to really stick to your hair, however extremely easy to wash off, and even okay for daily or extended use.</li>
            <li> This has a much stickier residue and for some reason doesn&#x27;t give as nice as a texture unless my hair is blow dried.</li>
            <li> Does not move much</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandson he said it works very well</li>
            <li> My hair: Straight and very fine&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like it&#x27;s gonna be used Bella fast</li>
            <li> Stuff doesnt get flakey if touched, very waxing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply much</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy but it holds like much greasier maximum strength hair gels.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to hold really well</li>
            <li> tried to use Gatsby for my attempt at heat-free straight hair, using rollers, straightening serum, and a night-time wrap.</li>
            <li> give this a  four-star rating because I know that it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault that it hasn&#x27;t taken as much effect as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I read on the Gatsby FAQ that it solidifies gradually with air exposure, and that the properties within this product can separate with too much heat and no longer usable.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, no doubt about it, and I really love the smell of gatsby (perhaps even addicted), but its really not for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have about 1 1/2 to 2 inches or so of light Asian hair that I form into a fauxhawk.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and will continue to use this product exclusively!</li>
            <li> , even after intense workouts&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Every time I would try to rinse the product out of my hair each night, it would still feel very well</li>
            <li> but you need hairspray to hold it up if you&#x27;re planning to go out the whole day.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Not only you will find some useful tips, but also a chuckle and some fun</li>
            <li> Gives you nice volume and last all day and next day too probably.</li>
            <li> nice (green apple)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br</li>
            <li> With all the strong reviews and videos about this stuff, I was expecting really strong hold on my thick medium length hair.</li>
            <li> It did so much better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl with short hair, this product works great for short to medium long hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super frustrating messing with your hair &amp;#34;here and there&amp;#34; and getting that perfect look, check the mirror 10 minutes later and your hair is gone flat.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product with strong hold, that doesn&#x27;t loose effect over the day, and that doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or oily look or build up....</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t look real, and the texture effect you just created won&#x27;t move free by itself (think windy-day and how each individual hair strand flows naturally)</li>
            <li> same as my comment, i love this product but green wasn&#x27;t for me, i just bought the purplish pink one and see how that goes :) but overall straight up dragon ball z look, and how i love it</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t help that much when I&#x27;m sweating or with humidity when it comes to the hold, but in general it&#x27;s fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get fooled by its runny texture of the product, it works wonder with just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> So, I have African American hair, mostly curly and coily.</li>
            <li> This particular gatsby pot may be watery for some, I like this one in particular because it is Lasts all day even if I play with my hair</li>
            <li> But I personally can&#x27;t get over its flaws and have since moved onto another product that, personally, works better.</li>
            <li> fact, I would say that not only does this stuff last throughout the day, but it looks better as the day wears on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> price on amazon is better than the prices at our local japanese stores in nyc.  </li>
            <li> Provides decent hold for medium-length hair after towel drying post-shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair products for over ten years</li>
            <li> It adds a reasonable, but not excessive, amount of shine.</li>
            <li> (Not too much or your hair won&#x27;t be soft anymore!)</li>
            <li> One application lasts me the entire day (and then some) and it&#x27;s surprising how long your hair will stay the same (if there&#x27;s no wind or anything).</li>
            <li> highly recomend it to anywone with short-medium hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> you are looking for some high quality wax, this is it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend both products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am writing this without having tried the really high end products.</li>
            <li> It works well, adds texture, has a nice smell to it, and has a different quality to it than other hair products.</li>
            <li> can achieve the same sort of styling with Gatsby Air Rise, but get better results with less meticulous setup (right dampness).  </li>
            <li> Does not wash out as easy as some other products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the wax is strong, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;ll fix your hair in place you may wish to find some other wax or get a hair spray.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t gunk up your hair like the other ones and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other things to note, it has a strong green apple scent which I think is a refreshing difference to the cologne-like smells of other hair products.</li>
            <li> The green one is my favorite of all the gatsby product.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I most likely inherited the bald gene from my grandfather passed down via my mom (whose scalp is 85%+ visible,</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty wet, but quickly dries into a natural finish.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be pretty long, so when I went to my stylist to have it cut for the show, she suggested we push the limits of the appropriate length of the era, and just product it down within an inch of its life.  </li>
            <li> This can be a con for some, but if you look at it differently, it allows the product to hold better in humid or wet conditions like during the rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used a different brand wax and as expected it netting okay results.  </li>
            <li> This product is kind of expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I rub the product over my palms sufficiently, so it is not due to too much product in one area.</li>
            <li> no matter how much she dyes her hair), and since my hair is very soft, very thin, and cant defy gravity, its a tremendous disadvantage for me as the years go by and more hair falls off.</li>
            <li> The reason I like their products is that they doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like glue or sticky as pomades, yet able to shape your hair looking natural; it is no wonder it is called \\&quot;moving rubber\\</li>
            <li> My front bangs are long and Sebastian isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> Ive been using so many waxes, gels, hairsprays, excessive time etc,</li>
            <li> My hair (on top, where I style it) will usually be between 1.5 inches to 3 inches.</li>
            <li> This is that very product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than one fingertip&#x27;s worth of this creamy-like stuff is enough for my hair for the entire day.</li>
            <li> After many attempts, I have yet to master the looks I see in the Gatsby video tutorials and various other tutorials.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use less, because if I used less the hold wouldn&#x27;t be good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Gatsby colors (hold types) and liked those too, but this is less sticky than the purple and works for my short (1&amp;#34; to 2&amp;#34;) hair.</li>
            <li> Also, it is pretty sticky, so make sure you use it in the few minutes just barely before your hair gets dry</li>
            <li> Crew Fiber does an okay job of that, but it loses hold over the day, it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, and it clumps a bit in the hair.  </li>
            <li> hair still feels soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to keep my hair up for an entire day.</li>
            <li> but yet still look naturally flowing, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wild and spiky</li>
            <li> Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium</li>
            <li> part of all is that it doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent in it, so it works well for a girl like me.</li>
            <li> Hair looks natural and not goopy.</li>
            <li> I saw a whole bunch of reviews talking about how well it works for Asian men&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Not so much with short cropped hair.</li>
            <li> This wax is also natural looking.</li>
            <li> It holds real well and can easily last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> good and a small amount is really enough to hold long hair&lt;</li>
            <li> Make sure not to use too much; your hair might take on a thick gooey texture, and if not spread out enough will cake up.</li>
            <li> ;  This was perfect for preventing annoying flyways and controlling any frizziness.</li>
            <li> I really like that I don&#x27;t need my hair to be a certain level of damp compared to the American Crew Fiber I was using before, but I find that the hold is not as strong as I would like it (very thick, straight, coarse hair).  </li>
            <li> I have really flat and straight hair</li>
            <li> For a long time, I looked for a hair product that gave my hair enough hold but was light enough to not clump up</li>
            <li> so I really recommend it for those that need something to lay the edges flat and stick through the day!</li>
            <li> My hair is capable of doing many different things, as it is not as kinky and hard to deal with, in comparison to those who have similar hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair keeps it back or even up high.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected from my first Gatsby product.</li>
            <li> After I blow dry it, I put very shiny pomade on because this product has a matte look which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
            <li> wax applies really easily; some hair products are really thick and requires a lot of work to be applied to your hair, but Gatsby isn&#x27;t like that at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember to keep this product in cool places, and to seal it TIGHTLY the moment you&#x27;re done with it!</li>
            <li> Only use a tiny wax to try them out first, and apply from roots to add volume and the hold last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic without causing hard or sticky hair and the green apple smell is super yummy.  </li>
            <li> i used 1 tip of a finger on my long hair and wow !!&lt;</li>
            <li> There are plenty of tutorials online, and some by Gatsby themselves to help you get a general idea of what you can do with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is medium long,  so I only need as much as the tip of my finger.  </li>
            <li> It holds, but is soft enough to shape it around.</li>
            <li> It holds its natural texture, yet formed shape, the entire day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely stronger than gel (while leaving my hair soft and \\&quot;moveable\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> If you have money to spend, you might want to look into those, but as far as the moderately priced products go, this item does the job.</li>
            <li> This green gatsby hair product, and the other color varieties, provides great hold without being overly shiny or hard.  </li>
            <li> After my first tub ran out, I was using other hair products that just did not do the same thing.</li>
            <li> In the shower, you really have to rub it out of your hair and scalp, unlike other hair products I&#x27;ve used which often just melt in the water.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to manipulate in my hands and only a small dime sized amount or less is needed to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair first with a little water, apply cool wet to make your hair look cool and a little wet, then apply gatsby air rise to hold your hair however you want it.</li>
            <li> Check out the description as the different products Gatsby offers have different hold and shine ratings.</li>
            <li> The first time that I opened the container, I immediately smelled the sour apple scent and wanted the put the entire thing in my mouth</li>
            <li> I first bought this when I was having little luck finding hair wax or creme</li>
            <li> It smells great like green apple candies though it can start to smell more...chemical or weird when left unused for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looks totally natural yet it still holds for a long time.</li>
            <li> At first bought this along with the pink one, wondering which one would be better for my hair, but then i realized both are just not good enough to even come close to styling my hair without the heavy use of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Only use this for hanging out or social stuff never any athletic events.</li>
            <li> After I get a small dab, I make sure to furiously rub between my palms to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; the wax and literally make my hair messy by tossing it all over</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than the Crew Fibre I&#x27;ve used for the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next time I need to use less haha.</li>
            <li> (so that it&#x27;s still just a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of tough to wash out...</li>
            <li> Hair has a little bit of a sticky feel to it unless you really rub it in&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Although I still think it&#x27;s not strong enough to keep my hair styled a certain way.</li>
            <li> Has enough to last you long enough from one if used occasionally.</li>
            <li> am definitely going to stick the to Gatsby Moving Rubber Air Rise as long as I keep my hair this length with the same hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I am still on the green one and it really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Smell was decent, like a green apple, if a bit with some chemical scents added into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve let friends use them instead, of all hair types, and they work absolutely well, with that extra gatsby fragrance to kick it up a notch, but no matter if my hair is long (+6in) or short (1-4in) neither the pink or the green gatsby wax products works.</li>
            <li> It might not work if you want your hair spiky, if your hair is too long or very short.</li>
            <li> It falls flat in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I think every male with long hair and an up-do should as well.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold</li>
            <li> When your hair goes flat, you can moisten your fingers or your hair and reshape it for a freshened look.</li>
            <li> I grow out my hair a bit on top, but nothing crazy like these pictures of Japanese men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover what I want to cover so a tub of this size will last you at least a month.</li>
            <li> When your hair is longer, its a bit harder to hold up, especially if its asian hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and hard to work with and after much trial and error with hair products, I decided to go with the trial size Gatsby Air Rise.</li>
            <li> Did not seem any different than other  similar hair products.</li>
            <li> Harvey Spectre from Suits), and long (Johnny Depp) length hair.</li>
            <li> So I use products to make it slightly messy but generally professional, and keep it from sticking up.  </li>
            <li> I on a whim decided to try despite having long hair.</li>
            <li> considering I have long hair, but hairspray is recommended to finish</li>
            <li> long )&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> It stays pliable all day long, so at the end of the day when your locks are pooping out on you, you can just reach in and rework them.  </li>
            <li> Green  --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;</li>
            <li> long to long&lt;br /&gt;Nuance</li>
            <li> long to long&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grunge Matte / Grey ---</li>
            <li> wet / Blue  </li>
            <li> I used to buy the pink one when I was stationed in Korea and when it finally ran out, I was so upset because I use it on my edges and didn&#x27;t know where to find it.</li>
            <li> It greats for long to medium long hair.</li>
            <li> Makes even if my hair feels soft to the touch, its very firm and last all day long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : This is more expensive and has slightly less of a hold.</li>
            <li> It provides a natural textured look without making your hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I do also recommend the black/dark grey container if you are using them for sharp spikes in your hair for only the tips.</li>
            <li> and I would also encourage guys with short or long hair to try Gatsby&#x27;s other hair waxes.</li>
            <li> Probably a bit more expensive than other gels in your regular drugstore, but a little bit lasts a long way.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m a guy with a thick head of fine hair, 6 inches at least in length.</li>
            <li> I personally think the small dab is enough to hold my entire hair the way I want for a while.</li>
            <li> I will try the other products in the future if I ever change things up.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t insta-dry like other products prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hold for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)You would need to blow dry your hair to get the maximum hold.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not strong enough to push back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese with very typical Chinese hair</li>
            <li> --- Wet / Medium long to long&lt;</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Loose Shuffle/Orange --- Loose and disheveled / Medium</li>
            <li> I only use about a half the size of a pea of this stuff a day and the hold lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> short, if you&#x27;re not looking for this product to hold your longer hair down in a windstorm, GO FOR IT.  </li>
            <li> I use this product, instead of using a medium sized glob, I only use a small dab of it from the lid (because there always some on the lid when I open it).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes slight amount of this gel to stylize your hair.</li>
            <li> a 23yr old caucasian and my hair is medium long, thick and brown.</li>
            <li> So I use as little gatsby as possible.</li>
            <li> Definitely smells like green apples but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I used the green one for short</li>
            <li> Not too liquidy, not too rough.</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of it, then the next day when you take a shower, even with the water you&#x27;ll still have trouble running your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li> this the only reason I bought green one</li>
            <li> holding no shining or wet</li>
            <li> Pink give you a bit firmer hold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to activate with my hair texture, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this green one with the purple and blue as a set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality: The product was just as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much into hairstyling</li>
            <li> As i recall, pink and purple were a bit thicker, and closer to clay.  </li>
            <li> I think green was somewhere in the middle, medium hold and medium</li>
            <li> It holds well and doesn&#x27;t flake or have that wet look.</li>
            <li> It gives enough flexibility without looking or feeling like stiff gel.</li>
            <li> After an hour or so, my hair falls back down and has a slightly &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look, although it does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I usually have medium-length hair and when I get my hair cut a little shorter, I like to use Gatsby&#x27;s Wild Shake hair wax.</li>
            <li> i have used more expensive brands which are not nearly as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It only takes about a single penny size amount to stylize and hold my hair for at least 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;2)No smell or greasiness.</li>
            <li> I usually just spike it up/pull it back.</li>
            <li> There are other things in my hair care arsenal, but this is my must-have.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky and greasy like some other wax products I tried.</li>
            <li> green Gatsby is for medium to long hair.  </li>
            <li> I use American Crew Forming Cream past 2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Gatsby Air Rise is a lot lighter than the other Gatsby products that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The way I spread it on is to push all my hair to one side and take the product and rub it in my hand and rub my hair to one side with one of my hands until I get to the other side(then</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though you may achieve the hold required to &amp;#34;texturize&amp;#34; your hair, it is so sticky that it will be glued to your other hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Writing all that, I&#x27;m too lazy to write a proper conclusion.</li>
            <li> to remove than other products.</li>
            <li> As expected for the brand!</li>
            <li> Gatsby does not weigh down my light hair like other products, and it washes out without leaving an unpleasant residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I made a purchase and when I got it this time,  it seems like they sent me a really old one because the product itself is stiff and hardly pliable.</li>
            <li> This product of from Japan and hard to find on American shelves.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty frustrated with gels and waxes and was looking for something similar to \\&quot;hair glue\\&quot; when I found Gatsby \\&quot;Moving</li>
            <li> my hair is longer than 2 inches, this product just doesn&#x27;t have enough holding power for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Hairspray helps but a better base(by base</li>
            <li> Requires less focus to apply it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it in my hair for half a day, and it&#x27;s maintained</li>
            <li> If it is windy in your area, it can get a bit awkward since it holds well enough that your hair won&#x27;t be moving naturally.</li>
            <li> Use less you say?</li>
            <li> I used the Air Rise on my slightly wavy hair a few days into my attempt, the day it arrived (It arrived quickly!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like there was much left behind, and even after adding in some shampoo to break any leftover down, it would remain.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, I shape it into a quiff fauxhawk-ish style if you spread the product correctly it will stay in place for a while with little to no readjustment.</li>
            <li> There is a little bit of a \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feel to my hair after putting on the \\&quot;Moving</li>
            <li> and others I tried had little to no hold.</li>
            <li> I think I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Messy Side-part&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can wear it messy but it will still hold its shape</li>
            <li> My hair was medium/long, and I had been having trouble finding a product that would give the hair a stable shape for the day.</li>
            <li> Made my hair limp and greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is not for those who need an absolutely firm hold, but that&#x27;s no longer in fashion these days anyway.</li>
            <li> The green Gatsby has the strongest green apple smell of all the Gatsby products.</li>
            <li> dont waste this product unless you can afford to waste it.</li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes or so, I&#x27;d say the product is dried and in prime condition.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to style my hair to work.</li>
            <li> drug store products) to this green gatsby.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> Green apple smell and doesn&#x27;t drown you in the odor when you put it on&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like Green Apples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using green gatsby for about 6 years</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, it&#x27;s not shiny, and it smells</li>
            <li> In addition, it is a little hard to get out of your hair however.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little hard to style longer</li>
            <li> You do this by applying hair product on your hands and twisting ends of a few hair strands to make the effect of some &amp;#34;movement&amp;#34;  in your hair, rather than the usual dull coconut head look(Of</li>
            <li> This product also works for people who like to restyle in the middle of the day, or play around with your hair when you&#x27;re bored (without reapplying!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have to do shampoo and rinse then shampoo again to get it all out.</li>
            <li> so I usually combine 2-3 products.</li>

            <li> style),I have THICK hair</li>
            <li> it is seriously strong&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; your hair isn&#x27;t limited to cutting it at the barber, you can also &amp;#34;texturize&amp;#34; your hair with hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to work with let alone hold a style.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t worry, once you apply in on your hair, it is very subtle and not as if your head will smell fruit all</li>
            <li> Only thing I hate about these waxes is that the residue is difficult to remove with one shop washing.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes slightly uncomfortable, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Gatsby hair care products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be skeptical, nothing in America is like this.</li>
            <li> There are online charts to find out which Gatsby product fits your hair style, and there are videos showing you how to achieve the desired look, which will be difficult to duplicate without Gatsby products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - The one flaw I find with this product is that it&#x27;s difficult to get out of your hair, even with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can pass my fingers through my hair and still not have feel any stickiness (it may take 1-2 minutes of blow drying to reach this stage).&lt;br /&gt;3)No artificial looking hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> The wax also smells like an apple like flavor which isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this to get the &amp;#34;anime&amp;#34; hairspiked hairstyle because that looks stupid</li>
            <li> Apple smell (if you hate the smell, you will hate this</li>
            <li> A base: Wax, moose,</li>
            <li> This is what you use to get the effect in parts of your hair the base product can&#x27;t accomplish.</li>
            <li> I shake my head after apply the base to see which parts of my hair needs hold</li>
            <li> When I discovered it in a sea of horrible products, I thought it was gold.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> underrated gatsby. it holds pretty well and works well with fringe hairstyles. you might need to use abit of hairspray. definetely looks more natural than the purple.</li>
            <li> Smells good and tames my hair ^^</li>
            <li> Definitely smells like green apples but this doesn&#x27;t bother me. I find this to have more hold and definition than the Lucido line, which is for females. Seems to have a better hold on my waves throughout the day without much need to touch-up. It gives enough flexibility without looking or feeling like stiff gel. Probably a bit more expensive than other gels in your regular drugstore, but a little bit lasts a long way.</li>
            <li> Grear product, our favorite brand!</li>
            <li> This product is great cause I have really flat and straight hair its amazing what it does to my hair im glad I bought gatsby.</li>
            <li> Nice product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best wax I ever used! Makes even if my hair feels soft to the touch, its very firm and last all day long.&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells a lot like apple, tho it dosent last that long.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend it to anywone with short-medium hair. You have to try it, its so worth it and for the price its a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Gives light hold with a natural finish.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Does wonders for my hair keeps it back or even up high. Does not move much but i can still play with it run my fingers through my hair etc. Lasts all day. Even played basketball no hair in my face</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as described and holds just as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product, instead of using a medium sized glob, I only use a small dab of it from the lid (because there always some on the lid when I open it). I personally think the small dab is enough to hold my entire hair the way I want for a while. After I get a small dab, I make sure to furiously rub between my palms to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; the wax and literally make my hair messy by tossing it all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and looks good. I recommend the brand gatsby to anyone who likes styling their hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair wax out of all brands, i like the green one better than the purple ones.&lt;br /&gt;smells like apple, which is great, pretty good holding power and my favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t give that much shine.&lt;br /&gt;the hair looks nature healthy and textured. especially the price, it&#x27;s great for a product like this! i have used more expensive brands which are not nearly as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Works great, make sure to warm up in your hands before applying or else you&#x27;ll have clumpy hair.</li>
            <li> Non greasy hair gel that keep hair in place. Bouncy and shiny!</li>
            <li> Did not seem any different than other  similar hair products.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandson he said it works very well doesn&#x27;t stiffen really hard but holds and it&#x27;s not like Palmade/Palmade Lite where u can&#x27;t wash it out for a month!</li>
            <li> It brings a nice shine to my hair as well as volume. I can make my hair the way I like it, Draconian with spiky edges. Great for a Visual Kei style!</li>
            <li> I did not like it. It does not work like it&#x27;s supposed to. I think I wasted my money.  I used it twice and never touched it again.  Its making me lose hair faster.</li>
            <li> I used the green one for short (Russel Crowe length), medium (Harvey Spectre from Suits), and long (Johnny Depp) length hair. I usually just spike it up/pull it back. It holds, but is soft enough to shape it around. Highly recommend. Doesn&#x27;t work if you sweat a lot though. But then your sweat would do the trick afterwards. Lol.</li>
            <li> My son loves it and used it every time after swimming practice.</li>
            <li> I love Gatsby products. There are other things in my hair care arsenal, but this is my must-have. I&#x27;ve tried other Gatsby colors (hold types) and liked those too, but this is less sticky than the purple and works for my short (1&amp;#34; to 2&amp;#34;) hair.</li>
            <li> Always loved this green gatsby. Smells good. Not too liquidy, not too rough. It&#x27;s perfect for medium hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Holds even after a swim!  Good spike and feel</li>
            <li> I only use about a half the size of a pea of this stuff a day and the hold lasts a very long time. Make sure not to use too much; your hair might take on a thick gooey texture, and if not spread out enough will cake up. However, this wax gives my thin straight hair much needed volume and shape. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair: Straight and very fine&lt;br /&gt;My hair styles: Messy Side-part&lt;br /&gt;My hair length: Medium - My bangs are about to my eyes and my sides are tapered&lt;br /&gt;Products I am comparing it to: Kiehl&#x27;s Creative Cream Wax, American Crew Fiber, Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Gatsby:&lt;br /&gt;1) Relatively cheaper&lt;br /&gt;2) Apple smell (if you hate the smell, you will hate this product)&lt;br /&gt;3) Great natural looking hold&lt;br /&gt;4) You can wear it messy but it will still hold its shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of Gatsby:&lt;br /&gt;1) Apple Smell - it is seriously strong&lt;br /&gt;2) Hair has a little bit of a sticky feel to it unless you really rub it in&lt;br /&gt;3) Does not wash out as easy as some other products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Competition:&lt;br /&gt;1) Kiehls Creative Cream Wax: This is more expensive and has slightly less of a hold. It isn&#x27;t the best for fine hair due to the lack of hold, but I still like it, because it smells the best out of all the products and gives a completely natural look while washing out super easy. Winner: Gatsby for control and price, but Kiehls if you have thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;2) American Crew Fiber: This has a much stickier residue and for some reason doesn&#x27;t give as nice as a texture unless my hair is blow dried. Winner: Gatsby!&lt;br /&gt;3) Paul Mitchell Tea Trea: This has a similar feel to the Kiehls, but my hair would feel greasy towards the end of the day. Winner: Gatsby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to stick the to Gatsby Moving Rubber Air Rise as long as I keep my hair this length with the same hairstyle. I will try the other products in the future if I ever change things up. 5/5 Star product for my needs.</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome for medium to medium long hair and its even more awesome if you mix it with gatsby cool wet. I wet my hair first with a little water, apply cool wet to make your hair look cool and a little wet, then apply gatsby air rise to hold your hair however you want it. Ive been using so many waxes, gels, hairsprays, excessive time etc, that I was almost gonna cut my hair bold one day because of the frustuation. Now im so happy this formula works for me, and it works so perfect im just amazed. It might not work if you want your hair spiky, if your hair is too long or very short. It will also depend on your type of hair. Im a 23yr old caucasian and my hair is medium long, thick and brown.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. It looks like it&#x27;s gonna be used Bella fast but it&#x27;s not. Mines lasted for about a year and a couple of months. The product a lil hold and has a matte finish if u just don&#x27;t splat it on areas of the hair</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding something that can control my hair and thus does the best job out of anything I have tried. I will definitely be ordering this again. It works best if you take two finger fulls and rub them between your hands and then work it into towel dried hair before you style.</li>
            <li> I use this to spike up my hair yet have my hair be adjustable during the day and this works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t permanently keep my hair stuck in one position, but instead I&#x27;m able to fix my hair through out the day just in case something happens. Also, this stuff smells AMAZINGLY good. Like super sweet apples that I&#x27;d like to eat. Good stuff. Here&#x27;s a photo of me...just cause. ;P</li>
            <li> same as my comment, i love this product but green wasn&#x27;t for me, i just bought the purplish pink one and see how that goes :) but overall straight up dragon ball z look, and how i love it</li>
            <li> I have used Crew Fiber for years.  When I discovered it in a sea of horrible products, I thought it was gold.  Gatsby&#x27;s Air Rise is the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium hair.  More specifically I get my hair cut with scissors but sometimes I&#x27;ll get some of the longest electric clippers on the sides and back.  I like to have my hair around there tidy.  I grow out my hair a bit on top, but nothing crazy like these pictures of Japanese men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair sticks up a lot around the crown because it&#x27;s fairly fine/thin.  So I use products to make it slightly messy but generally professional, and keep it from sticking up.  Crew Fiber does an okay job of that, but it loses hold over the day, it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly, and it clumps a bit in the hair.  To get an ideal styling with Crew Fiber I would have to hair dry my hair but leave it slightly damp.  Otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t work, especially as my hair got longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can achieve the same sort of styling with Gatsby Air Rise, but get better results with less meticulous setup (right dampness).  Specifically this product beats Crew Fiber in the following ways:&lt;br /&gt;1. It holds much better throughout the day.  I can workout, sweat a bit, and it&#x27;s 90% still there.&lt;br /&gt;2. Leaves the hair softer to touch.&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not clump.&lt;br /&gt;4. Requires less focus to apply it.  Just get a dab, spread on hands evenly, and rake.  It won&#x27;t insta-dry like other products prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those with similar hair/style: I also tried Gatsby Spikey Edge.  It has more hold, leaves my hair stickier, and clumps a bit, especially in the bangs.  Seems more appropriate for short hair.</li>
            <li> This product worked as well as I wanted. Plus it has this great fruity scent to it.</li>
            <li> This is gatsby man, the best product out in the market</li>
            <li> With all the strong reviews and videos about this stuff, I was expecting really strong hold on my thick medium length hair. The hold is medium at best though I believe it would probably work better with shorter hair. Aveda Men &#x27;pure-formanceâ„¢&#x27; Grooming Clay is a much better product and washes out easier.</li>
            <li> Oh Japanese products, how you are so amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Gatsby Moving Rubber Air Rise wax, i can shape my hair however i like it. This wax, smells delicious, its got a green apple aroma that smells sooooooooooooooo good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax stays in your hair for a while, so you can reshape your hair 5 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for some high quality wax, this is it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great volume and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching a youtube video about the product. It did not disappoint. My hair was medium/long, and I had been having trouble finding a product that would give the hair a stable shape for the day. This actually held throughout the day. It did so much better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s even better than the Crew Fibre I&#x27;ve used for the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot more like a cream than Fibre is. It also smells strongly of apples. That&#x27;s nice, i guess. Also, it is pretty sticky, so make sure you use it in the few minutes just barely before your hair gets dry (so that it&#x27;s still just a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of tough to wash out...If you use a lot of it, then the next day when you take a shower, even with the water you&#x27;ll still have trouble running your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something like Fiber by American Crew, but it&#x27;s way more easier to apply and gives you more control all day long. I love that it&#x27;s not sticky and has a matte finish. Awesome smell, very stylish packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, because I wanted to replace the teenager style Axe hair product I have been using for a decade. This one works great and smells great too. Makes spiking the hair easy to do, but I don&#x27;t spike it. It basically gives any hair style you want more stiffness.</li>
            <li> First of all, this item smells amazing.  The first time that I opened the container, I immediately smelled the sour apple scent and wanted the put the entire thing in my mouth (don&#x27;t worry guys, your hair won&#x27;t actually smell fruity so no one will be judging you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax applies really easily; some hair products are really thick and requires a lot of work to be applied to your hair, but Gatsby isn&#x27;t like that at all.  It isn&#x27;t very viscous and &#x27;rubs in&#x27; really easily.  Once you put it in your hair, it will keep it&#x27;s hold for a very long time.  I&#x27;ve had it in my hair for half a day, and it&#x27;s maintained it&#x27;s form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Made my hair limp and greasy.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl but was super intrigued by the tutorials put out by Gatsby. I on a whim decided to try despite having long hair. It smells great like green apple candies though it can start to smell more...chemical or weird when left unused for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the product is great for giving volume to my bangs and top layers. Gives my usually flat hair more of a light and airy/beachy surfer look. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky and greasy like some other wax products I tried. The product is very easy to manipulate in my hands and only a small dime sized amount or less is needed to style my hair. Its hold is pretty good considering I have long hair, but hairspray is recommended to finish off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone who wants to get that awesome bedhead/surfer look.</li>
            <li> I thought It would hold my hair enough but it doesn&#x27;t, I have medium hair this the only reason I bought green one, red gatsby has 10/10 rate for holding hair, this one has 7/10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products and this rates in the top... well, handful, definitely.  Goes on easily, it&#x27;s not shiny, and it smells FAB. Love this stuff- and love that it&#x27;s not $20+.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well. I use it every now and then when I go on special occasions. It works all day and stays all day.</li>
            <li> the case is about the size of my palm. Has enough to last you long enough from one if used occasionally. Stuff doesnt get flakey if touched, very waxing. smells like apples :) Good stuff, can&#x27;t get these at any of the Japanese markets in Southern California (that i&#x27;ve checked..)</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for a hair product that would work best for my hair. After all my years of searching this is where I ended up, and will never go on that hunt again. This product smells as good as it works. I do also recommend the black/dark grey container if you are using them for sharp spikes in your hair for only the tips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this to get the &amp;#34;anime&amp;#34; hairspiked hairstyle because that looks stupid and i use this for texture/holding purposes. I&#x27;m impressed that i only used a pea drop of Gatsby and it did it&#x27;s job. Next time I need to use less haha.</li>
            <li> after using it now i can write my review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now i know why all the ppl on youtube using it and recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its awesome hair wax&lt;br /&gt;it looks like a cream at first i thought it will not hold my hair ( my hair now is about 3&amp;#34; long )&lt;br /&gt;but i used 1 tip of a finger on my long hair and wow !!&lt;br /&gt;great holding no shining or wet looking hair&lt;br /&gt;smells good and a small amount is really enough to hold long hair&lt;br /&gt;i really love it and will be buying it from now on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a bit pricey i think but for the quality is well worth it ;)</li>
            <li> Creamy. Easy to use. Recommended for medium-long hairs. I don&#x27;t apply much but I don&#x27;t think the wax is strong, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;ll fix your hair in place you may wish to find some other wax or get a hair spray.</li>
            <li> Best styler I&#x27;ve used for wavy, colored hair.</li>
            <li> love gatsby brand, i&#x27;ve been using this for years</li>
            <li> Not as good as the black one.</li>
            <li> I am a woman, but I have short spiky hair.  I have tried so many different gels, pomades, waxes and cremes but this one definitely outshines them all.  It works fantastic without causing hard or sticky hair and the green apple smell is super yummy.  It stays pliable all day long, so at the end of the day when your locks are pooping out on you, you can just reach in and rework them.  Easy peasy.  I have tried all of the gatsby waxes, and I definitely like the green the best, but it depends on your style.  Pink give you a bit firmer hold, purple is wetter, blue gives you the wet-head look.</li>
            <li> This product of from Japan and hard to find on American shelves.  I first got some when visiting Hong Kong a few years ago, and loved it.  Thankfully it&#x27;s available on Amazon.  I use it daily, along with a leave in conditioner, and it holds my hair great.  My hair is fine but there is a lot of it so most hair products fall flat.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using it for couple months now, and it must be the best hair wax I have used.</li>
            <li> Strong hold yet hair still feels soft. Doesn&#x27;t take much to keep my hair up for an entire day.</li>
            <li> All the girls check me out.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/thin hair. This is the best hair gel I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light. It is non-greasy but it holds like much greasier maximum strength hair gels. Even after 10 hours, my hair still holds well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes slight amount of this gel to stylize your hair. This is not for those who need an absolutely firm hold, but that&#x27;s no longer in fashion these days anyway. If you want your hair to hold really well but yet still look naturally flowing, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)Light. It only takes about a single penny size amount to stylize and hold my hair for at least 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;2)No smell or greasiness. My hair looks totally natural yet it still holds for a long time. I can pass my fingers through my hair and still not have feel any stickiness (it may take 1-2 minutes of blow drying to reach this stage).&lt;br /&gt;3)No artificial looking hold. My hair looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)You would need to blow dry your hair to get the maximum hold.But this is true of most hair gels.&lt;br /&gt;2)Ideal for medium length hair but probably not the best gel for longer hairs.</li>
            <li> So, I have African American hair, mostly curly and coily. My hair is capable of doing many different things, as it is not as kinky and hard to deal with, in comparison to those who have similar hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use Gatsby for my attempt at heat-free straight hair, using rollers, straightening serum, and a night-time wrap. I used the Air Rise on my slightly wavy hair a few days into my attempt, the day it arrived (It arrived quickly!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried, because I knew that a hair product like this would probably not be likely to benefit my hair type, but surprisingly it helped sculpt my hair in ways that i would otherwise need a pin for, it also helps stretch my hair a bit more. It&#x27;s harder to activate with my hair texture, but that&#x27;s to be expected. I hope to experiment more and see how it fares! Perhaps this could actually work nearly as well on my hair with the right products :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed, as well, that the left-over curl from my rollers reacted more to the Gatsby, making them separate and turn into more defined straight waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this a  four-star rating because I know that it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault that it hasn&#x27;t taken as much effect as I had hoped. Using this on hair texture like mine is a leap of faith, considering that this product was not made for African American hair types. I will update if it does more good to my hair in future experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My hair is between a 3B and a 3C.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells wonderful. It makes my eyes slightly uncomfortable, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to keep this product in cool places, and to seal it TIGHTLY the moment you&#x27;re done with it! I read on the Gatsby FAQ that it solidifies gradually with air exposure, and that the properties within this product can separate with too much heat and no longer usable.</li>
            <li> The green Gatsby has the strongest green apple smell of all the Gatsby products. But don&#x27;t worry, once you apply in on your hair, it is very subtle and not as if your head will smell fruit all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the internet for hundreds of tutorials on how to use the product. Not only you will find some useful tips, but also a chuckle and some fun laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green Gatsby is for medium to long hair.  The reason I like their products is that they doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like glue or sticky as pomades, yet able to shape your hair looking natural; it is no wonder it is called \\&quot;moving rubber\\&quot;.  My hair is medium long,  so I only need as much as the tip of my finger.  What also great is that you can reshape your hair anytime in the day by just moisting your hand with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80g is not much; I guess it is a bit expensive considering it is imported from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product / Color  --- Style / Hair length&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Spiky Edge/Red --- Spiky and stirring / Very short to short hair&lt;br /&gt;Wild shake/Purple --- Wild and spiky / short to medium short&lt;br /&gt;Air rise/Green  --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;br /&gt;Loose Shuffle/Orange --- Loose and disheveled / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;Nuance Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grunge Matte / Grey --- Matte / Short to medium short&lt;br /&gt;Cool wet / Blue  --- Wet / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt; Comment  Permalink</li>
            <li> Good product for short hairs. Don&#x27;t keep it in a warm place or else the gel will melt and it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl with short hair, this product works great for short to medium long hair! It adds volume, and texture since I like my hair to be on the messy side (out of bed look), I&#x27;ve tried so many hair styling wax (Garnier Fructis, The Body Shop Beeswax, Short Sexy Hair, and that blue Manipulator, just to name some) and this Gatsby works best for me. The great thing about this product is that this is not a grease or petroleum based wax so it doesn&#x27;t ends up oily or greasy by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product however works best probably on Asian hairstyle, and it works better with very dry hair (not towel dry). Only use a tiny wax to try them out first, and apply from roots to add volume and the hold last throughout the day. However it doesn&#x27;t help that much when I&#x27;m sweating or with humidity when it comes to the hold, but in general it&#x27;s fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get fooled by its runny texture of the product, it works wonder with just a tiny bit. This product also works for people who like to restyle in the middle of the day, or play around with your hair when you&#x27;re bored (without reapplying!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part of all is that it doesn&#x27;t have that &#x27;masculine&#x27; scent in it, so it works well for a girl like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese with very typical Chinese hair and I have sometimes found it hard to style. This product works for my hair when it is shorter. My hair (on top, where I style it) will usually be between 1.5 inches to 3 inches. When it is shorter than 2 inches, I find that this is the ideal product. It adds a reasonable, but not excessive, amount of shine. It has great hold and gives my hair a shape it usually doesn&#x27;t get on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is longer than 2 inches, this product just doesn&#x27;t have enough holding power for my thick hair. I use American Crew Forming Cream past 2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both products.</li>
            <li> This particular gatsby pot may be watery for some, I like this one in particular because it is Lasts all day even if I play with my hair</li>
            <li> First off let me just say that I love the Gatsby products! I used to buy the pink one when I was stationed in Korea and when it finally ran out, I was so upset because I use it on my edges and didn&#x27;t know where to find it. I bought this green one with the purple and blue as a set. I am still on the green one and it really goes a long way.  It does leave my fingers sticky and hard to wash out. I usually have to do shampoo and rinse then shampoo again to get it all out. But it is so worth it. I don&#x27;t use it all over my hair. Just on the edges so I really recommend it for those that need something to lay the edges flat and stick through the day!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, no doubt about it, and I really love the smell of gatsby (perhaps even addicted), but its really not for my hair type. At first bought this along with the pink one, wondering which one would be better for my hair, but then i realized both are just not good enough to even come close to styling my hair without the heavy use of hairspray. First and foremost, I most likely inherited the bald gene from my grandfather passed down via my mom (whose scalp is 85%+ visible, no matter how much she dyes her hair), and since my hair is very soft, very thin, and cant defy gravity, its a tremendous disadvantage for me as the years go by and more hair falls off. I&#x27;ve let friends use them instead, of all hair types, and they work absolutely well, with that extra gatsby fragrance to kick it up a notch, but no matter if my hair is long (+6in) or short (1-4in) neither the pink or the green gatsby wax products works. Hopefully other buyers will be weary as the wax tends to really stick to your hair, however extremely easy to wash off, and even okay for daily or extended use.</li>
            <li> Always love Gatsby products. Smells great, and washes out clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was desperate.  I was playing the lead in a show set in 1935, which involved a TON of physical comedy, including running all over the stage and being yanked around.  My hair used to be pretty long, so when I went to my stylist to have it cut for the show, she suggested we push the limits of the appropriate length of the era, and just product it down within an inch of its life.  Hence, my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While getting acquainted with the product, I was able to put my hair in many amusing and surprisingly gravity-defying positions, but the stresses of the show would inevitably cause my &#x27;do to... don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re not looking for this product to hold your longer hair down in a windstorm, GO FOR IT.  It works VERY well in most situations and it smells like green apples, which is a pleasant plus.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  I really like that I don&#x27;t need my hair to be a certain level of damp compared to the American Crew Fiber I was using before, but I find that the hold is not as strong as I would like it (very thick, straight, coarse hair).  I will try their stronger products to see if they work better for me because it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected from my first Gatsby product. Lasts long, smells great &amp; works. Make sure to get the right product (color Gatsby) for your hair length &amp; needs.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s just because I have really fine hair, but the pink Gatsby works better for me even when my hair is medium length...</li>
            <li> I paid for one but you guys sent me two. I was wondering why? and also I was wondering if you guys charged me for the second one? Anyway other than that i&#x27;m pretty happy with what I bought. The Gatsby Air Rise is a lot lighter than the other Gatsby products that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome...Hair looks natural and not goopy. It moves and swirls like the many snake heads of Medusa. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Gatsby hair care products. I have every colour of Moving Rubber there is and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to check on their website because they have a style guide on how to use each type of their product. It is incredible how good these products are if you use them correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got all of my stylists to use them and they love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> I think another reviewer mentioned this. If it is windy in your area, it can get a bit awkward since it holds well enough that your hair won&#x27;t be moving naturally.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, I shape it into a quiff fauxhawk-ish style if you spread the product correctly it will stay in place for a while with little to no readjustment. The way I spread it on is to push all my hair to one side and take the product and rub it in my hand and rub my hair to one side with one of my hands until I get to the other side(then style),I have THICK hair so I need a little more than most people with regular fine asian hair. By the way this will not last through sweat, I go to the gym a lot and I try to keep my hair out of my face when running, just use a gel or a got2b&#x27;s glue dont waste this product unless you can afford to waste it. Only use this for hanging out or social stuff never any athletic events. Avoid places with dust, your hair becomes magnet to everything in the flying in the air.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m indian, and it works great with my hair lol. I honestly would recommend someone on the borderline of buying this, to buy this. Don&#x27;t be skeptical, nothing in America is like this.</li>
            <li> I have about 1 1/2 to 2 inches or so of light Asian hair that I form into a fauxhawk. For a long time, I looked for a hair product that gave my hair enough hold but was light enough to not clump up and I could be able to run my fingers through my hair. This is that very product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than one fingertip&#x27;s worth of this creamy-like stuff is enough for my hair for the entire day. It goes on pretty wet, but quickly dries into a natural finish. After about 20 minutes or so, I&#x27;d say the product is dried and in prime condition. It has plenty of hold to easily form my sometimes unwilling hair into the style I want. There are no hassles or touching up required for me; I just rub some on my fingertips and run my fingers through my hair multiple times before forming. The hold lasts the ENTIRE day; it doesn&#x27;t fall off, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your fingers. It holds its natural texture, yet formed shape, the entire day. If it gets messed up by the wind, I just run my hand through my hair and it goes back. No sticky residue on my fingers, no clumps in my hair. Highly satisfied, would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things to note, it has a strong green apple scent which I think is a refreshing difference to the cologne-like smells of other hair products. In addition, it is a little hard to get out of your hair however. In the shower, you really have to rub it out of your hair and scalp, unlike other hair products I&#x27;ve used which often just melt in the water. This can be a con for some, but if you look at it differently, it allows the product to hold better in humid or wet conditions like during the rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would order again, would recommend</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product with strong hold, that doesn&#x27;t loose effect over the day, and that doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or oily look or build up....and this is it.  It provides a natural textured look without making your hair sticky or stiff.  It&#x27;s a soft wax in the container, but after you put a little on your palm and rub your hands together, then run your hands through your hair, it provides great all day hold.  Check out the description as the different products Gatsby offers have different hold and shine ratings.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it to keep my side swept bangs together and my boyfriend uses it for volume.</li>
            <li> great for short to med length hair. When your hair is longer, its a bit harder to hold up, especially if its asian hair.</li>
            <li> I first found this hair wax while traveling in Japan. Now it&#x27;s the only hair product that I use. It is easy to apply and to wash out.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. My hair is pretty thick and hard to work with and after much trial and error with hair products, I decided to go with the trial size Gatsby Air Rise. And after using the trial size, I&#x27;ve decided to purchase the full size product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dime-sized amount applied to a full head of thick/medium-length hair does wonders. My hair forms and shapes up nicely in the style that I want it to, and stays that way with a little bit of hair spray. (Not too much or your hair won&#x27;t be soft anymore!) There are plenty of tutorials online, and some by Gatsby themselves to help you get a general idea of what you can do with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will continue to use this product exclusively!</li>
            <li> I was pretty frustrated with gels and waxes and was looking for something similar to \\&quot;hair glue\\&quot; when I found Gatsby \\&quot;Moving Rubber\\&quot; online. I saw a whole bunch of reviews talking about how well it works for Asian men&#x27;s hair so I tried it out and it was great. It&#x27;s not greasy like wax is and it&#x27;s definitely stronger than gel (while leaving my hair soft and \\&quot;moveable\\&quot;). There is a little bit of a \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feel to my hair after putting on the \\&quot;Moving Rubber\\&quot; paste but there&#x27;s no going around that. One application lasts me the entire day (and then some) and it&#x27;s surprising how long your hair will stay the same (if there&#x27;s no wind or anything). Great stuff and I&#x27;ll probably get a more stiffer Gatsby paste, but all the \\&quot;Moving Rubber\\&quot; stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This is another wonderful product for your hair. It feel and smell is similar to the Frutius (idek if I spelt that right) gel one, but it holds better.</li>
            <li> Ordered and got what I wanted, good quality fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have very thick hair so I usually combine 2-3 products. I combine this with blow drying gel, and blow dry my hair, and it gives me great volume. It&#x27;s has a gel hold, but moves like pomade. After I blow dry it, I put very shiny pomade on because this product has a matte look which I&#x27;m not a fan of. But it is very shapeable and smells great. Great product.</li>
            <li> The green one is my favorite of all the gatsby product. It greats for long to medium long hair. Gives you nice volume and last all day and next day too probably.</li>
            <li> Delivery: Item was delivered in a box. It was sealed with the shrinkwrap which you just tear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: The product was just as expected. It has a pleasant light green-apple scent. This may be appealing to both men and women users of this product. The product can be washed off easily in the shower, and some quick soap and water to remove from your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: I have very soft and silky hair, which was cut short (thus the purchase of this product :)) I do have quite a bit of hair. After many attempts, I have yet to master the looks I see in the Gatsby video tutorials and various other tutorials. After an hour or so, my hair falls back down and has a slightly &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look, although it does not feel greasy. I rub the product over my palms sufficiently, so it is not due to too much product in one area. It works well with a bit coarser hair qualities, however. For my hair, when combined with some heating tools (curlers, straighteners), this product performs quite well in helping to keep the hold without the crispy texture of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to style my hair to work. I like the styling effect and the light apple fragrance.</li>
            <li> Used a different brand wax and as expected it netting okay results.  When I tried this stuff out the first time i was wondering how they could call this wax when it looks and feels more like creme.  Anyhow, it goes on great and is truly amazing stuff.  No more gels, waxes, mousses for this guy.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for the best hair product. Now, I&#x27;m a guy with a thick head of fine hair, 6 inches at least in length. I wear my hair back in a side-part.. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with everything but nothing came close(Garnier surfer, bed head, alberto clay, misc. drug store products) to this green gatsby. And even then, I was not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say about this product is it&#x27;s smell. And this is coming from someone who&#x27;s been using this wax for longer than a year I hope you know my review is coming from prolonged experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve left at the bottom advice for people who are like me who are seeking to get the best products for their hair. Back to the review.  I&#x27;m telling you this so you can see why I&#x27;ve rated this product only 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off it&#x27;s sticky. &amp;#34;Texturing&amp;#34; your hair isn&#x27;t limited to cutting it at the barber, you can also &amp;#34;texturize&amp;#34; your hair with hair products. You do this by applying hair product on your hands and twisting ends of a few hair strands to make the effect of some &amp;#34;movement&amp;#34;  in your hair, rather than the usual dull coconut head look(Of course this depends on your hair type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though you may achieve the hold required to &amp;#34;texturize&amp;#34; your hair, it is so sticky that it will be glued to your other hair. It won&#x27;t look real, and the texture effect you just created won&#x27;t move free by itself (think windy-day and how each individual hair strand flows naturally) but when using this product the effect you&#x27;re(I&#x27;m) trying to achieve won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it&#x27;s heavy. The more you use, the heavier and shinier your hair gets. Use enough and you will look like you just dipped your comb under the faucet and ran it through your hair. Use less you say? I can&#x27;t use less, because if I used less the hold wouldn&#x27;t be good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the hold is NOT okay. It falls flat in 5 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it can hold perfectly for those first 5 minutes because I&#x27;m looking for something to hold for the ENTIRE DAY. It&#x27;s super frustrating messing with your hair &amp;#34;here and there&amp;#34; and getting that perfect look, check the mirror 10 minutes later and your hair is gone flat. Hairspray helps but a better base(by base I mean wax) would be the best solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;// The now&lt;br /&gt;To get it out really quick, if you&#x27;re loyal to the gatsby line I suggest you try the pink/red or purple. The best is the pink/red one though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using (3) hair products and I think every male with long hair and an up-do should as well.&lt;br /&gt;1. A base: Wax, moose, whatever. Anything you like that isn&#x27;t very strong and won&#x27;t weigh down hair. For this I use Sebastian craft clay. It&#x27;s not very strong  for some parts of my hair but is perfect for others. For example, it adds volume and texture in the back of my hair but it&#x27;s not strong enough to push back my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;2. A finisher: This can be anything again. This is what you use to get the effect in parts of your hair the base product can&#x27;t accomplish. For instance, I use purple Gatsby. My front bangs are long and Sebastian isn&#x27;t strong enough. So I use as little gatsby as possible. I shake my head after apply the base to see which parts of my hair needs hold then I apply gatsby to that part.&lt;br /&gt;3. Hairspray. I use OSIS+ Freeze spray, 3 hold. Often over-looked but very essentially to taming your mane. This hair spray is totally worth it. Get it to keep your do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing all that, I&#x27;m too lazy to write a proper conclusion. I hope this helps those who have had the same troubles with hair products as myself.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the equivalent to putting cement in your hair. 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing. I have medium length hair that&#x27;s not oily and this product works great in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loves&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting hold, even after intense workouts&lt;br /&gt;- Green apple smell and doesn&#x27;t drown you in the odor when you put it on&lt;br /&gt;- Matte finish&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t need a lot of product to achieve look (at least for me)</li>
            <li> been using this for 10 years. i love it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, no problems here. The gel is smooth but NOT OILY. It can stay in for about 24-30 hours, but i recommend washing it out. Works with medium/long hair for guys. Not so much with short cropped hair. I&#x27;m not much into hairstyling but i bought it out of curiosity. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this pretty quick and I was so happy to get this. It smells great like green apples! it works pretty well, I like it (:</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. After my first tub ran out, I was using other hair products that just did not do the same thing. You will have a new favorite, too, if you order this. This product lasts all day. When your hair goes flat, you can moisten your fingers or your hair and reshape it for a freshened look. Gatsby does not weigh down my light hair like other products, and it washes out without leaving an unpleasant residue. Also, if you are using a straightener to make your hair stand up, it will not leave product on your hair tools like some waxes or products do. If you have light hair that is about shoulder-length, this is a great product for you. There are online charts to find out which Gatsby product fits your hair style, and there are videos showing you how to achieve the desired look, which will be difficult to duplicate without Gatsby products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My packages always come very quickly and I always am satisfied with Gatsby products.</li>
            <li> Good product if you use wax with very light apple aroma. Does the job for short to medium hair. Only thing I hate about these waxes is that the residue is difficult to remove with one shop washing. Takes two or three washes for your hair to feel clean again.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great. What else could you ask for? No hard stuff with gel and not the cheap axe hair wax stuff. This is the way to go.</li>
            <li> One of the best products that I have used. I have used many ones including the popular Axe ones. However, this one is the one that I like the best. It not only gives you your hair a great look, but it is super to apply. It also does not form white dandruff like flakes on your hair. This wax is also natural looking. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy or anything. It holds real well and can easily last throughout the day. This product is kind of expensive, but it is worth it. The wax also smells like an apple like flavor which isn&#x27;t bad at all. I would definitely recommend this product to any guys who style their hair.</li>
            <li> I first bought this when I was having little luck finding hair wax or creme locally - American Crew has too many parabens for my taste and others I tried had little to no hold. Taking the chance and seeing the reviews, I decided to order this Gatsby Air Rise wax. I won&#x27;t comment on the packaging or anything like that, what matters is if the product works. &amp; just as a note, I have curly/wavy hair, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - I damp my hair before putting in any hair styling, so with that in mind, applying this product was easy. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover what I want to cover so a tub of this size will last you at least a month. The hold is also strong and pliable, so on the rare occasion my hair might get a bit messed up, it was easy to get my hair back to how I like it. Smell was decent, like a green apple, if a bit with some chemical scents added into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The one flaw I find with this product is that it&#x27;s difficult to get out of your hair, even with shampoo. As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t use much, maybe a pinky tips worth. Every time I would try to rinse the product out of my hair each night, it would still feel very well like there was much left behind, and even after adding in some shampoo to break any leftover down, it would remain. On top of that, the product feels a bit sticky and dry in your hair which can easily make your hands feel the same if you need to tweak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t for the stickyness and the difficulty in getting it out of your hair, I think this product would work great, as it does everything else right. But I personally can&#x27;t get over its flaws and have since moved onto another product that, personally, works better.</li>
            <li> Good item fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Smells like Green Apples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product if you don&#x27;t want extreme hold. Works better with hair length as seen on the label and shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Allows hair to be restyled after having it on for some time.&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves hair looking mostly natural.&lt;br /&gt;-Only need to use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells nice (green apple)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-A little hard to style longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Harder to remove than other products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t gunk up your hair like the other ones and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong either.  Although I still think it&#x27;s not strong enough to keep my hair styled a certain way.</li>
            <li> Good hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it&#x27;s an add-on item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product ever since I picked it up from 7 11 in Japan.  I did a little research before making my purchase deciding which product would be best for me and my desired hairstyle.  For me having short hair and only parting it to one side this was the perfect fit.  Just start with damp hair, rub in and style, then come through when &amp;#34;dried.&amp;#34;  This was perfect for preventing annoying flyways and controlling any frizziness.</li>
            <li> Very Good product. Smells really good, feels good on the hair.</li>
            <li> I have asian hair, and this is the product I use to style my hair. It provides good volume and smells good.</li>
            <li> This green gatsby hair product, and the other color varieties, provides great hold without being overly shiny or hard.  Whatever the formula is, it works better than the domestic stuff, which I find falls off easily and doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.  For the record, my hair is about 2 inches on top after a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I would say that not only does this stuff last throughout the day, but it looks better as the day wears on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like green the best, and i&#x27;ve tried all the others.  They have small travel size ones, if you want to try it out to decide which on you like.  As i recall, pink and purple were a bit thicker, and closer to clay.  Blue is almost like a gel.  I think green was somewhere in the middle, medium hold and medium shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price on amazon is better than the prices at our local japanese stores in nyc.  What I also found was that if you have a better wax, then you can go longer without getting a haircut, which can cost 15-50 dollars a month.  Using this stuff is more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Provides decent hold for medium-length hair after towel drying post-shower. The product itself has a cream-like consistency, and it is easy to apply. The apple aroma is pleasant and not sickening.  The container design is also attractive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using green gatsby for about 6 years and I love it so much. It holds well and doesn&#x27;t flake or have that wet look. People can&#x27;t tell I have stuff in my hair! I tell people about it and convert them to gatsby believers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I made a purchase and when I got it this time,  it seems like they sent me a really old one because the product itself is stiff and hardly pliable.</li>
            <li> I am writing this without having tried the really high end products. If you have money to spend, you might want to look into those, but as far as the moderately priced products go, this item does the job. I wanted to avoid having that wet gel look that so many junior high kids sport, and have a smoother and more matte look. I also needed my hair to stay up and have plenty of volume without looking like it was drenched in hair products. There might be better products that I&#x27;m unaware about, but for the price this works very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to work with let alone hold a style. And this product does great! I love the fact that you can mix the products and reshape your hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Product came in as hard paste. Not as it use to be where it was more like a cream consistency</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but you need hairspray to hold it up if you&#x27;re planning to go out the whole day.</li>
            <li> This is currently my favorite hair product. It doesn&#x27;t leave white residue in your hair like some gels do and it works very well. You have to rub it into your palm and/or fingers until it turns transparent before you apply it to your hair. I usually have medium-length hair and when I get my hair cut a little shorter, I like to use Gatsby&#x27;s Wild Shake hair wax. I have tried many different hair products for over ten years and I like Gatsby&#x27;s Moving Rubber hair wax the best. It works well, adds texture, has a nice smell to it, and has a different quality to it than other hair products. If you want your hair to stay styled longer, I recommend using Gatsby&#x27;s hairspray or any sprayable wax product after using the hair wax. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has medium-length hair and I would also encourage guys with short or long hair to try Gatsby&#x27;s other hair waxes.</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair and this is just about the only product I can put in to keep it from looking frizzy without losing all the volume. Smells like apples and washes out pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend to style his hair for once. He actually liked it a lot, and adapted well to using it. It has a pleasant, fruity smell which goes away once it dries. It&#x27;s flexible, doesn&#x27;t flake, and gives much-needed volume to his hair. As expected for the brand!</li>
