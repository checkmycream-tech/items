            <li>I bought one bottle and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>It is okay, fragrance and very good .I</li>
            <li>It is a great value and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>stated that I smelt really good.  </li>
            <li>nothing surprising.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a fruity scent (which is good as I am not a fan of overly fruity colognes).  </li>
            <li>Out of the 5 or 6 that I&#x27;ve tried, they all smell really good.</li>

            <li>so happy, I will surely to buy it again.</li>
            <li>Calvin Kline Encounter has a pleasant scent, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the sample that I received in a Macy&#x27;s flyer; I liked the sample better.  </li>
            <li>most of Calvin&#x27;s Klein&#x27;s collogues are good</li>
            <li>This was a nice gift set.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of Calvin Klein from some magazine and liked the woody odor</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>First of all that was the fastest delivery I ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I thought it was kind of strong.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would smell better than it did.</li>
            <li>Given that was just one instance, but I recommend you try this out. :)</li>
            <li>Women love the scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is still serves well to people who love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the product it holds hours</li>
            <li>ok I never buy cologne over the internet</li>
            <li>Great one to get if you want a change very manly.</li>
            <li>- Encounter may slide into the top 10 in my collection...</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not as I aspected</li>
            <li>not over the top starring sly stallone</li>
            <li>Best cologne i have bought in a long time!</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells great, nice big bottle at 3.4oz&lt;br /&gt;Eau</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you have nothing else available.</li>
            <li>If it goes well your natural scent, it smells great to you and others around you.</li>
            <li>Fragrance smells great but only last a couple hours at best.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift from my sister and wow, it smells great.</li>
            <li>, if knocked it would easily shatter into pieces&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not to strong.</li>
            <li>OK guys (or women if buying for that someone special)</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I smell first in another store then I liked</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Its really sporty and amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and its definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has a cheap smell to it after a while.</li>
            <li>It has a warm spiciness thanks to the cardamom and rum notes in it.  </li>
            <li>The cologne was great, and is the same thing as calvinklein.com has.</li>
            <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>It started smelling good and later it smelt even better, and chick</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;ll be able to tell if it&#x27;s right for you.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Quality product and 100% original ... recommended as a seller</li>
            <li>At the current $25 price, it&#x27;s a good cheap cologne to toss around and leave in the trunk or your work desk.</li>
            <li>This was the perfect fit because its not flowery, fruity, or complex.  </li>
            <li>Out of the gates, Encounter has a clean, fresh showered, scent then settles into a amber (woody), smooth, sweet, and unique fragrance unlike any of the CK fragrances I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I put it on and a good amount and 1 hour later no smell at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for daily uses.</li>
            <li>It only smells good for an hour or two and then it disappears</li>
            <li>I guess it is ok as something to wear daily in the office if you just want to smell ok, but nothing that&#x27;s going to get compliments.</li>
            <li>Encounter is definitely worthy to add to your collection.  </li>
            <li>This a a good perfume for everyday use - of course Armani is far better if you can afford the price !</li>
            <li>The smell just doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for the 3rd time and  I still in love with its smile.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Goes on a little strong, but mellows into a rich, but light, vanilla and rum tones with a touch of pine.</li>
            <li>Not my cup of tea and the smell does not last for more than 3 hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>My fiance loves this cologne just as much as I do!</li>
            <li>there is better stuff out there at same price.</li>
            <li>The bottle is big , it can use many years</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not a fake, but still lasts like one</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m still pretty satisfied with this cologne.</li>
            <li>I put 4 pumps of the stuff on and asked my girlfriend an hour later if she liked the smell of my new cologne</li>
            <li>Another classic fragrance!  </li>
            <li>He loves it thanks for fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Is really all I can say.  </li>
            <li>Will most certainly get another bottle in the future but the 3.4 ounce bottle will certainly last a while!</li>
            <li>but when this arrive the smell is different and goes very fast, very fast like 10 min.</li>
            <li>it is all about the WOW Factor..!!  </li>
            <li>and I needed a new cologne</li>
            <li>Try something new today - you may like it...</li>
            <li>Also, none of my aquaintances have commented on my new and improved scent.</li>
            <li>I also have several mid to high line colognes and they last most of the day,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It looks like an old man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>It is easy on the nose and the bottle design is above average - well</li>
            <li>I disliked the useless deodorant it comes with yet the box it ships in is super good.</li>
            <li>I ordered Encounter and Contradiction at the same time and guess what - they smell absolutely the same.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t project too much, doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>and I can smell it on me which happens very seldom with other colognes</li>
            <li>For those following my reviews, I am big on the WOW Factor and longevity.  </li>
            <li>Then the true test, I put on a little bit to keep it subtle and honestly at first</li>

            <li> Its just simple, subtle, and distinct.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is too suble and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I had to do a lot of investigation to find the right fragrance, and i knew i wanted something subtle and classy/professional.  </li>
            <li> and it last for a long time with me,</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long tho, maybe 4 or 5 hours.</li>
            <li> Very subtle, yet rich.</li>
            <li> how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li> give it five stars for the fact that it might not be right for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not right for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and all other Calvin Klein cologne.</li>
            <li> too bad it only lasts for about 5-10 minutes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bought it from a famous store, so</li>
            <li> Last for long time , heavy smell</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay long as the other said.</li>
            <li> The smell makes all the girls wet.</li>
            <li> Extremely smelly.</li>
            <li> it is a waste please do not get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing but a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon for almost half the price!</li>
            <li> I usually buy Calvin Klein for my husband because it is one of his favotir colognes, but this one was on sale</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I shipped it outside of USA before I could test it.</li>
            <li> I can complaint , the delivery was on time</li>
            <li> Nothing subtle about this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also VERY weak.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this one.&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;ron chubbs</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Though quite expensive here.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>

            <li> I thought it would smell better than it did. I usually buy Calvin Klein for my husband because it is one of his favotir colognes, but this one was on sale so I bought it thinking it was a great deal. The smell just doesn&#x27;t smell right. It&#x27;s not awful, but it isn&#x27;t great either. It&#x27;s ok if you have nothing else available.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cologne BUT it does not last AT ALL. I put it on and a good amount and 1 hour later no smell at all. I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I also have several mid to high line colognes and they last most of the day,&lt;br /&gt;I literally cannot smell this 2 min later.. it is a waste please do not get.</li>
            <li> Extremely smelly. Nothing subtle about this stuff. I&#x27;m gifting it at x-mas. I can not recommend this to anyone. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I got this and tried it before going out on the weekend.  I was fairly impressed with the smell and how long it lasted.  Then the true test, I put on a little bit to keep it subtle and honestly at first I thought it was kind of strong.  It started smelling good and later it smelt even better, and chick I went on a date with that evening stated that I smelt really good.  Given that was just one instance, but I recommend you try this out. :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t project too much, doesn&#x27;t last too long. At the current $25 price, it&#x27;s a good cheap cologne to toss around and leave in the trunk or your work desk. Maybe the gym bag.</li>
            <li> If it goes well your natural scent, it smells great to you and others around you. Will rebuy without hesitation.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell of this and it last for a long time with me,so I would recommend this product ,Calvin Klein makes the best cologne and perfume products</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I love the scent and its definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Last for long time , heavy smell</li>
            <li> Another classic fragrance!  Women love the scent and I always recieved compliments when I wear it.  Be prepared to be asked what are you wearing!</li>
            <li> nothing surprising. very standard. I use it to work out.  will not buy it again.  there is better stuff out there at same price.</li>
            <li> The smell makes all the girls wet.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;On my skin&amp;#34;. It has a cheap smell to it after a while. Not my type. But, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different. You have to wait until it soaks into the skin. Then you&#x27;ll be able to tell if it&#x27;s right for you.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sort of woodsy smell to it. I detect notes of cedar.&lt;br /&gt;I see this scent attracting a hiking, outdoorsy type of woman.&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for the fact that it might not be right for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not right for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is still serves well to people who love it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells are like music. It&#x27;s all subjective.</li>
            <li> Was a Birthday gift for my son. He loves it thanks for fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like it but it doesn&#x27;t stay long as the other said. it&#x27;s good for daily uses.</li>
            <li> Is awesome, it was a gift to my father. He is so happy</li>
            <li> Wow!  Is really all I can say.  This is what a man should smell like.  It isn&#x27;t a fruity scent (which is good as I am not a fan of overly fruity colognes).  It has a warm spiciness thanks to the cardamom and rum notes in it.  It doesn&#x27;t punch you in the nose as some cologne does, but it languishes over the body, begging to be smelled again and again and again....Buy this for the man in your life, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY!! CALVIN KLEIN DOES IT AGAIN AS ALWAYS.. MY WIFE LOVES IT. IT GOES GREAT WITH MY COLLECTION .</li>
            <li> The cologne was great, and is the same thing as calvinklein.com has. Best cologne i have bought in a long time!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested this to me and I needed a new cologne so I figured I would give this a try. Was not disappointed! Constantly getting compliments. Will most certainly get another bottle in the future but the 3.4 ounce bottle will certainly last a while!</li>
            <li> I saw this at a dept store at our mall. Great smell! Though quite expensive here. Found it on Amazon for almost half the price! What a deal!</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product it holds hours and I can smell it on me which happens very seldom with other colognes</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of Calvin Klein from some magazine and liked the woody odor&lt;br /&gt;Purchased on Amazon.Com&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, nice big bottle at 3.4oz&lt;br /&gt;Eau De Toilette lasts longer than Cologne&lt;br /&gt;Taking off 1 star as the bottle seems flimsy, if knocked it would easily shatter into pieces&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise great smell, 4 stars</li>
            <li> I bought one bottle and it was amazing! It may have been the best cologne I have ever worn. But this second bottle just isn&#x27;t the same. I think we have finally grown apart &#x27;Eau De Toilette&#x27;...</li>
            <li> It is okay, fragrance and very good .I so happy, I will surely to buy it again. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I smell first in another store then I liked but when this arrive the smell is different and goes very fast, very fast like 10 min. I tried to return can&#x27;t do it because hazard material bla bla bla bla ok I never buy cologne over the internet</li>
            <li> The bottle is big , it can use many years</li>
            <li> This was literally &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; -- everyone complains about it... Not the product that I remember from macys</li>
            <li> My Hubby has had the same cologne for years. Great one to get if you want a change very manly.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. too bad it only lasts for about 5-10 minutes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bought it from a famous store, so I know it&#x27;s not a fake, but still lasts like one</li>
            <li> I had to do a lot of investigation to find the right fragrance, and i knew i wanted something subtle and classy/professional.  This was the perfect fit because its not flowery, fruity, or complex.  Its just simple, subtle, and distinct.  Its a smell you cant specifically identify, except yourself.  I suggest that you find your fragrance by going to local shop (Sephora?) and try it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> I actually like a lot this perfume it&#x27;s not to strong. But it would stay on me the hole day</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t.  Says it reminders her of a scent her brother used to wear by Axe body spray.... wonderful.....  I will say I haven&#x27;t received any complements .... which tells me I should probably stop wearing it.</li>
            <li> This a a good perfume for everyday use - of course Armani is far better if you can afford the price !</li>
            <li> It smells woodsy, which is great. The only problem is that it is too suble and doesn&#x27;t last very long. It only smells good for an hour or two and then it disappears</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells great but only last a couple hours at best.  IF you want people to smell it keep the bottle with you at all times!</li>
            <li> The only similarity to Calvin Klein is the packaging. Unfortunately I shipped it outside of USA before I could test it. I ordered Encounter and Contradiction at the same time and guess what - they smell absolutely the same. It&#x27;s nothing but a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I hesitated before bying this Eau De Toilette since I fear online perfume shopping. One thing I can tell is that I was amazed when I received it. First of all that was the fastest delivery I ever experienced. Placed the order on March, 2nd and received it on the 4th. The terrific part about it is the smell not to mention the service. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I guess it is ok as something to wear daily in the office if you just want to smell ok, but nothing that&#x27;s going to get compliments. It&#x27;s also VERY weak. I put 4 pumps of the stuff on and asked my girlfriend an hour later if she liked the smell of my new cologne and she couldn&#x27;t smell it until she literally buried her nose in my shirt.</li>
            <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely fantastic. Goes on a little strong, but mellows into a rich, but light, vanilla and rum tones with a touch of pine. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my sister and wow, it smells great. I got a lot of compliments almost every time I left my house with this cologne on. I definitely recommend this product and all other Calvin Klein cologne. Out of the 5 or 6 that I&#x27;ve tried, they all smell really good.</li>
            <li> Love it !!! I can complaint , the delivery was on time</li>
            <li> OK guys (or women if buying for that someone special) it is all about the WOW Factor..!!  I purchased this about a month ago and finally got around to wearing it today.  Out of the gates, Encounter has a clean, fresh showered, scent then settles into a amber (woody), smooth, sweet, and unique fragrance unlike any of the CK fragrances I have tried.  If it were possible to cross CK&#x27;s Eternity and Euphoria, that may be a close comparison.  For those following my reviews, I am big on the WOW Factor and longevity.  Sweetie (a.k.a. my girlfriend) provides a \\&quot;smell test\\&quot; each day prior to leaving for work - no comment earlier this morning, however, some 10 hours later, she compliments Encounter - and thus adding to the longevity of 10+ hours.  It is easy on the nose and the bottle design is above average - well done CK..!!  My cologne collection has now surpassed 300 bottles (yes, I get that I have issues..!!) - Encounter may slide into the top 10 in my collection... Encounter is definitely worthy to add to your collection.  My final rating is 4.5 stars out of 5.  Try something new today - you may like it...</li>
            <li> Quality product and 100% original ... recommended as a seller</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Very subtle, yet rich.</li>
            <li> Calvin Kline Encounter has a pleasant scent, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the sample that I received in a Macy&#x27;s flyer; I liked the sample better.  And, while some reviewers found that it lasted all day, I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case.  Also, none of my aquaintances have commented on my new and improved scent. Overall, I&#x27;m still pretty satisfied with this cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not as I aspected</li>
            <li> its like a water, fragrance not staying for even mimuets. not recommended anyone for buying this product.</li>
            <li> good smell. I guess if &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; was a smell this would be it? date night/wedding reception things like that. my wife instantly was on me after I applied. doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long tho, maybe 4 or 5 hours. but if you use it for the reasons I gave you it&#x27;ll be fine. not over the top starring sly stallone</li>
            <li> It looks like an old man&#x27;s cologne. Sorry. Don&#x27;t buy this. I bought it and can&#x27;t use it. Can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
