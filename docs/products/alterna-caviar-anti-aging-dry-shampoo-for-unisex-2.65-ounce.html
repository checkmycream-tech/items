            <li>but it was a nice alternative for non-aerosol</li>

            <li>Like the spray better; however.</li>
            <li>and I love the Alterna products</li>
            <li>nice and light.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Alterna...</li>
            <li>and I still love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love many Alterna products, but this is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love all the products of alterna, use them for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my bangs maybe 2/3 times a week between washes to keep the oil under control.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many and I am telling you this is the one I landed on and</li>
            <li>I like the spray better.  </li>
            <li>The powder is okay</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT and if you put too much on you can easily spread it around with your fingers.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo in a powder form like this is the best.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best dry shampoo on the market for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice, fresh, clean scent and is effective.</li>
            <li>This is the very best dry shampoo that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>not heavy or sticky, great fragrance.</li>
            <li>I tried applying it more lightly-</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo out there!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to style after, also.</li>
            <li>makes a huge difference on the health of the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product, works well with brown hair and doesnt leave my hair feeling dried out.</li>
            <li>Does what it says it will do and makes greasy hair shiny and clean looking.</li>
            <li>The Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Dry Shampoo deserves a 5 star rating because it is, in my opinion, a great product that leaves your hair feeling as if you just washed it.</li>
            <li>my hair felt and looked clean.    </li>
            <li>Best (and most likely healthiest) dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite, favorite, favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I like putting something in my hair that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals</li>
            <li>I just make sure I put it on my fingertips and then gently rub into my roots.</li>
            <li>So on mornings after I have used this product, my hair has a lot more volume and it is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>It really helps and makes you feel confident</li>
            <li>It really works AND it doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; like so many of them do.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>This product absorbed excess oil in my hair and gave it a fresher look, allowing me to use it after light workouts and to skip the full shower.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used it, but I found it easy to apply and brush in.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo for 2nd day hair.</li>
            <li>it uses more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>it worth the price.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>I really like the applicator, which makes it easy to apply directly into the top of her hair without spilling much.  </li>
            <li>Since too much washing isn&#x27;t good for hair, using the Alterna Caviar anti-aging dry shampoo makes my hair have that just washed feeling.</li>
            <li>Absorbed excess oil in my hair, didn&#x27;t leave white powder on my scalp, which I value the most.</li>
            <li>fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several dry shampoos, and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s going to last more because you don&#x27;t use that much,otherwise it leaves the hair chalky.</li>
            <li>it looks funny.</li>
            <li>Scent is nice; application not difficult, however, it dispenses a lot at a time, so you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li>Update - I love this product and have ordered it 3 times now, however, this last time</li>
            <li>Then at night, I use this product on both sides at the top, and sometimes above my ears since I touch these areas a lot</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I wanted to get something that would help absorb the oil without requiring her to simply wash her hair more often.  </li>
            <li>This was a big time saver for those days I fit in a quick workout on my lunch break.  </li>
            <li>This is my go-to dry shampoo because it&#x27;s easy to use, has no strong smell, and works great.</li>
            <li>I was using the powder Oscar blandi dry shampoo for years and was looking for something more natural and found this one- great product - you can just use a little and it gives your hair lots of volume-</li>
            <li>Smells great and allows me to cut back washing my hair to every other day.</li>
            <li>I have dark hair and it blends nicely into my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this brand of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three different dry shampoos and didn&#x27;t feel that this was as good for my hair type</li>
            <li>(I have fine, low volume hair).  </li>
            <li>I have tried other dry shampoos, but because Alterna Caviar is such an awesome shampoo, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much..</li>
            <li>Works very well if you apply it to hair the night before.</li>
            <li>Very practical for travel since you can&#x27;t take an aerosol in your bags.</li>
            <li>It really seems to absorb and get rid of access oil.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Most recent order: CLEAN dry shampoo ; review forthcoming.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really has anti-aging components, but it does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work but didn&#x27;t give it much volume.</li>
            <li>so it also lasts much longer than the aerosol cans I have tried.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on real even.</li>
            <li>would NOT purchase this product again though i absolutely love other alerna products.</li>
            <li>It normally smells fantastic, but the product actually stunk this time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoo, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine textured hair, this is the dry shampoo for you.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin hair not so good with this type hair</li>
            <li>I have used A LOT of dry shampoo in my day (I have really fine hair and need a little extra volume boost), and this one is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li>I use dry shampoo all the time, and have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo does dispense quickly and is messy to apply, but that is perfect for those of us with thick and curly hair!</li>
            <li>After the 2nd day, my hair gets pretty oily.  </li>
            <li>I usually use it on day 3, then wash my hair on day 4 :).</li>
            <li>It lasts for what seems like forever, whereas most dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used is the spray bottles which last for barely a month.  </li>
            <li>I previously used Fekkai au Naturel, which is fabulous - provides volume, shine, and lasts all day/night; I will be returning to Fekkai.  </li>
            <li>I like that this one has just a faint smell but is pleasant (Unlike the Oscar Blandi one which smells like fruit loops).</li>
            <li>I use a sparse amount of this product on a soft bristle brush and brush it through my hair.</li>
            <li>I now only have to wash my hair 2-3 times a week, and it is so much easier to style.  </li>
            <li>This would include a brush out every day with curling iron to iron the frizzy parts since my hair is naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li>- one is 9 months old - so this product has allowed me to continue styling my hair and looking put together even with kids.  </li>
            <li>This product has completely changed my mornings and my satisfaction with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Lets just say i have never been an  early bird.</li>
            <li>I put this in and it looked like old person stage makeup.</li>
            <li>From the cheapest to the most expensive-- this one is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and was surprised that despite my dark brown hair it blended in very well and didn&#x27;t look ashy.</li>
            <li>That is why I recommend putting it on your fingers and rub it or dispense a very small amount on your scalp and then adding more if needed.</li>
            <li>previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser advised me to apply a little bit of dry shampoo on clean hair, to give them extra volume and make them stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and with a little rubbing there is no residue of white powder.  </li>
            <li>I thought the applicator would be difficult at first because I had used the spray kinds in the past (klorane was ok but ran out fast and would come out a little too fast then TiGi got clogged right away), but I just shake it in gently</li>
            <li>Works better at absorbing oil and disappearing (no film or funny texture or color left behind) than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>its super messy</li>
            <li>I have used a few different spray dry shampoos and this is better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and it is still not empty.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser began to clog, however, making application even more difficult as it has to be cleared frequently (warning: do not try to remove the cap to get at the product as it goes everywhere).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this dry shampoo for years upon the recommendation of a professional salon stylist.</li>
            <li>it works well, but I have dark hair, and the white powder is very visible.  </li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and if you rub it in enough it does not leave your scalp looking white, especially if you apply more underneath your hair and less on the crown.  </li>
            <li>Hair felt a little weighted, and didn&#x27;t give as much volume as some people had described so my hair didn&#x27;t look much different before and after applying.  </li>

            <li> This was a big time saver for those days I fit in a quick workout on my lunch break.  </li>
            <li> This is my go-to dry shampoo because it&#x27;s easy to use, has no strong smell, and works great.</li>
            <li> I was using the powder Oscar blandi dry shampoo for years and was looking for something more natural and found this one- great product - you can just use a little and it gives your hair lots of volume-</li>
            <li> Smells great and allows me to cut back washing my hair to every other day.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and it blends nicely into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three different dry shampoos and didn&#x27;t feel that this was as good for my hair type</li>
            <li> (I have fine, low volume hair).  </li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos, but because Alterna Caviar is such an awesome shampoo, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much..</li>
            <li> Works very well if you apply it to hair the night before.</li>
            <li> Very practical for travel since you can&#x27;t take an aerosol in your bags.</li>
            <li> It really seems to absorb and get rid of access oil.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Most recent order: CLEAN dry shampoo ; review forthcoming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really has anti-aging components, but it does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work but didn&#x27;t give it much volume.</li>
            <li> so it also lasts much longer than the aerosol cans I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on real even.</li>
            <li> would NOT purchase this product again though i absolutely love other alerna products.</li>
            <li> It normally smells fantastic, but the product actually stunk this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoo, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine textured hair, this is the dry shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin hair not so good with this type hair</li>
            <li> I have used A LOT of dry shampoo in my day (I have really fine hair and need a little extra volume boost), and this one is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo all the time, and have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo does dispense quickly and is messy to apply, but that is perfect for those of us with thick and curly hair!</li>
            <li> After the 2nd day, my hair gets pretty oily.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it on day 3, then wash my hair on day 4 :).</li>
            <li> It lasts for what seems like forever, whereas most dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used is the spray bottles which last for barely a month.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Fekkai au Naturel, which is fabulous - provides volume, shine, and lasts all day/night; I will be returning to Fekkai.  </li>
            <li> I like that this one has just a faint smell but is pleasant (Unlike the Oscar Blandi one which smells like fruit loops).</li>
            <li> I use a sparse amount of this product on a soft bristle brush and brush it through my hair.</li>
            <li> I now only have to wash my hair 2-3 times a week, and it is so much easier to style.  </li>
            <li> This would include a brush out every day with curling iron to iron the frizzy parts since my hair is naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> - one is 9 months old - so this product has allowed me to continue styling my hair and looking put together even with kids.  </li>
            <li> This product has completely changed my mornings and my satisfaction with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Lets just say i have never been an  early bird.</li>
            <li> I put this in and it looked like old person stage makeup.</li>
            <li> From the cheapest to the most expensive-- this one is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and was surprised that despite my dark brown hair it blended in very well and didn&#x27;t look ashy.</li>
            <li> That is why I recommend putting it on your fingers and rub it or dispense a very small amount on your scalp and then adding more if needed.</li>
            <li> previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser advised me to apply a little bit of dry shampoo on clean hair, to give them extra volume and make them stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily and with a little rubbing there is no residue of white powder.  </li>
            <li> I thought the applicator would be difficult at first because I had used the spray kinds in the past (klorane was ok but ran out fast and would come out a little too fast then TiGi got clogged right away), but I just shake it in gently</li>
            <li> Works better at absorbing oil and disappearing (no film or funny texture or color left behind) than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> its super messy</li>
            <li> I have used a few different spray dry shampoos and this is better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and it is still not empty.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser began to clog, however, making application even more difficult as it has to be cleared frequently (warning: do not try to remove the cap to get at the product as it goes everywhere).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dry shampoo for years upon the recommendation of a professional salon stylist.</li>
            <li> it works well, but I have dark hair, and the white powder is very visible.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and if you rub it in enough it does not leave your scalp looking white, especially if you apply more underneath your hair and less on the crown.  </li>
            <li> Hair felt a little weighted, and didn&#x27;t give as much volume as some people had described so my hair didn&#x27;t look much different before and after applying.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get the right about without looking chalky.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply a heavy amount directly to the scalp if you have dark hair or you may be able to see the white powder &amp; it maybe hard to remove.</li>
            <li> but apparently my hair isn&#x27;t meant for dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The current bottle smells weird and the 2 previous bottles smelled really nice.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is like no other dry shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It last a long time if you use it correctly and</li>
            <li> If you keep the hole on this applicator very small, it;s better because then you can just shake out a small amount of powder at a time.  </li>
            <li> I will try the spray dry shampoo next time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous Review - This dry shampoo has totally changed my morning routine.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos including the aerosol version</li>
            <li> When I ran out the first time I purchased a few other cheaper dry shampoos and none of them compared to this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair white like some other dry shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-aerosol dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I found this dry shampoo on here and purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every dry shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> Gives subtle volume and feels gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be aware that white residue can be left behind, but it goes away with a little rubbing.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and have not had any problems with the white residue showing through.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and don&#x27;t have problems with white residue.</li>
            <li> does not feel lightweight like i expected a dry shampoo to</li>
            <li> overall performance did improve slightly.  </li>
            <li> After using, I can run my hands through my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that dry feeling that other dry shampoos leave on your hair, scalp or hands.</li>
            <li> It cuts the times I have to (wet) wash and style my hair each week.</li>
            <li> No real scent or anything.</li>
            <li> I have been the type of person who always washes her hair everyday however as i have went to a different shift i have to get up @ 4:45am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this powder 3 tries.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, thin, wavy hair and for years I would wash my hair every day and have to completely style it every morning.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 15 year old daughter who hates to wash her thick hair.  </li>
            <li> a dark blonde, but tested that product on my boyfriend&#x27;s black hair</li>
            <li> They certainly never tried it themselves.  </li>
            <li> I just wet my long bangs and a little of the rest of it</li>
            <li> After using a brushout hairspray and other hair shaping products, my hair feels as if it needs to be washed every other day.</li>
            <li> and now I prefer it over the other kinds.  </li>
            <li> Just took away the greasy look but by the end of the day it looked worse than normal</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll continue to order this product after this last bottle.</li>
            <li> ; A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!!  </li>
            <li> I have thin, blonde hair and prefer to only wash it every 3 days or so.  </li>
            <li> (it takes forever to wash and to dry because it is so thick and long).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I would ever give a dry shampoo five stars, but this is close.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair and this still work well.</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted a year and a half</li>
            <li> I never really understood the &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; properties, I&#x27;m not really sure what those are.</li>
            <li> Now I just wash my hair (usually at night) and wet it in the morning and do the brush out.  </li>
            <li> and they tend to get dirty there first.  </li>
            <li> No change in my dark hair color and my hair is refreshed!</li>
            <li> am not sure about the other reviewers complaining about a &amp;#34;fish&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> And just a little will do.</li>
            <li> &amp; i just put a little in my hands, rub together, then apply to my hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Performance - in between shampoos it does well to begin with, however, after a few hours the product has lost effectiveness and hair is again limp, turning oily.  </li>
            <li> Revitalizes limp hair and allows  one not having to shampoo every day thereby keeping your hair from dryness and brittleness.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure how it would look if you had dark hair?</li>
            <li> One tip I found to work is to blow dry your roots on cold to get the extra powder off your scalp.</li>
            <li> However, the white powder sometimes stuck to my scalp and was often difficult to work into my hair.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using their shampoo for the past 5 years)</li>
            <li> Apply small amount at the roots, then rub in with fingers.  </li>
            <li> I always use a small hand towel afterward to rub the remainder of the powder into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying to get he powder out without getting too much</li>
            <li> Anti aging dry shampoo was disappointing, leaves a dull appearance to hair, doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> but it smells weird and shows up in your hair if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> This last time, the product had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Spray-on formulas tend to clog at the nozzle and are tough to travel with.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and it doesn&#x27;t get terribly oily, just limp.</li>
            <li> i am giving this product only two stars because i was very unhappy with the way the product comes out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> or if I just got a bad bottle this time.  </li>
            <li> Plus i think inhaling any of this stuff would be really bad for my lungs!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> You can see the white in your hair... Don&#x27;t use too much..</li>
            <li> This product absorbed excess oil in my hair and gave it a fresher look, allowing me to use it after light workouts and to skip the full shower.  This was a big time saver for those days I fit in a quick workout on my lunch break.  However, the white powder sometimes stuck to my scalp and was often difficult to work into my hair.  When I use this product, I am always a bit worried I will have a visible patch of white powder on my scalp that I cannot see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo out there!!! You do have to be aware that white residue can be left behind, but it goes away with a little rubbing. Love this product!</li>
            <li> i am giving this product only two stars because i was very unhappy with the way the product comes out of the bottle! its super messy and i just DONT like it. it gets ALL over your clothes and sink. Plus i think inhaling any of this stuff would be really bad for my lungs! would NOT purchase this product again though i absolutely love other alerna products. (I&#x27;ve been using their shampoo for the past 5 years) i hope one day they find a better solution to applying this product!</li>
            <li> I was using the powder Oscar blandi dry shampoo for years and was looking for something more natural and found this one- great product - you can just use a little and it gives your hair lots of volume- I can go 2-3 days without washing and blow drying- makes a huge difference on the health of the ends of my hair.  One tip I found to work is to blow dry your roots on cold to get the extra powder off your scalp.</li>
            <li> Anti aging dry shampoo was disappointing, leaves a dull appearance to hair, doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three different dry shampoos and didn&#x27;t feel that this was as good for my hair type (I have fine, low volume hair).  Hair felt a little weighted, and didn&#x27;t give as much volume as some people had described so my hair didn&#x27;t look much different before and after applying.  May do better for others, maybe with thicker hair.  I like to have both the cleaner feeling and increased manageability with some increased volume, so didn&#x27;t fill the bill for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever tried, and I have tried many! Works very well if you apply it to hair the night before. For best results use a large powder brush to apply to hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and all Alterna products. Like the spray better; however. Does what it says it will do and makes greasy hair shiny and clean looking. Easy to style after, also.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It&#x27;s a little annoying to get he powder out without getting too much but it works great in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very practical for travel since you can&#x27;t take an aerosol in your bags. Also it&#x27;s going to last more because you don&#x27;t use that much,otherwise it leaves the hair chalky. That is why I recommend putting it on your fingers and rub it or dispense a very small amount on your scalp and then adding more if needed.Alterna has great products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-aerosol dry shampoo and I love the Alterna products so thought I would  try this.  It didn&#x27;t work out.  It felt clumpy in my hair.  I am going to go back to an aerosol version.</li>
            <li> nice and light. not heavy or sticky, great fragrance. would recommend.</li>
            <li> The Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Dry Shampoo deserves a 5 star rating because it is, in my opinion, a great product that leaves your hair feeling as if you just washed it. After using a brushout hairspray and other hair shaping products, my hair feels as if it needs to be washed every other day. Since too much washing isn&#x27;t good for hair, using the Alterna Caviar anti-aging dry shampoo makes my hair have that just washed feeling. After using, I can run my hands through my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that dry feeling that other dry shampoos leave on your hair, scalp or hands. I have dark hair and have not had any problems with the white residue showing through. I brush this product into my hair and then restyle, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my style holding up until the next washing.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. It cuts the times I have to (wet) wash and style my hair each week. I have very dark hair. I use a sparse amount of this product on a soft bristle brush and brush it through my hair. No change in my dark hair color and my hair is refreshed!</li>
            <li> Whose idea was this?  They certainly never tried it themselves.  Maybe, if it came out with a spray it would work better.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> soon good!  Dry shampoo in a powder form like this is the best.  If I&#x27;ve straightened my curly hair, and use an aerosol version... it looks funny.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have thin, blonde hair and prefer to only wash it every 3 days or so.  After the 2nd day, my hair gets pretty oily.  If you keep the hole on this applicator very small, it;s better because then you can just shake out a small amount of powder at a time.  Apply small amount at the roots, then rub in with fingers.  I always use a small hand towel afterward to rub the remainder of the powder into my scalp.  It really seems to absorb and get rid of access oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this through the ulta store after having a keratin treatment done.  It saved me from having greasy yucky feeling hair on days three and four of no washing of the keratin treatment.  In fact on day 4 I probably could have gone another day, but I am use to washing my hair daily. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons were: if I scratched my scalp I got a white residue on my fingertips, but you could not see it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would have also liked more of a scent.  It smelled very pleasant, but it was very mild.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the other reviewers complaining about a &amp;#34;fish&amp;#34; smell.  I&#x27;m wondering if the product was rancid from another seller.  That is why I chose to go to an actual store before writing my review.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of dry shampoo. Smells great and allows me to cut back washing my hair to every other day.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works perfectly for those, don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair, quick fixes. And just a little will do.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Alterna...but apparently my hair isn&#x27;t meant for dry shampoo.  This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this brand or what but it didn&#x27;t help at all...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dry shampoo for years upon the recommendation of a professional salon stylist. It&#x27;s white, so if you have darker hair it will probably show up. I have lighter hair so it works great for me. No real scent or anything. I never really understood the &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; properties, I&#x27;m not really sure what those are.</li>
            <li> I like putting something in my hair that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals and it smells good and it really works.</li>
            <li> does not feel lightweight like i expected a dry shampoo to but it was a nice alternative for non-aerosol</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  I have blonde hair, and yes of course it is a powder.  Really nice scent and my hair felt and looked clean.    Edit:  I now have brunette/red hair and I still love this product.  a little goes a long way and if you rub it in enough it does not leave your scalp looking white, especially if you apply more underneath your hair and less on the crown.  I move sections of my hair and apply underneath all over my roots, also gives a boost of volume.  I ordered this bottle in middle November and I still have about 2 weeks left-- probably run out about mid April.  Thats 5 months of weekly use! About to order again.</li>
            <li> i have blonde hair and it make it white looking.  it is just powder.</li>
            <li> Gummed up my hair. I have thin hair not so good with this type hair</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is okay.  Scent is nice; application not difficult, however, it dispenses a lot at a time, so you have to be careful.  Performance - in between shampoos it does well to begin with, however, after a few hours the product has lost effectiveness and hair is again limp, turning oily.  I previously used Fekkai au Naturel, which is fabulous - provides volume, shine, and lasts all day/night; I will be returning to Fekkai.  UPDATE: With continued use of the product (between shampoos) overall performance did improve slightly.  The dispenser began to clog, however, making application even more difficult as it has to be cleared frequently (warning: do not try to remove the cap to get at the product as it goes everywhere).  I would not recommend Alterna Caviar.  Most recent order: CLEAN dry shampoo ; review forthcoming.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to dry shampoo because it&#x27;s easy to use, has no strong smell, and works great. Spray-on formulas tend to clog at the nozzle and are tough to travel with. This does not need to go in the &amp;#34;liquids&amp;#34; bag, and won&#x27;t explode at altitude! Works great for adding volume, as well. I shake a bit on my hands, then tousle through my hair (concentrating on the scalp) with my fingers. Love many Alterna products, but this is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> it works well, but I have dark hair, and the white powder is very visible.  Even if I take a lot of time trying to get the powder out, it is still there. I will try the spray dry shampoo next time</li>
            <li> Made my hair look flaky, I didn&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is like no other dry shampoo that I have ever used. Leaves hair shiny and smelling good. Revitalizes limp hair and allows  one not having to shampoo every day thereby keeping your hair from dryness and brittleness.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo for 2nd day hair. Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> I have used A LOT of dry shampoo in my day (I have really fine hair and need a little extra volume boost), and this one is by far my favorite!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair white like some other dry shampoos do.  And it smells great too!</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. I use dry shampoo all the time, and have tried many different brands. I like that this one has just a faint smell but is pleasant (Unlike the Oscar Blandi one which smells like fruit loops). I have black hair and this still work well. I just make sure I put it on my fingertips and then gently rub into my roots. I use it so that I dont have to wash my hair every day, and I sometimes use it two days in a row. The product comes out very easily in shampoo and does not build up.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, works well with brown hair and doesnt leave my hair feeling dried out. I love the scent, too!</li>
            <li> Probably the best dry shampoo on the market for my hair.  The smell is pleasant as well.  I don&#x27;t know if it really has anti-aging components, but it does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Update - I love this product and have ordered it 3 times now, however, this last time, something was different about the product.  The current bottle smells weird and the 2 previous bottles smelled really nice.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or if I just got a bad bottle this time.  Anyone else with same problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review - This dry shampoo has totally changed my morning routine.  I now only have to wash my hair 2-3 times a week, and it is so much easier to style.  I have blonde, thin, wavy hair and for years I would wash my hair every day and have to completely style it every morning.  This would include a brush out every day with curling iron to iron the frizzy parts since my hair is naturally wavy.  Now I just wash my hair (usually at night) and wet it in the morning and do the brush out.  Then at night, I use this product on both sides at the top, and sometimes above my ears since I touch these areas a lot and they tend to get dirty there first.  I thought the applicator would be difficult at first because I had used the spray kinds in the past (klorane was ok but ran out fast and would come out a little too fast then TiGi got clogged right away), but I just shake it in gently and now I prefer it over the other kinds.  This bottle has lasted a year and a half and it is still not empty.  After I use the product, I brush my hair to brush in the product.  My hair is blonde with some gray and I can&#x27;t ever see the white powder but I don&#x27;t know if it works as well on darker hair.  So on mornings after I have used this product, my hair has a lot more volume and it is much smoother.  I just wet my long bangs and a little of the rest of it and then I do a mini brush out - in total taking 5-10 minutes on my hair in the mornings.  I have 3 kids - one is 9 months old - so this product has allowed me to continue styling my hair and looking put together even with kids.  This product has completely changed my mornings and my satisfaction with my hair.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoo, and this is by far my favorite.  It lasts for what seems like forever, whereas most dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used is the spray bottles which last for barely a month.  This definitely does the job for me as well!  I usually use it on day 3, then wash my hair on day 4 :).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this STUFF! I have been the type of person who always washes her hair everyday however as i have went to a different shift i have to get up @ 4:45am. Lets just say i have never been an  early bird. This STUFF has been a life saver!! I have medium brown hair with hi-lights &amp; i just put a little in my hands, rub together, then apply to my hair/scalp. Don&#x27;t apply a heavy amount directly to the scalp if you have dark hair or you may be able to see the white powder &amp; it maybe hard to remove. REMEMBER: &amp;#34;SMALL AMOUNTS ONLY&amp;#34; A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!!  It smells pretty good too. The seller shipped pretty quick too. I will be a repeat customer! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used a few different spray dry shampoos and this is better than anything I have ever used. I have dark brown hair and don&#x27;t have problems with white residue.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the right about without looking chalky. It seemed to work but didn&#x27;t give it much volume. Just took away the greasy look but by the end of the day it looked worse than normal</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, favorite, favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love all the products of alterna, use them for more than 2 years. previously used different expensive brands, but the best Alterna not found!!</li>
            <li> I found this dry shampoo on here and purchased it. I use it mostly on my bangs maybe 2/3 times a week between washes to keep the oil under control. I really like the smell and was surprised that despite my dark brown hair it blended in very well and didn&#x27;t look ashy. I like that it uses more natural ingredients. When I ran out the first time I purchased a few other cheaper dry shampoos and none of them compared to this product. It last a long time if you use it correctly and it worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you have fine textured hair, this is the dry shampoo for you. Plus if you travel you dont have to worry about liquid. Its powder and works like a MIRACLE.  I have tried so many and I am telling you this is the one I landed on and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Works so well and you get a lot of product for a good price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 15 year old daughter who hates to wash her thick hair.  As such, she only washes it twice a week (it takes forever to wash and to dry because it is so thick and long).  As such, by the second day after washing her hair, the scalp appears oily.  I wanted to get something that would help absorb the oil without requiring her to simply wash her hair more often.  I have tried other dry shampoos, but because Alterna Caviar is such an awesome shampoo, I decided to try this.  I really like the applicator, which makes it easy to apply directly into the top of her hair without spilling much.  It absorbs easily and with a little rubbing there is no residue of white powder.  I am not sure I would ever give a dry shampoo five stars, but this is close.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos including the aerosol version and this is the best. It smells GREAT and if you put too much on you can easily spread it around with your fingers. I had my last bottle for over a year so it also lasts much longer than the aerosol cans I have tried. I have blonde hair so it works well for me (it is white) but I am not sure how it would look if you had dark hair?</li>
            <li> Works really well. Absorbed excess oil in my hair, didn&#x27;t leave white powder on my scalp, which I value the most. My hair looks fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several dry shampoos, and this is the best so far. My hairdresser advised me to apply a little bit of dry shampoo on clean hair, to give them extra volume and make them stay fresh longer. It really helps and makes you feel confident all the day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a dark blonde, but tested that product on my boyfriend&#x27;s black hair and I didn&#x27;t see any white powder too!</li>
            <li> I like the spray better.  The powder is okay but it smells weird and shows up in your hair if you have dark hair. It doesn&#x27;t go on real even.</li>
            <li> great stuff! smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo does dispense quickly and is messy to apply, but that is perfect for those of us with thick and curly hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this powder 3 tries. I either had to take a shower to wash it out or hope no one looked too closely at my greasy, gray hair. I wash my hair every other day and it doesn&#x27;t get terribly oily, just limp. I put this in and it looked like old person stage makeup. I tried applying it more lightly- didn&#x27;t make a difference. And it didn&#x27;t do anything for volume/oil absorption, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every dry shampoo on the market. From the cheapest to the most expensive-- this one is worth every penny. Works better at absorbing oil and disappearing (no film or funny texture or color left behind) than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. Gives subtle volume and feels gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> Best (and most likely healthiest) dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t even admit the amt of days I would go without shampooing and using this instead. I get compliments daily on my hair so why stop now!!</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo.  I have dark hair and it blends nicely into my hair.  It also has a nice, fresh, clean scent and is effective.</li>
            <li> This is the very best dry shampoo that I have ever used.  It perfectly works to get me through the day without looking oily.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used it, but I found it easy to apply and brush in.  I use straightening balm or cr&amp;egrave;me and sometimes it makes my hair look sort of oily.  This shampoo is really handy for those times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product numerous times. This last time, the product had a bad smell. It normally smells fantastic, but the product actually stunk this time. Not sure I&#x27;ll continue to order this product after this last bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a product Ihave been using for years.  I tried a lot of them before stumbling on to this one and I have never changed since!  It really works AND it doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; like so many of them do.  It also does not change the COLOR of my hair!  I love this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> This works well, although its by no means a solution for regular hair washing.  But it adds body to my hair if it needs a refresher.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Worked great!</li>
