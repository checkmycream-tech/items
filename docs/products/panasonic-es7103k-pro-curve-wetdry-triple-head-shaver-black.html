            <li>This is a great electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>The result wasn&#x27;t that great aether..</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s great and all, but it displays it in intervals of 20, so it goes 0%...</li>
            <li>got it for $49, which is a really great price considering the fact that&lt;</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on the Panasonic ES7103K and noting the great price, I decided to take a chance and buy one.</li>
            <li>feels great on hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Worked great until the battery died after a couple years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver</li>
            <li>Panasonic makes great stuff.</li>
            <li>this razor is very nice.</li>
            <li>You gonna Love Panasonic Shavers dedication to keeping you looking Great!</li>
            <li>The good news is that it gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>At that point, I decided that the best option would be to go for a less-close, more forgiving electric shaver.</li>
            <li>There are no cleaning tools used when cleaning the razor, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>There are no cleaning tools used when cleaning the razor, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>The best feature is that all 3 are still working just fine..</li>
            <li>The trimmer does a good job, but it could be a bit wider.  </li>
            <li>I rate it superior to any</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver if your looking for a good shaver that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>For $50, this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>As posted before.. recharge good for about 4 to 5 shaves.</li>
            <li>Lets face it, (pun intended) when you look good</li>
            <li>I believe it is a good purchase for under $50</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how good the longevity is once I use it.</li>
            <li>The razor holds the charge well and does a good job.</li>
            <li>However, the shave with that razor was so good, I looked at getting another Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Good seller by the way, i would recommend the seller and the product too.</li>
            <li>Its that good and priced that well.</li>
            <li>I will say that this is a damn good razor.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like the Norelco did while still offering a good shave.</li>
            <li>I switched from a Norelco after it broke and having read good reviews on the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>For the cost, I found this shaver to be as good as the $140 Panasonic model I bought a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>I knew I had made a good choice.  </li>
            <li>This is a good lookin&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li>Good product for fair price.</li>
            <li>LCD indicator of remaining charge is a good feature.</li>
            <li>Both are good</li>
            <li>Bought it as a back-up for travel; and it does a really good job even on the scalp area.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was good the delivery was as stated.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good.</li>
            <li>The best thing a can say about it is that it&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery life is very good.</li>
            <li>Because I read so many great reviews on Amazon.    </li>
            <li>and now he&#x27;s very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I bid for one on ebay, but didn&#x27;t win and am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It has a pop up trimmer great for between the brows, the sideburns, and (when required) some more \\&quot;private\\&quot; grooming.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely designed and neat that you can use wet/dry, but don&#x27;t expect it to give you a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You gonna Love it!</li>
            <li>I get about 12 shaves on a charge and the charge meter is helpful although I get two or three more shaves after the meter is on zero!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased and grateful to get a razor that works!</li>
            <li>I still believe the Braun&#x27;s are just better!</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure you have no problems holding a can of beer to your face!    </li>
            <li>I purchased it based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation that a foil shaver gives a better shave, and I can honestly say it does!  </li>
            <li>battery life is pretty impressive as well.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed at first sight.</li>
            <li>My husband purchased this and from the first time he used it he could not stop talking about how great it worked!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>every time with this razor, which I find amazing.  </li>
            <li>The pro curve razor from Panasonic is amazing.</li>
            <li>This thing cuts amazingly close for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have had no complaints from him and he liked that is</li>
            <li>Ergonomically, this is a nice razor.</li>
            <li>Now I have, with this shaver a cost effective method of achieving the result I need and want.&lt;br /&gt;jay adler music</li>
            <li>The cord and charge are nice features.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts quite a while too, it looks nice, and works well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because Panasonic products are generally very durable, even if not the best performers.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver for the money</li>
            <li>I bought a refurbed Panasonic 7037 and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I have had a braun before and they are nice but</li>
            <li>It works, just as described by it&#x27;s manufacturer; and, meets my needs for having this kind of a shaver.</li>
            <li>It is a bit bulky but gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li>, I really liked the wet/dry concept, and went looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>But, to me, this shaver is way more than twice or even three times as good.</li>
            <li>But, to me, this shaver is way more than twice or even three times as good.</li>
            <li>...grips all around the razor, an innovative shape that fits well in any sized hand, and a good amount of weight added as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried shaving under water yet but to be able to achieve a good shave in the shower or out, with bar soap, liquid hand soap, shaving gel, cream, or nothing</li>
            <li>The battery indicator is really nice and keeps you from trying to squeeze one</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a perfect electric shaver out there, but this is very close.  </li>
            <li>Fits my hand nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if you could use it while it is plugged, but can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like the razor and it will give a nice shave after some work on the problem areas.  </li>
            <li>I liked the shaver but found that I prefer another brand</li>
            <li>This is a good razor though, and if the newer model were significantly more, I&#x27;d just as soon buy this one again.</li>
            <li>Although it may not be very powerful, but it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li>This is a Keeper, works great, VERY POWERFUL, will be a panasonic electric shaving customer for years to come.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very happy with it, takes it with him all over the planet, and says its smooth cleanly without him feeling as though he&#x27;d been scalped.</li>
            <li>Great clean shave and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>This product proves that you don&#x27;t have to spend more than $50 to get a VERY good electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and cleanup is exceptional.</li>
            <li>by far the best shaver i ever going to get for this price.</li>
            <li>This shaver offers an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like shaving, but Panasonic so far is the best brand I&#x27;ve found for my beard.</li>
            <li>By far one of the best electric shavers out there.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a near perfect shave!  </li>
            <li>it feels good in your hand and it is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This razor is a very fine product in the acceptable $50 range.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s my first Panasonic triple head foil shaver, after so many years using Norelco shavers, and I am pretty impressed, good shaver for that money&lt;</li>
            <li>Always good, but best if done wet.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and works great for my ear and nose hair with the pop up shaver.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with two years.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine!</li>
            <li>It gives a very smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>All I can say is for me (very light and spotty beard)I</li>
            <li>My purchase through  Amazon.com was as good as ever, very quick and free  delivery.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good shaver, it works well, can be used with water for a more comfortable shave, looks good, gets virtually all the hairs, and gets closer than my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>To get a smooth finish, I have to go over spots two or three times!  </li>
            <li>I would really recommend this razor and the price is great also.</li>
            <li>I ordered a man&#x27; s razor thinking it will be better for women&#x27;s legs</li>
            <li>Definately the best I&#x27;ve ever used and the price is low.</li>
            <li>Checked many products online and in stores but felt Panasonic was a better choice.  </li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll find yourself shaving so much more that the wife will start to wonder what&#x27;s going on?</li>
            <li>and it would be a better investment then purchasing the foil and blade replacement.</li>
            <li>, to start it off is my favorite appliance and electronic company.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The top of the lip and the buccal surfaces were smoother than a blade.  </li>
            <li>My neck area does sometimes have patches of stubble but it requires many repeated going overs to ensure they&#x27;re gone.  </li>
            <li>I was also drawn in by many favorable reviews of this product here.    </li>
            <li>Seems most things are made to be disposable now, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve had a Remington F4790 that I think does a better job.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and works great on chin/cheeks/jawbone area!  </li>
            <li>But money is an object that most of us lack, including myself.    </li>
            <li>It gives me a shave that is just as close as a Braun Series 7, but requires sometimes a couple more passes than the Series 7.</li>
            <li>Excellent asset to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy a nice shave</li>
            <li>My favorite shaving implements are my Norelco 7xxxx series (used with Nivea Shave Conditioner or Afta Pre Shave) and this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have collected a Norelco corded 4xxx series, a Headblade, Atra, Mach 3, Sensor, Tracer and Schick Hydro, and of all the shaving items I have the ones I use most</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain and the price is great too.</li>
            <li>The shaver works better with a pre-shave lotion.</li>
            <li>According to my husband it&#x27;s 100 times better than advertised.</li>
            <li>B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]] at Best Buy for $20.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use, easy to clean, happy to have.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from local Best Buy since I was traveling overseas and didn&#x27;t have time to get it shipped from online stores.</li>
            <li>and I realized how close and smooth it shaved!  </li>
            <li>i have used this for a month now and am not wholly pleased.  </li>
            <li>After trying and returning Norelco, I had Brauns, including the top of the line, for many years.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been pleased with this brand of shaver.  </li>
            <li>I use them until they die in 5-7 years, much better life than the Remington&#x27;s I used to have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I gave them a chance...</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the comfort offered by the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Also requires more time to shave as I need to pass over areas miore than before.  </li>
            <li>I am coming from an ancient razor that had become more of a lawnmower than an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Looking at the design was interesting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year and it is the best performer of the many electrics I&#x27;ve used over the last 35 years.  </li>
            <li>Although a lot more money, I just ordered ES8103S, I hope to have better luck with 8103 than this one.</li>
            <li>After reading some comparisons online on Rotary vs. Foil, I decided to give foil a try, since most people said they gave a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Now my regiment for shaving (if I have more than a day&#x27;s growth on my face)</li>
            <li>If your not looking for a top of the line razor, and got 50 bucks to spend get it.</li>
            <li>This is an OK razor for the price.  </li>
            <li>just have to go over areas more than once.  </li>
            <li>Like I said for the price it is an OK razor.</li>
            <li>It has done what I want it to do and more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have  had it for a week now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave &amp; easy to clean, no complaints there.</li>
            <li>some how it won&#x27;t be able to recharge.</li>
            <li>I love the wet/dry design and shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>He told me he has never been able to use shaving gel with an electric shaver before till now :)</li>
            <li>The instructions recommend you change more often then</li>
            <li>My Braun trimmer was much more efficient.</li>
            <li>, i like Norelco a lot better</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does a pretty good job for the money and in comparison to my Remington.  </li>
            <li>It shaves pretty good</li>
            <li>PROS    Shaves pretty good for the price.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to find this baby on sale for $50--so don&#x27;t pay more than that--</li>
            <li>Cleaning is as easy as popping off the top cover and running it under water.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy, and I love the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li>Well made and is very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and it says you can use it in water</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor is great so far.  </li>
            <li>this the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to use it hassle free for almost 2 years</li>
            <li>The replacement blade is pretty cheap (cost wise).  </li>
            <li>Very close shave good battery life.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a diference in the shave but the shaving cream does provide good lubrication.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Power, clean close shave very smooth.</li>
            <li>Had an original Wet/Dry Shaver for more than 15 years...</li>
            <li>A thinner soap, like a rich face soap, seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>This came very quickly</li>
            <li>The head does, however, clean more easily than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>In the end it is a smooth shave after all, so that&#x27;s the most important thing.  </li>
            <li>It also discharges very quickly, have to charge after one to two uses.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done, I pop the top off and clean the blades and foil while still in the shower.  </li>
            <li>three were easily to wash.  </li>
            <li>Easy as that.</li>
            <li>two he wasn&#x27;t sure of what kind of a sahve he was really going to get.  </li>
            <li>Broke very quickly.  </li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin and could not find a nice razor to shave effectively.  </li>
            <li>im not complaining, good speed and a decent cut.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s as strong of recommendation as I ever give.</li>
            <li>This one has been running strong for two years.</li>
            <li>It shaves kind of nice and smooth although it takes longer to shave than my   old shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first submersible I&#x27;ve owned, which is REALLY nice.</li>
            <li>After several months of regular use, I must say that the shaver is about as good as the best I have owned.  </li>
            <li>The first one is a battery-only model - small/no trimmer, but handy for weekend suitcase</li>
            <li>While I prefer to use it Dry, it is also very good with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The feel is excellent, easy to handle and work into tight areas.  </li>
            <li>The charge has hold up fine.  </li>
            <li>and I love the quick charge feature.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s absolutely the most buzz for your buck!</li>
            <li>If you shave daily, it&#x27;s great - close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>In addition, the battery life isn&#x27;t all that great, but for me it isn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the shaver overall, and would buy it again, a bargain.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, etc.</li>
            <li>I decided that I would try to find one that would work and after reading reviews and counting the money I had available, I bought the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>My neck has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean after every shave.</li>
            <li>For my beard, this is an important improvement over cheaper 2-blade models.</li>
            <li>I eventually lost it and ole faithful filled in the gap, again.</li>
            <li>I was always painted into a corner until I purchased the Panasonic shaver depicted and predictably experienced an equal quality shave as compared to the blade.</li>
            <li>My last Braun was a Syncro 7505 and it was great.</li>
            <li>I like to shave in the shower to get a close but comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>With this razor, its so comfortable and leaves no burn.       </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a coarse beard and don&#x27;t get an especially smooth shave, so</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Build materials are on the cheap end, but this device just works.</li>
            <li>but you will need to listen to get a smooth even shave.  </li>
            <li>(haven&#x27;t measured it yet in days), and is comfortable in my hand and on my face.    </li>
            <li>The Panasonic just feels and sounds cheap.</li>
            <li>In addition, it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t looked into replacemnet parts, but I doubt they are cheap...</li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know how people can get cut with these kind of shavers, it is really a mystery...</li>
            <li>It replaced this horribly cheap electric razor I got from Phillips Norelco.</li>
            <li>Before buying this razor, I had a Panasonic wet/dry that worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>when receiving it were 1) cheap plastic housing, 2)</li>
            <li>Overall, a great cordless electric razor for the budget shopper.</li>
            <li>It gives me a smooth, close shave without making my skin break out.  </li>
            <li>He said its great, but I saw him using it only once...</li>
            <li>i got a cheap remington that did the job</li>
            <li>easy to clean</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>When the 20% charge light starts blinking I just plug it in.</li>
            <li>I was using some cheap Hitachi shaver which cost around 30 bucks in (2002) and it lasted me about 7 or 8 years.</li>
            <li>A newer model may be available but I have no experience with it.</li>
            <li>the old 4026 was good for maybe a week, TOPS.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old Norelco three head rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>still all original and shaves fine.  </li>
            <li>On top of all that, the price is right.    </li>
            <li>I love this shaver very much.</li>
            <li>Super close, comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li>One of the best buys I have purchased, in the past.</li>
            <li>The ac adapter is unique to the shaver which means I would have to buy</li>
            <li>After obtaining the information I look around for the best price and as usual Amazon.com had it.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands and this is the first purchase of a Panasonic and it is excellent.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it takes more than a swipe or two to get a very clean shave, but that said, I have been able to get a terrific, close shave (almost indistinguishable from that of a blade shave)</li>
            <li>I find that their products are so immaculately engineered and durable that I still own them from the stone age and after 15 years a TV is brand new in theory.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a clean close shave.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic Razor produces a close, smooth shave and charges quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>if amazing just one charge last for many days ( in my case )...</li>
            <li>At least as importantly, it is still in perfect condition in all respects.    </li>
            <li>it has helped me on my search to be clean and polished.</li>
            <li>The Norelco beard trimmer was great for getting rid of a week&#x27;s worth of facial hair, which I could then follow with a close shave.</li>
            <li>It is fully immersible in water, and washes clean with a rinse under the faucet--no cleaning tools needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A rinse under the faucet keeps it totally clean, inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>A rinse under the faucet keeps it totally clean, inside and out.     </li>
            <li>Compared to my old Norelco rotary shaver, it is amazing and provides a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I did, however, clean the shaver per the instructions after every shave.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot easier to clean, all you do is put some liquid soap on it and rinse it out.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, mostly dry, and it continues to do a great job.</li>
            <li>It operates smoothly, has plenty of power and speed, the % remaining display is helpful, and it charges quickly</li>
            <li>It also takes a bit longer to get a totally clean shave</li>
            <li>Being able to clean it with water is an added bonus and the ability to shave wet or dry and receive the same great results is awesome.  </li>
            <li>This new one is better designed and the digital readout on the battery is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li>The new one is finally large enough, and the tilting head follows the contours of face and neck perfectly- works fine without the mirror and battery capacity is monitored with an LCD panel showing % of charge remaining..</li>
            <li>Spent almost $100 on son&#x27;s, this is a great deal, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>For the first 8 months or so the ES7103K worked perfect, but then it started losing charge rapidly, I would need to recharge it every few days sometimes and</li>
            <li>Makes keeping a straight \\&quot;stash\\&quot; more of a challenge.  </li>
            <li>The shave I get from this is not quite as good as with my last one.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good razor.  </li>
            <li>even if it only lasts a year, I will still consider it a good value.  </li>
            <li>Who would have thought that Panasonic would make such a good razor.en if it only lasts a year, I will still consider it a good value.  </li>
            <li>Who would have thought that Panasonic would make such a good razor.</li>
            <li>In case your barber didn&#x27;t do a good enough job on your haircut</li>
            <li>Even so, it&#x27;s still not a bad deal for the price.    </li>
            <li>Wow, what a pleasant surprise to find that this shaver really works.  </li>
            <li>I using it almost every day for shaving... but only for my neck and ears, for many years I have full beard :)&lt;</li>
            <li>After using so many manual razors, it is refreshing to see a brand of electrics that rethinks typical shavers and goes for something innovative for today&#x27;s man.</li>
            <li>After using so many manual razors, it is refreshing to see a brand of electrics that rethinks typical shavers and goes for something innovative for today&#x27;s man.</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver was a foil shaver from Braun and which did it job fine.  </li>
            <li>Quick to charge.  </li>
            <li>My son loves the razor and the company shipped it out quickly in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect shaver though, then you might want to go with something more expensive.</li>
            <li>is a simple joy for me and provides me with a real option to my hand shaver.  </li>
            <li>You may be able to get them from a Panasonic service centre, but they will likely cost more than the shaver itself.    </li>
            <li>Intially, I use to go couple of weeks before charging, now I am lucky to get two shaves out of it.     </li>
            <li>It performs much better than my older Braun</li>
            <li>My experience is the shaver is now pretty close to giving a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>but wet is better and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave and having a wet option is truly unique.</li>
            <li>I will say this razor goes a long time on a charge and has a good charge indicator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this is not the most powerful Panasonic model out there at 10k rpm, it definitely feels more powerful</li>
            <li>It was ok, but really nothing compared to the higher series Brauns</li>
            <li>a side note the side burn shaver is pretty good for not only trimming your side burns but also for the hair on the side of your head if you get a number 1.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months, I think, and so far I really like it, works a lot better than my last razor and the trimmer is a very nice addition.</li>
            <li>I found this razor to be quiet, easy to clean, comfortable, easy to hold (because of its shape), and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This is the first dedicated electric razor I have purchased, outside of smaller trimmers, and I am very happy with it.   </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>It shaves closer and more quickly than my old Braun Ultraspeed, and I can wash it out.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and simple to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is by far, the best electric shaver you can buy under $200...and it only costs $49.99 on amazon, or $44.99 at Fry&#x27;s Electronics (if you live on the West coast).</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, cuts reasonable close, comfortable to use, easy to clean with the kitchen sink spray head, battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>I still get a few razor bumps but the shaver is great</li>
            <li>Although this has some positives (e.g. its LCD display &amp; pop up trimmer), the main point of an electric shaver is to provide a smooth shave quickly.  </li>
            <li>But I got a nice, close shave only for a couple of months, then the blades wore out.</li>
            <li>This shaver is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It will hold a charge for about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li>like my old, battery-powered, dry-shave Braun travel shaver a lot better than this</li>
            <li>paid $60 for this at Best Buy; you can get it here for approximately $45.</li>
            <li>I paid $60 for this at Best Buy; you can get it here for approximately $45.</li>
            <li>it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco triple head old style shaver that did a better job for 20 plus years before it died.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not this is worth the money, trust me, it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be surprised if i get 6-12 more months out of this one.</li>
            <li>It takes a week or two to get used to it, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>and I decided to give it a try as my face has become more sensitive.</li>
            <li>I get about a weeks worth of shaving from one charge.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a pretty good job of shaving close but does not hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li>I was not willing to fork over more for a razor that may have been a bit better.   </li>
            <li>Most shavers I&#x27;ve had go flat as soon as the TIME TO CHARGE light comes</li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature seems to work well, I&#x27;m able to clean it much easier than my old razor.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s quiet, holds a charge very well, and to clean it, you just put a lil hand soap on it, turn it on, let it lather up, and then rinse!</li>
            <li>While this model takes off my face top skin layer like no other electric razors out there, my skin does feels fresh after I give it some aftershave lotion.  </li>
            <li>perhaps you will find it cuts your beard better than mine, especially if your beard is pretty light.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a good, painless shave in my life (with blades or other electric shavers) - until I used this shaver.    </li>
            <li>I know if I need to charge it right before travelling.</li>
            <li>The guy complaining about the service didn&#x27;t even use it right</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of not returning right away, because for some reason I thought I would get it figured out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is the closet shave for a barebones unit, and that price is right.  </li>
            <li>Just wished it had the plug and play feature.unit, and that price is right.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and, size is just right ...</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s gentle and smooth when applied to the face and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve since bought another (Norelco PT730/41) shaver that works much better for me: I can get a closer shave and more quickly, the battery lasts at least three times longer than the Panasonic, it is noticeably lighter in my hand, it is significantly quieter.</li>
            <li>They have a huge selection of shavers for all budgets that are high quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers over the years including, most recently, a popular consumer magagzine&#x27;s \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; which turned out to be anything but; noisy, horrible shave, missed spots, etc.  </li>
            <li>This shaves nice and smooth, smoother than the old Braun, even with new blades, it balances and feels natural.</li>
            <li>and although no electric shaver will completely match a razor blades shave, it does a fantastic job good enough to step outside looking clean shaven and fresh</li>
            <li>Someone intelligent at Panasonic decided to save a few million dollars and make it the way it has to be in our legal system.    </li>
            <li>Once nice feature is that it has an LED showing how much of the battery is left.  </li>
            <li>After using this shaver for a few weeks, it (magically) made my skin more resilient.  </li>
            <li>, I sent it back and am happy to be back to my blades.</li>
            <li>This is all good news for me as it&#x27;s one less step and</li>
            <li>The shaver&#x27;s power is as strong with a full charge as it is with a low battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is the first electric razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric after 20 years of blades.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cut the hair on my legs and when I tried it in the shower it got extremely hot.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>This was my first Panasonic Shaver and about 2 years later I purchase the ES8103S Arc3, which was a step up andmy most used razor.</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for your first shaver this is the one.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give an electric shaver a go, after so many years between my last attempt.  </li>
            <li>The neck area, because of the many directions of hair growth, I have to use a circular motion for an extra 3-4 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is about the sixth electric shaver I have owned, and the first Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you buy/own a tiny brush for cleaning your razor.</li>
            <li>As this is my first electric I cannot compare it to others.</li>
            <li>This thing shaves so close my skin felt senitive for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaver, electric or blade that i have used that did NOT give me a razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried the higher end one because I don&#x27;t have the money to buy it.  </li>
            <li>This one is even better because it curves to your face, it&#x27;s quiet and gets a close shave!</li>
            <li>No razor burn, even the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; my face with a dab of shower gel first and then shave</li>
            <li>So, hesitant to replace that disaster with another one, I was extra cautious, but what sold me on the Panasonic ES7103K was the outstanding Amazon.com customer reviews.    </li>
            <li>This review is geared more toward those who don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis.     </li>
            <li>If you must try this shaver, send it back immediately if you don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Its plug port is located at the bottom of the razor, and do be aware</li>
            <li>Although the shaver does not work while plugged in, it does work consistently at the peak of its power while on battery.</li>
            <li>using this wet would make it effective for just about anyone.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric shaver in 30 years</li>
            <li>After my first shave with this razor</li>
            <li>Higher end Panasonic shavers go up to 13k rpm.  </li>
            <li>The triple rotating blades on the Spectra, while doesn&#x27;t cut as close, definitely fits my face contour better creating an even cut.  </li>
            <li>its foil/coil (not the current triple heads models) missed some hair under the neck and mustache and need more passes than both the Norelco and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shave wet is a nice feature also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco first and then, two Brauns which were a step up from the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I could reliably get 1 shave even when it first hits \\&quot;0%\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The earlier one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a couple of years, but had a better blade and head.  </li>
            <li>First off, any electric shaver is going to take longer than a razor, that&#x27;s just a fact of life.</li>
            <li>You can shave without even really paying attention or even looking at yourself - no mirror required!</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s customer support is excellent, and they have always replaced the failed unit.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor since I started shaving 40 years ago.</li>
            <li>the result is that the condition of my skin is overall a lot better.</li>
            <li>I also have a Norelco 7310 and it gives several more shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li>After a couple more months the razor could no longer hold enough charge for reliable wireless shaving.</li>
            <li>I liked that you could get this one wet, not that I use it in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t want to worry about getting water on the inside of the device.  </li>
            <li>(before the battery simply wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple shaves).</li>
            <li>and, though it&#x27;s a bit louder, it cuts a whole lot closer!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find the tilt action of the head very useful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 and my beard is very thick, and this shaver is the best experience so far!    </li>
            <li>An easy to read DIGITAL battery gauge is in the handle, not a hard to see glow light.</li>
            <li>Yes, as many other reviewers have confirmed, this shaver does deliver a very close shave.</li>
            <li>In any event, I think that the price I paid for it is right in comparison to the Norelco shavers which  are very pricey now days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as someone with only light facial hair growth I do not find this shaver gives me a good, smooth shave when used dry.</li>
            <li>Easy Clean - wet the shaving head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a triple rotating head Norelco electric razor for years and, while I liked the convenience, it never really shaved very close.</li>
            <li>This one works very well dry (for a quick touch-up) and GREAT wet, with or without soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver does need to be charged more frequently than my old Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll actually start feeling good specially when the feedback form your viewers is positive due to your representation.</li>
            <li>It pops open easily and has very accessible and open heads for cleaning.</li>
            <li>know the lions share of review are positive.</li>
            <li>The trimmer did work but it will take too long to shave legs with a trimmer :)</li>
            <li>This shaves very well, and works exactly as I would expect.</li>
            <li>Strange, but not something you&#x27;d encounter often if you look at the battery meter to make sure it never goes to 0%.</li>
            <li>One other general comment, I&#x27;ve found that the twin-headed flexible blade razors do cut more effectively than the single-headed ones and are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The shave is super close, the noise level is par with my old Braun</li>
            <li>only  * when you clean the shaver, make sure that ONLY the head isrinsed under water.</li>
            <li>Although this Panasonic is a very decent shaver.</li>
            <li>The auto cleaning system is just pure genius --</li>
            <li>I did have to adjust to it as a certain technique</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the large head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Used wet, dry or with a preshave this item gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>The longer hairs that the trimmer missed were then missed by the regular shaver, though shorter hairs came off fine.     </li>
            <li>With my use, the battery stays charged for a large number of shaves, is re-charged very papidly when I have to do so; and, I like the percentage status display of remaining battery power between charges.</li>
            <li>Just quickly run it under cool water and lay it on a towel or on the counter to dry.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is better on this one, but not as wide so doesn&#x27;t cover as much area.  </li>
            <li>Also, unlike others who didn&#x27;t think that the razor did well trimming and shaping the beard, mustache or sideburns, I have found that it works very well on those areas, even without using the \\&quot;trimmer blade.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The battery charge indicator is very reliable.</li>
            <li>I expected more for a razor of this value and won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li>The shaves are really close</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic ES-7103 for about one year now and really like the design and the price.</li>
            <li>The shaver gets really close</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the time consuming part of the process.</li>
            <li>and the trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t see how Panasonic could possibly improve this shaver so much that it would be worth paying 3times more.  </li>
            <li>(it really smooths out the shave).  </li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t shave my neck very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Not to go into too much detail</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s twice as much as the 4026.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s twice as much as the 4026.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close</li>
            <li>The ES7103K just does not have the power that you expect from a modern shaver.  </li>
            <li>Built really well and holds charge for along time.</li>
            <li>I found this to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, I went cheap for my next razor, a Norelco rotary because it had good review, and it just doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable and get as close.  </li>
            <li>I would say that it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>The design is very user-friendly</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try to wet shave with it for the reason that I just don&#x27;t see any benefit out of this at all, in fact I see it as more of  cleaning work after shaving.</li>
            <li>Takes about 15 seconds, 30 if you&#x27;re very thorough.  </li>
            <li>I imagine that, for legal reasons, since this is advertised as a water-proof unit, they can&#x27;t allow the razor to function with a cord plugged into a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants to avoid this and maximize the life of their 7103K, what I would recommend is:  *</li>
            <li>Despite those faults, using this shaver \\&quot;wet\\&quot; is simply fantastic, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver enough.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it&#x27;s really been a boon for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these for my brother as a Christmas gift, and after he told me it gave him a really close shave</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t beleave how fast it charges.</li>
            <li>It charges fast and holds the charge well depemding on your use.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>I also do seem to get a better shave when wet.    </li>
            <li>However, where it really excels is when your face is irritated and you don&#x27;t want to butcher yourself with a razor.</li>
            <li>One thing I will note is that the picture on the package shows a guy cutting as swath through a perfect coat of lather which I found was not that affective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not get as close as a real blade if that is a concern.  </li>
            <li>The foil broke after a year and costs as much as the shaver itself....</li>
            <li>Seemed like a nice shaver, but it quit working a few months after purchase.</li>
            <li>It recharges very quickly and goes a long time before having to recharge it.  </li>
            <li>It charges very quickly and holds the charge for a long time.    </li>
            <li>It shaves clean and trim well, with the LCD screen display you know how much battery left.</li>
            <li>Since this is a wet/dry shaver I use it mostly in the shower, but I suspect the battery life issues were due to</li>
            <li>if you have a coarse beard, I&#x27;m not sure you would be happy with any electric razor.    </li>
            <li>I also clean my razor heads out almost daily to prolong the life of the cutters.    </li>
            <li>Maybe the rest of the world has pansy whiskers or something because this this simply will not shave me clean.</li>
            <li>It was more comfortable, missed less hairs, and was an overall closer, nicer shave.</li>
            <li>so far I am very, very</li>
            <li>I am willing to venture and say that the slower speed and the angle of the blades are the contributing factor in my complete satisfaction with this Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li>The old Norelco was a rotary, and it was also my first shaver.</li>
            <li>I was initially getting 10-12 shaves on a full charge.</li>
            <li>Over all, not bad if you change your electrical shaver every 2 years anyway and keep you beard short over the weekend.</li>
            <li>from the instruction, it said when the batteries drop down to 0% you still can have 2 more shave time.</li>
            <li>I used to shave with a razor and it did take a little more than a week to really get proficient at getting a close shave, but I don&#x27;t miss the nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Only notable change is the nicads are gradually loosing their ability to hold a full charge, usually only last a weeks shaving now.  </li>
            <li>I was ready for a new shaver  and looked for and thought I was going to buy the Braun 370.</li>
            <li>So I went the route of the mach 3 for many years, but was subject to cuts and bleeding.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it in the hope that it would be more durable than the previous two shavers I owned, both Brauns.  </li>
            <li>After many years of using Norelco, Remington, and Braun electric razors, I thought I&#x27;d try Panasonic when my previous razor&#x27;s battery died.  </li>
            <li>is that it does not seem to cut as well as my previous Braun and Remington twin-head razors (which also cut much more efficiently than the Norelco rotaries).  </li>
            <li>I owned an older Panasonic electric shaver with induction charging.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent option at this price point.  </li>
            <li>Quick Charge - 5 minute charge will give you enough juice to do a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He cannot say enough about the tremendous, close shave.</li>
            <li>Also, he finds the digital battery level display to be helpful in making sure he always has enough charge.</li>
            <li>For me there are 3 main criteria to evaluate a shaver: closeness/smoothness, robustness against irregular hair and quality/longevity:   -</li>
            <li>a decent one is around $90.</li>
            <li>I had a much older version</li>
            <li>When I bought this product , it was a decent shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver remained loyal for several (4 maybe?)</li>
            <li>The next is similar to this new one, but smaller head, requiring more attention in the mirror to get a full shave..  </li>
            <li>It is certainly not as close of a shave by far, but it does okay</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend as a late Christmas gift and he love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li>Okay razor, I expected more, have a small Panasonic travel electric razor and when it was new gave me great shaves, but after three years it is starting to dull</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>The Braun series 7 (a $230 shaver) would need a little more than one pass per zone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than my old Remington Microscreen, but doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close.  </li>
            <li>Having to go over a spot more than once wastes time.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much the same razor as my son&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>To minimize that, I had to spend a long time in the shower and use The Shaving Co gel for sensitive skin just to have a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Only minor problem has been getting the area between jaw and neck (getting better at it, tho).  </li>
            <li>Even though the 7103 uses NiMH rechargable batteries, you can&#x27;t use normal batteries for this shaver.</li>
            <li>I would say the noise level is on par with other electrics that I&#x27;ve used (although I&#x27;ve never spent more than $120 on one, so maybe the high dollar ones are quieter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor burn from my previous cheap electric shaver was too much for me to handle.  </li>
            <li>* while leaving it to dry, make sure that the tail/bottom of the shaver is above the head of the shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even planned on purchasing a second unit as a backup since the price is right</li>
            <li>Plus, while ordering right before Christmas, we received the shipment promptly with no extra shipping charge.</li>
            <li>An easy way is to lay the bottom of the shaver on the plastic cover of the head, so it&#x27;s sloping down and any water will drain towards the head of the shaver.    </li>
            <li>Yet, I went back to my Panasonic Travel Shaver for daily use, which is much smaller, less sophisticated that this one, but does a better job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work wet in my opinion which was my original desire, although now I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>I have had my new Panasonic electric razor for 3 weeks now and regret not having purchased it years ago.</li>
            <li>it was about time to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>, so I was up for a new one and went with Panasonic again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order a new \\&quot;screen\\&quot;, soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have no problem buying an all new unit every year if it happens to break.</li>
            <li>so I bought this new one</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a new rechargeable shaver, I was comparing the Braun but</li>
            <li>I expected to get a closer shave without so many strokes over the same areas.  </li>
            <li>I find that I have to keep going over the same areas, especially my neck, to get a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>As far as not being able to use with a cord, thats a dead issur to me.</li>
            <li>Battery does not seem to be replaceable...still going strong, but how long will it last?</li>
            <li>a slightly closer shave  - shower gel seems to me to make for an even better wet shave than shaving cream  - can wash the shaving block with hand soap and water      Cons  - does not operate while plugged in  - no matter how many passes or angles, it misses short whiskers around lips, under nose and on neck  - lack of texturized grip makes the shaver prone to slipping out of your hand when wet shaving (there goes your $50 new shaver)  - battery gauge only displays 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%; better would just be five bars like on a cell phone  - the effective width of the shaving area is quite small:</li>
            <li>In the last twenty years I have bought every electric shaver in sight, always returning to the latest hoo hah version of blade shaving and quirky foam cream that ended up with a closer shave (that method actually severs a layer of skin) and a lot of shekels for replacement blades and said foam cream.</li>
            <li>and it is so far!</li>
            <li>I bought my son the next higher level one about a year ago.</li>
            <li>Overall, the shaver works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the beard trimmer component would serve as a consistent enough shave to leave a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow.     </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my year-old bare bones Norelco shaver that had really lost it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li>My second purchase of a Panasonic shaver (I dropped the first out my window-don&#x27;t ask)  </li>
            <li>the size is not small and it is built evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used only mid range electric razors from Braun which all left stubble and/or cut my face if I applied more pressure to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Well, the day I first used it I was left in complete amazement</li>
            <li>It also cut me near my Adam&#x27;s apple, but I remembered that the same thing happened the first time I tried my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>So in good conscience, I can only give this a one star due to it only lasting 7 months.</li>
            <li>Overall it requires more time than a conventional razor and not quite as close, so far anyway, but it&#x27;s a winner for me.</li>
            <li>My Braun 5614 feels vastly superior in design and has been going strong for 6 years of hard labor on my tough whiskers.</li>
            <li>Even though they recommend that one try the new shaver for at least a month, five days were more than I could handle.  </li>
            <li>Second, the cordless feature is nice for a choice of wet or dry shaves.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, although I noticed that it missed a few hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a good job dry and wet (closer shave wet).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There really is only one con, and it&#x27;s more of a little annoyance than a deficiency.</li>
            <li>- Lifetime of the battery was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>When it shows \\&quot;O\\&quot; charge, I know I can get at least one more shave without recharging.  </li>
            <li>Much to my disappoint upon receiving, I found this charger doesn&#x27;t have induction charging, instead it has a traditional plug with two prongs.  </li>
            <li>I guess this yanking action somehow loosened the water-proofing around the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>Frequently I ended up shaving twice a day and never felt that \\&quot;razor blade smooth\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li>Remember that old joke, it&#x27;s not the razor, it&#x27;s the blades.</li>
            <li>I switched from an old Remington.  </li>
            <li>It seems as though it just takes longer to get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li>Total shave time is really about 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>If money is no object, the Braun Series 7 electric shaver is by far the smoothest and closest shave.    </li>
            <li>Have had 3 Norelco&#x27;s before, including 2 of the ones that have lotion inside of them and this Panasonic is by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric.  </li>
            <li>At a young 59 years old my husband, was just diagnosed with a heart condition that requires him to be on a blood thinning prescription.</li>
            <li>I know this is a personal, subjective call, but to me, this absolutely shaves closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will tell if it is sturdier than my old 4026.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it is sturdier than my old 4026.</li>
            <li>There is no way to get \\&quot;cut\\&quot; since the blade is inside the shaver and it can&#x27;t be exposed, so you may only get these so-called \\&quot;cuts\\&quot; if you let your beard grow too much.</li>
            <li>This experience has completely turned me away from all electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Wow, just got this shaver.</li>
            <li>A month later he told me he absolutely loves this shaver.  </li>
            <li>or so I have been using not thing but Norelco shavers, and as far as I&#x27;m consern there is just  no comparison not with this shaver any ways.</li>
            <li>If used daily, you wouldn&#x27;t even need a straight, or disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised to find that it shaves every bit as close as the blades that I use.  </li>
            <li>reviews claim that this is a relatively loud shaver, but I use it in my bathroom which is about 10 feet away from my 1 year olds room, and she never wakes up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready for it&#x27;s fourth charge today though.  </li>
            <li>Keep as much water off the body where the switch, power cord and electronics are as possible.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Wow, this electric shaver is the closest thing to a Bic razor.  </li>
            <li>The newer Braun models have fixed this feature.</li>
            <li>Also, the LCD screen displays how much energy is left in the battery</li>
            <li>I also did not like how loud this shaver is.</li>
            <li>I have supremely sensitive skin on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>And finally, the digital battery display is not as precise as one may might think as it only works in steps of 20% (i.e. 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%).    </li>
            <li>Wet/dry shave, pretty long battery and one of the closest shaves from and electric.</li>
            <li>and he developed a raw-looking rash as a result of using it twice.</li>
            <li>This model has a plug-in charger, which I suspect is what was responsible for it failing after only three months.</li>
            <li>:  Takes about 6 minutes for a complete shave.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave very close after only one day of hair growth.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The trimmer is the only real disappontment with this shaver.</li>
            <li>All the research I did before I purchased this razor for him was well worth the time spent.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for the first few months.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied so far the the Razor, it shaves well with very little rash, which has been a problem for me with other razors.</li>
            <li>After a full charge, the unit would rapidly and completely discharge after just one and a half shaves.</li>
            <li>It does not feel cheap, and actually seems extremely durable.</li>
            <li>All three does evenly in the bread part of the face with a long trimmer on the first wave and switching back to the main shaver for the softer cut.  </li>
            <li>The first time, I used it without any water; just dry.</li>
            <li>When contemplating whether to purchase a new shaver head or a new electric shaver I opted for the latter based on the reviews I read.      </li>
            <li>To be honest, those areas were impossible to go against the grain because they were so sensitive and that is even with a fresh blade.</li>
            <li>The first, and most typical method, is with a small amount of Lectric Shave splashed on my face in the moments before shaving.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what it would be like for the main razor as I use a regular blade, but for trimming and getting those spots I missed, it works well.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model and the flip up shaver finally broke after 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I changed from manual to electric because I knew that it would be the easiest way for me to get a decent shave every day without dealing with potential razor burn.</li>
            <li>The first thing thing I noticed was that when the LCD said 40% charge left, the shaver just died instantly.</li>
            <li>Braun (older model) definitely has a close shave but</li>
            <li>The older Braun and Panasonic work on a charge only and cannot plug and play.  </li>
            <li>Low end shaver with decent battery life.  </li>
            <li>Still decent for occasional use and the trimmer is convenient.</li>
            <li>&gt;  Came with no accessories, such as brushes or a decent carrying</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve used that gives a really close shave-and it does it in half the time of others!</li>
            <li>I chose this one mostly due to the fact it also has the trimmer and the price was right.</li>
            <li>This razor gives as smooth a shave if not better than disposables and no knicks.</li>
            <li>Not only do I get quick, efficient, close shaves, but the shaver is exceptionally quiet, holds a charge for a long time</li>
            <li>Shaves really well and hold a long charge!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, and the replacement blades are only 40% of the cost of a new razor.    </li>
            <li>Recently, though, a new job required me to change my shaving habits and begin shaving every day.</li>
            <li>I had been thinking about getting a new electric shaver for some time and finally decided to get one.  </li>
            <li>beats half an hour in the shower and thus made this product worth it for me.       </li>
            <li>I really like the digital readout of what percent of battery is left!  </li>
            <li>The digital screen shows how much the battery is left, but is always on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much in the features of the more expensive razors that justifies their price.  </li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars even though I can&#x27;t get my neck hair with it, but it&#x27;s not as thick as the rest of my facial hair, and no other shaver has been able to get it</li>
            <li>No other shaver I owned or hear of goes dead so quickly  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive neck and this shaver does not cause those embarrasing red streaks of irritation.</li>
            <li>There is just no other rating that I can think of.</li>
            <li>There is just no other rating that I can think of.</li>
            <li>This is a major flaw.</li>
            <li>The head looks flat like a Braun, but unlike the lower series Brauns of the same price range, this Panasonic has a head that articulates in every direction and contours myface very well.    </li>
            <li>It takes a long time to get a decent shave; probably 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I might have been lucky previously, but I&#x27;d never had an electric shaver that didn&#x27;t last longer than 7 years.</li>
            <li>Quiet, powerful, close shave, goes much farther on a single charge and there is a small window that tell you how much of a charge you have left.</li>
            <li>Yes, they should be able to put in a disclaimer and tell the user not to use it plugged in where it could drop into water and fry themselves but the courts have decreed that that is not good enough.  </li>
            <li>The only case where I got some irritation (and I have a sensitive skin) were when I shave a \\&quot;4-days\\&quot; growing beard, and it happened here and</li>
            <li>Since I never wet the razor nor the blades, I&#x27;ve never had to replace the foil nor the blades.  </li>
            <li>Now after just over 2 years, I get barely 2 shaves out of the ES7203.</li>
            <li>Looking closely, it was apparent that water had entered this waterproof shaver via where one of the prongs of the power cord enters that compartment.</li>
            <li>that was one of the cheaper models and several years old).  </li>
            <li>Tried the wet shave for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I figure I&#x27;d get a few months worth of usage and off to the garbage.</li>
            <li>At first, the razor was strong and cut well, but now it bogs down and when my beard is thick it can actually stall out the razor with 100% charge.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve bounced around and between different shaving methods - blades vs. electric; multi-blades vs single blade; rotary vs. straight.</li>
            <li>What I really didn&#x27;t like about it is that when the battery is totaly discharged it doesn&#x27;t work until it  is fully charged, other shavers are fully functional as soon as you plug them into the wall whether or not the battery is charged.  </li>
            <li>- If beard grown longer, this model will have a hard time to get you clean.</li>
            <li>Also, the razor can occasionally miss a few stubborn hairs on the neck (no matter how many times you try to mow them down).  </li>
            <li>Seems to have the same blades/foil, just a feature or two different, but it works real well in the shower or dry.</li>
            <li>Gives a gentle shave, quiet, had LCD display of charge status and can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It does shave close but takes twice as long as my old razor.  </li>
            <li>If I use it wet, it works much better -- but I bought it to use dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying aspect of the shaver is its power management.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s the fact that it misses a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is AWFUL, but if you use a straight blade on the bottom of your neck, the bottom being where you can just splash a little water on it and straight blade it, you&#x27;ll end up with a good shave and save a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the shave, but extremely disappointed that the shaver didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It shaves MUCH closer than the two  previous Brauns</li>
            <li>Bought this shaver due to its low price and decent spec&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It really works wet AND dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great electric shaver.  </li>

            <li> , that&#x27;s great and all, but it displays it in intervals of 20, so it goes 0%...</li>
            <li> got it for $49, which is a really great price considering the fact that&lt;</li>
            <li> So for him to be happy with it</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Worked great until the battery died after a couple years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver</li>

            <li> this razor is very nice.</li>
            <li> You gonna Love Panasonic Shavers dedication to keeping you looking Great!</li>
            <li> The good news is that it gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> At that point, I decided that the best option would be to go for a less-close, more forgiving electric shaver.</li>
            <li> There are no cleaning tools used when cleaning the razor, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> There are no cleaning tools used when cleaning the razor, which is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> The best feature is that all 3 are still working just fine..</li>
            <li> The trimmer does a good job, but it could be a bit wider.  </li>
            <li> I rate it superior to any</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver if your looking for a good shaver that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> For $50, this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> As posted before.. recharge good for about 4 to 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, (pun intended) when you look good</li>
            <li> I believe it is a good purchase for under $50</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how good the longevity is once I use it.</li>
            <li> The razor holds the charge well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> However, the shave with that razor was so good, I looked at getting another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Good seller by the way, i would recommend the seller and the product too.</li>
            <li> Its that good and priced that well.</li>
            <li> I will say that this is a damn good razor.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like the Norelco did while still offering a good shave.</li>
            <li> I switched from a Norelco after it broke and having read good reviews on the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> For the cost, I found this shaver to be as good as the $140 Panasonic model I bought a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> I knew I had made a good choice.  </li>
            <li> This is a good lookin&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li> Good product for fair price.</li>
            <li> LCD indicator of remaining charge is a good feature.</li>
            <li> Both are good</li>
            <li> Bought it as a back-up for travel; and it does a really good job even on the scalp area.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was good the delivery was as stated.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good.</li>
            <li> The best thing a can say about it is that it&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> Because I read so many great reviews on Amazon.    </li>
            <li> and now he&#x27;s very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I bid for one on ebay, but didn&#x27;t win and am glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It has a pop up trimmer great for between the brows, the sideburns, and (when required) some more \\&quot;private\\&quot; grooming.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely designed and neat that you can use wet/dry, but don&#x27;t expect it to give you a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You gonna Love it!</li>
            <li> I get about 12 shaves on a charge and the charge meter is helpful although I get two or three more shaves after the meter is on zero!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so pleased and grateful to get a razor that works!</li>
            <li> I still believe the Braun&#x27;s are just better!</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m sure you have no problems holding a can of beer to your face!    </li>
            <li> I purchased it based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation that a foil shaver gives a better shave, and I can honestly say it does!  </li>
            <li> battery life is pretty impressive as well.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed at first sight.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this and from the first time he used it he could not stop talking about how great it worked!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> every time with this razor, which I find amazing.  </li>
            <li> The pro curve razor from Panasonic is amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing cuts amazingly close for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had no complaints from him and he liked that is</li>
            <li> Ergonomically, this is a nice razor.</li>
            <li> Now I have, with this shaver a cost effective method of achieving the result I need and want.&lt;br /&gt;jay adler music</li>
            <li> The cord and charge are nice features.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts quite a while too, it looks nice, and works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because Panasonic products are generally very durable, even if not the best performers.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the money</li>
            <li> I bought a refurbed Panasonic 7037 and really liked it.</li>
            <li> I have had a braun before and they are nice but</li>
            <li> It works, just as described by it&#x27;s manufacturer; and, meets my needs for having this kind of a shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a bit bulky but gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li> , I really liked the wet/dry concept, and went looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> But, to me, this shaver is way more than twice or even three times as good.</li>

            <li> ...grips all around the razor, an innovative shape that fits well in any sized hand, and a good amount of weight added as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried shaving under water yet but to be able to achieve a good shave in the shower or out, with bar soap, liquid hand soap, shaving gel, cream, or nothing</li>
            <li> The battery indicator is really nice and keeps you from trying to squeeze one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a perfect electric shaver out there, but this is very close.  </li>
            <li> Fits my hand nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice weight.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if you could use it while it is plugged, but can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like the razor and it will give a nice shave after some work on the problem areas.  </li>
            <li> I liked the shaver but found that I prefer another brand</li>
            <li> This is a good razor though, and if the newer model were significantly more, I&#x27;d just as soon buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Although it may not be very powerful, but it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li> This is a Keeper, works great, VERY POWERFUL, will be a panasonic electric shaving customer for years to come.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very happy with it, takes it with him all over the planet, and says its smooth cleanly without him feeling as though he&#x27;d been scalped.</li>
            <li> Great clean shave and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> This product proves that you don&#x27;t have to spend more than $50 to get a VERY good electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and cleanup is exceptional.</li>
            <li> by far the best shaver i ever going to get for this price.</li>
            <li> This shaver offers an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like shaving, but Panasonic so far is the best brand I&#x27;ve found for my beard.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best electric shavers out there.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a near perfect shave!  </li>
            <li> it feels good in your hand and it is also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This razor is a very fine product in the acceptable $50 range.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s my first Panasonic triple head foil shaver, after so many years using Norelco shavers, and I am pretty impressed, good shaver for that money&lt;</li>
            <li> Always good, but best if done wet.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and works great for my ear and nose hair with the pop up shaver.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with two years.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine!</li>
            <li> It gives a very smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> All I can say is for me (very light and spotty beard)I</li>
            <li> My purchase through  Amazon.com was as good as ever, very quick and free  delivery.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good shaver, it works well, can be used with water for a more comfortable shave, looks good, gets virtually all the hairs, and gets closer than my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> To get a smooth finish, I have to go over spots two or three times!  </li>
            <li> I would really recommend this razor and the price is great also.</li>
            <li> I ordered a man&#x27; s razor thinking it will be better for women&#x27;s legs</li>
            <li> Definately the best I&#x27;ve ever used and the price is low.</li>
            <li> Checked many products online and in stores but felt Panasonic was a better choice.  </li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll find yourself shaving so much more that the wife will start to wonder what&#x27;s going on?</li>
            <li> and it would be a better investment then purchasing the foil and blade replacement.</li>
            <li> , to start it off is my favorite appliance and electronic company.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The top of the lip and the buccal surfaces were smoother than a blade.  </li>
            <li> My neck area does sometimes have patches of stubble but it requires many repeated going overs to ensure they&#x27;re gone.  </li>
            <li> I was also drawn in by many favorable reviews of this product here.    </li>
            <li> Seems most things are made to be disposable now, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had a Remington F4790 that I think does a better job.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and works great on chin/cheeks/jawbone area!  </li>
            <li> But money is an object that most of us lack, including myself.    </li>
            <li> It gives me a shave that is just as close as a Braun Series 7, but requires sometimes a couple more passes than the Series 7.</li>
            <li> Excellent asset to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy a nice shave</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving implements are my Norelco 7xxxx series (used with Nivea Shave Conditioner or Afta Pre Shave) and this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have collected a Norelco corded 4xxx series, a Headblade, Atra, Mach 3, Sensor, Tracer and Schick Hydro, and of all the shaving items I have the ones I use most</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> The shaver works better with a pre-shave lotion.</li>
            <li> According to my husband it&#x27;s 100 times better than advertised.</li>
            <li> B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]] at Best Buy for $20.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use, easy to clean, happy to have.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from local Best Buy since I was traveling overseas and didn&#x27;t have time to get it shipped from online stores.</li>
            <li> and I realized how close and smooth it shaved!  </li>
            <li> i have used this for a month now and am not wholly pleased.  </li>
            <li> After trying and returning Norelco, I had Brauns, including the top of the line, for many years.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pleased with this brand of shaver.  </li>
            <li> I use them until they die in 5-7 years, much better life than the Remington&#x27;s I used to have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I gave them a chance...</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the comfort offered by the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Also requires more time to shave as I need to pass over areas miore than before.  </li>
            <li> I am coming from an ancient razor that had become more of a lawnmower than an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Looking at the design was interesting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year and it is the best performer of the many electrics I&#x27;ve used over the last 35 years.  </li>
            <li> Although a lot more money, I just ordered ES8103S, I hope to have better luck with 8103 than this one.</li>
            <li> After reading some comparisons online on Rotary vs. Foil, I decided to give foil a try, since most people said they gave a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Now my regiment for shaving (if I have more than a day&#x27;s growth on my face)</li>
            <li> If your not looking for a top of the line razor, and got 50 bucks to spend get it.</li>
            <li> This is an OK razor for the price.  </li>
            <li> just have to go over areas more than once.  </li>
            <li> Like I said for the price it is an OK razor.</li>
            <li> It has done what I want it to do and more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have  had it for a week now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave &amp; easy to clean, no complaints there.</li>
            <li> some how it won&#x27;t be able to recharge.</li>
            <li> I love the wet/dry design and shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> He told me he has never been able to use shaving gel with an electric shaver before till now :)</li>
            <li> The instructions recommend you change more often then</li>
            <li> My Braun trimmer was much more efficient.</li>
            <li> , i like Norelco a lot better</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does a pretty good job for the money and in comparison to my Remington.  </li>
            <li> It shaves pretty good</li>
            <li> PROS    Shaves pretty good for the price.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to find this baby on sale for $50--so don&#x27;t pay more than that--</li>
            <li> Cleaning is as easy as popping off the top cover and running it under water.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy, and I love the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> Well made and is very easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and it says you can use it in water</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor is great so far.  </li>
            <li> this the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to use it hassle free for almost 2 years</li>
            <li> The replacement blade is pretty cheap (cost wise).  </li>
            <li> Very close shave good battery life.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a diference in the shave but the shaving cream does provide good lubrication.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Power, clean close shave very smooth.</li>
            <li> Had an original Wet/Dry Shaver for more than 15 years...</li>
            <li> A thinner soap, like a rich face soap, seemed to work better.</li>
            <li> This came very quickly</li>
            <li> The head does, however, clean more easily than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> In the end it is a smooth shave after all, so that&#x27;s the most important thing.  </li>
            <li> It also discharges very quickly, have to charge after one to two uses.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, I pop the top off and clean the blades and foil while still in the shower.  </li>
            <li> three were easily to wash.  </li>
            <li> Easy as that.</li>
            <li> two he wasn&#x27;t sure of what kind of a sahve he was really going to get.  </li>
            <li> Broke very quickly.  </li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin and could not find a nice razor to shave effectively.  </li>
            <li> im not complaining, good speed and a decent cut.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s as strong of recommendation as I ever give.</li>
            <li> This one has been running strong for two years.</li>
            <li> It shaves kind of nice and smooth although it takes longer to shave than my   old shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first submersible I&#x27;ve owned, which is REALLY nice.</li>
            <li> After several months of regular use, I must say that the shaver is about as good as the best I have owned.  </li>
            <li> The first one is a battery-only model - small/no trimmer, but handy for weekend suitcase</li>
            <li> While I prefer to use it Dry, it is also very good with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The feel is excellent, easy to handle and work into tight areas.  </li>
            <li> The charge has hold up fine.  </li>
            <li> and I love the quick charge feature.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s absolutely the most buzz for your buck!</li>
            <li> If you shave daily, it&#x27;s great - close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> In addition, the battery life isn&#x27;t all that great, but for me it isn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the shaver overall, and would buy it again, a bargain.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, etc.</li>
            <li> I decided that I would try to find one that would work and after reading reviews and counting the money I had available, I bought the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> My neck has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean after every shave.</li>
            <li> For my beard, this is an important improvement over cheaper 2-blade models.</li>
            <li> I eventually lost it and ole faithful filled in the gap, again.</li>
            <li> I was always painted into a corner until I purchased the Panasonic shaver depicted and predictably experienced an equal quality shave as compared to the blade.</li>
            <li> My last Braun was a Syncro 7505 and it was great.</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower to get a close but comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> With this razor, its so comfortable and leaves no burn.       </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a coarse beard and don&#x27;t get an especially smooth shave, so</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Build materials are on the cheap end, but this device just works.</li>
            <li> but you will need to listen to get a smooth even shave.  </li>
            <li> (haven&#x27;t measured it yet in days), and is comfortable in my hand and on my face.    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic just feels and sounds cheap.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked into replacemnet parts, but I doubt they are cheap...</li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how people can get cut with these kind of shavers, it is really a mystery...</li>
            <li> It replaced this horribly cheap electric razor I got from Phillips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Before buying this razor, I had a Panasonic wet/dry that worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> when receiving it were 1) cheap plastic housing, 2)</li>
            <li> Overall, a great cordless electric razor for the budget shopper.</li>
            <li> It gives me a smooth, close shave without making my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> He said its great, but I saw him using it only once...</li>
            <li> i got a cheap remington that did the job</li>
            <li> easy to clean</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> When the 20% charge light starts blinking I just plug it in.</li>
            <li> I was using some cheap Hitachi shaver which cost around 30 bucks in (2002) and it lasted me about 7 or 8 years.</li>
            <li> A newer model may be available but I have no experience with it.</li>
            <li> the old 4026 was good for maybe a week, TOPS.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Norelco three head rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> still all original and shaves fine.  </li>
            <li> On top of all that, the price is right.    </li>
            <li> I love this shaver very much.</li>
            <li> Super close, comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li> One of the best buys I have purchased, in the past.</li>
            <li> The ac adapter is unique to the shaver which means I would have to buy</li>
            <li> After obtaining the information I look around for the best price and as usual Amazon.com had it.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands and this is the first purchase of a Panasonic and it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it takes more than a swipe or two to get a very clean shave, but that said, I have been able to get a terrific, close shave (almost indistinguishable from that of a blade shave)</li>
            <li> I find that their products are so immaculately engineered and durable that I still own them from the stone age and after 15 years a TV is brand new in theory.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a clean close shave.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic Razor produces a close, smooth shave and charges quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> if amazing just one charge last for many days ( in my case )...</li>
            <li> At least as importantly, it is still in perfect condition in all respects.    </li>
            <li> it has helped me on my search to be clean and polished.</li>
            <li> The Norelco beard trimmer was great for getting rid of a week&#x27;s worth of facial hair, which I could then follow with a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is fully immersible in water, and washes clean with a rinse under the faucet--no cleaning tools needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A rinse under the faucet keeps it totally clean, inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fully immersible in water, and washes clean with a rinse under the faucet--no cleaning tools needed.    </li>
            <li> A rinse under the faucet keeps it totally clean, inside and out.     </li>
            <li> Compared to my old Norelco rotary shaver, it is amazing and provides a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I did, however, clean the shaver per the instructions after every shave.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot easier to clean, all you do is put some liquid soap on it and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, mostly dry, and it continues to do a great job.</li>
            <li> It operates smoothly, has plenty of power and speed, the % remaining display is helpful, and it charges quickly</li>
            <li> It also takes a bit longer to get a totally clean shave</li>
            <li> Being able to clean it with water is an added bonus and the ability to shave wet or dry and receive the same great results is awesome.  </li>
            <li> This new one is better designed and the digital readout on the battery is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> The new one is finally large enough, and the tilting head follows the contours of face and neck perfectly- works fine without the mirror and battery capacity is monitored with an LCD panel showing % of charge remaining..</li>
            <li> Spent almost $100 on son&#x27;s, this is a great deal, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> For the first 8 months or so the ES7103K worked perfect, but then it started losing charge rapidly, I would need to recharge it every few days sometimes and</li>
            <li> Makes keeping a straight \\&quot;stash\\&quot; more of a challenge.  </li>
            <li> The shave I get from this is not quite as good as with my last one.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good razor.  </li>
            <li> even if it only lasts a year, I will still consider it a good value.  </li>
            <li> Who would have thought that Panasonic would make such a good razor.en if it only lasts a year, I will still consider it a good value.  </li>
            <li> Who would have thought that Panasonic would make such a good razor.</li>
            <li> In case your barber didn&#x27;t do a good enough job on your haircut</li>
            <li> Even so, it&#x27;s still not a bad deal for the price.    </li>
            <li> Wow, what a pleasant surprise to find that this shaver really works.  </li>
            <li> I using it almost every day for shaving... but only for my neck and ears, for many years I have full beard :)&lt;</li>
            <li> After using so many manual razors, it is refreshing to see a brand of electrics that rethinks typical shavers and goes for something innovative for today&#x27;s man.</li>
            <li> After using so many manual razors, it is refreshing to see a brand of electrics that rethinks typical shavers and goes for something innovative for today&#x27;s man.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver was a foil shaver from Braun and which did it job fine.  </li>
            <li> Quick to charge.  </li>
            <li> My son loves the razor and the company shipped it out quickly in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect shaver though, then you might want to go with something more expensive.</li>
            <li> is a simple joy for me and provides me with a real option to my hand shaver.  </li>
            <li> You may be able to get them from a Panasonic service centre, but they will likely cost more than the shaver itself.    </li>
            <li> Intially, I use to go couple of weeks before charging, now I am lucky to get two shaves out of it.     </li>
            <li> It performs much better than my older Braun</li>
            <li> My experience is the shaver is now pretty close to giving a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> but wet is better and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave and having a wet option is truly unique.</li>
            <li> I will say this razor goes a long time on a charge and has a good charge indicator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this is not the most powerful Panasonic model out there at 10k rpm, it definitely feels more powerful</li>
            <li> It was ok, but really nothing compared to the higher series Brauns</li>
            <li> a side note the side burn shaver is pretty good for not only trimming your side burns but also for the hair on the side of your head if you get a number 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months, I think, and so far I really like it, works a lot better than my last razor and the trimmer is a very nice addition.</li>
            <li> I found this razor to be quiet, easy to clean, comfortable, easy to hold (because of its shape), and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This is the first dedicated electric razor I have purchased, outside of smaller trimmers, and I am very happy with it.   </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> It shaves closer and more quickly than my old Braun Ultraspeed, and I can wash it out.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and simple to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is by far, the best electric shaver you can buy under $200...and it only costs $49.99 on amazon, or $44.99 at Fry&#x27;s Electronics (if you live on the West coast).</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, cuts reasonable close, comfortable to use, easy to clean with the kitchen sink spray head, battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> I still get a few razor bumps but the shaver is great</li>
            <li> Although this has some positives (e.g. its LCD display &amp; pop up trimmer), the main point of an electric shaver is to provide a smooth shave quickly.  </li>
            <li> But I got a nice, close shave only for a couple of months, then the blades wore out.</li>
            <li> This shaver is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It will hold a charge for about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li> like my old, battery-powered, dry-shave Braun travel shaver a lot better than this</li>
            <li> paid $60 for this at Best Buy; you can get it here for approximately $45.</li>
            <li> I paid $60 for this at Best Buy; you can get it here for approximately $45.</li>
            <li> it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco triple head old style shaver that did a better job for 20 plus years before it died.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not this is worth the money, trust me, it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be surprised if i get 6-12 more months out of this one.</li>
            <li> It takes a week or two to get used to it, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> and I decided to give it a try as my face has become more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I get about a weeks worth of shaving from one charge.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a pretty good job of shaving close but does not hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to fork over more for a razor that may have been a bit better.   </li>
            <li> Most shavers I&#x27;ve had go flat as soon as the TIME TO CHARGE light comes</li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature seems to work well, I&#x27;m able to clean it much easier than my old razor.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s quiet, holds a charge very well, and to clean it, you just put a lil hand soap on it, turn it on, let it lather up, and then rinse!</li>
            <li> While this model takes off my face top skin layer like no other electric razors out there, my skin does feels fresh after I give it some aftershave lotion.  </li>
            <li> perhaps you will find it cuts your beard better than mine, especially if your beard is pretty light.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a good, painless shave in my life (with blades or other electric shavers) - until I used this shaver.    </li>
            <li> I know if I need to charge it right before travelling.</li>
            <li> The guy complaining about the service didn&#x27;t even use it right</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not returning right away, because for some reason I thought I would get it figured out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is the closet shave for a barebones unit, and that price is right.  </li>
            <li> Just wished it had the plug and play feature.unit, and that price is right.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and, size is just right ...</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s gentle and smooth when applied to the face and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve since bought another (Norelco PT730/41) shaver that works much better for me: I can get a closer shave and more quickly, the battery lasts at least three times longer than the Panasonic, it is noticeably lighter in my hand, it is significantly quieter.</li>
            <li> They have a huge selection of shavers for all budgets that are high quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers over the years including, most recently, a popular consumer magagzine&#x27;s \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; which turned out to be anything but; noisy, horrible shave, missed spots, etc.  </li>
            <li> This shaves nice and smooth, smoother than the old Braun, even with new blades, it balances and feels natural.</li>
            <li> and although no electric shaver will completely match a razor blades shave, it does a fantastic job good enough to step outside looking clean shaven and fresh</li>
            <li> Someone intelligent at Panasonic decided to save a few million dollars and make it the way it has to be in our legal system.    </li>
            <li> Once nice feature is that it has an LED showing how much of the battery is left.  </li>
            <li> After using this shaver for a few weeks, it (magically) made my skin more resilient.  </li>
            <li> , I sent it back and am happy to be back to my blades.</li>
            <li> This is all good news for me as it&#x27;s one less step and</li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s power is as strong with a full charge as it is with a low battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is the first electric razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric after 20 years of blades.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut the hair on my legs and when I tried it in the shower it got extremely hot.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This was my first Panasonic Shaver and about 2 years later I purchase the ES8103S Arc3, which was a step up andmy most used razor.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking for your first shaver this is the one.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give an electric shaver a go, after so many years between my last attempt.  </li>
            <li> The neck area, because of the many directions of hair growth, I have to use a circular motion for an extra 3-4 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is about the sixth electric shaver I have owned, and the first Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you buy/own a tiny brush for cleaning your razor.</li>
            <li> As this is my first electric I cannot compare it to others.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves so close my skin felt senitive for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver, electric or blade that i have used that did NOT give me a razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the higher end one because I don&#x27;t have the money to buy it.  </li>
            <li> This one is even better because it curves to your face, it&#x27;s quiet and gets a close shave!</li>
            <li> No razor burn, even the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; my face with a dab of shower gel first and then shave</li>
            <li> So, hesitant to replace that disaster with another one, I was extra cautious, but what sold me on the Panasonic ES7103K was the outstanding Amazon.com customer reviews.    </li>
            <li> This review is geared more toward those who don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis.     </li>
            <li> If you must try this shaver, send it back immediately if you don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Its plug port is located at the bottom of the razor, and do be aware</li>
            <li> Although the shaver does not work while plugged in, it does work consistently at the peak of its power while on battery.</li>
            <li> using this wet would make it effective for just about anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric shaver in 30 years</li>
            <li> After my first shave with this razor</li>
            <li> Higher end Panasonic shavers go up to 13k rpm.  </li>
            <li> The triple rotating blades on the Spectra, while doesn&#x27;t cut as close, definitely fits my face contour better creating an even cut.  </li>
            <li> its foil/coil (not the current triple heads models) missed some hair under the neck and mustache and need more passes than both the Norelco and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shave wet is a nice feature also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco first and then, two Brauns which were a step up from the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I could reliably get 1 shave even when it first hits \\&quot;0%\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The earlier one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a couple of years, but had a better blade and head.  </li>
            <li> First off, any electric shaver is going to take longer than a razor, that&#x27;s just a fact of life.</li>
            <li> You can shave without even really paying attention or even looking at yourself - no mirror required!</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s customer support is excellent, and they have always replaced the failed unit.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor since I started shaving 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> the result is that the condition of my skin is overall a lot better.</li>
            <li> I also have a Norelco 7310 and it gives several more shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li> After a couple more months the razor could no longer hold enough charge for reliable wireless shaving.</li>
            <li> I liked that you could get this one wet, not that I use it in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t want to worry about getting water on the inside of the device.  </li>
            <li> (before the battery simply wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple shaves).</li>
            <li> and, though it&#x27;s a bit louder, it cuts a whole lot closer!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find the tilt action of the head very useful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 and my beard is very thick, and this shaver is the best experience so far!    </li>
            <li> An easy to read DIGITAL battery gauge is in the handle, not a hard to see glow light.</li>
            <li> Yes, as many other reviewers have confirmed, this shaver does deliver a very close shave.</li>
            <li> In any event, I think that the price I paid for it is right in comparison to the Norelco shavers which  are very pricey now days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as someone with only light facial hair growth I do not find this shaver gives me a good, smooth shave when used dry.</li>
            <li> Easy Clean - wet the shaving head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a triple rotating head Norelco electric razor for years and, while I liked the convenience, it never really shaved very close.</li>
            <li> This one works very well dry (for a quick touch-up) and GREAT wet, with or without soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver does need to be charged more frequently than my old Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll actually start feeling good specially when the feedback form your viewers is positive due to your representation.</li>
            <li> It pops open easily and has very accessible and open heads for cleaning.</li>
            <li> know the lions share of review are positive.</li>
            <li> The trimmer did work but it will take too long to shave legs with a trimmer :)</li>
            <li> This shaves very well, and works exactly as I would expect.</li>
            <li> Strange, but not something you&#x27;d encounter often if you look at the battery meter to make sure it never goes to 0%.</li>
            <li> One other general comment, I&#x27;ve found that the twin-headed flexible blade razors do cut more effectively than the single-headed ones and are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The shave is super close, the noise level is par with my old Braun</li>
            <li> only  * when you clean the shaver, make sure that ONLY the head isrinsed under water.</li>
            <li> Although this Panasonic is a very decent shaver.</li>
            <li> The auto cleaning system is just pure genius --</li>
            <li> I did have to adjust to it as a certain technique</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the large head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Used wet, dry or with a preshave this item gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> The longer hairs that the trimmer missed were then missed by the regular shaver, though shorter hairs came off fine.     </li>
            <li> With my use, the battery stays charged for a large number of shaves, is re-charged very papidly when I have to do so; and, I like the percentage status display of remaining battery power between charges.</li>
            <li> Just quickly run it under cool water and lay it on a towel or on the counter to dry.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is better on this one, but not as wide so doesn&#x27;t cover as much area.  </li>
            <li> Also, unlike others who didn&#x27;t think that the razor did well trimming and shaping the beard, mustache or sideburns, I have found that it works very well on those areas, even without using the \\&quot;trimmer blade.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The battery charge indicator is very reliable.</li>
            <li> I expected more for a razor of this value and won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> The shaves are really close</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic ES-7103 for about one year now and really like the design and the price.</li>
            <li> The shaver gets really close</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the time consuming part of the process.</li>
            <li> and the trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t see how Panasonic could possibly improve this shaver so much that it would be worth paying 3times more.  </li>
            <li> (it really smooths out the shave).  </li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t shave my neck very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Not to go into too much detail</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s twice as much as the 4026.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s twice as much as the 4026.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close</li>
            <li> The ES7103K just does not have the power that you expect from a modern shaver.  </li>
            <li> Built really well and holds charge for along time.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I went cheap for my next razor, a Norelco rotary because it had good review, and it just doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable and get as close.  </li>
            <li> I would say that it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> The design is very user-friendly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try to wet shave with it for the reason that I just don&#x27;t see any benefit out of this at all, in fact I see it as more of  cleaning work after shaving.</li>
            <li> Takes about 15 seconds, 30 if you&#x27;re very thorough.  </li>
            <li> I imagine that, for legal reasons, since this is advertised as a water-proof unit, they can&#x27;t allow the razor to function with a cord plugged into a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants to avoid this and maximize the life of their 7103K, what I would recommend is:  *</li>
            <li> Despite those faults, using this shaver \\&quot;wet\\&quot; is simply fantastic, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver enough.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it&#x27;s really been a boon for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my brother as a Christmas gift, and after he told me it gave him a really close shave</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t beleave how fast it charges.</li>
            <li> It charges fast and holds the charge well depemding on your use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> I also do seem to get a better shave when wet.    </li>
            <li> However, where it really excels is when your face is irritated and you don&#x27;t want to butcher yourself with a razor.</li>
            <li> One thing I will note is that the picture on the package shows a guy cutting as swath through a perfect coat of lather which I found was not that affective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not get as close as a real blade if that is a concern.  </li>
            <li> The foil broke after a year and costs as much as the shaver itself....</li>
            <li> Seemed like a nice shaver, but it quit working a few months after purchase.</li>
            <li> It recharges very quickly and goes a long time before having to recharge it.  </li>
            <li> It charges very quickly and holds the charge for a long time.    </li>
            <li> It shaves clean and trim well, with the LCD screen display you know how much battery left.</li>
            <li> Since this is a wet/dry shaver I use it mostly in the shower, but I suspect the battery life issues were due to</li>
            <li> if you have a coarse beard, I&#x27;m not sure you would be happy with any electric razor.    </li>
            <li> I also clean my razor heads out almost daily to prolong the life of the cutters.    </li>
            <li> Maybe the rest of the world has pansy whiskers or something because this this simply will not shave me clean.</li>
            <li> It was more comfortable, missed less hairs, and was an overall closer, nicer shave.</li>
            <li> so far I am very, very</li>
            <li> I am willing to venture and say that the slower speed and the angle of the blades are the contributing factor in my complete satisfaction with this Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> The old Norelco was a rotary, and it was also my first shaver.</li>
            <li> I was initially getting 10-12 shaves on a full charge.</li>
            <li> Over all, not bad if you change your electrical shaver every 2 years anyway and keep you beard short over the weekend.</li>
            <li> from the instruction, it said when the batteries drop down to 0% you still can have 2 more shave time.</li>
            <li> I used to shave with a razor and it did take a little more than a week to really get proficient at getting a close shave, but I don&#x27;t miss the nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Only notable change is the nicads are gradually loosing their ability to hold a full charge, usually only last a weeks shaving now.  </li>
            <li> I was ready for a new shaver  and looked for and thought I was going to buy the Braun 370.</li>
            <li> So I went the route of the mach 3 for many years, but was subject to cuts and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it in the hope that it would be more durable than the previous two shavers I owned, both Brauns.  </li>
            <li> After many years of using Norelco, Remington, and Braun electric razors, I thought I&#x27;d try Panasonic when my previous razor&#x27;s battery died.  </li>
            <li> is that it does not seem to cut as well as my previous Braun and Remington twin-head razors (which also cut much more efficiently than the Norelco rotaries).  </li>
            <li> I owned an older Panasonic electric shaver with induction charging.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent option at this price point.  </li>
            <li> Quick Charge - 5 minute charge will give you enough juice to do a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He cannot say enough about the tremendous, close shave.</li>
            <li> Also, he finds the digital battery level display to be helpful in making sure he always has enough charge.</li>
            <li> For me there are 3 main criteria to evaluate a shaver: closeness/smoothness, robustness against irregular hair and quality/longevity:   -</li>
            <li> a decent one is around $90.</li>
            <li> I had a much older version</li>
            <li> When I bought this product , it was a decent shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver remained loyal for several (4 maybe?)</li>
            <li> The next is similar to this new one, but smaller head, requiring more attention in the mirror to get a full shave..  </li>
            <li> It is certainly not as close of a shave by far, but it does okay</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a late Christmas gift and he love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> Okay razor, I expected more, have a small Panasonic travel electric razor and when it was new gave me great shaves, but after three years it is starting to dull</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The Braun series 7 (a $230 shaver) would need a little more than one pass per zone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than my old Remington Microscreen, but doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close.  </li>
            <li> Having to go over a spot more than once wastes time.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much the same razor as my son&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> To minimize that, I had to spend a long time in the shower and use The Shaving Co gel for sensitive skin just to have a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Only minor problem has been getting the area between jaw and neck (getting better at it, tho).  </li>
            <li> Even though the 7103 uses NiMH rechargable batteries, you can&#x27;t use normal batteries for this shaver.</li>
            <li> I would say the noise level is on par with other electrics that I&#x27;ve used (although I&#x27;ve never spent more than $120 on one, so maybe the high dollar ones are quieter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor burn from my previous cheap electric shaver was too much for me to handle.  </li>
            <li> * while leaving it to dry, make sure that the tail/bottom of the shaver is above the head of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even planned on purchasing a second unit as a backup since the price is right</li>
            <li> Plus, while ordering right before Christmas, we received the shipment promptly with no extra shipping charge.</li>
            <li> An easy way is to lay the bottom of the shaver on the plastic cover of the head, so it&#x27;s sloping down and any water will drain towards the head of the shaver.    </li>
            <li> Yet, I went back to my Panasonic Travel Shaver for daily use, which is much smaller, less sophisticated that this one, but does a better job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work wet in my opinion which was my original desire, although now I don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> I have had my new Panasonic electric razor for 3 weeks now and regret not having purchased it years ago.</li>
            <li> it was about time to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> , so I was up for a new one and went with Panasonic again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order a new \\&quot;screen\\&quot;, soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have no problem buying an all new unit every year if it happens to break.</li>
            <li> so I bought this new one</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a new rechargeable shaver, I was comparing the Braun but</li>
            <li> I expected to get a closer shave without so many strokes over the same areas.  </li>
            <li> I find that I have to keep going over the same areas, especially my neck, to get a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> As far as not being able to use with a cord, thats a dead issur to me.</li>
            <li> Battery does not seem to be replaceable...still going strong, but how long will it last?</li>
            <li> a slightly closer shave  - shower gel seems to me to make for an even better wet shave than shaving cream  - can wash the shaving block with hand soap and water      Cons  - does not operate while plugged in  - no matter how many passes or angles, it misses short whiskers around lips, under nose and on neck  - lack of texturized grip makes the shaver prone to slipping out of your hand when wet shaving (there goes your $50 new shaver)  - battery gauge only displays 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%; better would just be five bars like on a cell phone  - the effective width of the shaving area is quite small:</li>
            <li> In the last twenty years I have bought every electric shaver in sight, always returning to the latest hoo hah version of blade shaving and quirky foam cream that ended up with a closer shave (that method actually severs a layer of skin) and a lot of shekels for replacement blades and said foam cream.</li>
            <li> and it is so far!</li>
            <li> I bought my son the next higher level one about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shaver works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the beard trimmer component would serve as a consistent enough shave to leave a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow.     </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my year-old bare bones Norelco shaver that had really lost it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> My second purchase of a Panasonic shaver (I dropped the first out my window-don&#x27;t ask)  </li>
            <li> the size is not small and it is built evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used only mid range electric razors from Braun which all left stubble and/or cut my face if I applied more pressure to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Well, the day I first used it I was left in complete amazement</li>
            <li> It also cut me near my Adam&#x27;s apple, but I remembered that the same thing happened the first time I tried my Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> So in good conscience, I can only give this a one star due to it only lasting 7 months.</li>
            <li> Overall it requires more time than a conventional razor and not quite as close, so far anyway, but it&#x27;s a winner for me.</li>
            <li> My Braun 5614 feels vastly superior in design and has been going strong for 6 years of hard labor on my tough whiskers.</li>
            <li> Even though they recommend that one try the new shaver for at least a month, five days were more than I could handle.  </li>
            <li> Second, the cordless feature is nice for a choice of wet or dry shaves.</li>
            <li> It worked fine, although I noticed that it missed a few hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job dry and wet (closer shave wet).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There really is only one con, and it&#x27;s more of a little annoyance than a deficiency.</li>
            <li> - Lifetime of the battery was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> When it shows \\&quot;O\\&quot; charge, I know I can get at least one more shave without recharging.  </li>
            <li> Much to my disappoint upon receiving, I found this charger doesn&#x27;t have induction charging, instead it has a traditional plug with two prongs.  </li>
            <li> I guess this yanking action somehow loosened the water-proofing around the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> Frequently I ended up shaving twice a day and never felt that \\&quot;razor blade smooth\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li> Remember that old joke, it&#x27;s not the razor, it&#x27;s the blades.</li>
            <li> I switched from an old Remington.  </li>
            <li> It seems as though it just takes longer to get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li> Total shave time is really about 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> If money is no object, the Braun Series 7 electric shaver is by far the smoothest and closest shave.    </li>
            <li> Have had 3 Norelco&#x27;s before, including 2 of the ones that have lotion inside of them and this Panasonic is by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric.  </li>
            <li> At a young 59 years old my husband, was just diagnosed with a heart condition that requires him to be on a blood thinning prescription.</li>
            <li> I know this is a personal, subjective call, but to me, this absolutely shaves closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will tell if it is sturdier than my old 4026.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it is sturdier than my old 4026.</li>
            <li> There is no way to get \\&quot;cut\\&quot; since the blade is inside the shaver and it can&#x27;t be exposed, so you may only get these so-called \\&quot;cuts\\&quot; if you let your beard grow too much.</li>
            <li> This experience has completely turned me away from all electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Wow, just got this shaver.</li>
            <li> A month later he told me he absolutely loves this shaver.  </li>
            <li> or so I have been using not thing but Norelco shavers, and as far as I&#x27;m consern there is just  no comparison not with this shaver any ways.</li>
            <li> If used daily, you wouldn&#x27;t even need a straight, or disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised to find that it shaves every bit as close as the blades that I use.  </li>
            <li> reviews claim that this is a relatively loud shaver, but I use it in my bathroom which is about 10 feet away from my 1 year olds room, and she never wakes up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ready for it&#x27;s fourth charge today though.  </li>
            <li> Keep as much water off the body where the switch, power cord and electronics are as possible.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Wow, this electric shaver is the closest thing to a Bic razor.  </li>
            <li> The newer Braun models have fixed this feature.</li>
            <li> Also, the LCD screen displays how much energy is left in the battery</li>
            <li> I also did not like how loud this shaver is.</li>
            <li> I have supremely sensitive skin on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> And finally, the digital battery display is not as precise as one may might think as it only works in steps of 20% (i.e. 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%).    </li>
            <li> Wet/dry shave, pretty long battery and one of the closest shaves from and electric.</li>
            <li> and he developed a raw-looking rash as a result of using it twice.</li>
            <li> This model has a plug-in charger, which I suspect is what was responsible for it failing after only three months.</li>
            <li> :  Takes about 6 minutes for a complete shave.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave very close after only one day of hair growth.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The trimmer is the only real disappontment with this shaver.</li>
            <li> All the research I did before I purchased this razor for him was well worth the time spent.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for the first few months.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied so far the the Razor, it shaves well with very little rash, which has been a problem for me with other razors.</li>
            <li> After a full charge, the unit would rapidly and completely discharge after just one and a half shaves.</li>
            <li> It does not feel cheap, and actually seems extremely durable.</li>
            <li> All three does evenly in the bread part of the face with a long trimmer on the first wave and switching back to the main shaver for the softer cut.  </li>
            <li> The first time, I used it without any water; just dry.</li>
            <li> When contemplating whether to purchase a new shaver head or a new electric shaver I opted for the latter based on the reviews I read.      </li>
            <li> To be honest, those areas were impossible to go against the grain because they were so sensitive and that is even with a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> The first, and most typical method, is with a small amount of Lectric Shave splashed on my face in the moments before shaving.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what it would be like for the main razor as I use a regular blade, but for trimming and getting those spots I missed, it works well.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model and the flip up shaver finally broke after 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I changed from manual to electric because I knew that it would be the easiest way for me to get a decent shave every day without dealing with potential razor burn.</li>
            <li> The first thing thing I noticed was that when the LCD said 40% charge left, the shaver just died instantly.</li>
            <li> Braun (older model) definitely has a close shave but</li>
            <li> The older Braun and Panasonic work on a charge only and cannot plug and play.  </li>
            <li> Low end shaver with decent battery life.  </li>
            <li> Still decent for occasional use and the trimmer is convenient.</li>
            <li> &gt;  Came with no accessories, such as brushes or a decent carrying</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve used that gives a really close shave-and it does it in half the time of others!</li>
            <li> I chose this one mostly due to the fact it also has the trimmer and the price was right.</li>
            <li> This razor gives as smooth a shave if not better than disposables and no knicks.</li>
            <li> Not only do I get quick, efficient, close shaves, but the shaver is exceptionally quiet, holds a charge for a long time</li>
            <li> Shaves really well and hold a long charge!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper, and the replacement blades are only 40% of the cost of a new razor.    </li>
            <li> Recently, though, a new job required me to change my shaving habits and begin shaving every day.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting a new electric shaver for some time and finally decided to get one.  </li>
            <li> beats half an hour in the shower and thus made this product worth it for me.       </li>
            <li> I really like the digital readout of what percent of battery is left!  </li>
            <li> The digital screen shows how much the battery is left, but is always on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much in the features of the more expensive razors that justifies their price.  </li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars even though I can&#x27;t get my neck hair with it, but it&#x27;s not as thick as the rest of my facial hair, and no other shaver has been able to get it</li>
            <li> No other shaver I owned or hear of goes dead so quickly  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive neck and this shaver does not cause those embarrasing red streaks of irritation.</li>
            <li> There is just no other rating that I can think of.</li>
            <li> There is just no other rating that I can think of.</li>
            <li> This is a major flaw.</li>
            <li> The head looks flat like a Braun, but unlike the lower series Brauns of the same price range, this Panasonic has a head that articulates in every direction and contours myface very well.    </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get a decent shave; probably 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I might have been lucky previously, but I&#x27;d never had an electric shaver that didn&#x27;t last longer than 7 years.</li>
            <li> Quiet, powerful, close shave, goes much farther on a single charge and there is a small window that tell you how much of a charge you have left.</li>
            <li> Yes, they should be able to put in a disclaimer and tell the user not to use it plugged in where it could drop into water and fry themselves but the courts have decreed that that is not good enough.  </li>
            <li> The only case where I got some irritation (and I have a sensitive skin) were when I shave a \\&quot;4-days\\&quot; growing beard, and it happened here and</li>
            <li> Since I never wet the razor nor the blades, I&#x27;ve never had to replace the foil nor the blades.  </li>
            <li> Now after just over 2 years, I get barely 2 shaves out of the ES7203.</li>
            <li> Looking closely, it was apparent that water had entered this waterproof shaver via where one of the prongs of the power cord enters that compartment.</li>
            <li> that was one of the cheaper models and several years old).  </li>
            <li> Tried the wet shave for the first time last weekend.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I figure I&#x27;d get a few months worth of usage and off to the garbage.</li>
            <li> At first, the razor was strong and cut well, but now it bogs down and when my beard is thick it can actually stall out the razor with 100% charge.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve bounced around and between different shaving methods - blades vs. electric; multi-blades vs single blade; rotary vs. straight.</li>
            <li> What I really didn&#x27;t like about it is that when the battery is totaly discharged it doesn&#x27;t work until it  is fully charged, other shavers are fully functional as soon as you plug them into the wall whether or not the battery is charged.  </li>
            <li> - If beard grown longer, this model will have a hard time to get you clean.</li>
            <li> Also, the razor can occasionally miss a few stubborn hairs on the neck (no matter how many times you try to mow them down).  </li>
            <li> Seems to have the same blades/foil, just a feature or two different, but it works real well in the shower or dry.</li>
            <li> Gives a gentle shave, quiet, had LCD display of charge status and can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It does shave close but takes twice as long as my old razor.  </li>
            <li> If I use it wet, it works much better -- but I bought it to use dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying aspect of the shaver is its power management.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s the fact that it misses a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is AWFUL, but if you use a straight blade on the bottom of your neck, the bottom being where you can just splash a little water on it and straight blade it, you&#x27;ll end up with a good shave and save a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the shave, but extremely disappointed that the shaver didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It shaves MUCH closer than the two  previous Brauns</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver due to its low price and decent spec&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It really works wet AND dry.</li>
            <li> It has versatile wet or dry shaving capabilities, with equally high quality results.</li>
            <li> This new shaver left behind large patches of hair on my face in spite of multiple passes in all possible directions and sometimes shaving for ten minutes at a time!</li>
            <li> However, my old razor was the same way, so I&#x27;ve decided not to dock a star due to this.    </li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews (something that usually works well).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a few months old!!</li>
            <li> I have tried and reviewed just about every modern manual razor on the United States market in the past year, and found only a couple that provided a close and comfortable--yet cost effective--shave.</li>
            <li> I t does take a little getting used to since I have normally used a razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Hairs under the neck needs a first past with a long trimmer on the Braun and Norelco, but not necessary for the Panasonic, which seem to chop almost all areas evenly without the long hair</li>
            <li> since the up keep is cost about the same as the shaver, it&#x27;s time to throw in a few bucks and get a new unit.</li>
            <li> My last two shavers didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> However, it is not powerful or fast as other Panasonic shavers...</li>
            <li> I do wish, however, that you could use this razor while plugged in, but that is only a minor inconvenience for me.  </li>
            <li> Charge doesn&#x27;t last as long  2) Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close  3)</li>
            <li> Close shaves for an electric and keeps a solid charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The following items are minor irritants that should not deter you from buying:    </li>
            <li> However, the extra time spent shaving is negligible, and overall, the shave quality ends up being the same.    </li>
            <li> so I cant tell you how long it last</li>
            <li> Additionally, the razor itself is so solidly built that I anticipate a long life for it.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the razor itself is so solidly built that I anticipate a long life for it.</li>
            <li> Due to a hand injury I was not able to shave with my right hand.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it dry.  </li>
            <li> have only used it dry</li>
            <li> I let the parts sit out to air dry while I&#x27;m at work, and snap it back together in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is made really well and is not cheaply made but not really needed for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recomend this product for the Price, and Durability, I would also advise anyone that if you do want to use this product wet and in the shower, just be prepared to buy new blades down the line.  </li>
            <li> The third blade on this model is the center slit blade, which cuts longer hairs and hairs that lay flat against the skin.  </li>
            <li> my 3 year old razor does, but no cuts and I haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving because my other razor cut me when I did.  </li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;ve used the rotating head razors, so I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s this razor in particular, or all razors like this, but it &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; hair all over when I use it.</li>
            <li> so far i have being using ES7103K for almost 5 weeks and my skin is never red, not has it tended to become raw.  </li>
            <li> I had tried over the years several electric shavers, but always my skin was left red and somewhat raw, meaning i could not possibly use them beyond a week.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, since I really liked this shaver.</li>
            <li> But then again, I only use it for 30 sec per day.</li>
            <li> and I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The last one (and most expensive) began falling apart after just a few months.      </li>
            <li> Only minus, the thing doesn&#x27;t work if it&#x27;s plugged in.  </li>
            <li> The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do is wet shaving, but I never used that Panasonic feature anyway.</li>
            <li> Long charge life -</li>
            <li> It will take you twice as long to shave as it does with the ES8103.  </li>
            <li> The second method is a wet shave with my Aveeno shave gel.</li>
            <li> I never thought that an electric razor would actually work well on a wet beard, but this just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I never thought that an electric razor would actually work well on a wet beard, but this just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has added a long spike on the +ve and a nipple on the -ve.</li>
            <li> close shave/trim&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts for about 4-5 shaves and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge&lt;br /&gt;Real</li>
            <li> Complaints: Fairly minor,</li>
            <li> It gives him a close shave and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I picked this Panasonic because it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, and because I liked the idea of the small LCD screen.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that gave me a close shave i.e. no prickly stubble left behind.  </li>
            <li> This can usually be handled by going over the zone a few times, but usually I just grab an old razor and quickly cut the missed hairs.</li>
            <li> Ironically, I normally dry shave, and only tried a wet shave about 3 times.</li>
            <li> When I went to replace it couldn&#x27;t find any Panasonics in the small town that I live in so bought a Braun.</li>
            <li> It compares unfavorably in several other ways;  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t make comparisons with other shavers and their relative quality, quietness, or closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li> For me it last about 2 weeks shaving every other day.    </li>
            <li> other times it would easily last two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive purchasing this product after reading several reviews where the shaver cut just a little bit too deep.</li>
            <li> With this I shaved dry</li>
            <li> Today that statement represents a serious matter because shaving with a blade scenario is very costly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m strictly a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> I never would buy a \\&quot;dry only\\&quot; shaver again.  </li>
            <li> dry shave</li>
            <li> It does produce a closer shave than dry.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to friends, but maybe it would make an excellent gift for that annoying coworker whose name I pulled for workplace Secret Santa.</li>
            <li> Now I needed a replacement for my workhorse but when I looked at Braun, I noticed that they forgot about those on a limited budget.</li>
            <li> just one thing, like every single shaver it takes time to get used to.</li>
            <li> Robustness to master 2 or 3-day stubles is quite limited and demands patience.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would rate the Panasonic comparable to something that Black and Decker would make in comparison to the Braun which would be closer to a Dewalt product - excuse</li>
            <li> I like the size, NOT easy to loose grip on because it is larger than the last one I had.</li>
            <li> In the past couple months the battery life has clearly deteriorated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 40 years and would consider the Panasonic ES7103 only average.</li>
            <li> : buzz off any beard, shave with a 3-blade razor to get my hairs small, use the Panasonic shaver to remove the rest, leaving my face soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why all the plastic parts under the Spectra blade have never been broken all these years, but they still work fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this 4 and a half stars, but I can&#x27;t give it only 4.</li>
            <li> I never did see any difference between wet or dry shaving either.     </li>
            <li> and panasonic wet and dry</li>
            <li> Wet, dry, in the shower, shaving cream, you name it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric razors in the past and I always find myself dis-satisfied and end up switching back to a blade.  </li>
            <li> There was evidence of water in the supposedly waterproof &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; electronics compartment that held the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a wet dry shaver for a while</li>
            <li> I tried it both wet and dry and neither worked well.  </li>
            <li> In the past 25 yrs I have had gone thru only 2-3 shavers, because once the batteries would die I could still use the shaver plugged in &amp; occasional replace the blades.  </li>
            <li> The wet and dry feature caught my eye</li>
            <li> I selected this product based on the positive reviews at this site, but I was totally disappointed with this first electric shaver of mine.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise if you only use the razor dry, the blades should last at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> In short the Panasonic feels like a toy, it does shave close, is a little cheaper than a comparable Braun</li>
            <li> But for those who like to keep a little bit of facial hair</li>
            <li> the Norelco design is a little different.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to try razors anymore, this little machine has made my life easier since I only have to recharge it</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and it grows fast.</li>
            <li> It wasnt used to being cut so close cause its been so long!!!</li>
            <li> Really no negatives to it from my standpoint.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor and used it only intermittantly for a few months.</li>
            <li> and I always have to be careful shaving around them.  </li>
            <li> just wash my face and leave it wet.. then shave.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be wet shaving</li>
            <li> I Tried the wet shave with lather.</li>
            <li> and I havent even tried the wet shave yet.</li>
            <li> Has a harder time shaving the neck area</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy into the wet shave with an electric razor theory</li>
            <li> He has to be extremely careful not to even get a \\&quot;Paper Cut\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so I dont know about wet shaving, etc.</li>
            <li> Never really trusted the razor to wet it.  </li>
            <li> It is almost comparable to a wet shave, without the skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother using it as a wet shaver, or with shaving cream</li>
            <li> 7 months later, the shaver is dead.</li>
            <li> The battery is likely dead, but frankly I would no longer trust the integrity of the electronics.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Closet shave:&lt;br /&gt;I will have to give this to the Panasonic by a narrow margin then Braun at 2 and Norelco in 3rd.  </li>
            <li> To get the desirable result took him over 30 mins when he used to do it in a few mins with regular shaver.</li>
            <li> He has even tried it wet.  </li>
            <li> - wet shaving seems to make for</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and the product was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> For my wedding, I shaved with an actual razor, but otherwise I used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very picky when it comes to razors, and this has been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver recharges rather slowly, but I get four or five complete shaves with each charge, so it&#x27;s not like the user who&#x27;s paying attention needs to worry about the inability to use it while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> I am asian w/ a sparse beard with thick individual hairs.  </li>
            <li> Both Braun and Panasonic coils going up and down where this Panasonic triple blades move up and down independently.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the LCD display of remaining power is (in my experience, at least) a complete fiction.</li>
            <li> This is for Panasonic ES7103K Pro Curve Wet Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the battery life is pretty short so when you travel you will need to bring the power cable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a life of at least 3-4 years, a long time for daily shower use, keeps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried in the shower yet but can&#x27;t imagine that it would perform any less than when using it dry.</li>
            <li> I had gotten really tired of my older Remington Rotary leaving my face with razor burn</li>
            <li> Once again though, Panasonic sent me a new unit of the next model up within a week of receiving the failed one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer gets a lot closer than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used as well.    </li>
            <li> sometimes it can get pretty difficult when you have a beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for nine years now and would not use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, because of the other positives mentioned, I probably will keep using this razor until it wears out.  </li>
            <li> It shaves EXTREMELY close.  </li>
            <li> I will compare this barebones Panasonic Es 7103k with the other models I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like those that has a big head and small tail</li>
            <li> I cannot compare it to other electric razors, but this one works well.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, this thing will save you money and probably some cuts here and there.    </li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for this type of junk.</li>
            <li> and it is always sharp</li>
            <li> When the older one eventually got old and looked a little dirty, i bought this one.  </li>
            <li> has decreased even further recently.  </li>
            <li> As far as the floating head I&#x27;m not to crazy about it, it&#x27;s a little too stiff and it only pevots in one direction unlike my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Be aware of very poor workmanship of this shaver.</li>
            <li> They last two years, and then get dull.  </li>
            <li> It costs about $35 to replace the blades and screen -- not worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare to the expensive modern electric shavers, just to the mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Although the Braun shavers performed very well, they were very expensive and extremely fragile.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for at least a month and it is the second electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> For me, I am getting an average battery life of two weeks.</li>
            <li> For me, I am getting an average battery life of two weeks.</li>
            <li> They would then have to spend millions more in payout to the idiot&#x27;s family and then have to make it non usable while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> You can hear it cut hair so run it over your face slowly and move it back and forth until you don&#x27;t hear the hair being cut anymore.  </li>
            <li> $20 for the 4026 was a waste of money; $60 for this is money well spent.    </li>
            <li> I get seven or eight shaves between charges, and I have never had the battery run completely down.  </li>
            <li> (yes, i did down there too if you&#x27;re wondering)</li>
            <li> down to 20 then 00.</li>
            <li> This will ensure that water/moisture does not run down to the body of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Norelco design hands down is the easiest on the face.  </li>
            <li> With the 4026, it was impossible to shave dry, and wet really meant I had to lather my face with soap.</li>
            <li> It is heavier than his previous shaver.  </li>
            <li> Have had 2 Norleco&#x27;s previously, but this razor gave me the closet shave I have ever had since using a razor.  </li>
            <li> When the switch on my Norelco went out, I looked around and found this for less than half the price of a rotary.</li>
            <li> Spending half an hour or longer in the shower was taking its toll in the mornings.</li>
            <li> but remember that in less than a year, you will have to replace the blades.  </li>
            <li> It does not work well with longer hairs, which is typical of foil shavers.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver was a Series 3 370 Braun.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even believe some of you guys complained that the Braun&#x27;s were too heavy - get some upper body strength dudes</li>
            <li> I shave for less than 1 minute per day.</li>
            <li> The previous one I had over 10 years.    </li>
            <li> This thing will pay for itself in less than a year.    </li>
            <li> Why not a true measure of battery capacity, or a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 countdown?</li>
            <li> Why not a true measure of battery capacity, or a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 countdown?</li>
            <li> I considered the Braun average and Norelco have trouble with thicker hair around the mustache area.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts long as well (at least a week/charge).    </li>
            <li> As you can tell I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time and my hairs are thick.  </li>
            <li> so a 200.00 razor for me is kind of a bit insane, many moderate under 100 dollar razors are WORTHLESS!</li>
            <li> I have been a Fusin wet shave for fan for the past few years, but the blade cost seems to increase all the time while their usage decreases.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to keep my balance when I used a razor in the shower and on top of that the cost of the blades are getting very expensive.</li>
            <li> ; squirt a little hand soap on the head; turn it on; lather up; rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I said, a little niggle ... which says a lot for this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you can fix it up a little with this little powerhorse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic razors over the years, and in the early days, they would fail in less than a year.</li>
            <li> So far the only BAD thing that has happened, was that the trimmer part in the back has broken down on me.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a cap, charger, a few manuals, and a little traveling bag.</li>
            <li> I usually shave every other day, and tend to let the battery down to 60% before I fully charge it again, usually 2x a week.  </li>
            <li> This is THE design flaw that eventually killed the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews about this shaver and thought i&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li> A charge lasts about 10 days and recharges in just a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> $20 for the 4026 was a waste of money; $60 for this is money well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the ES7103K.</li>
            <li> I am returning this as soon as I return from my trip in a few days.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another Remington because, even though the three or so models I&#x27;ve had over the last few decades cut well, they got very noisy, and were poorly sealed between the cutting area and the motor/electronic parts.    </li>
            <li> It kept getting caught on my chin and mustache hairs and cut my face a few times.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a heavy duty electric razor, you would be well advised to pass this one up.</li>
            <li> he didn&#x27;t want to waste the money if he didn&#x27;t like it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> In the end, I wish I&#x27;d gone with the 7310XL: the wet/dry is not that big of a deal, and the inability to shave while the Panasonic is plugged in is irritating.      </li>
            <li> The side trimmer is so small it is not useful for much.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nicer if it displayed the numbers in intervals of 5, but that&#x27;s not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a shaver for less than 100 dollars and this is it ! ...</li>
            <li> Flexing head is so stiff it does not adjust to the surface of my face  </li>
            <li> It finally died (from me dropping it too often) and had some chipped teeth on the trimmer (not good!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite this item being fairly expensive, I am just unhappy enough with the overall experience that I will likely replace it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have real thick facial hair</li>
            <li> I can run this shaver over till it feels raw and</li>
            <li> Cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the cutting surfaces.  </li>
            <li> The plug itself is very tight, so it takes a bit of a force to detach the shaver from the charging cord.  </li>
            <li> I am very skeptical with all Panasonic shavers now, as long as they are staying with the traditional charging system design.</li>
            <li> Like I said, a little niggle ... which says a lot for this shaver!    </li>
            <li> Replace an expensive Braun shaver that suddenly quit.  </li>
            <li> Soon it began failing to fully charge and finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all, rendering the razor useless.</li>
            <li> and I have to buy the expensive aftershave products at 25-50 a bottle for daily razor</li>
            <li> No more nicks or cuts</li>
            <li> , sadly it gives almost the same shave</li>
            <li> This  is my opinion, if you are looking for an exspensive razor then I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one since it usually sells around 60 bucks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a must-have for a messy kid like my cousin!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the 30 degree blade or its power is the reason why the Panasonic get the closet shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for the past 24 years.</li>
            <li> I usually shave \\&quot;wet\\&quot; about once a week.</li>
            <li> the shaver itself is bulky and awkwardly shaped for a medicine closet or cabinet  - taking off the shaving block to dry after a wet shave makes for clutter in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would still say that the Panasonic still needs less than 2 passes per zone on the face, on average.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to tell by feeling my face because it is covered in shaving cream even after shaving.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge for close to a week and never gets dull.</li>
            <li> Take your hard earned money and buy one of their newer products instead which are quieter and provide a closer, sharper, finer shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves are at least as close as a blade without the bleeding.  </li>
            <li> So now I can even use standard 3-blade razors without cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I was doubtful that I would find, at a reasonable price, a shaver that would do the job.  </li>
            <li> The product is no better than the service behind it.</li>
            <li> I have struggled w/ Braun shavers for some years and been frustrated with their poor engineering which makes you buy new foil heads - rather expensive - every time they fail to seat on the razor properly, so you end up shaving w/ both hands(one to hold the head</li>
            <li> I know foil shavers are supposed to be louder than rotary, and it&#x27;s not extremely loud, but it&#x27;s a little annoying for me.</li>
            <li> Not good when you are trying to get out the door to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Electric Shaver has the Cutting Blade at a 30 degree angle, and a speed of 10K RPM which compare to other shaves it&#x27;s not a speed racer yet this formula seem to be the ticket!.</li>
            <li> If you have a particularly tough beard</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t tackle tough beards - it snags you, doesn&#x27;t shave well and irritates skin.</li>
            <li> I will just buy a product that has service behind it instead.</li>
            <li> One of the worse shavers I ever used.    </li>
            <li> I decided to buy an electric razor because I got tired of spending $10+ on a pack of razors.  </li>
            <li> I hate this big harvesters...</li>
            <li> The bad news is that the batteries lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> Assuming the battery/electronics compartment has a watertight seal (which looks well sealed to my eyes), both the prongs for the power cord and 2 other holes at the base of the shaver are the weak points.    </li>
            <li> this is not a good product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it got dropped and broken, and I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of buying expensive gillette blades</li>
            <li> This fails on both points.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Panasonic</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> After just 16 months of use, the battery failed.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when you shave the hairs seem to end up on your shirt or chest rather than in the head of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry panasonic, just the truth.      </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with a Panasonic wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic beats any of them and isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> Amazon can do know wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to return this.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have to recommend trying another shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 6 months and find it does a mediocre job.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and thought I was upgrading, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> , those just look weird and feel weird (just in my opinion)  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think at this time this model by Panasonic is no longer in production</li>
            <li> the part that flips up is useless..</li>
            <li> cause my boyfriend is very tough on his stuff.</li>
            <li> From a die hard Braun fan, take it from me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more bad shaves on the neck line for him, this one covers it all!    </li>
            <li> When the batteries fail it will be worthless.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> so when it went bad</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Im really disappointed and will be calling Panasonic for a refund.</li>
            <li> but I hate using them because I have a couple of birth marks on my face</li>
            <li> They had to make it idiot proof so someone doesn&#x27;t try to shave with it in the tub and turn themselves into a crispy critter.  </li>
            <li> I hate to shave and this makes it a pleasure; done in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Looking at the base where the power cord plugs in, there was rust like substance.</li>
            <li> Panasonic head pivot side to side, horizontally, that doesn&#x27;t lose power from the base motor.  </li>
            <li> Braun head pivot vertically closer to the face, but comparably to a non-pivot head, it seem to lost power from the base motor in the design.  </li>
            <li> and they were worthless.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purcahse.</li>
            <li> That thing was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been very happy with the Panasonic shaver. It&#x27;s the first submersible I&#x27;ve owned, which is REALLY nice. I won&#x27;t be going back to a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; razor. Does a good job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric shaver for about 40 years  and this is the best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very close shave good battery life.  My purchase through  Amazon.com was as good as ever, very quick and free  delivery.</li>
            <li> Although this has some positives (e.g. its LCD display &amp; pop up trimmer), the main point of an electric shaver is to provide a smooth shave quickly.  This fails on both points.  To get a smooth finish, I have to go over spots two or three times!  Having to go over a spot more than once wastes time.  Sorry Panasonic this is not a good product!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my son&#x27;s Braun shaver. I have had no complaints from him and he liked that is was a wet/dry shaver. It is heavier than his previous shaver.  This came very quickly (I shipped it to his dorm). No complaints from him.</li>
            <li> I am one who has owned electric razors all my life (especially Norelco) and this is the first electric razor I have ever owned that I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed a blade shave to finish everything off after shaving with the electric.  I have to say that it takes more than a swipe or two to get a very clean shave, but that said, I have been able to get a terrific, close shave (almost indistinguishable from that of a blade shave) every time with this razor, which I find amazing.  Also, unlike others who didn&#x27;t think that the razor did well trimming and shaping the beard, mustache or sideburns, I have found that it works very well on those areas, even without using the \\&quot;trimmer blade.\\&quot;  I do wish, however, that you could use this razor while plugged in, but that is only a minor inconvenience for me.  In addition, the battery life isn&#x27;t all that great, but for me it isn&#x27;t a big deal.  I would really recommend this razor and the price is great also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric after 20 years of blades. Really no negatives to it from my standpoint. Cuts well on short hairs, skip a day or two and you are going to need quite a bit of effort getting cleaned back up. If you shave 1-2 times a day it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have used the shaver almost every day for a month. I had been using a safety razor for a couple of years, so I may be over critical about the closeness of the shave.  I expected to get a closer shave without so many strokes over the same areas.  It is satisfactory, but not noteworthy, in closeness.  The feel is excellent, easy to handle and work into tight areas.  The trimmer does a good job, but it could be a bit wider.  I get seven or eight shaves between charges, and I have never had the battery run completely down.  The battery charge indicator is very reliable. When it shows \\&quot;O\\&quot; charge, I know I can get at least one more shave without recharging.  The recharge time is short.  Overall, I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a \\&quot;backup\\&quot; and for the trimmer.  It works great.  Don&#x27;t know what it would be like for the main razor as I use a regular blade, but for trimming and getting those spots I missed, it works well.  Holds a charge well.  But then again, I only use it for 30 sec per day.</li>
            <li> Replace an expensive Braun shaver that suddenly quit.  This shaves nice and smooth, smoother than the old Braun, even with new blades, it balances and feels natural. The trimmer is narrower than I am used to, the only thing I would change.  Makes keeping a straight \\&quot;stash\\&quot; more of a challenge.  I am happy with the shaver overall, and would buy it again, a bargain.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for over 30 years. I have used Remington, Braun, Norelco and others...with both standard and rotary blades. I recently purchased this Panasonic from Amazon. It gives a very smooth and close shave. I rate it superior to any I have used before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor and used it only intermittantly for a few months. Soon it began failing to fully charge and finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all, rendering the razor useless. I expected more for a razor of this value and won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give this 4 and a half stars, but I can&#x27;t give it only 4. As a shaver, this thing is on par with the Norelco shavers that cost $130. The trimmer is AWFUL, but if you use a straight blade on the bottom of your neck, the bottom being where you can just splash a little water on it and straight blade it, you&#x27;ll end up with a good shave and save a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically, this is a nice razor. Comfortable to hold, etc. But I got a nice, close shave only for a couple of months, then the blades wore out. I never did see any difference between wet or dry shaving either.     It costs about $35 to replace the blades and screen -- not worth it. I&#x27;m back to using a manual razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered a man&#x27; s razor thinking it will be better for women&#x27;s legs but I was wrong. It didn&#x27;t cut the hair on my legs and when I tried it in the shower it got extremely hot. The trimmer did work but it will take too long to shave legs with a trimmer :)</li>
            <li> This shaves very well, and works exactly as I would expect. The only surprise was that you can not shave while charging, not a problem for me as I&#x27;ll keep it charged up. I would recommend this shaver if your looking for a good shaver that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> This is the first dedicated electric razor I have purchased, outside of smaller trimmers, and I am very happy with it.   I just got it today and used it out of the box and the shave I got was great.  I don&#x27;t have real thick facial hair so it might just be me, but I am happy with it.  Can I get closer with a razor?  Maybe, but I hate using them because I have a couple of birth marks on my face and I always have to be careful shaving around them.  With this I shaved dry and I have no problems at all.  Again I have nothing to compare it to, but for the price I think this is a great razor and I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tried a host of products, I have used an electric razor off and on for the last 12 years.  I was doubtful that I would find, at a reasonable price, a shaver that would do the job.  I decided that I would try to find one that would work and after reading reviews and counting the money I had available, I bought the Panasonic.  Wow, what a pleasant surprise to find that this shaver really works.  I have had it for about 2 months and from the beginning it did the job.  Thank you Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I owned an older Panasonic electric shaver with induction charging.  When the older one eventually got old and looked a little dirty, i bought this one.  Much to my disappoint upon receiving, I found this charger doesn&#x27;t have induction charging, instead it has a traditional plug with two prongs.  This is THE design flaw that eventually killed the shaver.  The plug itself is very tight, so it takes a bit of a force to detach the shaver from the charging cord.  I guess this yanking action somehow loosened the water-proofing around the battery compartment.  After just 16 months of use, the battery failed.  I opened the shaver and found an leaking battery, and lots of water deposits inside the shaver. (I&#x27;ll try to upload some photos soon).  I am very skeptical with all Panasonic shavers now, as long as they are staying with the traditional charging system design.</li>
            <li> Although it may not be very powerful, but it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me. The only drawback is that although it has an LED screen for showing the battery, but it could show only 5 levels: 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%. Why bother to have a screen!</li>
            <li> Just got this razor.  Have had 2 Norleco&#x27;s previously, but this razor gave me the closet shave I have ever had since using a razor.  My neck has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a clean close shave.  Always good, but best if done wet.  Easy to clean after every shave. I like the size, NOT easy to loose grip on because it is larger than the last one I had.</li>
            <li> This shaver is heavier than the Norelco triple rotor heads. It compares unfavorably in several other ways;  1) Charge doesn&#x27;t last as long  2) Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close  3) Flexing head is so stiff it does not adjust to the surface of my face  The head does, however, clean more easily than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have owned Remingtons, Norelcos, and Brauns.  This is the easiest, closest shave I have ever gotten. I always have stray hairs that I need to use the trimmer for and I don&#x27;t have that problem with this shaver. It gets every hair on your face within two passes.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a nice shaver, but it quit working a few months after purchase. When I contacted Panasonic, they replied that I would have to ship it to them, and after 2 weeks they would let me know if they will cover it under warranty. It&#x27;s only a few months old!! What am I supposed to do about shaving for 2 weeks? Use a blade? I will just buy a product that has service behind it instead. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The product is no better than the service behind it. Panasonic doesn&#x27;t have it together.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve used that gives a really close shave-and it does it in half the time of others! This razor actually shaves as close as a safety razor. Definately the best I&#x27;ve ever used and the price is low.</li>
            <li> For $50, this is a good buy.  It shaves closer and more quickly than my old Braun Ultraspeed, and I can wash it out.  The third blade on this model is the center slit blade, which cuts longer hairs and hairs that lay flat against the skin.  For my beard, this is an important improvement over cheaper 2-blade models.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver. I am very happy with the results.. gives a close shave with no problems have had it for a couple of months now and am very happy with it. I have not tried it in the shower. Dont use Lectric Shave. just wash my face and leave it wet.. then shave. As posted before.. recharge good for about 4 to 5 shaves. It is easy to clean and works great for my ear and nose hair with the pop up shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a triple rotating head Norelco electric razor for years and, while I liked the convenience, it never really shaved very close. Frequently I ended up shaving twice a day and never felt that \\&quot;razor blade smooth\\&quot; feel. When contemplating whether to purchase a new shaver head or a new electric shaver I opted for the latter based on the reviews I read.      I have had my new Panasonic electric razor for 3 weeks now and regret not having purchased it years ago. This is an excellent product and I hope it will serve me well for years to come.</li>
            <li> Had an original Wet/Dry Shaver for more than 15 years...it was about time to buy a new one.  Checked many products online and in stores but felt Panasonic was a better choice.  Found best price in Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver due to its low price and decent spec&#x27;s. When it arrived I figure I&#x27;d get a few months worth of usage and off to the garbage. I had gotten really tired of my older Remington Rotary leaving my face with razor burn and I considered a Foil Shaver this time might help? Well, the day I first used it I was left in complete amazement, it was actually a pleasure to shave and not have any irritation on my neck or the red blotches that accompanied my former shaves. This Electric Shaver has the Cutting Blade at a 30 degree angle, and a speed of 10K RPM which compare to other shaves it&#x27;s not a speed racer yet this formula seem to be the ticket!. It is also a wet/dry shaver, meaning it could be used while in the shower. I am willing to venture and say that the slower speed and the angle of the blades are the contributing factor in my complete satisfaction with this Panasonic Shaver. The shaves are really close and although no electric shaver will completely match a razor blades shave, it does a fantastic job good enough to step outside looking clean shaven and fresh, you&#x27;ll find yourself shaving so much more that the wife will start to wonder what&#x27;s going on? I&#x27;ve even planned on purchasing a second unit as a backup since the price is right and it would be a better investment then purchasing the foil and blade replacement. Lets face it, (pun intended) when you look good you&#x27;ll actually start feeling good specially when the feedback form your viewers is positive due to your representation. You gonna Love it! UPDATE: Here it is 2/27/17 and I just bought a replacement Foil &amp; Blade, this is probably my 4th time replacing these 2 items and this shaver is still kicking. The replacement cost $40.69, which means it&#x27;s the last replacement I&#x27;ll purchase since the up keep is cost about the same as the shaver, it&#x27;s time to throw in a few bucks and get a new unit. This was my first Panasonic Shaver and about 2 years later I purchase the ES8103S Arc3, which was a step up andmy most used razor. I eventually lost it and ole faithful filled in the gap, again. Any electric shaver I will buy will always be a Panasonic, and after all these years it has performed flawlessly and to my expectations. BTW it even outlasted the 2nd wife! You gonna Love Panasonic Shavers dedication to keeping you looking Great!</li>
            <li> January 16, 2009&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic, to start it off is my favorite appliance and electronic company. I find that their products are so immaculately engineered and durable that I still own them from the stone age and after 15 years a TV is brand new in theory. In the last twenty years I have bought every electric shaver in sight, always returning to the latest hoo hah version of blade shaving and quirky foam cream that ended up with a closer shave (that method actually severs a layer of skin) and a lot of shekels for replacement blades and said foam cream. I was always painted into a corner until I purchased the Panasonic shaver depicted and predictably experienced an equal quality shave as compared to the blade. Remember that old joke, it&#x27;s not the razor, it&#x27;s the blades. Today that statement represents a serious matter because shaving with a blade scenario is very costly. Now I have, with this shaver a cost effective method of achieving the result I need and want.&lt;br /&gt;jay adler music</li>
            <li> After a lot of research and reading tons of reviews, I ended up purchasing this shaver. I was a Braun user for the last 15 years. My last Braun was a Syncro 7505 and it was great. Now I needed a replacement for my workhorse but when I looked at Braun, I noticed that they forgot about those on a limited budget. The series 1 Braun, I learned was garbage and has one head. I looked at the Wahl as well but did not like the fact that people rated it as having flimsy construction. This Panasonic for the price is awesome. The shave is super close, the noise level is par with my old Braun and it&#x27;s construction is rock solid. From now on, I&#x27;m going with Panasonic. They have a huge selection of shavers for all budgets that are high quality. I won&#x27;t be wet shaving so i can&#x27;t review that part. I&#x27;m strictly a dry shaver. From a die hard Braun fan, take it from me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. This shaver is worth every penny.  UPDATE: 02/12/10:  I Tried the wet shave with lather. Where have I been all these years. Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, period! Super close, comfortable and smooth. Now I will definitely stick with panasonic forever. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I switched from an old Remington.  This razor is great so far.  Close shaves for an electric and keeps a solid charge for a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and have charged it twice.  Solid razor.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Razor produces a close, smooth shave and charges quite quickly.  I believe it is a good purchase for under $50 and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This razor was purchased as a gift for my son. He has said that this is the closest shave he has ever had. It is easy to use and cleanup is exceptional. The reviews I read led me to this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic ES-7103 for about one year now and really like the design and the price. The good news is that it gives a great shave. The bad news is that the batteries lasted less than a year. Also expect to replace both the inner and outer blades at about eight months. Even so, it&#x27;s still not a bad deal for the price.    When it came time to replace it, I decided to give a higher-end Norelco a try. Too bad, since I really liked this shaver.</li>
            <li> i purchased this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it! it works great! i have never bought one of these so i wanted to find the best one and it is so far! a perfect gift for a boyfriend,husband, or father!</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower to get a close but comfortable shave. When the switch on my Norelco went out, I looked around and found this for less than half the price of a rotary. It shaves just as close and is not noisy like some reciprocating shavers. I get about 12 shaves on a charge and the charge meter is helpful although I get two or three more shaves after the meter is on zero! Kinda like some gas gauges that will go 50 miles on \\&quot;empty\\&quot;. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I used a Remington before buying the Panasonic.  This shaver does a pretty good job for the money and in comparison to my Remington.  The battery life is very good.  One of the things I wish it had was a wider trimming blade like my Remington had.  We&#x27;ll see how good the longevity is once I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought my son the next higher level one about a year ago. He loves it. I tried it and it worked well. This is pretty much the same razor as my son&#x27;s. Seems to have the same blades/foil, just a feature or two different, but it works real well in the shower or dry. Not blade close, but none are. easy to clean.  Great value. Spent almost $100 on son&#x27;s, this is a great deal, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My last Razor was a similar Panasonic I bought about 5 years ago.  It finally died (from me dropping it too often) and had some chipped teeth on the trimmer (not good!), so I was up for a new one and went with Panasonic again.  This one looks similar in shape but a different colour.  The trimmer is better on this one, but not as wide so doesn&#x27;t cover as much area.  The shave I get from this is not quite as good as with my last one.  It seems as though it just takes longer to get a complete shave.  In the end it is a smooth shave after all, so that&#x27;s the most important thing.  I also don&#x27;t shave everyday so it might be too much for this shaver.  Anyway, a perfectly acceptable razor for the $50.xx price range.  I was not willing to fork over more for a razor that may have been a bit better.   Solid 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He has sensitive skin and could not find a nice razor to shave effectively.  He loves it.  The cord and charge are nice features.  It always shaves closely.  Very happy with the purchase.  Plus, while ordering right before Christmas, we received the shipment promptly with no extra shipping charge.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a shaver for less than 100 dollars and this is it ! ... by far the best shaver i ever going to get for this price. battery life if amazing just one charge last for many days ( in my case )... it feels good in your hand and it is also very easy to clean.  so if you are looking for your first shaver this is the one.  just one thing, like every single shaver it takes time to get used to.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews about this shaver and thought i&#x27;d try it out. I&#x27;ve had it about 6 months, I think, and so far I really like it, works a lot better than my last razor and the trimmer is a very nice addition. The shaver gets really close and I havent even tried the wet shave yet. The trimmer gets a lot closer than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used as well.    Overall very happy with it. I give it 5 stars even though I can&#x27;t get my neck hair with it, but it&#x27;s not as thick as the rest of my facial hair, and no other shaver has been able to get it either so I don&#x27;t want to knock off a star for that. I just use a razor on it.    The charge lasts quite a while too, it looks nice, and works well. Nothing else I could need in a shaver.</li>
            <li> I decided to give an electric shaver a go, after so many years between my last attempt.  The razor burn from my previous cheap electric shaver was too much for me to handle.  So I went the route of the mach 3 for many years, but was subject to cuts and bleeding.  To minimize that, I had to spend a long time in the shower and use The Shaving Co gel for sensitive skin just to have a smooth shave.  Spending half an hour or longer in the shower was taking its toll in the mornings. So I bought this to save time.       I continue to use my shaving gel with this electric shaver making this the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Mind you I can&#x27;t compare to the expensive modern electric shavers, just to the mach 3.  The top of the lip and the buccal surfaces were smoother than a blade.  To be honest, those areas were impossible to go against the grain because they were so sensitive and that is even with a fresh blade. As you can tell I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time and my hairs are thick.  With this razor, its so comfortable and leaves no burn.       My neck area does sometimes have patches of stubble but it requires many repeated going overs to ensure they&#x27;re gone.  That&#x27;s really the time consuming part of the process. If not for that, I would shave in about 2 minutes time and look great.  The neck area, because of the many directions of hair growth, I have to use a circular motion for an extra 3-4 minutes.  Total shave time is really about 5-6 minutes. beats half an hour in the shower and thus made this product worth it for me.       Also note that the third blade is on the foil, so one should replace the foil in addition to the two blades after a years use.  Add that to the cost when you compare prices to disposable blades.</li>
            <li> This is about the sixth electric shaver I have owned, and the first Panasonic.  I purchased it in the hope that it would be more durable than the previous two shavers I owned, both Brauns.  Although the Braun shavers performed very well, they were very expensive and extremely fragile.  The last one (and most expensive) began falling apart after just a few months.      I purchased this shaver because Panasonic products are generally very durable, even if not the best performers.  I was also drawn in by many favorable reviews of this product here.    After several months of regular use, I must say that the shaver is about as good as the best I have owned.  At least as importantly, it is still in perfect condition in all respects.    The following items are minor irritants that should not deter you from buying:    1) Sideburn trimmer does not function as well as others I have used.    2) Shaver can not be used while plugged in for charging.    3) Battery does not seem to be replaceable...still going strong, but how long will it last?</li>
            <li> Seems most things are made to be disposable now, and this is no exception.  It&#x27;s easy to find this baby on sale for $50--so don&#x27;t pay more than that--but remember that in less than a year, you will have to replace the blades.  And they will cost you about 70% of the cost of the razor.  Which is why people throw it away and buy whatever is on sale.    Does it shave well?  That&#x27;s always relative.  It&#x27;s great wet or dry.  But I&#x27;ve had a Remington F4790 that I think does a better job. It&#x27;s cheaper, and the replacement blades are only 40% of the cost of a new razor.    If you&#x27;re thinking about switching from a blade to an electric razor, don&#x27;t expect ANY electric razor to give you the same shave as a blade.  Just won&#x27;t happen.  I don&#x27;t have a coarse beard and don&#x27;t get an especially smooth shave, so if you have a coarse beard, I&#x27;m not sure you would be happy with any electric razor.    I will say this razor goes a long time on a charge and has a good charge indicator.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and works great on chin/cheeks/jawbone area!  Has a harder time shaving the neck area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco, Braun and now Panasonic electric shavers. If money is no object, the Braun Series 7 electric shaver is by far the smoothest and closest shave.    But money is an object that most of us lack, including myself.    Which is why I sold that Braun to a friend. I then went and purchased a Norelco $50 shaver, and was astounded at how crappy it was and immediately returned it. The next thing I bought was a $50 Braun Series 3. It was ok, but really nothing compared to the higher series Brauns -- I don&#x27;t understand how one company accomplishes making different levels of quality product except that they do it on purpose.    I lost the cord for the Braun Series 3 and a replacement cord is $25...so I thought forget it, let&#x27;s try a Panasonic. Why? Because I read so many great reviews on Amazon.    Which brings me to the Panasonic E7103. This is by far, the best electric shaver you can buy under $200...and it only costs $49.99 on amazon, or $44.99 at Fry&#x27;s Electronics (if you live on the West coast). It gives me a shave that is just as close as a Braun Series 7, but requires sometimes a couple more passes than the Series 7. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would still say that the Panasonic still needs less than 2 passes per zone on the face, on average. The Braun series 7 (a $230 shaver) would need a little more than one pass per zone. However, the extra time spent shaving is negligible, and overall, the shave quality ends up being the same.    Cleaning the Panasonic is cake. It pops open easily and has very accessible and open heads for cleaning. Make sure you buy/own a tiny brush for cleaning your razor. Another great feature is the LCD readout with the battery level. I know if I need to charge it right before travelling. It also has the detailing shaver that pops out for doing edging and sideburns. The head looks flat like a Braun, but unlike the lower series Brauns of the same price range, this Panasonic has a head that articulates in every direction and contours myface very well.    Excellent asset to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, smooth shave.  Quick to charge.  Easy to clean.  I dig it.    Only minus, the thing doesn&#x27;t work if it&#x27;s plugged in.  Strange, but not something you&#x27;d encounter often if you look at the battery meter to make sure it never goes to 0%.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the money, It does everything it says it will.  I don&#x27;t buy into the wet shave with an electric razor theory so I can&#x27;t comment on that. The razor holds the charge well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I bought a refurbed Panasonic 7037 and really liked it. After a few months the off/on switch broke and I was very dissapointed. However, the shave with that razor was so good, I looked at getting another Panasonic. I do not wish to spend 150-200 bones on a razor. That&#x27;s just me. This razor is a very fine product in the acceptable $50 range.    Some background---I shave my face and head every day. I have a tough beard and it grows fast. I could shave twice a day the way it grows.     I enjoy a nice shave and I don&#x27;t like beards or stubble. My favorite shaving implements are my Norelco 7xxxx series (used with Nivea Shave Conditioner or Afta Pre Shave) and this Panasonic. Used wet, dry or with a preshave this item gives a great shave. I have a very sensitive neck and this shaver does not cause those embarrasing red streaks of irritation. Also my head has no ingrown hairs when I use it. I also clean my razor heads out almost daily to prolong the life of the cutters.    Over the years I have collected a Norelco corded 4xxx series, a Headblade, Atra, Mach 3, Sensor, Tracer and Schick Hydro, and of all the shaving items I have the ones I use most is: the Panasonic, followed by the Norelco and then the Hydro as a change of pace.        You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a fan and user solely of electric shavers as regular shaving gives me razor burn and I have to buy the expensive aftershave products at 25-50 a bottle for daily razor burn reduction. I have had a braun before and they are nice but in 2 or 3 years u have to replace them so a 200.00 razor for me is kind of a bit insane, many moderate under 100 dollar razors are WORTHLESS! This is a Keeper, works great, VERY POWERFUL, will be a panasonic electric shaving customer for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have been a Fusin wet shave for fan for the past few years, but the blade cost seems to increase all the time while their usage decreases.  I had tried over the years several electric shavers, but always my skin was left red and somewhat raw, meaning i could not possibly use them beyond a week.  so far i have being using ES7103K for almost 5 weeks and my skin is never red, not has it tended to become raw.  My experience is the shaver is now pretty close to giving a smooth shave.  No more nicks or cuts and i feel presentable after my morning shave.</li>
            <li> I still get a few razor bumps but the shaver is great I really can&#x27;t complain and the price is great too. Good seller by the way, i would recommend the seller and the product too.</li>
            <li> This is a decent option at this price point.  It takes a long time to get a decent shave; probably 20 minutes.  It will hold a charge for about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  It cleans well under running water.  I have had mine for about 2 years and the battery seems to be holding up well, as is the hardware.  Unfortunately, when you shave the hairs seem to end up on your shirt or chest rather than in the head of the shaver.  It does not work well with longer hairs, which is typical of foil shavers.  It doesn&#x27;t work wet in my opinion which was my original desire, although now I don&#x27;t care.  If you don&#x27;t shave often and want a cleaner solution, take a look at a Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li> I chose this one mostly due to the fact it also has the trimmer and the price was right. As this is my first electric I cannot compare it to others. I am not overly imprssed but it does the job when I don&#x27;t want to take the time and effort to use a blade shaver. It is certainly not as close of a shave by far, but it does okay and the trimmer works very well.  The best thing a can say about it is that it&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> My son loves the razor and the company shipped it out quickly in time for Christmas. Thank you</li>
            <li> One of the best buys I have purchased, in the past. Have to move the shaver in several directions for my beard. The shaver works better with a pre-shave lotion. Get about 10-12 shaves per charge.-</li>
            <li> This is a quality product! Shaves close and easy to clean! The only fault is the battery-life --it discharges sooner than the owner&#x27;s manual says it should! I&#x27;ll order a new \\&quot;screen\\&quot;, soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a Gold Box special...assuming it would be my travel shaver. That was until I tried it. This thing blows my fancy Braun with a fancy cleaning unit OUT OF THE WATER.     This thing shaves so close my skin felt senitive for the first time in years. It wasnt used to being cut so close cause its been so long!!! My wife could feel the difference, hands down...or hands on! Ha ha.    Build materials are on the cheap end, but this device just works. I&#x27;d have no problem buying an all new unit every year if it happens to break. Its that good and priced that well.</li>
            <li> Okay razor, I expected more, have a small Panasonic travel electric razor and when it was new gave me great shaves, but after three years it is starting to dull so I bought this new one, sadly it gives almost the same shave my 3 year old razor does, but no cuts and I haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving because my other razor cut me when I did.  Blades almost seem slower than my travel razor.  It also discharges very quickly, have to charge after one to two uses.  My travel razor used two rechargeable AA batts, and I only charged them once every four or five days(hooray for Duracel).</li>
            <li> 1. NO Razor burn    2. Close as a blade    what else could you possibly want?  This is the first shaver, electric or blade that i have used that did NOT give me a razor burn.  I have used several Norelco electric shavers over the years.  I have also used several Gillette shavers from 2 bladed to 4.  I have used Schick&#x27;s blade shavers.  I had given up hope for a shaver that would not give me razor burn.    Thankfully I was wrong.  I got this panasonic shaver several days ago and it is fantabulous.  Did I mention, NO razor burn?  and shaves as close as a blade?  I suggest you try it yourself.  Buy it from a local store if you don&#x27;t want to take the chance that you might have to ship it back.  Then return it and get it from Amazon once you decide that it is for you.    For the people that keep wondering why it won&#x27;t let you shave while plugged in, I only have 2 words for you...WET/DRY.    They had to make it idiot proof so someone doesn&#x27;t try to shave with it in the tub and turn themselves into a crispy critter.  Panasonic then would have to spend millions defending themselves and in the end would lose.  They would then have to spend millions more in payout to the idiot&#x27;s family and then have to make it non usable while plugged in.  Someone intelligent at Panasonic decided to save a few million dollars and make it the way it has to be in our legal system.    Yes, they should be able to put in a disclaimer and tell the user not to use it plugged in where it could drop into water and fry themselves but the courts have decreed that that is not good enough.  I hope this explains why you will never see a panasonic WET/DRY shaver that can be used plugged in.  maybe in Japan?    Go buy one now if you don&#x27;t like razor burns and like close shaves.    I have not tried the higher end one because I don&#x27;t have the money to buy it.  I will say that this is a damn good razor.  I simply can&#x27;t see how Panasonic could possibly improve this shaver so much that it would be worth paying 3times more.  You could buy 3 of these at that price.  Sorry panasonic, just the truth.      Edit: 9/19/2010  (added 2 weeks later)    Thought I would give feedback after using this shaver for 2 weeks.  I still highly recommend this.  No razor burn at all, not even once.  You can hear it cut hair so run it over your face slowly and move it back and forth until you don&#x27;t hear the hair being cut anymore.  I found it hard to tell by feeling my face because it is covered in shaving cream even after shaving.  You can find spots that you miss with your hands but you will need to listen to get a smooth even shave.  I suggest you hide this from your S/O or it will be used!</li>
            <li> I had an older model and the flip up shaver finally broke after 10 years.  This one is even better because it curves to your face, it&#x27;s quiet and gets a close shave!</li>
            <li> It works, just as described by it&#x27;s manufacturer; and, meets my needs for having this kind of a shaver. With my use, the battery stays charged for a large number of shaves, is re-charged very papidly when I have to do so; and, I like the percentage status display of remaining battery power between charges.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this product -- it fits well in my hand and feels well-made. I also finding cleaning it quite easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as someone with only light facial hair growth I do not find this shaver gives me a good, smooth shave when used dry. I find myself going over my face multiple times to get a satisfactory shave. If I use it wet, it works much better -- but I bought it to use dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying aspect of the shaver is its power management. On the one hand, you can&#x27;t use it while it is plugged in. On the other hand, the LCD display of remaining power is (in my experience, at least) a complete fiction. I routinely turn the shaver on when it is displaying \\&quot;60%\\&quot; only to have the motor not start and the display to then read \\&quot;0%\\&quot;. Not good when you are trying to get out the door to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this item being fairly expensive, I am just unhappy enough with the overall experience that I will likely replace it. I actually  like my old, battery-powered, dry-shave Braun travel shaver a lot better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve since bought another (Norelco PT730/41) shaver that works much better for me: I can get a closer shave and more quickly, the battery lasts at least three times longer than the Panasonic, it is noticeably lighter in my hand, it is significantly quieter. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do is wet shaving, but I never used that Panasonic feature anyway.</li>
            <li> Have had 3 Norelco&#x27;s before, including 2 of the ones that have lotion inside of them and this Panasonic is by far the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric.  No razor burn, even the first time I used it.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> this razor is very nice. it has helped me on my search to be clean and polished. and being polite too! taking care of yourself and grooming yourself properly helps you find reason in life. sometimes it can get pretty difficult when you have a beard. jesus had a beard but having no hairs on my body (yes, i did down there too if you&#x27;re wondering) helped me find god. and panasonic wet and dry is god on spring break.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver in the shower - it work great! A charge lasts about 10 days and recharges in just a few hours.  I used to shave with a razor and it did take a little more than a week to really get proficient at getting a close shave, but I don&#x27;t miss the nicks and cuts.  I \\&quot;lubricate\\&quot; my face with a dab of shower gel first and then shave (it really smooths out the shave).  When I&#x27;m done, I pop the top off and clean the blades and foil while still in the shower.  A really great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my Dad who decided to switch to electric shaving at age 97!  It works really great for him: shaves beautifully and is well designed.  You will not be disappointed with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shaver works pretty well. It still doesn&#x27;t shave my neck very well but I can get it after awhile. I have no problem with the charger having to be not plugged in to use it. Get this shaver if you want an affordable electric shaver. If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect shaver though, then you might want to go with something more expensive. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for at least a month and it is the second electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned. My previous shaver was a Series 3 370 Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of electric shavers over the years including, most recently, a popular consumer magagzine&#x27;s \\&quot;best buy\\&quot; which turned out to be anything but; noisy, horrible shave, missed spots, etc.  So, hesitant to replace that disaster with another one, I was extra cautious, but what sold me on the Panasonic ES7103K was the outstanding Amazon.com customer reviews.    This is the best electric shaver that I have every used . . . at any price.  Not only do I get quick, efficient, close shaves, but the shaver is exceptionally quiet, holds a charge for a long time (haven&#x27;t measured it yet in days), and is comfortable in my hand and on my face.    On top of all that, the price is right.    Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The only reason I tried it was because my Norelco battery was dying, so I thought I would give the Panasonic a try--based on the reviews.  After two weeks of use, the Panasonic is in the trash and I&#x27;m back with my dying Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for shaving in the shower.  It has a life of at least 3-4 years, a long time for daily shower use, keeps it&#x27;s charge for close to a week and never gets dull.</li>
            <li> Have used Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers for almost a decade. They last two years, and then get dull.  Cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the cutting surfaces.  This time instead of $30 I bought the $50 one.  Shaves well with foam. Charges in an hour.  A charge lasts me a week plus. Shaves are at least as close as a blade without the bleeding.  I&#x27;ll keep going with Panasonic Wet/Dry&#x27;s (don&#x27;t get one that&#x27;s just rinse-able - get one you can use in the shower.)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VKV28S Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black]]I like it. It is a bit bulky but gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li> I have struggled w/ Braun shavers for some years and been frustrated with their poor engineering which makes you buy new foil heads - rather expensive - every time they fail to seat on the razor properly, so you end up shaving w/ both hands(one to hold the head on)This razor is great &amp; the foil head FITS!  It also gets the unruly neck hairs that the Braun always missed - I&#x27;ll never go back and I&#x27;m so pleased and grateful to get a razor that works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 40 years and would consider the Panasonic ES7103 only average. I still believe the Braun&#x27;s are just better! The Panasonic just feels and sounds cheap. My Braun 5614 feels vastly superior in design and has been going strong for 6 years of hard labor on my tough whiskers. Overall I would rate the Panasonic comparable to something that Black and Decker would make in comparison to the Braun which would be closer to a Dewalt product - excuse the \\&quot;construction worker\\&quot; analogy but I think it fits.    I can&#x27;t even believe some of you guys complained that the Braun&#x27;s were too heavy - get some upper body strength dudes - I&#x27;m sure you have no problems holding a can of beer to your face!    In short the Panasonic feels like a toy, it does shave close, is a little cheaper than a comparable Braun but that is it IMO.</li>
            <li> At a young 59 years old my husband, was just diagnosed with a heart condition that requires him to be on a blood thinning prescription. His Cariologist informed us that he could no longer use disposable razors. He has to be extremely careful not to even get a \\&quot;Paper Cut\\&quot;. As it takes months to adjust the drugs to keep his blood at the thickness levels the Doctor wants, and he has a heavy beard growth, he couldn&#x27;t go without shaving. All the research I did before I purchased this razor for him was well worth the time spent. According to my husband it&#x27;s 100 times better than advertised. This razor gives as smooth a shave if not better than disposables and no knicks. In addition, it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain. We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the money.  I would recomend it to my friends.  It takes about 6 shaves for the head and cutters to wear in for maximum sharpness.</li>
            <li> This  is my opinion, if you are looking for an exspensive razor then I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one since it usually sells around 60 bucks. you can buy the braun shavers for 10 apeice and get 6 and they will work just as well. I haven&#x27;t looked into replacemnet parts, but I doubt they are cheap... I have only had my for a week so I cant tell you how long it last but it is made really well and is not cheaply made but not really needed for the price. Hope this helps...</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve bounced around and between different shaving methods - blades vs. electric; multi-blades vs single blade; rotary vs. straight. I always wanted to try a wet/dry shaver, and finally did so last year when I came across the Panasonic 4026 [[ASIN:B0001209OO Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve Rechargeable Double Blade Wet/Dry Men&#x27;s Shaver, Blue/Yellow]] at Best Buy for $20. Not to go into too much detail (you can read my 2 star review on that product page), but it was, in a word, disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I really liked the wet/dry concept, and went looking for a replacement. I needed to choose between a Braun and this ES7103K. I have to say, so far I am very, very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) It really works wet AND dry. With the 4026, it was impossible to shave dry, and wet really meant I had to lather my face with soap. This one works very well dry (for a quick touch-up) and GREAT wet, with or without soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Closer than a blade. I know this is a personal, subjective call, but to me, this absolutely shaves closer than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Long charge life - the old 4026 was good for maybe a week, TOPS. This one - I&#x27;ve gotten 3 weeks, MINIMUM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Easy Clean - wet the shaving head; squirt a little hand soap on the head; turn it on; lather up; rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The trimmer WORKS - not always the case for electric shavers. This one works great on sideburns, beard/moustache edges, and necks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Power meter - An easy to read DIGITAL battery gauge is in the handle, not a hard to see glow light. After three weeks, it went to \\&quot;00\\&quot; double zero, but still had plenty of juice to finish a shave. Most shavers I&#x27;ve had go flat as soon as the TIME TO CHARGE light comes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Quick Charge - 5 minute charge will give you enough juice to do a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;There really is only one con, and it&#x27;s more of a little annoyance than a deficiency. The battery gauge show a percent of charge left, but does it in 20% increments. So, it goes from 100, to 80, etc ... down to 20 then 00. The CHARGER warning starts to flash at 20%. Why not a true measure of battery capacity, or a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 countdown? Like I said, a little niggle ... which says a lot for this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $60 for this at Best Buy; you can get it here for approximately $45. That&#x27;s twice as much as the 4026. But, to me, this shaver is way more than twice or even three times as good. $20 for the 4026 was a waste of money; $60 for this is money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell if it is sturdier than my old 4026. If it is, I might come back and bump it up to a 5 star rating.n 00. The CHARGER warning starts to flash at 20%. Why not a true measure of battery capacity, or a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 countdown?

            <li> This shaver is awesome! The guy complaining about the service didn&#x27;t even use it right, I don&#x27;t know about the service (thank god!), but the shaver is excellent!   The shave is very close and it is easy to clean. I&#x27;m 35 and my beard is very thick, and this shaver is the best experience so far!    About the battery, the guy that said \\&quot;DOES NOT WORK WHILE PLUGGED IN!\\&quot; is correct and it may be a problem in the future when the battery need replacement.     I just don&#x27;t know how people can get cut with these kind of shavers, it is really a mystery... The only case where I got some irritation (and I have a sensitive skin) were when I shave a \\&quot;4-days\\&quot; growing beard, and it happened here and there feeling like the shaver was pulling some hairs.     There is no way to get \\&quot;cut\\&quot; since the blade is inside the shaver and it can&#x27;t be exposed, so you may only get these so-called \\&quot;cuts\\&quot; if you let your beard grow too much.</li>
            <li> What a great shaver. I had had a Panasonic before but I drop it and it was broke beyond repair. When I went to replace it couldn&#x27;t find any Panasonics in the small town that I live in so bought a Braun. That thing was awful. This Panasonic ES7103K is great. Quiet, powerful, close shave, goes much farther on a single charge and there is a small window that tell you how much of a charge you have left. I&#x27;ve not tried in the shower yet but can&#x27;t imagine that it would perform any less than when using it dry.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with a Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I have been using them for nine years now and would not use any other brand.</li>
            <li> If you are choosing between this shaver and the ES8103, go with the ES8103.  The ES7103K just does not have the power that you expect from a modern shaver.  It will take you twice as long to shave as it does with the ES8103.  The added power of the ES8103 also makes for a smoother shave.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the ES7103K.</li>
            <li> This shaver offers an excellent shave. It replaced this horribly cheap electric razor I got from Phillips Norelco. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like the Norelco did while still offering a good shave. The battery lasts about a week or two before a charge when used daily. The trimmer works well to keep my sideburns under control. I use it in the shower so it&#x27;s water proof enough.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the Panasonic shaver!  It is very easy to use and simple to clean.  It recharges very quickly and goes a long time before having to recharge it.  I really like the digital readout of what percent of battery is left!  I t does take a little getting used to since I have normally used a razor and shaving cream.  Only minor problem has been getting the area between jaw and neck (getting better at it, tho).  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my dad. He cannot say enough about the tremendous, close shave. Also, he finds the digital battery level display to be helpful in making sure he always has enough charge. It has versatile wet or dry shaving capabilities, with equally high quality results. Comfortable to use, easy to clean, happy to have.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from local Best Buy since I was traveling overseas and didn&#x27;t have time to get it shipped from online stores. I selected this product based on the positive reviews at this site, but I was totally disappointed with this first electric shaver of mine.  Even though they recommend that one try the new shaver for at least a month, five days were more than I could handle.  This new shaver left behind large patches of hair on my face in spite of multiple passes in all possible directions and sometimes shaving for ten minutes at a time! In short, it was a total disaster for me!   After five days, I had had enough and switched back to my Gillette Fusion and I realized how close and smooth it shaved!  This experience has completely turned me away from all electric shavers. I found the shaver to be quite bulky as well, but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  The battery held up well, though.  I am returning this as soon as I return from my trip in a few days.</li>
            <li> i have used this for a month now and am not wholly pleased.  It does shave close but takes twice as long as my old razor.  Would try something else.</li>
            <li> After trying and returning Norelco, I had Brauns, including the top of the line, for many years. This Panasonic beats any of them and isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> Wow, just got this shaver. Great out of the box. charge it up and go. I shave for less than 1 minute per day. Great clean shave and does not irritate the skin. Built really well and holds charge for along time. I use it dry so I dont know about wet shaving, etc. I would defintly buy this product again. I have had this shaver for two months and use it almost every day. Go for it at a great price. Amazon can do know wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned only rotary shavers before this one.  I purchased it based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation that a foil shaver gives a better shave, and I can honestly say it does!  This shaver lasted for about 2 years for me(I shave every day) before the battery finally died.  I was pretty happy with two years.  Once nice feature is that it has an LED showing how much of the battery is left.  I found this to be very helpful.  Sadly, I went cheap for my next razor, a Norelco rotary because it had good review, and it just doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable and get as close.  Once the Norelco finally dies, I&#x27;ll be back for a Panasonic foil razor.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my college-age cousin who decided to give up his beard and start shaving every day. :)  A month later he told me he absolutely loves this shaver.  It gives a smooth shave and is very easy to use.  No cuts, no missed spots.  He likes the popup trimmer, too.  The auto cleaning system is just pure genius -- it&#x27;s a must-have for a messy kid like my cousin!  I will buy another two as gifts for this Xmas.</li>
            <li> After many years of using Norelco, Remington, and Braun electric razors, I thought I&#x27;d try Panasonic when my previous razor&#x27;s battery died.  I found this razor to be quiet, easy to clean, comfortable, easy to hold (because of its shape), and very reasonably priced.  It&#x27;s one drawback is that it does not seem to cut as well as my previous Braun and Remington twin-head razors (which also cut much more efficiently than the Norelco rotaries).  I find that I have to keep going over the same areas, especially my neck, to get a smooth cut.  Nevertheless, because of the other positives mentioned, I probably will keep using this razor until it wears out.  I would recommend this razor if your priorities match the advantages i noted above.  perhaps you will find it cuts your beard better than mine, especially if your beard is pretty light.     If I had to do it all over again, I&#x27;d go back to a Braun twin-headed model, though a bit more expensive.  I will never buy another Remington because, even though the three or so models I&#x27;ve had over the last few decades cut well, they got very noisy, and were poorly sealed between the cutting area and the motor/electronic parts.    One other general comment, I&#x27;ve found that the twin-headed flexible blade razors do cut more effectively than the single-headed ones and are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This review is geared more toward those who don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis.     I switched from a Norelco after it broke and having read good reviews on the Panasonic. The Norelco beard trimmer was great for getting rid of a week&#x27;s worth of facial hair, which I could then follow with a close shave. Sometimes the beard trimmer component would serve as a consistent enough shave to leave a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow.     This model&#x27;s beard trimmer is totally ineffective. It kept getting caught on my chin and mustache hairs and cut my face a few times. The longer hairs that the trimmer missed were then missed by the regular shaver, though shorter hairs came off fine.     Unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to return this. Again I don&#x27;t speak on behalf of those who shave once or twice a day. But for those who like to keep a little bit of facial hair I unfortunately have to recommend trying another shaver.</li>
            <li> Does not shave my face. I bought this based on all the positive reviews (something that usually works well). Maybe the rest of the world has pansy whiskers or something because this this simply will not shave me clean. Wet, dry, in the shower, shaving cream, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially areas on my neck and under my chin. I can run this shaver over till it feels raw and the whiskers will still be there. I made the mistake of not returning right away, because for some reason I thought I would get it figured out. Didn&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s nicely designed and neat that you can use wet/dry, but don&#x27;t expect it to give you a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the lions share of review are positive. I don;t know why. If you must try this shaver, send it back immediately if you don&#x27;t love it. Don&#x27;t get stuck with it like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 2 years now.  I would say that it shaves very close.  I have only used it dry.  Never really trusted the razor to wet it.  The charge has hold up fine.  I usually shave every other day, and tend to let the battery down to 60% before I fully charge it again, usually 2x a week.  Since I never wet the razor nor the blades, I&#x27;ve never had to replace the foil nor the blades.  So far the only BAD thing that has happened, was that the trimmer part in the back has broken down on me.  But if I remember correctly that was actually an accident, the trimmer part was open and it fell out of my hand, and it broke.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recomend this product for the Price, and Durability, I would also advise anyone that if you do want to use this product wet and in the shower, just be prepared to buy new blades down the line.  Otherwise if you only use the razor dry, the blades should last at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> For the cost, I found this shaver to be as good as the $140 Panasonic model I bought a couple of years ago. I don&#x27;t like shaving, but Panasonic so far is the best brand I&#x27;ve found for my beard. I haven&#x27;t found the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; shaver, and it might not exist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pleased with this brand of shaver.  I use them until they die in 5-7 years, much better life than the Remington&#x27;s I used to have.  I never would buy a \\&quot;dry only\\&quot; shaver again.  The battery status indicator is helpful in deciding when to charge it, especially if I&#x27;m going on an overnighter and don&#x27;t want to bother charging it at the hotel.</li>
            <li> I have tried and reviewed just about every modern manual razor on the United States market in the past year, and found only a couple that provided a close and comfortable--yet cost effective--shave. Recently, though, a new job required me to change my shaving habits and begin shaving every day. At that point, I decided that the best option would be to go for a less-close, more forgiving electric shaver. After a lot of comparison shopping, I found this Panasonic model and took the plunge. I&#x27;m glad that I gave them a chance...it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 5 stars. This shaver looks and feels great. The design is very user-friendly...grips all around the razor, an innovative shape that fits well in any sized hand, and a good amount of weight added as well. It does not feel cheap, and actually seems extremely durable. The shaver also boasts an always-on LCD display showing battery strength. That, to me, was a great inclusion. Its plug port is located at the bottom of the razor, and do be aware--it does not work whlie plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Although the shaver does not work while plugged in, it does work consistently at the peak of its power while on battery. With my former Norelco, there was a noticeable drop in shaver RPM when it was on battery. Not so with the Panasonic. The shaver&#x27;s power is as strong with a full charge as it is with a low battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: 4.5 stars. I am extremely pleased with the comfort offered by the Panasonic. I changed from manual to electric because I knew that it would be the easiest way for me to get a decent shave every day without dealing with potential razor burn. What I did not realize is that this shaver would deliver as close of a shave as the manual razor I had been using did. I shave in two different methods with the Panasonic--and keep in mind, it is a wet/dry shaver. The first, and most typical method, is with a small amount of Lectric Shave splashed on my face in the moments before shaving. The second method is a wet shave with my Aveeno shave gel. I never thought that an electric razor would actually work well on a wet beard, but this just can&#x27;t be beat. It is fully immersible in water, and washes clean with a rinse under the faucet--no cleaning tools needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: 5 stars. The Panasonic has excellent battery life. For me, I am getting an average battery life of two weeks. Additionally, the razor itself is so solidly built that I anticipate a long life for it. There are no cleaning tools used when cleaning the razor, which is a pleasant surprise. A rinse under the faucet keeps it totally clean, inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5 stars. There is just no other rating that I can think of. After using so many manual razors, it is refreshing to see a brand of electrics that rethinks typical shavers and goes for something innovative for today&#x27;s man. Well done, Panasonic.ave with my Aveeno shave gel. I never thought that an electric razor would actually work well on a wet beard, but this just can&#x27;t be beat.

            <li> Overall, a good razor.  It&#x27;s much quieter than my old Remington Microscreen, but doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close.  Also requires more time to shave as I need to pass over areas miore than before.  Only pivots side to side, not front to back, but this isn&#x27;t a big issue.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 6 months and find it does a mediocre job. I had a Norelco triple head old style shaver that did a better job for 20 plus years before it died.  Read the reviews and thought I was upgrading, I was wrong. Panasonic says to give it 3 months for your skin to get accustommed to the shaver.  My skin still hates this shaver. Keep looking.</li>
            <li> I am coming from an ancient razor that had become more of a lawnmower than an electric shaver. So I may not be the best judge of the effectiveness of this one.  All I can say is for me (very light and spotty beard)I have only used it dry and I am extremely satisfied with it.  If you have a particularly tough beard maybe it&#x27;s possible a premium priced \\&quot;super\\&quot; razor would make a difference, but my guess is, using this wet would make it effective for just about anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago and have been using it ever since. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m disapointed by it because  for the last thirty years or so I have been using not thing but Norelco shavers, and as far as I&#x27;m consern there is just  no comparison not with this shaver any ways. It shaves kind of nice and smooth although it takes longer to shave than my   old shaver. As far as the floating head I&#x27;m not to crazy about it, it&#x27;s a little too stiff and it only pevots in one direction unlike my old shaver. What I really didn&#x27;t like about it is that when the battery is totaly discharged it doesn&#x27;t work until it  is fully charged, other shavers are fully functional as soon as you plug them into the wall whether or not the battery is charged.  I didn&#x27;t try to wet shave with it for the reason that I just don&#x27;t see any benefit out of this at all, in fact I see it as more of  cleaning work after shaving. In any event, I think that the price I paid for it is right in comparison to the Norelco shavers which  are very pricey now days.</li>
            <li> Before buying this razor, I had a Panasonic wet/dry that worked fantastic. Unfortunately it got dropped and broken, and I had to replace it.  This razor at the time was the closest model to what I had.  Initial thoughts when receiving it were 1) cheap plastic housing, 2) the swivel head seemed low-quality and was too \\&quot;floppy\\&quot;.  I have been using it for about 6 months now and the battery and motor seem to be dying.  At first, the razor was strong and cut well, but now it bogs down and when my beard is thick it can actually stall out the razor with 100% charge.  Im really disappointed and will be calling Panasonic for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought several as gifts. People like it. This is for Panasonic ES7103K Pro Curve Wet Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black.</li>
            <li> For me there are 3 main criteria to evaluate a shaver: closeness/smoothness, robustness against irregular hair and quality/longevity:   - Yes, as many other reviewers have confirmed, this shaver does deliver a very close shave. It is almost comparable to a wet shave, without the skin irritation. Closer than Remington, closer than Brown. Cleaning the blades with isopropanol dies help maintain performance.  - If beard grown longer, this model will have a hard time to get you clean. Robustness to master 2 or 3-day stubles is quite limited and demands patience.  - Lifetime of the battery was a great disappointment. After a year there was a loss of about 20-30 %. Now after just over 2 years, I get barely 2 shaves out of the ES7203. The display still shows  40 or even 60%, but the head stops moving. You cannot continue shaving with the cord plugged in. No other shaver I owned or hear of goes dead so quickly  Over all, not bad if you change your electrical shaver every 2 years anyway and keep you beard short over the weekend. If you look for lasting quality look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Works just fine! No problems at all even with a couple of days growth. I hate to shave and this makes it a pleasure; done in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Shaves really well and hold a long charge!  I owned a braun and a norelco, but this tops them for both closeness and comfort, plus my dog dose not complain when he kisses my face! Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> This razor is bar none the best in it&#x27;s class.  If used daily, you wouldn&#x27;t even need a straight, or disposable razor.  It shaves EXTREMELY close.  What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s quiet, holds a charge very well, and to clean it, you just put a lil hand soap on it, turn it on, let it lather up, and then rinse! For the price, it&#x27;s absolutely the most buzz for your buck!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric shaver in 30 years so I can&#x27;t make comparisons with other shavers and their relative quality, quietness, or closeness of shave.  What I can comment on is the wet/dry versatility of the shaver.  I haven&#x27;t tried shaving under water yet but to be able to achieve a good shave in the shower or out, with bar soap, liquid hand soap, shaving gel, cream, or nothing is a simple joy for me and provides me with a real option to my hand shaver.  It may even become my preferred way to go.  I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Panasonic model I have purchased. The first one is a battery-only model - small/no trimmer, but handy for weekend suitcase travel.-  The next is similar to this new one, but smaller head, requiring more attention in the mirror to get a full shave..  The new one is finally large enough, and the tilting head follows the contours of face and neck perfectly- works fine without the mirror and battery capacity is monitored with an LCD panel showing % of charge remaining.. Panasonic is equivalent to BRAUN without the price.. The best feature is that all 3 are still working just fine..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver exclusively for 2 months now, and I have to say I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve used several electric razors in the past and I always find myself dis-satisfied and end up switching back to a blade.  This shaver however, for the price, can&#x27;t be beat!  After my first shave with this razor I knew I had made a good choice.  I was extremely surprised to find that it shaves every bit as close as the blades that I use.  I don&#x27;t bother using it as a wet shaver, or with shaving cream (though I did try it once just to check it out) as it does a great job when I use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews claim that this is a relatively loud shaver, but I use it in my bathroom which is about 10 feet away from my 1 year olds room, and she never wakes up.  I would say the noise level is on par with other electrics that I&#x27;ve used (although I&#x27;ve never spent more than $120 on one, so maybe the high dollar ones are quieter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this razor is a snap.  Simply pop off the foil, pop off the shroud, and run all the parts under water.  Takes about 15 seconds, 30 if you&#x27;re very thorough.  I let the parts sit out to air dry while I&#x27;m at work, and snap it back together in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is pretty impressive as well.  Like I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve been using this razor exclusively for 2 months, shaving almost every day except on the weekends.  I think I&#x27;ve only charged it 3 times since I got it.  It&#x27;s ready for it&#x27;s fourth charge today though.  The battery indicator is really nice and keeps you from trying to squeeze one last shave out of a battery that you didn&#x27;t know was about to die.  The only down-side about charging this shaver is that it can not be used while plugged into the wall.  I imagine that, for legal reasons, since this is advertised as a water-proof unit, they can&#x27;t allow the razor to function with a cord plugged into a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price paid ($46.47) for this razor, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one when this one dies...even if it only lasts a year, I will still consider it a good value.  Who would have thought that Panasonic would make such a good razor.en if it only lasts a year, I will still consider it a good value.  Who would have thought that Panasonic would make such a good razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in December 2009. Compared to my old Norelco rotary shaver, it is amazing and provides a close smooth shave. I am again a foil shaver convert.    7 months later, the shaver is dead. The first thing thing I noticed was that when the LCD said 40% charge left, the shaver just died instantly. Looking at the base where the power cord plugs in, there was rust like substance. Having put up with this for several charges, I was concerned that this might be unsafe and decided to investigate. I disassembled the shaver according to the instruction manual. One of the batteries had rust coloured stain for 3/4 of its length. There was evidence of water in the supposedly waterproof &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; electronics compartment that held the battery. Looking closely, it was apparent that water had entered this waterproof shaver via where one of the prongs of the power cord enters that compartment. The battery is likely dead, but frankly I would no longer trust the integrity of the electronics.     Even though the 7103 uses NiMH rechargable batteries, you can&#x27;t use normal batteries for this shaver. Panasonic has added a long spike on the +ve and a nipple on the -ve. You may be able to get them from a Panasonic service centre, but they will likely cost more than the shaver itself.    Looking at the design was interesting. The outer shell and rubber grips of the body that you see aren&#x27;t meant to be watertight at all! The key is the inner shell. Assuming the battery/electronics compartment has a watertight seal (which looks well sealed to my eyes), both the prongs for the power cord and 2 other holes at the base of the shaver are the weak points.    Ironically, I normally dry shave, and only tried a wet shave about 3 times. I did, however, clean the shaver per the instructions after every shave.    For anyone who wants to avoid this and maximize the life of their 7103K, what I would recommend is:  * dry shave only  * when you clean the shaver, make sure that ONLY the head isrinsed under water. Keep as much water off the body where the switch, power cord and electronics are as possible.  * while leaving it to dry, make sure that the tail/bottom of the shaver is above the head of the shaver. This will ensure that water/moisture does not run down to the body of the shaver. An easy way is to lay the bottom of the shaver on the plastic cover of the head, so it&#x27;s sloping down and any water will drain towards the head of the shaver.    I was happy with the shave, but extremely disappointed that the shaver didn&#x27;t last. I might have been lucky previously, but I&#x27;d never had an electric shaver that didn&#x27;t last longer than 7 years. So in good conscience, I can only give this a one star due to it only lasting 7 months.</li>
            <li> Well made and is very easy to use and keep clean. Not as good as my old Norelco three head rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year and it is the best performer of the many electrics I&#x27;ve used over the last 35 years.  However, the battery life (which was only about 5 shaves to start with) has decreased even further recently.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a repacement with a longer life.</li>
            <li> I bought this model in July 2010. I am very disappointed with my purcahse. One of the worse shavers I ever used.    It worked pretty well for the first few months. Now seven months later it takes me 15-20 minutes to shave. Intially, I use to go couple of weeks before charging, now I am lucky to get two shaves out of it.     Today it is on sale for $35 (Gold Box deals). I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if it was $10.     Although a lot more money, I just ordered ES8103S, I hope to have better luck with 8103 than this one.</li>
            <li> This is a good lookin&#x27; razor. I was impressed at first sight. Put to the test, it did not  deliver up...it doesn&#x27;t tackle tough beards - it snags you, doesn&#x27;t shave well and irritates skin. If you shave daily, it&#x27;s great - close, smooth shave. If you are looking for a heavy duty electric razor, you would be well advised to pass this one up.</li>
            <li> The pro curve razor from Panasonic is amazing. First, it&#x27;s gentle and smooth when applied to the face and neck. Second, the cordless feature is nice for a choice of wet or dry shaves. Third, the razor is fully charged within an hour and keeps you updated with a power indicator. Lastly, the price is reasonable. I paid $48 at Kohl&#x27;s. Overall, a great cordless electric razor for the budget shopper.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best electric shavers out there.  Power, clean close shave very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver.  It gives me a smooth, close shave without making my skin break out.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a perfect electric shaver out there, but this is very close.  This is my 3rd electric shavers I owned.  My first electric shaver was a foil shaver from Braun and which did it job fine.  After seeing all the Norelco&#x27;s lift and cut commercial, I finally got the Norelco Spectra 8825 XL and finally replaced it with a Panasonic brand.  I will compare this barebones Panasonic Es 7103k with the other models I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closet shave:&lt;br /&gt;I will have to give this to the Panasonic by a narrow margin then Braun at 2 and Norelco in 3rd.  Before I got this model, I tried my brother Panasonic and actually got a cut.  Wow, this electric shaver is the closest thing to a Bic razor.  I have not yet gotten any cut or bleeding from this newer model, but my skin feels tender and definitely need some lotion afterward.  The blade speed is 10k rpm compare to Braun at 7-8k rpm.  Higher end Panasonic shavers go up to 13k rpm.  I considered the Braun average and Norelco have trouble with thicker hair around the mustache area.  All three does evenly in the bread part of the face with a long trimmer on the first wave and switching back to the main shaver for the softer cut.  Hairs under the neck needs a first past with a long trimmer on the Braun and Norelco, but not necessary for the Panasonic, which seem to chop almost all areas evenly without the long hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave:&lt;br /&gt;Norelco or Panasonic, then Braun.  While this model takes off my face top skin layer like no other electric razors out there, my skin does feels fresh after I give it some aftershave lotion.  Norelco design hands down is the easiest on the face.  No aftershave lotion at all.  The triple rotating blades on the Spectra, while doesn&#x27;t cut as close, definitely fits my face contour better creating an even cut.  Braun (older model) definitely has a close shave but its foil/coil (not the current triple heads models) missed some hair under the neck and mustache and need more passes than both the Norelco and Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power:&lt;br /&gt;While this is not the most powerful Panasonic model out there at 10k rpm, it definitely feels more powerful then Braun or Norelco.  Granted the Norelco design is a little different.  Norelco is the quietest follow by Braun.  This model is also as noisily as my father Remington and tad under the decibel of some hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction:&lt;br /&gt;I like Panasonic, Norelco and Braun design and construction for varies reason, the Remington design is another story.  On the outside all three are equally solid.  Under the blade, Panasonic looks the sturdiest.  Its coils looks thicker then the Braun.  I am not sure why all the plastic parts under the Spectra blade have never been broken all these years, but they still work fine.  I got to say this flush on design and construction for all three bases on personal preferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;All three were easily to wash.  All three have swivel blade heads.  Norelco has the best contour to face.  Braun and Panasonic foil head pivot in different way.  Panasonic head pivot side to side, horizontally, that doesn&#x27;t lose power from the base motor.  Braun head pivot vertically closer to the face, but comparably to a non-pivot head, it seem to lost power from the base motor in the design.  Both Braun and Panasonic coils going up and down where this Panasonic triple blades move up and down independently.  I am not sure if the 30 degree blade or its power is the reason why the Panasonic get the closet shave.  The digital screen shows how much the battery is left, but is always on.  The only drawback I see in this design is the rechargeable batteries.  Only Norelco works both as a recharge and cord plug in.  The older Braun and Panasonic work on a charge only and cannot plug and play.  The Braun batteries died and never worked again, I hope this won&#x27;t happen to the Panasonic.  The newer Braun models have fixed this feature.Shave wet is a nice feature also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is the closet shave for a barebones unit, and that price is right.  Just wished it had the plug and play feature.unit, and that price is right.  Just wished it had the plug and play feature.</li>
            <li> Low end shaver with decent battery life.  However, it is not powerful or fast as other Panasonic shavers...consequently, takes longer to shave and does not shave close.</li>
            <li> Got it as the gift for my husband. He said its great, but I saw him using it only once... The result wasn&#x27;t that great aether..To get the desirable result took him over 30 mins when he used to do it in a few mins with regular shaver.I think he just didn&#x27;t want to disappoint me. Wont recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my year-old bare bones Norelco shaver that had really lost it&#x27;s edge. It was basically eating my face. The old Norelco was a rotary, and it was also my first shaver. After reading some comparisons online on Rotary vs. Foil, I decided to give foil a try, since most people said they gave a closer shave. I picked this Panasonic because it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, and because I liked the idea of the small LCD screen. As soon as it came via UPS, I opened it up and tried it. It comes with a cap, charger, a few manuals, and a little traveling bag. The first time, I used it without any water; just dry. It worked fine, although I noticed that it missed a few hairs on my neck. My cheek, however, was left hairless. It also cut me near my Adam&#x27;s apple, but I remembered that the same thing happened the first time I tried my Norelco shaver. My skin was obviously not used to a foil shaver. I tried it again using water, since the instruction manual said that that would give me a closer shave, and it did. It was more comfortable, missed less hairs, and was an overall closer, nicer shave. So, what&#x27;s stopping me from giving this thing 5 stars? First, it&#x27;s the fact that it misses a few hairs here and there. This can usually be handled by going over the zone a few times, but usually I just grab an old razor and quickly cut the missed hairs. Also, the LCD screen displays how much energy is left in the battery, that&#x27;s great and all, but it displays it in intervals of 20, so it goes 0%...60%, 80%, 100%. It&#x27;d be nicer if it displayed the numbers in intervals of 5, but that&#x27;s not a huge issue. I also did not like how loud this shaver is. I know foil shavers are supposed to be louder than rotary, and it&#x27;s not extremely loud, but it&#x27;s a little annoying for me. The last thing that I did not like was the fact that you can&#x27;t have the shaver hooked up to the wall and shave at the same time. The shaver must have a charge for it to function. I bought this shaver alreadyknowing that, so it&#x27;s not that big of an issue either. Overall, this is a very good shaver, it works well, can be used with water for a more comfortable shave, looks good, gets virtually all the hairs, and gets closer than my Norelco shaver. It&#x27;s also a lot easier to clean, all you do is put some liquid soap on it and rinse it out. Easy as that. If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not this is worth the money, trust me, it is.</li>
            <li> I have supremely sensitive skin on my face and neck.  I&#x27;ve never had a good, painless shave in my life (with blades or other electric shavers) - until I used this shaver.    I use this shaver after a shower, using shaving cream, and I get a pain-free shave that&#x27;s smoother than using a 3-blade razor.  It gives me a near perfect shave!  The battery lasts long as well (at least a week/charge).    Note, however, this shaver isn&#x27;t a miracle worker. If I use this shaver \\&quot;dry\\&quot;, I still get some irritation on my neck.  Also, the razor can occasionally miss a few stubborn hairs on the neck (no matter how many times you try to mow them down).  And finally, the digital battery display is not as precise as one may might think as it only works in steps of 20% (i.e. 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%).    Despite those faults, using this shaver \\&quot;wet\\&quot; is simply fantastic, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver enough.    UPDATE: After using this shaver for a few weeks, it (magically) made my skin more resilient.  So now I can even use standard 3-blade razors without cutting myself.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it&#x27;s really been a boon for my skin.  Now my regiment for shaving (if I have more than a day&#x27;s growth on my face): buzz off any beard, shave with a 3-blade razor to get my hairs small, use the Panasonic shaver to remove the rest, leaving my face soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.  If it&#x27;s only been a day, then just using the Panasonic is enough.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> i have only have had two electric razors. i got a cheap remington that did the job but it has fallen apart so i went with something nicer. unfortunaly it is not as close of a shave as the remington. Although this Panasonic is a very decent shaver. im not complaining, good speed and a decent cut.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple of years now&lt;br /&gt;Never had any issues with it&lt;br /&gt;Really close shave/trim&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts for about 4-5 shaves and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge&lt;br /&gt;Real easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;I got it for $49, which is a really great price considering the fact that&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to use it hassle free for almost 2 years</li>
            <li> This product proves that you don&#x27;t have to spend more than $50 to get a VERY good electric razor.  It works as well as any razor I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Fits my hand nicely.  Nice weight.  I have told my friends about this razor.  That&#x27;s as strong of recommendation as I ever give.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this and from the first time he used it he could not stop talking about how great it worked!  It charges very quickly and holds the charge for a long time.    Being able to clean it with water is an added bonus and the ability to shave wet or dry and receive the same great results is awesome.  No more bad shaves on the neck line for him, this one covers it all!    Great value for the money and a great product as well!!!</li>
            <li> Good product for fair price. Wet/Dry is a bit plus. LCD indicator of remaining charge is a good feature.</li>
            <li> If your not looking for a top of the line razor, and got 50 bucks to spend get it. Wet/dry shave, pretty long battery and one of the closest shaves from and electric.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver.  I bought one of these for my brother as a Christmas gift, and after he told me it gave him a really close shave I bought one for myself.  It performs much better than my older Braun shaver(however that was one of the cheaper models and several years old).  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver only a week but I like it already. Tried the wet shave for the first time last weekend. It does produce a closer shave than dry. Both are good but wet is better and more comfortable. Easy to clean. The reason for only four stars is you can&#x27;t use it with the cord.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to April 2011: This is still the best shaver I ever owned. I use it every day, mostly dry, and it continues to do a great job. As far as not being able to use with a cord, thats a dead issur to me. When the 20% charge light starts blinking I just plug it in. I can&#x27;t beleave how fast it charges. You don&#x27;t need a cord. Buy this product. You will not be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband becasue he had happened to mention he would like to try an electric razor.  Well it sat in the package for over a month waiting for him to decide if he wanted to try it.  One becasue he didn&#x27;t want to waste the money if he didn&#x27;t like it and two he wasn&#x27;t sure of what kind of a sahve he was really going to get.  Finally he did and now he&#x27;s very pleased.  He is amazed how close a shave he gets with it.  No pulling what&#x27;s so ever and he can shave while watching TV.  He has even tried it wet.  So for him to be happy with it has to say \\&quot;it&#x27;s a keeper\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I&#x27;ve been looking for a wet dry shaver for a while and this one does a great job</li>
            <li> This is an OK razor for the price.  It shaves pretty good just have to go over areas more than once.  Like I said for the price it is an OK razor.</li>
            <li> My second purchase of a Panasonic shaver (I dropped the first out my window-don&#x27;t ask)  The previous one I had over 10 years.    While I prefer to use it Dry, it is also very good with shaving cream. It charges fast and holds the charge well depemding on your use. Gives a close shave, so close, that a fellow in my office, after seeing my face, purchased one as well.    Cleaning is as easy as popping off the top cover and running it under water. For the price, is the best pound for pound shaver out there.    After using this Panasonic, you will never buy a different brand shaver!</li>
            <li> I switched from an electric to blade years ago. I got tired of buying expensive gillette blades so I thought I&#x27;d give an electric another try.  I really wanted to like this but it wasn&#x27;t even close to acceptable.  I gave it a couple of weeks but all it did was irritate my skin and leave my skin feeling like sandpaper.  I tried it both wet and dry and neither worked well.  Needless to say, I sent it back and am happy to be back to my blades.</li>
            <li> Mine works terrific!  No problems.  And yes you can unplug it and it works great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor after my last Panasonic&#x27;s plastic piece broke on the trimmer that flips out. This new one is better designed and the digital readout on the battery is a very nice feature. It&#x27;s very easy to keep clean and it says you can use it in water but I&#x27;ve never tried that. I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting a new electric shaver for some time and finally decided to get one.  I got tired of trying to keep my balance when I used a razor in the shower and on top of that the cost of the blades are getting very expensive. I decided on a mens razor since the last two I bought were womens and they were worthless.  So far so good.  It has done what I want it to do and more.  It would be nice if you could use it while it is plugged, but can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a back-up for travel; and it does a really good job even on the scalp area.  The shaver recharges rather slowly, but I get four or five complete shaves with each charge, so it&#x27;s not like the user who&#x27;s paying attention needs to worry about the inability to use it while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  It operates smoothly, has plenty of power and speed, the % remaining display is helpful, and it charges quickly (I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once since the initial charge).    The wet/dry feature seems to work well, I&#x27;m able to clean it much easier than my old razor.  I also do seem to get a better shave when wet.    Complaints: Fairly minor, but I don&#x27;t find the tilt action of the head very useful.  It takes some force to make it tilt, which doesn&#x27;t help my shave, so I manipulate the razor myself.  However, my old razor was the same way, so I&#x27;ve decided not to dock a star due to this.    Bottom line: Great shaver for the money.  I don&#x27;t see much in the features of the more expensive razors that justifies their price.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for the past 24 years. I had a Norelco first and then, two Brauns which were a step up from the Norelco. I was ready for a new shaver  and looked for and thought I was going to buy the Braun 370. I bid for one on ebay, but didn&#x27;t win and am glad I didn&#x27;t. After reading the reviews on the Panasonic ES7103K and noting the great price, I decided to take a chance and buy one. I have  had it for a week now and absolutely love it. It shaves MUCH closer than the two  previous Brauns I had and I love the quick charge feature. I&#x27;m going to find a woman&#x27;s model for my girlfriend. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about a year ago. It gives a good shave &amp; easy to clean, no complaints there. In the past couple months the battery life has clearly deteriorated. I was initially getting 10-12 shaves on a full charge. I could reliably get 1 shave even when it first hits \\&quot;0%\\&quot;. Now when it hits 40% power (after about 5-6 shaves), I have to recharge- it will not even get thru a shave at that level. In the past 25 yrs I have had gone thru only 2-3 shavers, because once the batteries would die I could still use the shaver plugged in &amp; occasional replace the blades.  FOR SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE REASON, YOU CANNOT USE THIS SHAVER WHILE IT IS PLUGGED IN. I would not have bought it if i knew that, and I should have returned it as soon as I found out, but foolishly decided to keep it. I&#x27;ll be surprised if i get 6-12 more months out of this one.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic.  The earlier one wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after a couple of years, but had a better blade and head.  This one reflects a cost-cutting mentality covered up by a display screen. Still decent for occasional use and the trimmer is convenient.</li>
            <li> I was split between this shaver and the [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] once my Braun gave up the ghost after 10 years of terrific service. Both models would be a switch for me, the Panasonic because of the wet/dry feature and the 7310XL because of the rotary blades (which I like on a travel shaver I have). In the end, I wish I&#x27;d gone with the 7310XL: the wet/dry is not that big of a deal, and the inability to shave while the Panasonic is plugged in is irritating.      Pros  - close shave on cheeks and upper lip  - wet shaving seems to make for a slightly closer shave  - shower gel seems to me to make for an even better wet shave than shaving cream  - can wash the shaving block with hand soap and water      Cons  - does not operate while plugged in  - no matter how many passes or angles, it misses short whiskers around lips, under nose and on neck  - lack of texturized grip makes the shaver prone to slipping out of your hand when wet shaving (there goes your $50 new shaver)  - battery gauge only displays 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%; better would just be five bars like on a cell phone  - the effective width of the shaving area is quite small: just 1 3/4 inches  - the shaver itself is bulky and awkwardly shaped for a medicine closet or cabinet  - taking off the shaving block to dry after a wet shave makes for clutter in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Over all it is a good rechargeable shaver with trimmer!    I was using some cheap Hitachi shaver which cost around 30 bucks in (2002) and it lasted me about 7 or 8 years. some how it won&#x27;t be able to recharge. so I was looking for a new rechargeable shaver, I was comparing the Braun but a decent one is around $90. later i found this panasonic ES7103K. bought it at Amazon and shipped to me in a week. and I love it! feels great on hand. the size is not small and it is built evenly. i don&#x27;t like those that has a big head and small tail, those just look weird and feel weird (just in my opinion)  It shaves clean and trim well, with the LCD screen display you know how much battery left. from the instruction, it said when the batteries drop down to 0% you still can have 2 more shave time.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy an electric razor because I got tired of spending $10+ on a pack of razors.  I cannot compare it to other electric razors, but this one works well.  No pulling, redness, or irritation.  The battery life is good.  For me it last about 2 weeks shaving every other day.    The shaver does a good job dry and wet (closer shave wet).  The only issue is the neck; it takes me longer to shave my neck than it did with a standard razor.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Pulled&amp;#34; at my husband&#x27;s chin hairs and he developed a raw-looking rash as a result of using it twice. Would not recommend to friends, but maybe it would make an excellent gift for that annoying coworker whose name I pulled for workplace Secret Santa.</li>
            <li> First off, any electric shaver is going to take longer than a razor, that&#x27;s just a fact of life. On the other hand, this thing will save you money and probably some cuts here and there.    This thing cuts amazingly close for an electric shaver. With enough time and patience, it can rival a razor shave. However, where it really excels is when your face is irritated and you don&#x27;t want to butcher yourself with a razor. Not only that, but a box of razor cartridges is somewhere between $30-50. This thing will pay for itself in less than a year.    It takes a week or two to get used to it, but the results are worth it. You can shave without even really paying attention or even looking at yourself - no mirror required! It has a pop up trimmer great for between the brows, the sideburns, and (when required) some more \\&quot;private\\&quot; grooming.    In my time owning it, I have yet to cut myself. It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied so far the the Razor, it shaves well with very little rash, which has been a problem for me with other razors. I hope it holds up well.The packaging was good the delivery was as stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic razors over the years, and in the early days, they would fail in less than a year. I love the wet/dry design and shave in the shower. Panasonic&#x27;s customer support is excellent, and they have always replaced the failed unit. Once they changed over to induction charging, the units started to last longer and I had one that lasted over three years. This model has a plug-in charger, which I suspect is what was responsible for it failing after only three months. After a full charge, the unit would rapidly and completely discharge after just one and a half shaves. Once again though, Panasonic sent me a new unit of the next model up within a week of receiving the failed one. See my review of the ES8103. It is absolutely superb to this unit.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor since I started shaving 40 years ago. The wet and dry feature caught my eye and I decided to give it a try as my face has become more sensitive. I did have to adjust to it as a certain technique is required it you are unfamiliar with electric razors.One thing I will note is that the picture on the package shows a guy cutting as swath through a perfect coat of lather which I found was not that affective. A thinner soap, like a rich face soap, seemed to work better. This is all good news for me as it&#x27;s one less step and the result is that the condition of my skin is overall a lot better. Rinsing it off under the tap when your done is also a definite plus.   Overall it requires more time than a conventional razor and not quite as close, so far anyway, but it&#x27;s a winner for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a late Christmas gift and he love&#x27;s it! It gives him a close shave and holds a charge for a long time. Plus it truly is a wet/dry shaver! He told me he has never been able to use shaving gel with an electric shaver before till now :) It also seems to be quite durable cause my boyfriend is very tough on his stuff. He dropped it about 5 times and it is still working perfectly!</li>
            <li> Be aware of very poor workmanship of this shaver. Expect to serve for as short as one year. Pretty expensive for this type of junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the large head. Also, it seems that the vibrations cause my grip to slip towards the head.     Battery life is good. Last about a week.     The shave isn&#x27;t too bad. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any closer than my Braun.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a pretty good job of shaving close but does not hold a charge for very long. I also have a Norelco 7310 and it gives several more shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Gives a gentle shave, quiet, had LCD display of charge status and can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Takes about 6 minutes for a complete shave.  Doesn&#x27;t shave very close after only one day of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;  The ac adapter is unique to the shaver which means I would have to buy a replacement adapter&lt;br /&gt;  should anything go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;  Came with no accessories, such as brushes or a decent carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;  The side trimmer is so small it is not useful for much.&lt;br /&gt;  Battery charge only lasts through about 5 6 minute shaves, then needs recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the razor and it will give a nice shave after some work on the problem areas.  This razor wiil not give razor burns like some Remington razors that I have owned.  You decide if you like that.</li>
            <li> I am asian w/ a sparse beard with thick individual hairs.  This is the first electric razor that gave me a close shave i.e. no prickly stubble left behind.  I&#x27;ve used only mid range electric razors from Braun which all left stubble and/or cut my face if I applied more pressure to get a closer shave.  For the first 8 months or so the ES7103K worked perfect, but then it started losing charge rapidly, I would need to recharge it every few days sometimes and other times it would easily last two weeks.  Since this is a wet/dry shaver I use it mostly in the shower, but I suspect the battery life issues were due to water damage b/c there were rust stains building up around the adapter socket.  Note there was no physical damage to the razor, like a cracked shell, that would&#x27;ve allowed water in.  After a couple more months the razor could no longer hold enough charge for reliable wireless shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver very much. I had a much older version so when it went bad I looked all over the internet for that model with no luck so I called Panasonic to find out which was the model that was comparable. After obtaining the information I look around for the best price and as usual Amazon.com had it. Delivery was prompt and the product was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Worked great until the battery died after a couple years.</li>
            <li> PROS    Shaves pretty good for the price.    Battery life seems to be about 5 shaves.    LCD Battery indicator.    Waterproof.      CONS     The shaver is giant! Big and clunky.     DOES NOT WORK WHILE PLUGGED IN! This is a major flaw. The shaver must be unplugged or it will not turn on. This could leave you unshaven if you let the battery get too low. When the batteries fail it will be worthless. I&#x27;m might return it because of this.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver.  It&#x27;s a bit bulky in my somewhat smallish hand, but it does its job and does it well.  Yet, I went back to my Panasonic Travel Shaver for daily use, which is much smaller, less sophisticated that this one, but does a better job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother and he loves it. It&#x27;s a great shaver and I received it in the mail in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome! The wet/dry feature makes it a breeze cleaning the head. Just quickly run it under cool water and lay it on a towel or on the counter to dry. My last two shavers didn&#x27;t last very long. After a year they both broke. This one has been running strong for two years. The only bad thing is that the battery life is pretty short so when you travel you will need to bring the power cable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note the side burn shaver is pretty good for not only trimming your side burns but also for the hair on the side of your head if you get a number 1. In case your barber didn&#x27;t do a good enough job on your haircut you can fix it up a little with this little powerhorse. Unfortunately I think at this time this model by Panasonic is no longer in production (Fall 2013). A newer model may be available but I have no experience with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to try razors anymore, this little machine has made my life easier since I only have to recharge it and it is always sharp</li>
            <li> I using it almost every day for shaving... but only for my neck and ears, for many years I have full beard :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s my first Panasonic triple head foil shaver, after so many years using Norelco shavers, and I am pretty impressed, good shaver for that money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and, size is just right ... I hate this big harvesters...</li>
            <li> I have been using this electric razor for about five years.  The same one.  Due to a hand injury I was not able to shave with my right hand.  I liked that you could get this one wet, not that I use it in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t want to worry about getting water on the inside of the device.  It does take some time for your whiskers to get used to the electric shave vs. the blade.  But once you are used to it, I wouldn&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not get as close as a real blade if that is a concern.  For my wedding, I shaved with an actual razor, but otherwise I used it everyday.  I have only replaced the blade under the foil once in that time.  The instructions recommend you change more often then every couple of years.  The replacement blade is pretty cheap (cost wise).  I have saved a lot of money on not buying replaceable blade and saved time because this is faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very picky when it comes to razors, and this has been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve used the rotating head razors, so I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s this razor in particular, or all razors like this, but it &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; hair all over when I use it. I have to shave over a sink, or I get tiny hairs everywhere.</li>
            <li> The foil broke after a year and costs as much as the shaver itself....the part that flips up is useless..you cannot shave when it is being charged connected to a socket,...</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive purchasing this product after reading several reviews where the shaver cut just a little bit too deep. I haven&#x27;t had this problem. The shaver has performed well. It gives a good shave and having a wet option is truly unique. I usually shave \\&quot;wet\\&quot; about once a week. I don&#x27;t see much of a diference in the shave but the shaving cream does provide good lubrication.  The shaver does need to be charged more frequently than my old Braun shaver. I get about a weeks worth of shaving from one charge. It also takes a bit longer to get a totally clean shave but it shaves closer than the Braun.  The trimmer is the only real disappontment with this shaver. My Braun trimmer was much more efficient.</li>
            <li> This shaver gave me the best shave I have ever had from an electric shaver. I have used other brands and this is the first purchase of a Panasonic and it is excellent. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I liked the shaver but found that I prefer another brand so I gave this one to a friend who loves it. He&#x27;s very happy with it, takes it with him all over the planet, and says its smooth cleanly without him feeling as though he&#x27;d been scalped.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, cuts reasonable close, comfortable to use, easy to clean with the kitchen sink spray head, battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.  I&#x27;ve used it for 4 years, and I haven&#x27;t found a need to replace the screens or the oscillating heads.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes great stuff. When I bought this product , it was a decent shaver. I couldn&#x27;t say the same today. Take your hard earned money and buy one of their newer products instead which are quieter and provide a closer, sharper, finer shave.</li>
            <li> Been using this shaver for several years now...... still all original and shaves fine.  Only notable change is the nicads are gradually loosing their ability to hold a full charge, usually only last a weeks shaving now.  If they still make this model when and if mine ever does give out completely I&#x27;d happily buy another!</li>
            <li> multiple passes to get all the hair, i like Norelco a lot better</li>
            <li> This shaver remained loyal for several (4 maybe?) years (before the battery simply wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a couple shaves). Though it&#x27;s got three heads, it only has two blades. Cleaning is easy, and I love the wet/dry feature. I recently replaced it with the ES8103S and, though it&#x27;s a bit louder, it cuts a whole lot closer! This is a good razor though, and if the newer model were significantly more, I&#x27;d just as soon buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Broke very quickly.  charging port corroded. Currently use a $14 Panasonic I&#x27;ve had for 5 years now.</li>
