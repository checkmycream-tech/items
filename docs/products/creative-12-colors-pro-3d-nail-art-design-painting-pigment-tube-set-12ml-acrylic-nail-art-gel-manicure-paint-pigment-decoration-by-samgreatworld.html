            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I love the colors but when I opened the package glitter was spilled on me!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I will be sure to order again when I run out, I have recommended to all my friends!</li>
            <li>It is not packaged like it is in the picture, which is probably why one of them spilled a bit, but that&#x27;s okay!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>

            <li>Got covered in glitter when the package arrived, but I love the variety of colors!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous and the glitter is very fine.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing</li>
            <li>The glitter is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing-</li>
            <li>They state that they are an honest company and would like to fix the mistake.</li>
            <li>Popular with my clients</li>
            <li>Others were nice.</li>
            <li>really liked the product..</li>
            <li>I recieved my glitters and the packaging was kind of jacked up</li>
            <li>I use them for my eyes and they stay on really nice.</li>
            <li>honestly wouldn&#x27;t mind buying again.</li>
            <li>It sticks nicely to her skin and in her  hair.</li>
            <li>No glitter was out of the containers and there was a nice array of colors.</li>
            <li>the glitter arrived in a zip lock bag not in a nice organized box as seen in the pictures.</li>
            <li>but, in my experience, that&#x27;s just kind of what happens with glitter.  </li>
            <li>They were in plastic nicely wrapped there was so glitter</li>
            <li>The glitter looks really nice on too.</li>
            <li>AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED</li>
            <li>The colors are really nice</li>
            <li>These are so worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I use them mainly for makeup, but they are wonderful for glitter tattoos as well!</li>
            <li>they come in a nice flexible plastic box that&#x27;s great for storage, and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I think thanksgiving, and just received it, was true to colors, and great for body glitter</li>
            <li>The glitter itself is very fine and a nice product that we plan to use for glitter eye-shadow and glitter tattoos.</li>
            <li>A variety of colors and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I use glitter a ton, it doesn&#x27;t bother my face and the colors are amazing :)</li>
            <li>The containers came full and a nice variety of colors were included!</li>
            <li>Product is still nice, thankfully there are many containers.  </li>
            <li>I love how it comes packaged in it&#x27;s own plastic case that fits so well in my kit.</li>
            <li>the fun level is great.  </li>
            <li>Bright Pink and Copper are the two most popular color requests. :D</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, and the shipping went a lot faster than the forecasted delivery date of Jan 9 - Jan 27, which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>The packaging is not the best as they never completely closed the lids of the glitter and some of it dumped out.</li>
            <li>great color selection, really versatile!</li>
            <li>The package arrived very quickly, which was nice.</li>
            <li>All of my cases were filled to the top as well!</li>
            <li>I received them today and honestly, while the colors are very pretty, about 80% of the glitter was all over the bag!</li>
            <li>But if your using this for glitter tatoos you will need a lot more of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love how it looks♥♥</li>
            <li>all fine.my kid love</li>
            <li>I love these glitters.</li>
            <li>You get so many for the price.  </li>
            <li>And I waited more than a month to get them.</li>
            <li>I love love loooooove this.</li>
            <li>So many colors to chose from you can match almost anything.</li>
            <li>and those who love to add glitter to your nails.</li>
            <li>They are really cute.</li>
            <li>also hope others have a much better experience with this company than I did.</li>
            <li>I bought this to put on my nails and it works perfect and they are all different colors and shades!</li>
            <li>I was expecting something better.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>LOVE the glitter not a fan of the Shimmer Dust Powder though it tends to clump up like sugar when you apply it over a eye glitter primer/glue</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many things from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did because the Shimmer tattoo kit arrived with glitter everywhere</li>
            <li>The glitter worked wonderfully with the extra glue and stencils that I bought.</li>
            <li>and I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I opened the package and was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>love these</li>
            <li>The picture didn&#x27;t show that there were as many duplicates as there were.</li>
            <li>Overall a great deal!</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more glitter to be in the containers.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much more color than we&#x27;d ever use.</li>
            <li>i love it and recommend it to all of my friends</li>
            <li>there were so many colours, not a ton of repeat colours----great selection and quality.</li>
            <li>Just like many others said here.  </li>
            <li>I did not receive many duplicates.</li>
            <li>Love the value...</li>
            <li>Despite much of what I saw in the reviews claiming that this product was a shipping disaster, the product arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li>My kids love glitter tatoos</li>
            <li>They need to put them in a better container</li>
            <li>the glitter was everywhere, you have to make sure that, the product is going to be intact when the costumer get it</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>so I figured one or more had opened, but after opening them and checking all 45 colors it looks like glitter from packaging and not from the containers in the package.</li>
            <li>there is A LOT of glitter more than I will ever use for nail art.</li>
            <li>I will order another set soon, that&#x27;s how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love these glitters.</li>
            <li>Perfect for beginners who need variety and want to test different colors.</li>
            <li>Ok if they would have come in without glitter everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love the colors of this product</li>
            <li>Love that I got so many</li>
            <li>They last and the color pay off is great!</li>
            <li>if they would guarantee they will add more glitter to each container</li>
            <li>I love love love these glitter.</li>
            <li>I have been searching a long time for perfect glitter dust but most of them in amazon are glitter shell.</li>
            <li>But most weren&#x27;t even a 1/4 full!</li>
            <li>Fantastic selection of colors and all are good quality super fine glitter.  </li>
            <li>There arent very full either.</li>
            <li>Love the colors but mini containers weren&#x27;t even filled halfway.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for nails :)</li>
            <li>To be fair it doesn&#x27;t say how much glitter there should be</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>the company refused to replace my product, but offered full refund.. for this i have changed my rating to 3 stars!</li>
            <li>I like the glitter containers and color varieties, but the glitter containers need to be full!</li>
            <li>Excellent alternative to some if the more higher priced eye glitters out currently.</li>
            <li>one cap loose a lil glitter spilled out but not a whole lot all in all very happy beautiful colors for many looks</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery .</li>
            <li>But for the most part there was enough variance to keep me happy.  </li>
            <li>Steady handed, adult supervision is probably best if purchasing them for minors.</li>
            <li>wish these glitters were ore fine.</li>
            <li>I got this order quickly and as promised!</li>
            <li>Came a little spilt over but all in all great colors!</li>
            <li>But, I do like the glitter a lot, it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous and the glitter is finely milled to be safe enough for your eyes.</li>
            <li>Great value you get literally 45 different colors for $10</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to use 2 colors so far, but they are both beautiful on!</li>
            <li>the pros is that it was cheap and affordable and u do get quite a bit of glitters for $7.00</li>
            <li>So happy about all of the different colors!</li>
            <li>some are iridescent, some are metallic, and i even got one fantastic holographic silver.  </li>
            <li>but overall this is a great product</li>
            <li>One last problem is that I didn&#x27;t get all there colors that were in the picture, I like what i got, but I was not too happy about it.</li>
            <li>Overall great stuff for nail art and for face makeup.</li>
            <li>The jars aren&#x27;t even filled all the way, or evenly.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these sparkles.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product!!!</li>
            <li>but, the colors are nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I make soaps so I plan on putting the wild colors like super bright yellows, greens, or blues in the soap, using any of the colors for illustrations that I do,  and using the golds, blacks, browns, and reds for my makeup.</li>
            <li>The person stated that original email was not sent by him and that his colleague forgot to send out the replacement because I did not respond that I would remove the feedback.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for these.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a significant difference in price points though.</li>
            <li>But for the price they are totally worth it!</li>
            <li>and i am pretty sure I&#x27;m set for life.</li>
            <li>containers to use but still, really fun!</li>
            <li>These are really worth the price!</li>
            <li>i loved them all got here really fast but got some repeats and some 3 of a kind but still got like 35 different colors</li>
            <li>I have ordered many other glitter products and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Most Of The Containers Were Kind of Open</li>
            <li>Took forever to clean up each container and the glitter that was spread everywhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pots are plastic screw top, 1 inch in diameter filled 1/4 inch in depth - about as much as the pots will realistically hold.</li>
            <li>They are gorgeous, and although they arrived unscathed, I am glad I read the reviews and opened the bag carefully.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to receive this package</li>
            <li>but there are so many it wasn&#x27;t really an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>I like the product I just wish they came full instead of halfway full.</li>
            <li>The glitters would have been gorgeous if they weren&#x27;t all mixed together...</li>
            <li>As well as some of them weren&#x27;t as full as they should have been.</li>
            <li>The actual product it self is good.</li>
            <li>I bought these to use at the local fair to make glitter tattoos.  </li>
            <li>The package was so full of glitter that escaped that it blanketed the floor and my lap where I was sitting.</li>
            <li>YES, IT TAKES ONE FULL MONTH TO ARRIVE AND THE WEAR AND TEAR DEF SHOWS].</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>they were all the way full when i got them.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind there are alot of colors so its not a bad deal.  </li>
            <li>Pretty quick for coming all that way!</li>
            <li>The outside packing was very good, but MANY of the glitter containers were OPEN (not twisted shut).  </li>
            <li>This product is very pretty and has a lot of colors.</li>
            <li>some colors were very pretty.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 11 and all things colorful and tattooy are cool....</li>
            <li>but other than that, they&#x27;re amazing!</li>
            <li>There are so many different shades and they were all full!</li>
            <li>Absolutely  amazing different shades of pinks blues greens so happy I ordered despite many negative reviews!</li>
            <li>Unless you own a nail salon, there really is no reason to be dissatisfied, as there is so much product and so many colors.</li>
            <li>Nice amount for the price but one of my had jar broke open and glitter all over in the package.</li>
            <li>(if even that think more of a light &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; amount)...just enough to coat the jar and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s glitter.</li>
            <li>Dont be fooled by the cheap price it is well worth it to buy a real cosmetic grade glitter set.</li>
            <li>I assume that&#x27;s because there are different sellers, but it would have been nice to have gotten some of the pastels that are shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Also glitter varies not only in color but in how fine the glitter is, some are larger pieces that are more costume-like, others are very fine for like eye makeup or you hair/body.</li>
            <li>other than one of the pods being open when it arrived, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>Right place for shopping.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and item</li>
            <li>and it just wasn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>for all the repeat colors i&#x27;ll just go out buy some more small jars and combine them and buy my own colors...</li>
            <li>Most were actually only 1/4 full.</li>
            <li>they loved my makeup i would recommended and it arrived in only 2 days i live in texas</li>
            <li>and I have found that this set definitely comes in handy and if I use more of a color I can always go out and buy a big glitter in that color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not fun to clean up, but my daughter is thrilled.</li>
            <li>Company sent a brand new set free of charge.  </li>
            <li>There are multiplies of certain colors but that doesn&#x27;t bug me since there are still a lot to choose from!</li>
            <li>The containers of glitter are not that filled and super small wish they were bigger colors are beautiful besides everything else</li>
            <li>Although they took a long time to resolve the issue, the new set arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>However, you don’t get very much of any one color</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>This one is exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors I got, even though some are duplicates or very similar.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied with the different colors and things, as well as the variety.</li>
            <li>There were so many different colors</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>The only con was some containers had more product than others and it took awhile for my package to arrive.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the tiny jars which are costly as well, they will be used over and over again!</li>
            <li>there are so many different colors!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really pretty colors, alot fell out; but I was pretty satisfied overall though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it came in other than those negatives I love them!</li>
            <li>some of the colors is the sand material, this works just as well &amp; at times even gives a better look that the regular glitter</li>
            <li>Very upset with this order!</li>
            <li>Next time i need/want more glitter</li>
            <li>for nail art it is a lot;)</li>
            <li>Many were starting to spill or halfway unscrewed.</li>
            <li>Same problem as many.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Most of the glitter seeped out from the individual containers.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are interested in using glitter as a makeup accessory but don’t yet know what colors</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty</li>
            <li>So many different colors and variations of colors.</li>
            <li>but i dnt mind since theyre so pretty .</li>
            <li>My product came three weeks ahead of time and my product was exactly as it was as pictured.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering similar products :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d store them flat, stacking is okay</li>
            <li>We really don&#x27;t want our money back, we would love to use the product.</li>
            <li>Secondly let me just say how much I stinking love</li>
            <li>The clear plastic container that held them all had opened in shipping and one little container of glitter was open and spilled out in the package, but for the price and the great deal, there is no way I will complain about that!</li>
            <li>Would be good for small events or children&#x27;s parties.</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to order these again - it was worth having to clean up the extra glitter that had spilled in the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The containers are only 1/4 full of the glitter!</li>
            <li>They came in a large shipping envelope with bubble wrap inside, and the glitters were packed in a disposable plastic box/container (however</li>
            <li>None of the jars were opened or spilled, and while i had some similar colors the variety was great with no true duplicates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The glitters are fine enough to use on the eyes and not cause irritation.</li>
            <li>my product was barely full and they containers lost product on the way because they were barely screwed shut!</li>
            <li>When I received my product, some of the containers were kind of opened, and it had spilled a little in the bag, but at $5, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I do wish that the colors we a little more widely variegated but, I received what was promised (45 different colored pots of glitter) and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>it thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t spill too much n</li>
            <li>Many of the glitter pots weren&#x27;t closed..</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing another set when these run out.</li>
            <li>Prive can&#x27;t be beat and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It blends very well when you mixing 2 colors for an ombre.</li>
            <li>there is just so much glitter in this pack.</li>
            <li>Came very well packaged,</li>
            <li>no broken containers or spills of glitter.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>But for such a low price and all of the ones you get, i think it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li>and it does ship fast( coming from a girl in Texas )</li>
            <li>For example I got about 4 purple and one was light, one was shimmery bluish purple, pinkish purple, and another different tone of purple almost plum.</li>
            <li>The lids aren&#x27;t on the containers very well.  </li>
            <li>But they werent packaged very well.</li>
            <li>My 8yr old and I had lots of fun with this color set</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from China to US.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>These applied really well to my manicure and my gel mani</li>
            <li>I enjoy this set and definitely would repurchase it!</li>
            <li>worked very well Thanks</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend these to everyone who likes glitter for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I use them for makeup and they work really well.</li>
            <li>They work really well with glitter tattoo glue.  </li>
            <li>Yes, some of them were a little less full than others, but honestly $5.00 for 45 glitters is fantastic and really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>The glitter itself looks very fine, but some larger individual flakes are showing up here and there.</li>
            <li>not a single one container was spilled, they were well packaged and all the lids were closed, the colors are amazing,</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this but half of the glitter containers were opened and split all over even before I opened the box.</li>
            <li>, some of the glitters are nice and radiant (good product) while some are more dull and less shimmery (not all glitter is created equal), but this is expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>Wow this glitters are really pretty and out of 45</li>
            <li>As for the colors, I think only two were true repeats in my case.</li>
            <li>but I did expect the tiny jars to be full (as some of them are).</li>
            <li>Most of them are only half full though</li>
            <li>but you have to carefully because it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>Also- shipping time was decent..</li>
            <li>Came quickly too, only 5 days!!</li>
            <li>It took so long to get it the first time that it isnt worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>I AM NOT THE FIRST TO COMPLAIN OF SAME EXACT THING</li>
            <li>If you need a decent amount of a particular color I would just pony up and purchase one color at a time somewhere else</li>
            <li>Sorry for the picture quality i love this i tried then today for my eyeshadow makeup and in work more than 10 people told my</li>
            <li>Even though they&#x27;re tiny they should last a while :)</li>
            <li>And though the pots are small you should be able to  get many uses out of it (if the pots aren&#x27;t empty).</li>
            <li>First off lets be clear there is obviously a few colors that i don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>they were only filled  with glitter 1/4th full, 3/4th empty.</li>
            <li>Oh and I do highly recommend e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>I found one jar of glitter in particular that was pretty loosely screwed on, but with all the traveling in trucks/boats/planes +handling that my package went through, I was glad it was only one loose jar and glad that it didn&#x27;t open all the way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestion to the seller: a little tape might help with the packaging issues that so many people seem to have when they receive their glitter.</li>
            <li>Your product is great, but a few tiny improvements in packaging would probably make a big difference.</li>
            <li>It adheres very well so far.</li>
            <li>Wish it would have arrived in more of a timely fashion, and package a bit messy.</li>
            <li>* be aware that some of the containers are really lose you have to pay attention while you open the box.</li>
            <li>Kinda messy but love the colors</li>
            <li>Already sent the link to this product to a few friends :)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a pretty wide range of colors in the set I purchased, so I&#x27;m not unhappy.</li>
            <li>A few of the darker glitter are more visible than the lighter colors.</li>
            <li>the colors are so vibrant and they open so easily so they don&#x27;t accidentally pop open.</li>
            <li>Many of the containers emptied in the packaging, some were half full others wew nearly empty.</li>
            <li>Right when I open the package theres glitter all over my clothes, table, and floor.</li>
            <li>Big mistake, there was barely any glitter in each of the containers, many colors were similar.</li>
            <li>Most of the pots were only half full and all the colors had mixed together!!!</li>
            <li>all the pots were more than half full (much fuller and you&#x27;d have trouble getting the lids off without spilling), except one which had &#x27;leaked&#x27; during shipping.</li>
            <li>They came earlier then expected which was a huge plus along with the quality of the glitters!</li>
            <li>This is an ok buy, smaller than expected</li>
            <li>And since there were extras it&#x27;s only fair that a sister hooks up the other with a few colors, right??</li>
            <li>So I was very surprised by what I to in the mail.</li>
            <li>The colors are different and really pretty.</li>
            <li>first off i got a bunch of tiny 1 gram twist close jars thrown in a zipper seal bag...</li>
            <li>but they are actually about the exact size of a quarter...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked at the other reviews about this product and it said they got some of the same glitter colors more than once</li>
            <li>Most of the colors appear to be noticeably different, although there are several that seem to be so similar they could not be told apart.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time to do my nails last night.</li>
            <li>so if you have a larger project in mind you would be better off buying larger individual tubs.</li>
            <li>Of course these were a little bit messy when I got them, but as soon as I got all the lids tightened and brushed off, I used them and loved them!</li>
            <li>The spillage was normal, the caps weren&#x27;t all screwed tight, but they never came off and the pots that aren&#x27;t full of glitter are colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally use any way.</li>
            <li>Some weren&#x27;t even half way filled.</li>
            <li>so I just got a huge glittery plastic mess.  </li>
            <li>There was only one that was not screwed on very tightly but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>It took a very long time for them to arrive but the price was right.  </li>
            <li>If you ran a strip of tape along the little pots while they were in their rows, they would be less likely to fly all over in the package if they do escape from the clear plastic holder.</li>
            <li>The grains of glitter are large and unsafe for use near the eyes, I would only recommend people to use this for nail art</li>
            <li>Use this on top of my gelish nail polish to give my manicures a little something extra.</li>
            <li>If you use on eyes use a clear creamy eye product to get to stick.</li>
            <li>: photo shows them stacked neatly in a clear plastic box.</li>
            <li>Overall I just didn&#x27;t like this much.</li>
            <li>You get all different colors and they work really well as eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 8 year old daughter to go with a Shimmer glitter tattoo kit that I bought her.</li>
            <li>One whole container was open and spilled all over the package.  </li>
            <li>I hoped they had fixed the problem</li>
            <li>lasted weeks with much stronger &#x27;French&#x27; glitter tips and no issues (photo posted).</li>
            <li>Glitter everywhere, nothing was screwed on tight, all of them were out of the original box it was placed in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors small but just the right amount</li>
            <li>every single vial was full to the brim and none were open and spilled.</li>
            <li>Granted the jars are small, but that can easily be seen in the photos.</li>
            <li>I adore that they are small and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>And yes, some have full jars and some have half jars.  </li>
            <li>I use these everyday pretty much.</li>
            <li>I think for the price you actually do get a decent product</li>
            <li>You get an immense variety of vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>I needed a little of a few different colors so for me this was a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>the containers  were pretty much empty.</li>
            <li>Just make sure they are closed tightly before shipping.</li>
            <li>Jars do have a dip in the bottom reducing the amount, but it is still a decent amount and worth the small price.  </li>
            <li>A few repeat colors and a little spilling during shipment, but other than that it&#x27;s a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, there was some spillage, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>The containers were pretty much empty!</li>
            <li>Only one of the lids wasn&#x27;t screwed on and it was one of my least favorite colors and barely any spilt.</li>
            <li>Receive most of them empty and open, they were a mess...</li>
            <li>no gold blue orange yellow copper white pastel colors or much of anything else...</li>
            <li>Almost all the containers were barely opened and I lost almost a 1/4 of glitter from each container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why a company that makes such a beautiful product would bother to ship its product with poor quality control.</li>
            <li>I have only one issue with them which I read in the other reviews, that some of the containers dont have very much sparkle in them.</li>
            <li>but it does not have the same high end look as the more expensive glitter shadows.</li>
            <li>no loose glitter no spills.</li>
            <li>Yes the containers are very small, but they weren&#x27;t even filled.</li>
            <li>I mean, how much money are they saving by shortchanging us a very inexpensive product while they are damaging their rep in the process.</li>
            <li>pretty much wasted my money on this gamble...</li>
            <li>In mine I got several pinks, a couple silvers, a few golds, one black, one white,  a couple browns, a few yellows, a good amount of greens+blues, and a couple purples.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for these, bought for my nails and for my makeup, showed up a few days earlier then expected...</li>
            <li>I purchased this assortment of glitter due to a high demand with butterflies and leopard spots.</li>
            <li>Also, if you taped the clear plastic container shut with just a small piece of tape, it might stay enclosed the whole time and there would be fewer complaints.</li>
            <li>Colors vary from neon orange to black; there are like 5-6 different shades of blue, 4 different shades of pink, 3 shades of purple, and many other colors.</li>
            <li>You will get tiny containers that are less than 1/4 full, as the other reviews state.</li>
            <li>I would think with how small the container is, it would at least be pretty full...</li>
            <li>BUT they come more then half empty in the little  containers.</li>
            <li>There was a little bit of glitter in the packaging but not too much.</li>
            <li>Glitter&#x27;s difficult to clean, and I don&#x27;t necessarily want light pink glitter mixed in with my other colors.</li>
            <li>Product was less than half full.</li>
            <li>The containers were all closed so no mess!</li>
            <li>Came quickly but very small amounts of glitter were in the tiny jars.</li>
            <li>And a lot, almost half of the tops cake loose and not twisted close all the way.</li>
            <li>Most colors were broken and the other half the casings didnt have much product in them</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are perfect and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but when I opened the package glitter was spilled on me!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I will be sure to order again when I run out, I have recommended to all my friends!</li>
            <li> It is not packaged like it is in the picture, which is probably why one of them spilled a bit, but that&#x27;s okay!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> use it for nail art and my clients love it!</li>
            <li> Got covered in glitter when the package arrived, but I love the variety of colors!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and the glitter is very fine.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing</li>
            <li> The glitter is amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing-</li>
            <li> They state that they are an honest company and would like to fix the mistake.</li>
            <li> Popular with my clients</li>
            <li> Others were nice.</li>
            <li> really liked the product..</li>
            <li> I recieved my glitters and the packaging was kind of jacked up</li>
            <li> I use them for my eyes and they stay on really nice.</li>
            <li> honestly wouldn&#x27;t mind buying again.</li>
            <li> It sticks nicely to her skin and in her  hair.</li>
            <li> No glitter was out of the containers and there was a nice array of colors.</li>
            <li> the glitter arrived in a zip lock bag not in a nice organized box as seen in the pictures.</li>
            <li> but, in my experience, that&#x27;s just kind of what happens with glitter.  </li>
            <li> They were in plastic nicely wrapped there was so glitter</li>
            <li> The glitter looks really nice on too.</li>
            <li> AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice</li>
            <li> These are so worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I use them mainly for makeup, but they are wonderful for glitter tattoos as well!</li>
            <li> they come in a nice flexible plastic box that&#x27;s great for storage, and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I think thanksgiving, and just received it, was true to colors, and great for body glitter</li>
            <li> The glitter itself is very fine and a nice product that we plan to use for glitter eye-shadow and glitter tattoos.</li>
            <li> A variety of colors and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I use glitter a ton, it doesn&#x27;t bother my face and the colors are amazing :)</li>
            <li> The containers came full and a nice variety of colors were included!</li>
            <li> Product is still nice, thankfully there are many containers.  </li>
            <li> I love how it comes packaged in it&#x27;s own plastic case that fits so well in my kit.</li>
            <li> the fun level is great.  </li>
            <li> Bright Pink and Copper are the two most popular color requests. :D</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, and the shipping went a lot faster than the forecasted delivery date of Jan 9 - Jan 27, which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> The packaging is not the best as they never completely closed the lids of the glitter and some of it dumped out.</li>
            <li> great color selection, really versatile!</li>
            <li> The package arrived very quickly, which was nice.</li>
            <li> All of my cases were filled to the top as well!</li>
            <li> I received them today and honestly, while the colors are very pretty, about 80% of the glitter was all over the bag!</li>
            <li> But if your using this for glitter tatoos you will need a lot more of it.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love how it looks♥♥</li>
            <li> all fine.my kid love</li>
            <li> I love these glitters.</li>
            <li> You get so many for the price.  </li>
            <li> And I waited more than a month to get them.</li>
            <li> I love love loooooove this.</li>
            <li> So many colors to chose from you can match almost anything.</li>
            <li> and those who love to add glitter to your nails.</li>
            <li> They are really cute.</li>
            <li> also hope others have a much better experience with this company than I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put on my nails and it works perfect and they are all different colors and shades!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something better.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> LOVE the glitter not a fan of the Shimmer Dust Powder though it tends to clump up like sugar when you apply it over a eye glitter primer/glue</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many things from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I did because the Shimmer tattoo kit arrived with glitter everywhere</li>
            <li> The glitter worked wonderfully with the extra glue and stencils that I bought.</li>
            <li> and I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> love these</li>
            <li> The picture didn&#x27;t show that there were as many duplicates as there were.</li>
            <li> Overall a great deal!</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more glitter to be in the containers.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much more color than we&#x27;d ever use.</li>
            <li> i love it and recommend it to all of my friends</li>
            <li> there were so many colours, not a ton of repeat colours----great selection and quality.</li>
            <li> Just like many others said here.  </li>
            <li> I did not receive many duplicates.</li>
            <li> Love the value...</li>
            <li> Despite much of what I saw in the reviews claiming that this product was a shipping disaster, the product arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> My kids love glitter tatoos</li>
            <li> They need to put them in a better container</li>
            <li> the glitter was everywhere, you have to make sure that, the product is going to be intact when the costumer get it</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> so I figured one or more had opened, but after opening them and checking all 45 colors it looks like glitter from packaging and not from the containers in the package.</li>
            <li> there is A LOT of glitter more than I will ever use for nail art.</li>
            <li> I will order another set soon, that&#x27;s how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love these glitters.</li>
            <li> Perfect for beginners who need variety and want to test different colors.</li>
            <li> Ok if they would have come in without glitter everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love the colors of this product</li>
            <li> Love that I got so many</li>
            <li> They last and the color pay off is great!</li>
            <li> if they would guarantee they will add more glitter to each container</li>
            <li> I love love love these glitter.</li>
            <li> I have been searching a long time for perfect glitter dust but most of them in amazon are glitter shell.</li>
            <li> But most weren&#x27;t even a 1/4 full!</li>
            <li> Fantastic selection of colors and all are good quality super fine glitter.  </li>
            <li> There arent very full either.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but mini containers weren&#x27;t even filled halfway.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for nails :)</li>
            <li> To be fair it doesn&#x27;t say how much glitter there should be</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> the company refused to replace my product, but offered full refund.. for this i have changed my rating to 3 stars!</li>
            <li> I like the glitter containers and color varieties, but the glitter containers need to be full!</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative to some if the more higher priced eye glitters out currently.</li>
            <li> one cap loose a lil glitter spilled out but not a whole lot all in all very happy beautiful colors for many looks</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery .</li>
            <li> But for the most part there was enough variance to keep me happy.  </li>
            <li> Steady handed, adult supervision is probably best if purchasing them for minors.</li>
            <li> wish these glitters were ore fine.</li>
            <li> I got this order quickly and as promised!</li>
            <li> Came a little spilt over but all in all great colors!</li>
            <li> But, I do like the glitter a lot, it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous and the glitter is finely milled to be safe enough for your eyes.</li>
            <li> Great value you get literally 45 different colors for $10</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use 2 colors so far, but they are both beautiful on!</li>
            <li> the pros is that it was cheap and affordable and u do get quite a bit of glitters for $7.00</li>
            <li> So happy about all of the different colors!</li>
            <li> some are iridescent, some are metallic, and i even got one fantastic holographic silver.  </li>
            <li> but overall this is a great product</li>
            <li> One last problem is that I didn&#x27;t get all there colors that were in the picture, I like what i got, but I was not too happy about it.</li>
            <li> Overall great stuff for nail art and for face makeup.</li>
            <li> The jars aren&#x27;t even filled all the way, or evenly.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these sparkles.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product!!!</li>
            <li> but, the colors are nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I make soaps so I plan on putting the wild colors like super bright yellows, greens, or blues in the soap, using any of the colors for illustrations that I do,  and using the golds, blacks, browns, and reds for my makeup.</li>
            <li> The person stated that original email was not sent by him and that his colleague forgot to send out the replacement because I did not respond that I would remove the feedback.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a significant difference in price points though.</li>
            <li> But for the price they are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> and i am pretty sure I&#x27;m set for life.</li>
            <li> containers to use but still, really fun!</li>
            <li> These are really worth the price!</li>
            <li> i loved them all got here really fast but got some repeats and some 3 of a kind but still got like 35 different colors</li>
            <li> I have ordered many other glitter products and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Most Of The Containers Were Kind of Open</li>
            <li> Took forever to clean up each container and the glitter that was spread everywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pots are plastic screw top, 1 inch in diameter filled 1/4 inch in depth - about as much as the pots will realistically hold.</li>
            <li> They are gorgeous, and although they arrived unscathed, I am glad I read the reviews and opened the bag carefully.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive this package</li>
            <li> but there are so many it wasn&#x27;t really an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> I like the product I just wish they came full instead of halfway full.</li>
            <li> The glitters would have been gorgeous if they weren&#x27;t all mixed together...</li>
            <li> As well as some of them weren&#x27;t as full as they should have been.</li>
            <li> The actual product it self is good.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use at the local fair to make glitter tattoos.  </li>
            <li> The package was so full of glitter that escaped that it blanketed the floor and my lap where I was sitting.</li>
            <li> YES, IT TAKES ONE FULL MONTH TO ARRIVE AND THE WEAR AND TEAR DEF SHOWS].</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li> they were all the way full when i got them.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind there are alot of colors so its not a bad deal.  </li>
            <li> Pretty quick for coming all that way!</li>
            <li> The outside packing was very good, but MANY of the glitter containers were OPEN (not twisted shut).  </li>
            <li> This product is very pretty and has a lot of colors.</li>
            <li> some colors were very pretty.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11 and all things colorful and tattooy are cool....</li>
            <li> but other than that, they&#x27;re amazing!</li>
            <li> There are so many different shades and they were all full!</li>
            <li> Absolutely  amazing different shades of pinks blues greens so happy I ordered despite many negative reviews!</li>
            <li> Unless you own a nail salon, there really is no reason to be dissatisfied, as there is so much product and so many colors.</li>
            <li> Nice amount for the price but one of my had jar broke open and glitter all over in the package.</li>
            <li> (if even that think more of a light &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; amount)...just enough to coat the jar and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s glitter.</li>
            <li> Dont be fooled by the cheap price it is well worth it to buy a real cosmetic grade glitter set.</li>
            <li> I assume that&#x27;s because there are different sellers, but it would have been nice to have gotten some of the pastels that are shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Also glitter varies not only in color but in how fine the glitter is, some are larger pieces that are more costume-like, others are very fine for like eye makeup or you hair/body.</li>
            <li> other than one of the pods being open when it arrived, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Right place for shopping.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and item</li>
            <li> and it just wasn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> for all the repeat colors i&#x27;ll just go out buy some more small jars and combine them and buy my own colors...</li>
            <li> Most were actually only 1/4 full.</li>
            <li> they loved my makeup i would recommended and it arrived in only 2 days i live in texas</li>
            <li> and I have found that this set definitely comes in handy and if I use more of a color I can always go out and buy a big glitter in that color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fun to clean up, but my daughter is thrilled.</li>
            <li> Company sent a brand new set free of charge.  </li>
            <li> There are multiplies of certain colors but that doesn&#x27;t bug me since there are still a lot to choose from!</li>
            <li> The containers of glitter are not that filled and super small wish they were bigger colors are beautiful besides everything else</li>
            <li> Although they took a long time to resolve the issue, the new set arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> However, you don’t get very much of any one color</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> This one is exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors I got, even though some are duplicates or very similar.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied with the different colors and things, as well as the variety.</li>
            <li> There were so many different colors</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> The only con was some containers had more product than others and it took awhile for my package to arrive.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the tiny jars which are costly as well, they will be used over and over again!</li>
            <li> there are so many different colors!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really pretty colors, alot fell out; but I was pretty satisfied overall though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it came in other than those negatives I love them!</li>
            <li> some of the colors is the sand material, this works just as well &amp; at times even gives a better look that the regular glitter</li>
            <li> Very upset with this order!</li>
            <li> Next time i need/want more glitter</li>
            <li> for nail art it is a lot;)</li>
            <li> Many were starting to spill or halfway unscrewed.</li>
            <li> Same problem as many.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Most of the glitter seeped out from the individual containers.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are interested in using glitter as a makeup accessory but don’t yet know what colors</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty</li>
            <li> So many different colors and variations of colors.</li>
            <li> but i dnt mind since theyre so pretty .</li>
            <li> My product came three weeks ahead of time and my product was exactly as it was as pictured.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering similar products :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d store them flat, stacking is okay</li>
            <li> We really don&#x27;t want our money back, we would love to use the product.</li>
            <li> Secondly let me just say how much I stinking love</li>
            <li> The clear plastic container that held them all had opened in shipping and one little container of glitter was open and spilled out in the package, but for the price and the great deal, there is no way I will complain about that!</li>
            <li> Would be good for small events or children&#x27;s parties.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to order these again - it was worth having to clean up the extra glitter that had spilled in the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The containers are only 1/4 full of the glitter!</li>
            <li> They came in a large shipping envelope with bubble wrap inside, and the glitters were packed in a disposable plastic box/container (however</li>
            <li> None of the jars were opened or spilled, and while i had some similar colors the variety was great with no true duplicates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The glitters are fine enough to use on the eyes and not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> my product was barely full and they containers lost product on the way because they were barely screwed shut!</li>
            <li> When I received my product, some of the containers were kind of opened, and it had spilled a little in the bag, but at $5, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I do wish that the colors we a little more widely variegated but, I received what was promised (45 different colored pots of glitter) and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t spill too much n</li>
            <li> Many of the glitter pots weren&#x27;t closed..</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing another set when these run out.</li>
            <li> Prive can&#x27;t be beat and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It blends very well when you mixing 2 colors for an ombre.</li>
            <li> there is just so much glitter in this pack.</li>
            <li> Came very well packaged,</li>
            <li> no broken containers or spills of glitter.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> But for such a low price and all of the ones you get, i think it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> and it does ship fast( coming from a girl in Texas )</li>
            <li> For example I got about 4 purple and one was light, one was shimmery bluish purple, pinkish purple, and another different tone of purple almost plum.</li>
            <li> The lids aren&#x27;t on the containers very well.  </li>
            <li> But they werent packaged very well.</li>
            <li> My 8yr old and I had lots of fun with this color set</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from China to US.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> These applied really well to my manicure and my gel mani</li>
            <li> I enjoy this set and definitely would repurchase it!</li>
            <li> worked very well Thanks</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend these to everyone who likes glitter for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I use them for makeup and they work really well.</li>
            <li> They work really well with glitter tattoo glue.  </li>
            <li> Yes, some of them were a little less full than others, but honestly $5.00 for 45 glitters is fantastic and really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The glitter itself looks very fine, but some larger individual flakes are showing up here and there.</li>
            <li> not a single one container was spilled, they were well packaged and all the lids were closed, the colors are amazing,</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this but half of the glitter containers were opened and split all over even before I opened the box.</li>
            <li> , some of the glitters are nice and radiant (good product) while some are more dull and less shimmery (not all glitter is created equal), but this is expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> Wow this glitters are really pretty and out of 45</li>
            <li> As for the colors, I think only two were true repeats in my case.</li>
            <li> but I did expect the tiny jars to be full (as some of them are).</li>
            <li> Most of them are only half full though</li>
            <li> but you have to carefully because it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> Also- shipping time was decent..</li>
            <li> Came quickly too, only 5 days!!</li>
            <li> It took so long to get it the first time that it isnt worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I AM NOT THE FIRST TO COMPLAIN OF SAME EXACT THING</li>
            <li> If you need a decent amount of a particular color I would just pony up and purchase one color at a time somewhere else</li>
            <li> Sorry for the picture quality i love this i tried then today for my eyeshadow makeup and in work more than 10 people told my</li>
            <li> Even though they&#x27;re tiny they should last a while :)</li>
            <li> And though the pots are small you should be able to  get many uses out of it (if the pots aren&#x27;t empty).</li>
            <li> First off lets be clear there is obviously a few colors that i don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li> they were only filled  with glitter 1/4th full, 3/4th empty.</li>
            <li> Oh and I do highly recommend e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> I found one jar of glitter in particular that was pretty loosely screwed on, but with all the traveling in trucks/boats/planes +handling that my package went through, I was glad it was only one loose jar and glad that it didn&#x27;t open all the way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestion to the seller: a little tape might help with the packaging issues that so many people seem to have when they receive their glitter.</li>
            <li> Your product is great, but a few tiny improvements in packaging would probably make a big difference.</li>
            <li> It adheres very well so far.</li>
            <li> Wish it would have arrived in more of a timely fashion, and package a bit messy.</li>
            <li> * be aware that some of the containers are really lose you have to pay attention while you open the box.</li>
            <li> Kinda messy but love the colors</li>
            <li> Already sent the link to this product to a few friends :)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pretty wide range of colors in the set I purchased, so I&#x27;m not unhappy.</li>
            <li> A few of the darker glitter are more visible than the lighter colors.</li>
            <li> the colors are so vibrant and they open so easily so they don&#x27;t accidentally pop open.</li>
            <li> Many of the containers emptied in the packaging, some were half full others wew nearly empty.</li>
            <li> Right when I open the package theres glitter all over my clothes, table, and floor.</li>
            <li> Big mistake, there was barely any glitter in each of the containers, many colors were similar.</li>
            <li> Most of the pots were only half full and all the colors had mixed together!!!</li>
            <li> all the pots were more than half full (much fuller and you&#x27;d have trouble getting the lids off without spilling), except one which had &#x27;leaked&#x27; during shipping.</li>
            <li> They came earlier then expected which was a huge plus along with the quality of the glitters!</li>
            <li> This is an ok buy, smaller than expected</li>
            <li> And since there were extras it&#x27;s only fair that a sister hooks up the other with a few colors, right??</li>
            <li> So I was very surprised by what I to in the mail.</li>
            <li> The colors are different and really pretty.</li>
            <li> first off i got a bunch of tiny 1 gram twist close jars thrown in a zipper seal bag...</li>
            <li> but they are actually about the exact size of a quarter...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at the other reviews about this product and it said they got some of the same glitter colors more than once</li>
            <li> Most of the colors appear to be noticeably different, although there are several that seem to be so similar they could not be told apart.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time to do my nails last night.</li>
            <li> so if you have a larger project in mind you would be better off buying larger individual tubs.</li>
            <li> Of course these were a little bit messy when I got them, but as soon as I got all the lids tightened and brushed off, I used them and loved them!</li>
            <li> The spillage was normal, the caps weren&#x27;t all screwed tight, but they never came off and the pots that aren&#x27;t full of glitter are colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally use any way.</li>
            <li> Some weren&#x27;t even half way filled.</li>
            <li> so I just got a huge glittery plastic mess.  </li>
            <li> There was only one that was not screwed on very tightly but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time for them to arrive but the price was right.  </li>
            <li> If you ran a strip of tape along the little pots while they were in their rows, they would be less likely to fly all over in the package if they do escape from the clear plastic holder.</li>
            <li> The grains of glitter are large and unsafe for use near the eyes, I would only recommend people to use this for nail art</li>
            <li> Use this on top of my gelish nail polish to give my manicures a little something extra.</li>
            <li> If you use on eyes use a clear creamy eye product to get to stick.</li>
            <li> : photo shows them stacked neatly in a clear plastic box.</li>
            <li> Overall I just didn&#x27;t like this much.</li>
            <li> You get all different colors and they work really well as eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year old daughter to go with a Shimmer glitter tattoo kit that I bought her.</li>
            <li> One whole container was open and spilled all over the package.  </li>
            <li> I hoped they had fixed the problem</li>
            <li> lasted weeks with much stronger &#x27;French&#x27; glitter tips and no issues (photo posted).</li>
            <li> Glitter everywhere, nothing was screwed on tight, all of them were out of the original box it was placed in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors small but just the right amount</li>
            <li> every single vial was full to the brim and none were open and spilled.</li>
            <li> Granted the jars are small, but that can easily be seen in the photos.</li>
            <li> I adore that they are small and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> And yes, some have full jars and some have half jars.  </li>
            <li> I use these everyday pretty much.</li>
            <li> I think for the price you actually do get a decent product</li>
            <li> You get an immense variety of vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I needed a little of a few different colors so for me this was a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> the containers  were pretty much empty.</li>
            <li> Just make sure they are closed tightly before shipping.</li>
            <li> Jars do have a dip in the bottom reducing the amount, but it is still a decent amount and worth the small price.  </li>
            <li> A few repeat colors and a little spilling during shipment, but other than that it&#x27;s a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, there was some spillage, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> The containers were pretty much empty!</li>
            <li> Only one of the lids wasn&#x27;t screwed on and it was one of my least favorite colors and barely any spilt.</li>
            <li> Receive most of them empty and open, they were a mess...</li>
            <li> no gold blue orange yellow copper white pastel colors or much of anything else...</li>
            <li> Almost all the containers were barely opened and I lost almost a 1/4 of glitter from each container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why a company that makes such a beautiful product would bother to ship its product with poor quality control.</li>
            <li> I have only one issue with them which I read in the other reviews, that some of the containers dont have very much sparkle in them.</li>
            <li> but it does not have the same high end look as the more expensive glitter shadows.</li>
            <li> no loose glitter no spills.</li>
            <li> Yes the containers are very small, but they weren&#x27;t even filled.</li>
            <li> I mean, how much money are they saving by shortchanging us a very inexpensive product while they are damaging their rep in the process.</li>
            <li> pretty much wasted my money on this gamble...</li>
            <li> In mine I got several pinks, a couple silvers, a few golds, one black, one white,  a couple browns, a few yellows, a good amount of greens+blues, and a couple purples.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for these, bought for my nails and for my makeup, showed up a few days earlier then expected...</li>
            <li> I purchased this assortment of glitter due to a high demand with butterflies and leopard spots.</li>
            <li> Also, if you taped the clear plastic container shut with just a small piece of tape, it might stay enclosed the whole time and there would be fewer complaints.</li>
            <li> Colors vary from neon orange to black; there are like 5-6 different shades of blue, 4 different shades of pink, 3 shades of purple, and many other colors.</li>
            <li> You will get tiny containers that are less than 1/4 full, as the other reviews state.</li>
            <li> I would think with how small the container is, it would at least be pretty full...</li>
            <li> BUT they come more then half empty in the little  containers.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of glitter in the packaging but not too much.</li>
            <li> Glitter&#x27;s difficult to clean, and I don&#x27;t necessarily want light pink glitter mixed in with my other colors.</li>
            <li> Product was less than half full.</li>
            <li> The containers were all closed so no mess!</li>
            <li> Came quickly but very small amounts of glitter were in the tiny jars.</li>
            <li> And a lot, almost half of the tops cake loose and not twisted close all the way.</li>
            <li> Most colors were broken and the other half the casings didnt have much product in them</li>
            <li> They come about 1/3 full though and they were all just about half way open so a little spilled out of each.</li>
            <li> I responded that they had already agreed to replace the order per previous conversations and was waiting to receive the new product.  </li>
            <li> but no mess like other reviews.</li>
            <li> these are very pretty, hard to stay on my eyes without getting on mycheeks but what a value!</li>
            <li> Only thing is that they took a long time to come in.  </li>
            <li> Several of the containers lids were barely closed which caused glitter to spill out everywhere, and one was completely open so the entire color was lost.</li>
            <li> Poor quality...not true to color and the glitter doesn&#x27;t seem to adhere to the nail.</li>
            <li> There are several pinks that look very similar, but the underlying tones, or hues are different, or one might have holographic glitter inside and the other might not.</li>
            <li> They last on my nail for a really long time too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset, this is the second time I ordered this product, first I received an empty black box, and today I received a mess.</li>
            <li> what you actually get is glitter containers loosely stuffed into a ziplock bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting maybe a few of the same colors but not nearly half of the 45</li>
            <li> While it may be true what some are saying about having multiple pink, blue, purple, gold etc, they failed to mention that it was different tones that the colors came in.</li>
            <li> I only got about half to a third of the total glitter by the time it got to me!</li>
            <li> I received multiple glitters of the same color in a big bag, and as the other reviewers have mentioned multiple containers of the glitter opened and created a giant mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> However it does take a long time because it comes from China.</li>
            <li> i was dissapointed though, not much in the dishes only about 1/4 glitter.</li>
            <li> Delivered way before expected, took only 12 days to receive.</li>
            <li> The order arrived earlier than expected and was neatly packed and shipped.</li>
            <li> When I opened it over several of the containers were empty and the glitter laid everywhere on the bottom of the box.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading all the reviews that my glitters will be all over the place and that I was gonna find empty containers or containers with glitter mixed, but it wasn&#x27;t the case!</li>
            <li> Long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It Took a Long Time For The Package</li>
            <li> and it was because not one of the containers were closed properly!</li>
            <li> And several are empty.  </li>
            <li> I got it a lot earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The quanity of actual glitter that you get in each container is minimal.</li>
            <li> I just spent about 10 minutes washing each one individually and drying them off</li>
            <li> but it took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> No, the pots aren&#x27;t all filled to the top but while some of the colors may seem duplicate in bad lighting, there are very subtle differences.</li>
            <li> Some of the spilled product cross contaminated my other colors.</li>
            <li> I might have to buy other specific colors separately though.</li>
            <li> A LIITLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> The other reviews were correct, you get the package and almost every individual container is opened.  </li>
            <li> but when I got the package glitter was everywhere and half of the caps on the containers were loose and a lot of the colors barely had any glitter.</li>
            <li> A few shades are similar, but tonally different or reflecting different effects from each other (see photo).</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the caps on almost half were not tightly closed, thus leaving some containers about half full as well as contaminating some of the other colors, not to mention the mess.</li>
            <li> Several other lids were very loose.  </li>
            <li> This is the first one I can say I am truly not happy with.</li>
            <li> Add all the glitter loose in the package and you could probably fill 2 containers.</li>
            <li> loose lids, glitter everywhere --</li>
            <li> There was some loose glitter in the plastic, but none was &#x27;falling out&#x27; or leaking.</li>
            <li> I checked and found one loose lid that I screwed on</li>
            <li> By that I mean, a pink will reflect opalescent pearl, a coral will have kaleidoscope, a gold will have a pink flake or a green will have a gold reflect effect and a blue will reflect a green effect while others are their true foil with no refract effect beyond the sparkling glitter itself.</li>
            <li> I had tne same problem as a previous reviewer.</li>
            <li> Half of the glitter was open</li>
            <li> Now I just have a big mess</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s glitter all over the shipping envelope, it&#x27;s just one big mess.</li>
            <li> Because some of the container arrived open it was a mess</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because some containers were spilled and almost half empty</li>
            <li> the majority of my colors i got were blue pink purple red and green and one black and a reddish brown...</li>
            <li> They definitely add a little flair to everything I do with them.</li>
            <li> have a little left to shake..</li>
            <li> I was a little thrown off by the sizes I thought they would be slightly bigger</li>
            <li> For about $5, and 45 different colors, there&#x27;s little to complain about.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the sheer number of little containers of glitter that came.</li>
            <li> The glitter had no fall out but the plastic box the glitter came in had lots of glitter on it including the little individual glitter containers.</li>
            <li> The only thing was that some of the lids were a little loose and there was a lot of glitter when I opened up the package!</li>
            <li> This glitter set has every color you could ever want, they are small containers but obviously glitter goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They are not neon pink like the picture, they are fushia instead.</li>
            <li> It was as expected, glitter for glitter tattoos.  </li>
            <li> some of which weren&#x27;t even closed</li>
            <li> but my silver was almost empty</li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks to get the glitter which I expected.  </li>
            <li> and they arrived 2 weeks before the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> they are what I expected..</li>
            <li> some completely empty, some almost empty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thy came within the expected time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m missing 2, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> There is a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> then I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful working with these.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I did EXTREMELY glitter heavy looks on myself and several friends and didn&#x27;t seem to make a dent at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered something internationally and was a little skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Some glitters were not full, and the only black glitter in the box was spilled everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can complain about is that a few of the glitters weren&#x27;t sealed tightly, so they were almost empty because of leakage.</li>
            <li> so there is very little glitter in total.  </li>
            <li> a few of the jars&#x27; lids were slightly unloosened but not enough to ruin it for me.</li>
            <li> it came in n all over the other containers.</li>
            <li> A lot of colors and a lot cheaper than what I have paid on other sites.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t leak, but some of the lids were very loose and about to!</li>
            <li> Other Than That I Complain About It &amp;</li>
            <li> I know two other people that are also planning to order them just from seeing mine.</li>
            <li> I received these with no spill issues other reviewers encountered so it seems there&#x27;s inconsistency with delivery?</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> BUT that&#x27;s to be expected!</li>
            <li> so you will only receive a small amount of glitter.</li>
            <li> They have never caused any eye irritation though I am very careful in applying this glitter.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that there was a lot less in each container than I expected, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Half were empty</li>
            <li> and that some of the lids weren&#x27;t fully closed tightly which spilled glitter in the bag</li>
            <li> I think there were a few repeat colors or at least a few tubs are similar enough that I can’t tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> We waited for a very long time to get this product and were so disappointed to find EMPTY CONTAINERS and containers half full).  </li>
            <li> the reason I gave this product 4 stars is the containers are smaller than I thought but its not too bad  and the glitter is so pretty</li>
            <li> but I would not purchase again due to the mess it arrived in.</li>
            <li> at least 5 colors were doubled up on and 2 were tripled and 1 had 4 of  the same color.</li>
            <li> but after a few tries I got it</li>
            <li> for update; Aug 8, 2013:  Company contacted me via email yesterday and asked again if they could refund &#x27;half my money&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> (they come from China) about a month and half..</li>
            <li> I could have gone to my local craft store and got the same thing,&#x27;not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> but when I got it, the black glitter pot was exploded all over the box.  </li>
            <li> One of the containers opened in shipping and when I opened the box it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Totally exploded into a glittery mess in the box, they were much smaller than I expected and awkward</li>
            <li> A couple was not screwed on to tight and got all over the box.</li>
            <li> My package was wrapped tight and neat...</li>
            <li> I would screw them on tight once received.</li>
            <li> No glitter was spilled out, the package was tight.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because of the little mess, but</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of glitter in the box</li>
            <li> and it was a little messy when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused why everyone is complaining about there being the same color.  </li>
            <li> is that they came in a plastic Baggie with is not secure packaging in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I think she&#x27;ll be wearing glitter everyday.</li>
            <li> and the glue all dried up.</li>
            <li> Came from China and took about 1 week and a few days..</li>
            <li> I got a few multiples.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not filled all the way up.</li>
            <li> Yes there was glitter in the package, some caps were unscrewed and some pots were not filled</li>
            <li> OVER 80% OF THE GLITTER WAS WASTED IN PACKAGE WHEN RECEIVED...</li>
            <li> I mean for $5 you get what you pay for my only complaint</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I was very excited to find these glitters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong was that some of the containers weren&#x27;t tightened so there was glitter all in the box</li>
            <li> jars are small too (will upload pic asap).</li>
            <li> so I guess u get what u pay for! :/</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> My pots were rather small but</li>
            <li> SMALL</li>
            <li> The tins of glitter are relatively small (approx.</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> Also they were sent to me in a ziploc bag not a nice box like the picture suggests :/</li>
            <li> Tried this on nails NOT a good idea looks aweful so then tried to use on eyes and a bit messy.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT COSMETIC GRADE GLITTER AND IS NOT SUITABLE FOR THE EYE OR FACE AREA.</li>
            <li> Had it forever and hardly dented it.</li>
            <li> , some are hard to distinguish from one another</li>
            <li> but they are a bit hard to apply if your not a profesional</li>
            <li> They agreed to replace the product in exchange for removing negative feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a complaint and everyone loves the selection.</li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews about this product and decided to order it any way.</li>
            <li> The only down side was that some of them spilled in the packaging :(</li>
            <li> Yes the containers are small but what do you expect for $8!</li>
            <li> but I mean, it&#x27;s glitter</li>
            <li> Lots of repeat colors, and the tins are very small but works well for manicures</li>
            <li> They are very small in size</li>
            <li> Colors are very small to begin with, then when opening the box a quarter of the colors tops were off and glitter was everywhere.</li>
            <li> Oh and the glitter containers are very very small</li>
            <li> very small amount of glitter,</li>
            <li> It seems so silly to go through all the trouble to package it</li>
            <li> the diameter of a quarter and maybe three times as thick) and held in a thin plastic box.</li>
            <li> The worse: the pots are very small</li>
            <li> I however have been waiting for pastels,  white and  creams and didnt get any... :(  </li>
            <li> Some were already open and spilled everywhere :(</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d think if they gave a crap they would put even a tiny piece of tape on the lid to hold it shut..about 6 jars had maybe 1/8 of a tsp</li>
            <li> Sloppy packaging</li>
            <li> For the price, you can not go wrong</li>
            <li> Really sad and makes me kinda mad</li>
            <li> This item is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> But a disappointment when i noticed it was shipped from CHINA</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE CRAZY GLUE WITH THIS .</li>
            <li> Was spilled all through the bag it was in, shipped poorly!!</li>
            <li> Obsessed with my glitters!</li>
            <li> But wasn;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I am just disappointed at the packaging.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, but they are working to resolve the issue once</li>
            <li> Along with a gold base and glitter primer.</li>
            <li> I use it for eyeshadow with a cream base.</li>
            <li> Consider all the bad press?!</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in all the duplicates.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but when I opened it I was shocked!!!</li>
            <li> they were packaged so bad!!!</li>

            <li> Works well, but pinks are not the same color as shown in the picture.  They are not neon pink like the picture, they are fushia instead.</li>
            <li> I ordered these several weeks before a party I needed them for.  It took a very long time for them to arrive but the price was right.  When they came there was several that had spilled open but there are so many it wasn&#x27;t really an issue for me.  It was as expected, glitter for glitter tattoos.  There are a variety of colors and stays on well with the body glue.</li>
            <li> One of the glitters was open and it got all over the place.</li>
            <li> This product is very pretty and has a lot of colors. However it does take a long time because it comes from China. mine took a month beware. i was dissapointed though, not much in the dishes only about 1/4 glitter. Keep in mind there are alot of colors so its not a bad deal.  I however have been waiting for pastels,  white and  creams and didnt get any... :(  so now I will have to buy some.  Over all they did what they said and the colors are beautiful. But if your using this for glitter tatoos you will need a lot more of it.  - Curls</li>
            <li> I use glitter a ton, it doesn&#x27;t bother my face and the colors are amazing :)</li>
            <li> Great product and variety in colors!  The price is amazing and I have used this product now in one of my gel tip manicures and it looked great!</li>
            <li> I love the colors. I use them for my eyes : all I need to do is put some eyelash glue on and it stays on all day. I love, love, love how it looks♥♥</li>
            <li> Right place for shopping.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and item all fine.my kid love it thank you so much. No Package cases just individual in the bag but good price.can not complain.</li>
            <li> The outside packing was very good, but MANY of the glitter containers were OPEN (not twisted shut).  When I opened the box, glitter was everywhere!  We waited for a very long time to get this product and were so disappointed to find EMPTY CONTAINERS and containers half full).  It seems so silly to go through all the trouble to package it so nice(bubble wrap around the product), if the containers inside are not sealed.  I&#x27;m going to try to contact the company and see if they will fix this in anyway. The glitter itself is very fine and a nice product that we plan to use for glitter eye-shadow and glitter tattoos. The ordered was placed June 14, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit for update; JULY 20,2013:  The company has been in contact via email and seems to be responsive to our issue. They state that they are an honest company and would like to fix the mistake. They offered a $4.00 refund, but I asked for them to exchange the set.  We really don&#x27;t want our money back, we would love to use the product. They agreed to replace the product in exchange for removing negative feedback. We will update again once the issue is resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit for update; Aug 8, 2013:  Company contacted me via email yesterday and asked again if they could refund &#x27;half my money&#x27;.  I responded that they had already agreed to replace the order per previous conversations and was waiting to receive the new product.  The person stated that original email was not sent by him and that his colleague forgot to send out the replacement because I did not respond that I would remove the feedback. Very disappointing, but they are working to resolve the issue once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit for update:  Aug 26, 2013: Company sent a brand new set free of charge.  My 2 star rating is now changed to 4 stars.  Although they took a long time to resolve the issue, the new set arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> wish these glitters were ore fine. good price tho</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved this gift.</li>
            <li> Great bargain for the price. The colors are amazing and the size is perfect for traveling. My only complaint would be that the caps on almost half were not tightly closed, thus leaving some containers about half full as well as contaminating some of the other colors, not to mention the mess.</li>
            <li> The colors are different and really pretty. The worse: the pots are very small but it&#x27;s a very good deal</li>
            <li> Wish the container lids didn&#x27;t loosen.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star cause of delivery date I ordered it this way before xmas I think thanksgiving, and just received it, was true to colors, and great for body glitter but order it 2 months in advance</li>
            <li> I love these glitters. I use them mainly for makeup, but they are wonderful for glitter tattoos as well! They definitely add a little flair to everything I do with them. The package arrived very quickly, which was nice. The only thing I can complain about is that a few of the glitters weren&#x27;t sealed tightly, so they were almost empty because of leakage. Other than that, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love them all! I use for makeup and they work great!</li>
            <li> Popular with my clients</li>
            <li> Product is GREAT. No repeat colors. Delivered way before expected, took only 12 days to receive. The packaging was good. The only thing wrong was that some of the containers weren&#x27;t tightened so there was glitter all in the box it came in n all over the other containers. It didn&#x27;t spill too much n I just took each one, tightened them n put it under running water for like 3 secs n it was cleaned!</li>
            <li> I feel like I will have glitter for the rest of my life!  You get so many for the price.  I&#x27;m confused why everyone is complaining about there being the same color.  Some seem to just be different shades.  When I opened the package, there was some spillage, but nothing major.  Unless you own a nail salon, there really is no reason to be dissatisfied, as there is so much product and so many colors.</li>
            <li> This glitter set has every color you could ever want, they are small containers but obviously glitter goes a long way. Great value you get literally 45 different colors for $10, you can&#x27;t beat that anywhere that I know of. Also glitter varies not only in color but in how fine the glitter is, some are larger pieces that are more costume-like, others are very fine for like eye makeup or you hair/body. Colors vary from neon orange to black; there are like 5-6 different shades of blue, 4 different shades of pink, 3 shades of purple, and many other colors.</li>
            <li> Every color is stunning and there are some even holographic glitters in there! I am so beyond happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My daughter has used these with stencils to create body tatoos and it&#x27;s been perfect. There are some duplicates of the colors as others have noted but I was expecting that.</li>
            <li> Right when I open the package theres glitter all over my clothes, table, and floor. Many of the glitter pots weren&#x27;t closed.. Overall I just didn&#x27;t like this much.</li>
            <li> Beware, picture is not what you will get! You will get tiny containers that are less than 1/4 full, as the other reviews state. And I waited more than a month to get them.</li>
            <li> Great product . Very quick delivery . Kids had a great time placing tattoos using the glitter.  I will absolutely be purchasing another set when these run out.</li>
            <li> A lot of colors and a lot cheaper than what I have paid on other sites.  good buy</li>
            <li> No, the pots aren&#x27;t all filled to the top but while some of the colors may seem duplicate in bad lighting, there are very subtle differences. I do wish that the colors we a little more widely variegated but, I received what was promised (45 different colored pots of glitter) and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> great item to use and is good to use and carry.</li>
            <li> I love love loooooove this. You get all different colors and they work really well as eyeshadow. I use these everyday pretty much.</li>
            <li> I like the product I just wish they came full instead of halfway full.</li>
            <li> Some of the same Colors but still beats store prices</li>
            <li> Eye makeup. Additive in homemade soap. Arts and crafts. Nail art. So many colors to chose from you can match almost anything. Prive can&#x27;t be beat and shipping was fast. Had it forever and hardly dented it.</li>
            <li> One of the containers opened in shipping and when I opened the box it was a mess.  Other than that I got this order quickly and as promised!</li>
            <li> Got all the colors shown. Great addition for my tattoo business. Wish it would have arrived in more of a timely fashion, and package a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM! PERFECT FOR EYE-SHADOW DRAMA SO VIBRANT WITH COLOR AND GLAM!!! LOVE THEM! I STILL CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE LOW PRICE!</li>
            <li> For the price, you can not go wrong here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I donate my time to events and organizations with my face painting skills. I purchased this assortment of glitter due to a high demand with butterflies and leopard spots. I&#x27;ve never had a complaint and everyone loves the selection. Bright Pink and Copper are the two most popular color requests. :D</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the value and quality of product. The containers came full and a nice variety of colors were included!</li>
            <li> These are so worth the money!!! I received them well ahead of the estimated arrival time and every single vial was full to the brim and none were open and spilled. The colors are gorgeous and the glitter is very fine. I can&#x27;t wait to buy some sculpting gel and use it!</li>
            <li> Nice amount for the price but one of my had jar broke open and glitter all over in the package. Didn&#x27;t bother with the hassle to return but it did suck to lose one entire color. Others were nice.</li>
            <li> I received them today and honestly, while the colors are very pretty, about 80% of the glitter was all over the bag! The containers were pretty much empty! I contacted the company about this issue and I&#x27;m waiting for a response. Also they were sent to me in a ziploc bag not a nice box like the picture suggests :/</li>
            <li> Wow this glitters are really pretty and out of 45 I only got 5 dupes.! The containers were all closed so no mess! I got mine about one week before I was supposed too! I would definitely recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product!!! I ran home after work to retrieve it but when I opened it I was shocked!!! Glitter everywhere!!! Most of the pots were only half full and all the colors had mixed together!!! If the seller can remedy this I would give 5⭐&#x27;S!!! The glitters would have been gorgeous if they weren&#x27;t all mixed together... And though the pots are small you should be able to  get many uses out of it (if the pots aren&#x27;t empty). Also- shipping time was decent.. Please remedy this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update- the company refused to replace my product, but offered full refund.. for this i have changed my rating to 3 stars! wish i could have gotten a replacement really liked the product..</li>
            <li> Came a little spilt over but all in all great colors!</li>
            <li> Perfect glitter dust for nail art! I have been searching a long time for perfect glitter dust but most of them in amazon are glitter shell. This one is exactly what I am looking for. I didn&#x27;t get any repeated color all of them are different. It blends very well when you mixing 2 colors for an ombre. BUT!!!** be aware that some of the containers are really lose you have to pay attention while you open the box.</li>
            <li> Alot of the colors are the same but atleast im set  on glitter for a bit</li>
            <li> these are very pretty, hard to stay on my eyes without getting on mycheeks but what a value! great fun and great price!</li>
            <li> First off lets be clear there is obviously a few colors that i don&#x27;t love but I know I can use as accent colors.  Secondly let me just say how much I stinking love these glitter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is great! there is just so much glitter in this pack. Definitely the cheapest I have seen! Granted the jars are small, but that can easily be seen in the photos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use 2 colors so far, but they are both beautiful on! I love the variety of colors I got, even though some are duplicates or very similar. The order arrived earlier than expected and was neatly packed and shipped. Love the price!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Colors! different shades of each color, some are hard to distinguish from one another so you might mistake them for duplicates. In my order i had 38 different colors and 7 duplicates. jars are small too (will upload pic asap). I am so in love with these! My order came in perfect condition, no spillage and no unscrewed cases. All of my cases were filled to the top as well! Would buy again. Recommended for people who love glitter! and those who love to add glitter to your nails.</li>
            <li> Glitter was everywhere when I opened my package. Lots of repeat colors, and the tins are very small but works well for manicures</li>
            <li> first off i got a bunch of tiny 1 gram twist close jars thrown in a zipper seal bag...some of which weren&#x27;t even closed so i opened a package to glitter everywhere...the majority of my colors i got were blue pink purple red and green and one black and a reddish brown...no gold blue orange yellow copper white pastel colors or much of anything else...you&#x27;d think if they gave a crap they would put even a tiny piece of tape on the lid to hold it shut..about 6 jars had maybe 1/8 of a tsp (if even that think more of a light &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; amount)...just enough to coat the jar and have a little left to shake..for all the repeat colors i&#x27;ll just go out buy some more small jars and combine them and buy my own colors...pretty much wasted my money on this gamble...</li>
            <li> They are really cute.</li>
            <li> I was a little thrown off by the sizes I thought they would be slightly bigger but they are actually about the exact size of a quarter... I mean for $5 you get what you pay for my only complaint is that they came in a plastic Baggie with is not secure packaging in my opinion. And a lot, almost half of the tops cake loose and not twisted close all the way. As well as some of them weren&#x27;t as full as they should have been. I would think with how small the container is, it would at least be pretty full... But again you get what you pay for. I bought these for makeup use so I&#x27;m satisfied with the different colors and things, as well as the variety.</li>
            <li> Lots of duplicate colors but no mess like other reviews. Tried this on nails NOT a good idea looks aweful so then tried to use on eyes and a bit messy. If you use on eyes use a clear creamy eye product to get to stick. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this but half of the glitter containers were opened and split all over even before I opened the box. When I opened it over several of the containers were empty and the glitter laid everywhere on the bottom of the box. Really sad and makes me kinda mad I spend money on a product that I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> I recieved my glitters and the packaging was kind of jacked up my the containers were tossed around everywhere and it just wasn&#x27;t right the pros is that it was cheap and affordable and u do get quite a bit of glitters for $7.00 so I guess u get what u pay for! :/</li>
            <li> I have no idea of the quality of the product since it was NEVER sent to me. I waited almost 2 months and never received what I paid for. I am very disappointed because I was very excited to find these glitters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess everything that &amp;#34;glitters&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t gold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hope others have a much better experience with this company than I did.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister and she LOVED it. Came very well packaged, no broken containers or spills of glitter. There are a couple of duplicate colors but she didn&#x27;t care. There were so many different colors I think she&#x27;ll be wearing glitter everyday. And since there were extras it&#x27;s only fair that a sister hooks up the other with a few colors, right?? ;)  The glitter is powder-fine and needs cosmetic glitter adhesive if you don&#x27;t want glitter all over your face but it&#x27;s a perfect consistency for highlighting eyes or cheeks, or use on nails. I think I&#x27;m going to have to buy one for myself now that I have seen hers!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to put on my nails and it works perfect and they are all different colors and shades! 3 stars only because some containers were spilled and almost half empty but I don&#x27;t mind since i will not be needing a lot of glitter but my silver was almost empty and thats the reason I even ordered this set.</li>
            <li> Kinda messy but love the colors</li>
            <li> my product was barely full and they containers lost product on the way because they were barely screwed shut!</li>
            <li> The glitter packs are probably the size of a quarter and out of the 45 I got 21 pinks and purple colored glitter. I was expecting maybe a few of the same colors but not nearly half of the 45, I did not like this I was expecting something better. Save yourself from the hassle and buy from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The product took for ever and only twelve color came in! Waste of my money! I Wouldn&#x27;t buy!! Don&#x27;t buy at all</li>
            <li> Love them. Just make sure they are closed tightly before shipping. A couple was not screwed on to tight and got all over the box.</li>
            <li> My package was wrapped tight and neat...no spill out! And I received no duplicate colors like some purchasers stated they received. The only con was some containers had more product than others and it took awhile for my package to arrive. LOVE the glitter not a fan of the Shimmer Dust Powder though it tends to clump up like sugar when you apply it over a eye glitter primer/glue (Elf has a $2 glitter primer that works really good)</li>
            <li> These are perfect and exactly what I needed. Thanks! I love the tiny jars which are costly as well, they will be used over and over again!</li>
            <li> Great Colors and number of colors.  Jars do have a dip in the bottom reducing the amount, but it is still a decent amount and worth the small price.  It did come to me in a package covered in glitter and a few of the jars&#x27; lids were slightly unloosened but not enough to ruin it for me.</li>
            <li> I love them! there are so many different colors! I use them for my eyes and they stay on really nice. I recommend!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really pretty colors, alot fell out; but I was pretty satisfied overall though.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly wouldn&#x27;t mind buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised by this product. I like it I don&#x27;t love it but it did what I needed it to do. I actually used it as eye shadow. Along with a gold base and glitter primer. Pigments are very good and of course it will add sparkle to ur look. I think for the price you actually do get a decent product but it does not have the same high end look as the more expensive glitter shadows. I&#x27;m not a make up artist but i do know my way around a brush and this is what I came up with on a practice run... Oh and I do highly recommend e.l.f. Glitter primer...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered something internationally and was a little skeptical.  It took about 3 weeks to get the glitter which I expected.  The glitter is very fine and perfect for glitter tattoos.  I will probably order these again.</li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews about this product and decided to order it any way. Big mistake, there was barely any glitter in each of the containers, many colors were similar. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This glitter is awesome! There are so many different shades and they were all full! The only thing was that some of the lids were a little loose and there was a lot of glitter when I opened up the package! Came quickly too, only 5 days!! I&#x27;m set with glitter for life!</li>
            <li> This item is a disappointment. It came in a zip lock bag, in a brown envelope. They are tiny in size, and as I took them out...glitter got everywhere!  I would not buy them again ! I&#x27;ve bought many things from Amazon. This is the first one I can say I am truly not happy with.</li>
            <li> So happy about all of the different colors! Mine didn&#x27;t leak, but some of the lids were very loose and about to! I would screw them on tight once received. Mybe if traveling bwith them, throw in a baggy. Really good value and wears well on the eye area if you have good glue. I have. Already sent the link to this product to a few friends :)</li>
            <li> This is an ok buy, smaller than expected and it was a little messy when it arrived.  But a disappointment when i noticed it was shipped from CHINA</li>
            <li> Alot of different colors to choose from. Yes the containers are very small, but they weren&#x27;t even filled. Some weren&#x27;t even half way filled. Then the package has glitter scattered throughout it. Add all the glitter loose in the package and you could probably fill 2 containers.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year old daughter to go with a Shimmer glitter tattoo kit that I bought her. I&#x27;m so glad that I did because the Shimmer tattoo kit arrived with glitter everywhere and the glue all dried up. The glitter worked wonderfully with the extra glue and stencils that I bought. My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset, this is the second time I ordered this product, first I received an empty black box, and today I received a mess. Glitter everywhere, nothing was screwed on tight, all of them were out of the original box it was placed in. The box was ripped open. No way it could have happened during shipping. I was so excited for these. Now I just have a big mess</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I love the colors. Used with a glitter glue and the payout is amazing!!! As a makeup artist I&#x27;m always on the hunt for inexpensive multicolored glitter sets to use on the eyes; well look no further bc this is it!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but when I opened the package glitter was spilled on me! Almost all the containers were barely opened and I lost almost a 1/4 of glitter from each container. I might have just been unlucky or something but they are very beautiful and they store very easily. ( ps. Very good price!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at the other reviews about this product and it said they got some of the same glitter colors more than once and that some of the lids weren&#x27;t fully closed tightly which spilled glitter in the bag it came in other than those negatives I love them!</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading all the reviews that my glitters will be all over the place and that I was gonna find empty containers or containers with glitter mixed, but it wasn&#x27;t the case! not a single one container was spilled, they were well packaged and all the lids were closed, the colors are amazing, great quality and they arrived 2 weeks before the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but mini containers weren&#x27;t even filled halfway. When I opened the package there was glitter everywhere. Delivery time took a while. The actual product it self is good. I used them as eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s glitter. there are a lot of colors. I use it when the tooth fairy comes.  the tooth fairy sprinkles glitter all over the house.  it&#x27;s not fun to clean up, but my daughter is thrilled. It sticks nicely to her skin and in her  hair.</li>
            <li> i got no repeats, just 45 awesome shades of glitter for a great price. some are iridescent, some are metallic, and i even got one fantastic holographic silver.  all the pots were more than half full (much fuller and you&#x27;d have trouble getting the lids off without spilling), except one which had &#x27;leaked&#x27; during shipping. they come in a nice flexible plastic box that&#x27;s great for storage, and they arrived quickly. i&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You get an immense variety of vibrant colors. They come about 1/3 full though and they were all just about half way open so a little spilled out of each. But for such a low price and all of the ones you get, i think it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> ALL my colors were DIFFERENT. This product is however not all glitter some of the colors is the sand material, this works just as well &amp; at times even gives a better look that the regular glitter but they are a bit hard to apply if your not a profesional but after a few tries I got it</li>
            <li> Receive most of them empty and open, they were a mess...defenetly wont recomend it!!</li>
            <li> The glitter is amazing and I use it all the time with my kit!  The only reason this isn&#x27;t five stars is because a lot of the glitter is basically transparent when applied and there are lots of duplicate colors.</li>
            <li> Most colors were broken and the other half the casings didnt have much product in them</li>
            <li> I bought these to use at the local fair to make glitter tattoos.  Awesome colors and the kids love the variety!  Only thing is that they took a long time to come in.  I think they come from china.</li>
            <li> I Loved The Colors &amp; the variety&lt;br /&gt;I used it For Make up/Eye Shadow &amp; it Last A Long time.&lt;br /&gt;The Only Thing Was That When i Got The Package Most Of The Containers Were Kind of Open So they spilled Out&lt;br /&gt;also It Took a Long Time For The Package To Be Delivered.&lt;br /&gt;But Other Than That I Complain About It &amp; They Refund My Money.</li>
            <li> the reason I gave this product 4 stars is the containers are smaller than I thought but its not too bad  and the glitter is so pretty and I do recommend it but just know that the containers are a bit smaller than what they seem but overall this is a great product and it does ship fast( coming from a girl in Texas )</li>
            <li> The containers of glitter are not that filled and super small wish they were bigger colors are beautiful besides everything else</li>
            <li> What I wanted and what I ordered</li>
            <li> Love these! Came from China and took about 1 week and a few days.. Pretty quick for coming all that way! I opened the package and was extremely pleased. No glitter was out of the containers and there was a nice array of colors. While it may be true what some are saying about having multiple pink, blue, purple, gold etc, they failed to mention that it was different tones that the colors came in. For example I got about 4 purple and one was light, one was shimmery bluish purple, pinkish purple, and another different tone of purple almost plum. These will last me awhile! I will be sure to order again when I run out, I have recommended to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Use this on top of my gelish nail polish to give my manicures a little something extra. Works like a charm! Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for nails :) I adore that they are small and easy to carry. Thanks so much!! These are great for everything I needed them for!!</li>
            <li> I had tne same problem as a previous reviewer. Many of the containers emptied in the packaging, some were half full others wew nearly empty. The package was so full of glitter that escaped that it blanketed the floor and my lap where I was sitting. It took so long to get it the first time that it isnt worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement. The glitter is great but they need to work on the packaging.</li>
            <li> One thing that I was disappoint about was the way it was packaged. It is not packaged like it is in the picture, which is probably why one of them spilled a bit, but that&#x27;s okay!  Another thing is that there was a lot less in each container than I expected, but I guess you get what you pay for. One last problem is that I didn&#x27;t get all there colors that were in the picture, I like what i got, but I was not too happy about it. But, I do like the glitter a lot, it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li> Very upset with this order! I received multiple glitters of the same color in a big bag, and as the other reviewers have mentioned multiple containers of the glitter opened and created a giant mess everywhere. DO NOT BE FOOLED- THIS IS NOT COSMETIC GRADE GLITTER AND IS NOT SUITABLE FOR THE EYE OR FACE AREA. The grains of glitter are large and unsafe for use near the eyes, I would only recommend people to use this for nail art and that is it. Dont be fooled by the cheap price it is well worth it to buy a real cosmetic grade glitter set.</li>
            <li> A few repeat colors and a little spilling during shipment, but other than that it&#x27;s a great price for what you get. I love it!</li>
            <li> For about $5, and 45 different colors, there&#x27;s little to complain about. When I received my product, some of the containers were kind of opened, and it had spilled a little in the bag, but at $5, I can&#x27;t complain. Some of the spilled product cross contaminated my other colors. Glitter&#x27;s difficult to clean, and I don&#x27;t necessarily want light pink glitter mixed in with my other colors. However, if you want immaculate packaging, I suggest purchasing a set of glitter from Martha Stewart. There&#x27;s a significant difference in price points though. The colors I received is different from what&#x27;s shown in the picture. I assume that&#x27;s because there are different sellers, but it would have been nice to have gotten some of the pastels that are shown in the picture. There&#x27;s a pretty wide range of colors in the set I purchased, so I&#x27;m not unhappy. If I run out of glitter, I can see myself purchasing another set. I might have to buy other specific colors separately though.</li>
            <li> The lids aren&#x27;t on the containers very well.  One whole container was open and spilled all over the package.  Several other lids were very loose.  Took forever to clean up each container and the glitter that was spread everywhere.</li>
            <li> Came as ordered. Sloppy packaging but all glitters were there with no repeats. Overall great stuff for nail art and for face makeup.</li>
            <li> I use these for crafts.. took awhile to get them (they come from China) about a month and half.. they are what I expected.. good color choices..</li>
            <li> I BELIEVE THIS IS SHIPPED BY DONKEY ACROSS THE HIMILAYAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[IN RESPONSE TO THE BUYER WHO INQUIRED ABOUT DELIVER TIME. YES, IT TAKES ONE FULL MONTH TO ARRIVE AND THE WEAR AND TEAR DEF SHOWS]. WHEN I FINALLY RCVD IT, THIS IS THE CLAIM I FIRED OFF [WILL UPDATE]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SLOW SHIPPING: took one month to arrive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAMAGED: loose lids, glitter everywhere -- some completely empty, some almost empty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DECEPTIVE: photo shows them stacked neatly in a clear plastic box. what you actually get is glitter containers loosely stuffed into a ziplock bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED: I WANT A REFUND without the hassle or cost of returning. I AM NOT THE FIRST TO COMPLAIN OF SAME EXACT THING, THOUGHT MAYBE THE PHOTO SHOWING THEM STACKED IN A BOX WAS AN INDICATOR THAT THE ISSUE MAY HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH. NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY DOES AMAZON ALLOW THEM TO KEEP DOING THIS?</li>
            <li> I only got about half to a third of the total glitter by the time it got to me! Was spilled all through the bag it was in, shipped poorly!! Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Thy came within the expected time. But they werent packaged very well. They came in a bag. Not box at all to keep them from moving around.  There was kinda alot of glitter inside the package that came out of the containers. I got a few multiples.  There arent very full either. Next time i need/want more glitter I will probably get it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine on December 12, and got it today on December 31. I live in Florida, and the shipping went a lot faster than the forecasted delivery date of Jan 9 - Jan 27, which was a pleasant surprise! They came in a large shipping envelope with bubble wrap inside, and the glitters were packed in a disposable plastic box/container (however im keeping mine in the plastic container thing bc it keeps them organized). There was a little bit of glitter in the packaging but not too much. Upon receiving them, I checked them all to see if any were damaged and to look at the colors. Yes, some of them were a little less full than others, but honestly $5.00 for 45 glitters is fantastic and really can&#x27;t be beat. I found one jar of glitter in particular that was pretty loosely screwed on, but with all the traveling in trucks/boats/planes +handling that my package went through, I was glad it was only one loose jar and glad that it didn&#x27;t open all the way. I can see how it could cause a big issue for someone else if one or more of their jars got twisted open. As for the colors, I think only two were true repeats in my case. Two pinks, and two oranges were the same. There are several pinks that look very similar, but the underlying tones, or hues are different, or one might have holographic glitter inside and the other might not. In mine I got several pinks, a couple silvers, a few golds, one black, one white,  a couple browns, a few yellows, a good amount of greens+blues, and a couple purples. I make soaps so I plan on putting the wild colors like super bright yellows, greens, or blues in the soap, using any of the colors for illustrations that I do,  and using the golds, blacks, browns, and reds for my makeup.</li>
            <li> Worked well with my stencils at a birthday party. A variety of colors and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  amazing different shades of pinks blues greens so happy I ordered despite many negative reviews! My pots were rather small but for nail art it is a lot;) no loose glitter no spills. however if I order again I want bigger tubes!!!</li>
            <li> Product was less than half full. Most were actually only 1/4 full. Seller did not seem too concerned. Did not get the variety of colors shown.</li>
            <li> I ordered these despite the reviews and I love them! Yes the containers are small but what do you expect for $8! Only one of the lids wasn&#x27;t screwed on and it was one of my least favorite colors and barely any spilt. Great glitter for use with gel nails!</li>
            <li> I was excepted that colors which are  shown on picture, but glitter colors are different</li>
            <li> amazing glitter!! love these</li>
            <li> I have yet to use these .....they were packaged so bad!!! The jars aren&#x27;t even filled all the way, or evenly. There&#x27;s glitter all over the shipping envelope, it&#x27;s just one big mess. I could have gone to my local craft store and got the same thing,&#x27;not impressed at all. Plus it takes forever because it&#x27;s coming from overseas - don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Christmas present for my girls.  When I opened the shipping box the glitter containers were rolling around on the bottom of the box, with three of them open.  I was very disappointed in all the duplicates.  The picture didn&#x27;t show that there were as many duplicates as there were.</li>
            <li> My items came in great condition with no spillage (thank god!) I do notice that the color selection varies by package because I did not get some of the same colors as some of the customer photos I see and there are duplicates.  Overall a great deal! I will be using for my lipsticks for the kaoir glitzstick effect. I will update with pictures of my product and how my lips turn out..</li>
            <li> The containers are only 1/4 full of the glitter! I&#x27;m missing 2, but that&#x27;s no big deal. There is a wide variety of colors. They arrived in great shape, with none opened in the bag. Overall...I like the glitter containers and color varieties, but the glitter containers need to be full! I mean, how much money are they saving by shortchanging us a very inexpensive product while they are damaging their rep in the process.</li>
            <li> Great color selections but I was expecting more glitter to be in the containers.</li>
            <li> Of course these were a little bit messy when I got them, but as soon as I got all the lids tightened and brushed off, I used them and loved them! There are multiplies of certain colors but that doesn&#x27;t bug me since there are still a lot to choose from! They last on my nail for a really long time too! 4 stars because of the little mess, but really...it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Some were already open and spilled everywhere :( not coll.</li>
            <li> My 8yr old and I had lots of fun with this color set and it&#x27;s much more color than we&#x27;d ever use.</li>
            <li> I use them for my eyes and i don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to make my eyes pop out i love it and recommend it to all of my friends</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these sparkles. I have only one issue with them which I read in the other reviews, that some of the containers dont have very much sparkle in them. But for the price they are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Hi! I just received these glitter colors as a gift. The colors are beautiful and are replacing others I had that had spilled. They are gorgeous, and although they arrived unscathed, I am glad I read the reviews and opened the bag carefully. Many were starting to spill or halfway unscrewed. I&#x27;m not sure why a company that makes such a beautiful product would bother to ship its product with poor quality control. Consider all the bad press?!</li>
            <li> VERY BEAUTIFUL COLORS. THERE SMALL BUT YOU WONT REGRET IT! A LIITLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> there were so many colours, not a ton of repeat colours----great selection and quality. they are also in twist close jars so they dont pop open by accident as some do!</li>
            <li> Just like many others said here.  Half of the glitter was open so I just got a huge glittery plastic mess.  Gross.  Never again.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the bag they came in I went to reach in and realized there was glitter everywhere and it was because not one of the containers were closed properly!</li>
            <li> other than one of the pods being open when it arrived, this product is awesome. I use it for eyeshadow with a cream base.</li>
            <li> They come in a big bag and they are all leaked into the bag. Very messy.</li>
            <li> The packaged arrived with glitter everywhere. Several of the containers lids were barely closed which caused glitter to spill out everywhere, and one was completely open so the entire color was lost. My daughter loves having all the colors but I would not purchase again due to the mess it arrived in.</li>
            <li> When you look at the cheapest products, expect the cheapest products. There are a ton of colors. I did not receive many duplicates. I purchased them for glitter tattoos. The plastic glitter has imperfections (string like components). I gave them to my sister for crafting and card making. She loves them.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect purchase to have every color glitter you can imagine without spending a fortune!</li>
            <li> Poor quality...not true to color and the glitter doesn&#x27;t seem to adhere to the nail. Tried applying two coats of glitter, but color glitter still wouldn&#x27;t show on the nail. A few of the darker glitter are more visible than the lighter colors.</li>
            <li> Same problem as many.  Glitter EVERYWHERE!  And several are empty.  I hoped they had fixed the problem but they did not.  Product is still nice, thankfully there are many containers.  My daughter will still use them in her birthday party goodie bags.</li>
            <li> They work good but you have to carefully because it spreads easily. DO NOT USE CRAZY GLUE WITH THIS .</li>
            <li> Love the value...great color selection. Best part was is I got it a lot earlier than expected. Fast shipping from China to US. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item it&#x27;s cool it&#x27;s looks awesome on your body that you just don&#x27;t want to take it off your body that&#x27;s why I purchased it</li>
            <li> Despite much of what I saw in the reviews claiming that this product was a shipping disaster, the product arrived on time and in great condition. The tins of glitter are relatively small (approx. the diameter of a quarter and maybe three times as thick) and held in a thin plastic box. There was some loose glitter in the plastic, but none was &#x27;falling out&#x27; or leaking. Most of the colors appear to be noticeably different, although there are several that seem to be so similar they could not be told apart. The glitter itself looks very fine, but some larger individual flakes are showing up here and there. I&#x27;ll write in an edit for the future applications to see if they hold up.</li>
            <li> Great color choice. My kids love glitter tatoos</li>
            <li> Most of the glitter seeped out from the individual containers. The ones that were still intact. We&#x27;re not filled all the way up. They were much smaller then I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> I really like this. But when received them my glitters were all over the bag. They need to put them in a better container so they won&#x27;t spill like it happen to me.</li>
            <li> The other reviews were correct, you get the package and almost every individual container is opened.  It&#x27;s a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> The quanity of actual glitter that you get in each container is minimal.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the sheer number of little containers of glitter that came. I love them! The clear plastic container that held them all had opened in shipping and one little container of glitter was open and spilled out in the package, but for the price and the great deal, there is no way I will complain about that! I know two other people that are also planning to order them just from seeing mine. I would not hesitate to order these again - it was worth having to clean up the extra glitter that had spilled in the package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion to the seller: a little tape might help with the packaging issues that so many people seem to have when they receive their glitter. If you ran a strip of tape along the little pots while they were in their rows, they would be less likely to fly all over in the package if they do escape from the clear plastic holder. Also, if you taped the clear plastic container shut with just a small piece of tape, it might stay enclosed the whole time and there would be fewer complaints. Your product is great, but a few tiny improvements in packaging would probably make a big difference. Thanks!</li>
            <li> the glitter arrived in a zip lock bag not in a nice organized box as seen in the pictures. the containers were all slightly open and the glitter was spilled out and mixed a bit. the containers  were pretty much empty. they were only filled  with glitter 1/4th full, 3/4th empty. at least 5 colors were doubled up on and 2 were tripled and 1 had 4 of  the same color. some colors were very pretty.</li>
            <li> they were all the way full when i got them. They lasted me over a year, and i used them a lot.</li>
            <li> So yes there will be glitter everywhere but, in my experience, that&#x27;s just kind of what happens with glitter.  I just spent about 10 minutes washing each one individually and drying them off so we&#x27;ll see if that works.  The issue is that the jars aren&#x27;t great and a lot of them don&#x27;t stay screwed shut.  And yes, some have full jars and some have half jars.  I needed a little of a few different colors so for me this was a good purchase.  If you need a decent amount of a particular color I would just pony up and purchase one color at a time somewhere else so you can get what you need.  Otherwise, these are good for the color variation and the price.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time to do my nails last night. The packaging is not the best as they never completely closed the lids of the glitter and some of it dumped out.</li>
            <li> Because some of the container arrived open it was a mess the glitter was everywhere, you have to make sure that, the product is going to be intact when the costumer get it</li>
            <li> Very tiny containers that spill out when opened. Beautiful bright colors. Would be good for small events or children&#x27;s parties. Shipping took awhile.</li>
            <li> great color selection, really versatile! use it for nail art and my clients love it! also cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> I use these to dip in my gel nails for a french tip look. They are very small in size but, the colors are nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I use this glitter as eyeshadow and I get so many compliments. The colors are gorgeous and the glitter is finely milled to be safe enough for your eyes. Excellent alternative to some if the more higher priced eye glitters out currently.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for these, bought for my nails and for my makeup, showed up a few days earlier then expected... But most weren&#x27;t even a 1/4 full! I don&#x27;t think I could get even one manicure out of one color...</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this set. So I was very surprised by what I to in the mail. They were in plastic nicely wrapped there was so glitter that was in the package so I figured one or more had opened, but after opening them and checking all 45 colors it looks like glitter from packaging and not from the containers in the package. there is A LOT of glitter more than I will ever use for nail art. I AM VERY HAPPY with what I GOT and I am looking forward to using it. The glitter looks really nice on too. I put it on m ring finger nail and I get complements all the time.</li>
            <li> Came quickly but very small amounts of glitter were in the tiny jars. A couple of the, were the same color.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. There was a little bit of glitter in the box but I mean, it&#x27;s glitter, I kinda expect that. None of the jars were opened or spilled, and while i had some similar colors the variety was great with no true duplicates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for renaissance faire makeup and i am pretty sure I&#x27;m set for life. I did EXTREMELY glitter heavy looks on myself and several friends and didn&#x27;t seem to make a dent at all. Really  great deal.</li>
            <li> I will order another set soon, that&#x27;s how much I love this product. No glitter was spilled out, the package was tight. I also did not receive duplicate colors. I love it, love it. Did I say love it!!!</li>
            <li> I received these with no spill issues other reviewers encountered so it seems there&#x27;s inconsistency with delivery? A few shades are similar, but tonally different or reflecting different effects from each other (see photo). By that I mean, a pink will reflect opalescent pearl, a coral will have kaleidoscope, a gold will have a pink flake or a green will have a gold reflect effect and a blue will reflect a green effect while others are their true foil with no refract effect beyond the sparkling glitter itself. See photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glitters are uniform grain, a fine sand in size and have a lot of impressive, reflective sparkle character. It&#x27;ll be versatile for makeup or nail applications and the occasional craft which I wanted them for. It adheres very well so far. I&#x27;d be careful working with these. Use them over a sheet of paper and expect a collection of &#x27;rainbow&#x27; to accrue. Tap them before twisting the caps. Steady handed, adult supervision is probably best if purchasing them for minors. I&#x27;d store them flat, stacking is okay and mine came with plastic envelopes. I checked and found one loose lid that I screwed on tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pots are plastic screw top, 1 inch in diameter filled 1/4 inch in depth - about as much as the pots will realistically hold. That&#x27;s a the size of a page, 11.25 inches of glitter but 1 inch deep. A lot of glitter! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. These applied really well to my manicure and my gel mani lasted weeks with much stronger &#x27;French&#x27; glitter tips and no issues (photo posted). I received a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE COLORS…..THEY R NOT AS BIG AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT WILL ORDER THEM AGAIN WHEN NEEDED…..</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive this package but when I got it, the black glitter pot was exploded all over the box.  Some glitters were not full, and the only black glitter in the box was spilled everywhere.  Other than that, some of the glitters are nice and radiant (good product) while some are more dull and less shimmery (not all glitter is created equal), but this is expected for the price.  I am just disappointed at the packaging.</li>
            <li> I love these glitters. My package came early than expected. Yes there was glitter in the package, some caps were unscrewed and some pots were not filled BUT that&#x27;s to be expected! The spillage was normal, the caps weren&#x27;t all screwed tight, but they never came off and the pots that aren&#x27;t full of glitter are colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally use any way. I think this is a great starter glitter set. I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist and I have found that this set definitely comes in handy and if I use more of a color I can always go out and buy a big glitter in that color. I love how it comes packaged in it&#x27;s own plastic case that fits so well in my kit. The glitters are fine enough to use on the eyes and not cause irritation. I enjoy this set and definitely would repurchase it!</li>
            <li> I just received my glitters and I am very happy. There was only one that was not screwed on very tightly but other than that it is great. Perfect for beginners who need variety and want to test different colors.</li>
            <li> The glitter arrived in the package all over the place</li>
            <li> worked very well Thanks</li>
            <li> I found this to be a great buy.  Each tub was small (which was expected) but full and all the containers were properly sealed.  I think there were a few repeat colors or at least a few tubs are similar enough that I can’t tell the difference.  But for the most part there was enough variance to keep me happy.  I would recommend this product if you are interested in using glitter as a makeup accessory but don’t yet know what colors/looks you want to create.  However, you don’t get very much of any one color so if you have a larger project in mind you would be better off buying larger individual tubs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic selection of colors and all are good quality super fine glitter.  Most of them are only half full though so there is very little glitter in total.  To be fair it doesn&#x27;t say how much glitter there should be but I did expect the tiny jars to be full (as some of them are).</li>
            <li> Ok if they would have come in without glitter everywhere. Half were empty</li>
            <li> Gorgeous glitters. BUT they come more then half empty in the little  containers.</li>
            <li> daughter loves it...the colors are awesome...the product containers are sturdy...the fun level is great.  My daughter is 11 and all things colorful and tattooy are cool....so this was perfect.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but when I got the package glitter was everywhere and half of the caps on the containers were loose and a lot of the colors barely had any glitter.</li>
            <li> I love the colors of this product the colors are so vibrant and they open so easily so they don&#x27;t accidentally pop open. I have ordered many other glitter products and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Sorry for the picture quality i love this i tried then today for my eyeshadow makeup and in work more than 10 people told my they loved my makeup i would recommended and it arrived in only 2 days i live in texas ❤️</li>
            <li> Totally exploded into a glittery mess in the box, they were much smaller than I expected and awkward containers to use but still, really fun! Even though they&#x27;re tiny they should last a while :)</li>
            <li> Love that I got so many they were packaged well and no leaks!</li>
            <li> Amazing- Rad- Great Price!!</li>
            <li> Got covered in glitter when the package arrived, but I love the variety of colors!</li>
            <li> I use this glitter for eye makeup. They last and the color pay off is great! They have never caused any eye irritation though I am very careful in applying this glitter. I would recommend these for cosmetic use.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. But wasn;t that bad. I will probley not reccomend this product to any one to buy.</li>
            <li> Colors are very small to begin with, then when opening the box a quarter of the colors tops were off and glitter was everywhere.</li>
            <li> OVER 80% OF THE GLITTER WAS WASTED IN PACKAGE WHEN RECEIVED... I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE ...</li>
            <li> The glitter had no fall out but the plastic box the glitter came in had lots of glitter on it including the little individual glitter containers. You will have to wash them off before use. Oh and the glitter containers are very very small so you will only receive a small amount of glitter. The glitters are beautiful! It&#x27;s definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> very small amount of glitter, very disappointed. if they would guarantee they will add more glitter to each container then I may consider changing my opinion and review of this seller.</li>
            <li> They came earlier then expected which was a huge plus along with the quality of the glitters! So many different colors and variations of colors. Absolutely recommend these to everyone who likes glitter for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> one cap loose a lil glitter spilled out but not a whole lot all in all very happy beautiful colors for many looks</li>
            <li> Love it! Obsessed with my glitters! Awesome deal. Look forward towards purchasing another set soon. (:</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and i only got 3 repeats ofcolors but i dnt mind since theyre so pretty . They have any color imagineable</li>
            <li> I love love love these glitter. They are easy to apply and came in good sizes and a great variety of colors. The only down side was that some of them spilled in the packaging :( but other than that, they&#x27;re amazing! I use them for makeup and they work really well.</li>
            <li> My nefuew loved the glitter but it took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> These are really worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a school party for glitter tattoos.  The colors are really nice and you get a great variety.  They work really well with glitter tattoo glue.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> i loved them all got here really fast but got some repeats and some 3 of a kind but still got like 35 different colors</li>
            <li> My product came three weeks ahead of time and my product was exactly as it was as pictured.I will be ordering similar products :)</li>
            <li> Pretty colors small but just the right amount</li>
