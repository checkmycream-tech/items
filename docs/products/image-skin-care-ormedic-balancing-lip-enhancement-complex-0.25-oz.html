            <li>I loved it so much I wanted to buy it right away, however this product is so popular they can&#x27;t keep it on their shelves</li>

            <li>This is hands down the best gloss.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth consistency.</li>

            <li>It does have a very pleasant consistency and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; but it is not any more effective in alleviating chapped lips than the less expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to give the full effect.</li>
            <li>It really does make your lips nice and smooth especially in dry weather.  </li>

            <li>I use this on both male and female patients before I clean their teeth.</li>

            <li>them soft much longer than any other lip product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>this is NOT cheap but it is worth every cent.  </li>

            <li>I love the consistency, a little thick, but not goopy.  </li>

            <li> I love the consistency, a little thick, but not goopy.  </li>
            <li> They appreciate the subtle unexpected flavor of it (who wants hum-drum Vasoline?)  </li>
            <li> Small in size, but positive can bring it on the airplane...</li>
            <li> so I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This has not only helped my lips, but, also helped the dry spots I&#x27;ve been getting around my lips from facials.</li>
            <li> I wear long lasting lipstick during he day and it tends to dry out my lips.  </li>
            <li> I had ever tried that actually healed my dry, peeling lips!</li>
            <li> Not waxy and stays on lips for a long time</li>
            <li> and I have not had chapped or dry lips regardless of weather or time of year.</li>
            <li> have extremely dry skin and nothing</li>
            <li> I tried it as I have dry, chapped lips</li>
            <li> I like this product because I have very dry lips.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and unlike other lip moisturizers, it is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Only need a really small amount</li>
            <li> Also, after reading other reviews, I hoped it would help with chapped lips, but it does an average job in this area.</li>
            <li> However, the price tag of $22.00 (shipped) is a little steep for such a small tube.</li>
            <li> All that you need is very little - it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is not too thick, but thick enough to last.  </li>
            <li> No more dry cracky lips for me...</li>
            <li> but the price could be less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky, but not like lip lacquer sticky.</li>

            <li> No more chapped lips after using this product.  I use it every night and I have not had chapped or dry lips regardless of weather or time of year.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips so smooth and soft! And it stays on for hours! It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> After trying so many yucky and gummy products in the winter for dry lips, my sister told me about this lip product.  This is the most amazing stuff ever!  So smooth!  Use it every night before bed and right before Hubby gets home from work.  Getting several as stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> I had a facial and my therapist used this. It makes the lips hydrated and supple. Small in size, but I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought Image Skin care Ormedic Balancing Lip Enhancement Complex 0.25 oz for my daughter who has chapped lips during the cold months. This lip balm is the only lip balm that actually heals and treats her chapped lips! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m giving this as gifts!its fabulous and it works !  The price is worth the benefit it gives!</li>
            <li> This the best lip conditioning prep I have ever used. it makes the lips hydrated and supple. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would highly recommend this product. Great stocking stuffer for all. I received this last year from a friend.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every lip balm product you can buy from the drugstore.  I am an avid chapstick user, have been for years.  I could never quite find anything that kept my lips moisturized any longer than an hour.  Chapstick was okay, but I had to constantly reapply it.  I happened upon this nice little product during a makeup sesion for my upcoming wedding.  It is by far, one of the best products I have used to help retain moisture for my lips!  I love the consistency, a little thick, but not goopy.  Nice scent/flavor and it gives a nice \\&quot;dewey\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVER LIP BALM... ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY NEEDS TO ADD SPF TO THE PRODUCT OR YOU NEED TO APPLY SPF TO YOUR LIPS...or you could just use it at night...</li>
            <li> Got it so fast. Best product for your lips. Been using it for years and just love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> This product is sooooooooooo nice.  It really does make your lips nice and smooth especially in dry weather.  However, the price tag of $22.00 (shipped) is a little steep for such a small tube.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this lip &amp;#34;balm!&amp;#34;  I have a tube by my bed, in my purse, in my gym bag and at work.  I highly recommend this product for anyone--male or female--who wants to keep their kisser in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> This product makes your lips feel so soft and hydrated!  Will definitely order again!  Thank you to my hair stylist who recommended it to me!</li>
            <li> I got a facial a few weeks ago they used this on my lips at the end. I loved it so much I wanted to buy it right away, however this product is so popular they can&#x27;t keep it on their shelves so I ended up ordering it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin and nothing seemed to help until this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, and that is the only reason I rated it with 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years and love it.  It has a great texture and smell and makes your lips shiny and full. Sometimes I will dot it on over lipstick, or just wear it by itself.</li>
            <li> All that you need is very little - it goes a long way.  I like to apply it during the day, but especially before bedtime.  Your lips will feels super soft.</li>
            <li> I think that I am hooked on this one!  My lips never felt so soft!  It is worth the money!!</li>
            <li> First time I tried it was at a spa in Tucson. Like how it looked and feels. Does add moisture to my aging lips.</li>
            <li> I had a facial and my aesthetician introduced me to this line and I am hooked!  This was lip balm she used on me during the facial Yes, it is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way. I use this on both male and female patients before I clean their teeth. They appreciate the subtle unexpected flavor of it (who wants hum-drum Vasoline?)  I highly recommend this for a birthday gift, a gift for yourslelf, a stocking stuffer, or for your dental office who wants to go the extra mile in patient care. It has a smooth consistency. It is neither sticky nor clumpy. Highly recommend this among other things in this line including facial cleanser, eye lotion, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product it&#x27;s the only lip enhancement that work for me but the price could be less. Well I&#x27;m very satisfied with the outcome my lips feel soft and moist throughout the day. No more dry cracky lips for me...</li>
            <li> Love it! Lips soft and appear fuller.  Will but again.  Small in size, but positive can bring it on the airplane...</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this after I had a juvederm injection to help keep my lips soft &amp; hydrated. It also softens wrinkles, and makes your lips look fuller. I apply it all day long and love the look it gives to my lips even without lipstick.</li>
            <li> This product goes on nice at first, but doesn&#x27;t last long on lips. I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all and I&#x27;ve been using it about a month. I put it on before bed, and in the morning before lipstick. No changes. Chapstick works better!</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips moist and the lines above my lips in check ;)</li>
            <li> Ormedic Lip Treatment is amazing. When you use it your lips actually heal so much that you no longer need it. Regular lip balms just coat your lips with a waxy film, but this product moisturizes and protects. When I have had a time of dehydration my lips feel terrible and I have to use it every hour or so. But after re-hydrating and treating my lips for a few days I no longer need it as often. Usually I only put it on once a day.&lt;br /&gt;  And in a pinch, you can use it to lubricate a lock or anything that sticking.&lt;br /&gt; A great product.</li>
            <li> Brilliant, made a noticeable difference to the fine lines around my mouth. Will not be without it from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for the last year and my lips stay nice and moist. Not waxy and stays on lips for a long time so you don&#x27;t have reapply that often. Once you try it you won&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
            <li> this is NOT cheap but it is worth every cent.  Highly concentrated and makes for super soft lips too.  arrived as promised</li>
            <li> This is a really great lip baum.  Lasts almost all day.  I highly recommend it to anyone with dry lips.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to give the full effect. It is soothing and unlike other lip moisturizers, it is not at all greasy. Because it is VERY expensive, I use Aquaphor on my lips AFTER applying the Ormedic product to seal it in. I bought it for both of my daughters. They love it. I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried this lip treatment - it literally changed my life. I ordered as many as I could as it was the first lip treatment I had ever tried that actually healed my dry, peeling lips! Made them feel like new!</li>
            <li> Very good  balm that I would expect at a top spa. Has a nice thick consistency and nice smell. It&#x27;s a little sticky, but not like lip lacquer sticky. If you use it twice a day, it really will make your lips soft and get in better condition. The size you get is surprisingly. Small for the cost. Think blistex sixes.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best gloss.  It is not too thick, but thick enough to last.  It gives a bit of plumping without the sting so it works from the inside building collegian...or at least restoring it!  It has amazing healing qualities as well.</li>
            <li> Best lip &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;. You can feel the difference when you start wearing it. There is no color so you can chose to put color on underneath or go more natural with no color.</li>
            <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried a sample of this product I loved it. I loved the way my lips felt. So since then I have ordered the several times of the product.</li>
            <li> This has not only helped my lips, but, also helped the dry spots I&#x27;ve been getting around my lips from facials.</li>
            <li> I just love this lip balm. It&#x27;s not greasy and it gives your lips a great shine when you don&#x27;t feel like wearing gloss.  I have 3 tubes so that I have one beside my bed, my purse, and one in the family room.  They are awesome!  I now have my boyfriend hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Actually, I think Carmex woks well, but I can&#x27;t stand the flavor. This is definitely way less objectionable, but costs about 10 times much. I would have given ths 4 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful base for any lip color, as it repairs dry lips.  It feels healing.  I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;plumping,&amp;#34; but it is a great product, non-the-less.</li>
            <li> This has a nice feel to it, good fragrance and a great moisurizer for my lips.  I love the Image line.</li>
            <li> I wear long lasting lipstick during he day and it tends to dry out my lips.  I apply the Image Skin care Ormedic lip enhancement complex every night before bedtime and my lips are rejuvenated by the next morning.</li>
            <li> Makes lips soft and hydrated.  Wish it was a little cheaper, but I still will continue to buy it!!! Great product line.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to PLUMP your lips.  Had no effect in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try the products above $28.00--Dermalogica was a big disappointment:  It moisturized your lips and  lasted a few hours on but did noting for plumping your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this product, it is not long-lasting and did nothing for plumping your lips.  As a matter of fact,  store name brand versions are a helluva lot better--I settled on Aquaphor, though Carmex Moisture Plus is good too.</li>
            <li> I actually really like how this product feels on my lips; definately quality ingredients. It goes on thick and sticky and soothing. Also, the container allows you to use every drop. However, .25 is a very tiny amount for the price. Also, after reading other reviews, I hoped it would help with chapped lips, but it does an average job in this area. I have better success and visible results with Clinique Love My Lips which is a little more product for about the same price. I probably won&#x27;t buy the Image lip product again, but if you can afford it I would recommend trying for yourself.</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer helps maintain more moisture in my lips than most others . I have enjoyed using this product . it was recommended to me by my esthetician.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for my lips and this is by far the best!  In the winter my lips get terrible but this helps with keeping them from drying out.  Now does this &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; my lips?  Not sure, maybe a little plumper/ fuller but it helps with getting rid of chapped lips so well it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The only product that has ever helped my lips.  Use at night and while you sleep it penetrates deeper and then you do not use as much during the day. Expensive but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my facialist as being a much better product than the lip balms available at the drugstores.  It does have a very pleasant consistency and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; but it is not any more effective in alleviating chapped lips than the less expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li> This is the best Lip Enhancement product by Image Skin Care...leaves your lips soft and not greasy for the price it lasts a long time. the price is going up a lot might have to find something else if it continues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years and love it. It stays on for about two to three hours! It is not sticky at all, it feels fabulous on your lips and is actually good for them. One tube will last around 4 months. You can use it by itself, over lipstick, or put on your lip liner then put this on over it! Great product, I will never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> So much better than other lip products. First saw and used at a spa, always used since then, perfect product</li>
            <li> I like this product because I have very dry lips.  I put it on in the morning around my lips and again at night.</li>
            <li> This product was initially given to me by a friend as a birthday gift.  I tried it as I have dry, chapped lips and it worked.  I use it every night at bedtime and wake up the next morning with smooth lips!</li>
            <li> This complex really seems to be absorbed into the lips and&lt;br /&gt;keeps them soft much longer than any other lip product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so into lip ointments and balms...nothing works like this one&lt;br /&gt;I buy a handful and have it handy in every bag and room.  Keeps your lips moist and hydrated all day unlike others which only last for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Good but kind of shiny. Only need a really small amount so I think it will last a long time. I like it but haven&#x27;t used regularly because it goes on shiny</li>
            <li> Best protective lip care on the market aside from organic chapstick. This is more glamorous in the way your lips look and the price is fabulous as most salons sell for $25 plus tax.</li>
