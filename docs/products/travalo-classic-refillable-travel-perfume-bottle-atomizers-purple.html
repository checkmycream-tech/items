            <li>and it&#x27;s such a gorgeous bottle.</li>

            <li>It absolutely would not fill.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up too much space</li>
            <li>Finally, a purse size atomizer that can be filled from my aerosol perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>I got two of these in different colors matching the colors of the bottles of my two favorite fragrances (purple &amp; red)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just love the ease with which I can fill these little bottles with my perfumes.</li>

            <li> It does not work. Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I see why these things get such positive reviews!  Easy to fill, and works great.  I actually like using this more than the original spray bottle as it fits my hand better and is easier to spritz.</li>
            <li> ...I purchased several more for my sisters as presents.</li>
            <li> I was buying these perfume bottle atomizers to add to my existing ones. I just love the ease with which I can fill these little bottles with my perfumes. It makes it so easy to carry the perfume that I want. I no longer have to struggle with funnels or other difficult methods of packing perfume into smaller bottles. I also don&#x27;t waste perfume while filling this refillable bottle, unlike how it was with the other &amp;#34;funnel style&amp;#34; bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, wondering whether or not to buy these bottles, go ahead and get them. In fact, don&#x27;t just buy one - buy many. You can have different brands of perfume in your handbag, or you can have the same brand in different handbags... The choice is yours. It&#x27;s simply convenient :-)</li>
            <li> These are great.  I was going on vacation &amp; wanted to smell good but didn&#x27;t want to risk my expensive bottles of perfume in a bag on the plane.  I got two of these in different colors matching the colors of the bottles of my two favorite fragrances (purple &amp; red) so I would easily know which fragrances were in them.  They were very simple to fill, had no leakage from filling, traveling, or spraying, and as an added bonus, they are very pretty!  Now I carry them in my purse or make up bag to refresh my fragrance any time.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> No spillage and the color is gorgeous. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This item worked great until I actually traveled with it. It ended up leaking during my flight, all over the inside of my purse.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, works great! Wish I had more!</li>
            <li> It absolutely would not fill.  I have had other similiar items that worked--this did not and I resent getting half my money back because of shipping cost</li>
            <li> My second Travelo it was leaking on my first trip just a little bit I just put  a little scotch tape and it was perfect no more leaking due to air pressure when flying</li>
            <li> Its nice for portable fragrance. Its small and compact</li>
            <li> I travel quite a bit for work and also do evening client entertaining. This is ideal. Small, compact, easy to fill, hard to break, and doesn&#x27;t spill product. It&#x27;s about the size of a lipstick and now has a permanent spot in my makeup bag. It also doesn&#x27;t spray too much or too little product. Very glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic. Easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does what it says and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It looks just like the picture and it does not leak! Shipping was great and there werent any problems refilling the travelo my daughter and I are absolutely obssesed with this product</li>
            <li> I love this product! I much prefer carrying a clutch than my purse and it fits perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t take up too much space and it&#x27;s such a gorgeous bottle. Plus, no leaks at all. Other products and brands have leaked all over my purse. This one is very good quality and Very cute :)</li>
            <li> Love this concept, i travel a lot and the airline is always losing my luggage. one time, i had jewelry and an expensive bottlr of perfume stolen from my suitcase so i stopped taking it with me. with the Travelo i can take it in my carryon. Its easy to use, I have had no problems with it leaking. I love it and am buying several more for stocking stuffers!!</li>
            <li> Finally, a purse size atomizer that can be filled from my aerosol perfume bottle. Now I can take my favorite perfume anywhere.. :)</li>
            <li> Love it!! Great for carry on luggage. Good deal!</li>
            <li> It worked for a couple of trips but no it will not accept the spray nozzle from the same bottle I used earlier. I can push a pin into the hole but not the spray nozzle no matter how hard I push or how much I wiggle it.</li>
            <li> This thing is so neat!</li>
            <li> Love the idea, if it only worked.  The perfume evaporates.</li>
            <li> Great product, a must if you fly a lot</li>
            <li> helpfull i do recommened it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</li>
            <li> I love Travalo. The cheaper knock-off brands tend to leak when you try to fill them.  I have stuck with this brand for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. I love it.  Easy to use and refill.  Highly recommend.</li>
