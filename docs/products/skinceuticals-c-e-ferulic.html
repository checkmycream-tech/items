            <li>Great product</li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the BEST thing I have ever put on my face...</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and let this dry before using moisturizer, and it is NEVER sticky, moisturizer goes on beautifully, and foundation is great to put on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many (Skinlastin, Dermalogica, SkinMedica, etc).  </li>
            <li>C E Ferulic has helped my skin with suppleness and preventing more damage.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>When you use this product, be sure to allow the serum to fully sink into your skin, don&#x27;t put your moisturizer on for three minutes after applying this to your face.  </li>
            <li>i have been using skinceuticals for many years.</li>
            <li>we also use a retinol product at night, and i  feel we hit on a winning combination....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for 3 years and it continues to be a favorite.</li>
            <li>I love CE Ferulic</li>
            <li>This product is the best especially for clarifying and tightening.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products that minimize pores and supposed to make the skin smoother but they just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Skinceuticals is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I already notice my skin a lot better.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s $40 cheaper</li>
            <li>my skin seems to glow more now, after a month of use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after New Beauty magazine had their awards and said this was an incredible product, as well as all the reviews that confirmed this.</li>
            <li>old and have been told i have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>Let me just say that I could not be more surprised and happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product has inf act reduced fine lines and rosacea</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product to me to reduce fine lines and even put my color.</li>
            <li>I choose this product after reading reviews and deciding to give it a try since I have been paying so much for another product for many years!</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in the moisture of my skin within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth and decreses wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I then ordered CE Ferulic from Skin Ceuticcals and confirmed what I thought.</li>
            <li>Almost ALL of my sun spots are gone, some acne scar improvement, and my fine lines have diminished significantly,  </li>
            <li>Never 100% sure how well any product really works to improve damage to skin on face, but this product is easy to apply underneath moisturizer &amp; sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended to me by my derotologist.  </li>
            <li>I did not get the original CE Ferulic from this vendor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who really loves to look good.</li>
            <li>It is a true serum (not a lotion that claims to be a serum) and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I have always taken care of my skin, sunscreen, good skin care products, diet, water, etc., but who couldn&#x27;t use a little help to make it better?</li>
            <li>I love this product it leaves my face very soft and help with anti-aging (prevention).</li>
            <li>Have used this in the past and happy to find it at a more reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the expense and your skin will show results.</li>
            <li>So worth it, and</li>
            <li>Looks strange works well, skin looks brighter and fine lines look better</li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>I live in the south, so heat proof products are important.</li>
            <li>The brand is not too expensive, but it&#x27;s the best I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product; I can see results and I have only used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been asked pretty often what products do I use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to trying this, I had started wearing foundation for the first time in my life to try to hide the sun damage.  </li>
            <li>Probably one of the most necessary products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I started using this two months ago and since then I have seen a positive improvement with my skin.  </li>
            <li>After using this for less than a month, I am THRILLED to report I no longer have to wear foundation.  </li>
            <li>thanks for asking???????????</li>
            <li>is the real thing</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It is not as intense.</li>
            <li>I am 55, am often mistaken for 40&#x27;s, and have been using this product for 2 years, as well as many other Skinceutical products.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for nine years and feel that that it has been great for my skin; I use it every day, just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li>This product really surprised me because it really worked.  </li>
            <li>Within a few days I have been complimented so many times on how radiant and glowing my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I am 33yrs old and was very close to shelling out almost a grand and taking a week off work to have the CO2 laser treatment to correct my acne scarring, sun damage (I&#x27;m a former sun godess who spent nearly a decade in a tanning bed), and some minor fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY dry skin and mild rosacea.  </li>
            <li>to get used to the tingling sensation, however I am more than half way thru my bottle and will definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>This product has helped keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product goes...</li>
            <li>So far, I have not seen a marked change in my skin, but these products need to be used for a long time and consistently to show their effect.  </li>
            <li>It is too early to write an informed review.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive it may take a week or so</li>
            <li>The cost is because of the high percentage of vitamin C which is necessary to effect improvement in collagen.</li>
            <li>Not only were their prices amazingly low in comparison to other vendors, it was free shipping</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and went off it briefly and could really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>After several months I noticed that my fine lines were finer, the crease between my eyes smaller, my skin was smoother, and my discolorations less.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this spendy little item when I had my last facial.</li>

            <li> After several months I noticed that my fine lines were finer, the crease between my eyes smaller, my skin was smoother, and my discolorations less.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this spendy little item when I had my last facial.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it on the oily parts of my face and have been applying it only to my cheeks (the dry parts) followed by the B5 gel and a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> have a strange smell</li>
            <li> when i was younger we were not aware of the damage uv rays would cause on our skin, and i abused the sun by using baby-oil, and sun reflectors.....</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product my combination skin reacted in two ways with both the dry and oily areas getting worse.</li>
            <li> Back to just concealer on blemishes, under eyes, and nose w/ a little powder to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike the other product-Phyto + that it still gradually improves my laser scar, this show no incremental benefits.</li>
            <li> a couple of yrs back with some improvement in the past didn&#x27;t stick with it for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years - stopped for awhile due to</li>
            <li> That compounded by the fear that I could potentially make my skin worse with this procedure (I&#x27;m a picker so nervous about scarring), I canceled the appointment and decided to make one last ditch effort before going the invasive route.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, my skin is smoother and not as dry as it was before.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem as dark in color as the previous bottles that I purchased from other sites.  </li>
            <li> I think it may have been watered down.  </li>
            <li> It does have vitamin C, E and ferrulic acid, so it has a little &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; smell when you put it on, but this dissipates.</li>
            <li> I hated it, my skin felt dirty, and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds or more trying to find something that looked natural, not cakey.  </li>
            <li> This is not easy living on a lake.</li>
            <li> NOT VERY HAPPY since i paid alot of money for it.</li>
            <li> While I am skeptical about other &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; claiming skin treatments, this one works for me.  </li>
            <li> When I was on a little austerity kick, I decided not to use it for a while, and oh, was I sorry.</li>
            <li> so thin you can&#x27;t feel it on your skin at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best anti-oxidant combo and age/wrinkle fighter out there and I&#x27;ve tried many (Skinlastin, Dermalogica, SkinMedica, etc).  Started using this in 2004 and it&#x27;s still the best and my favorite even within the SkinCeuticals line.  It is a true serum (not a lotion that claims to be a serum) and it absorbs quickly.  Can be used under regular moisturizer or by itself.</li>
            <li> Received from vendor in 3 days.  Packaging in perfect condition.  C E Ferulic has helped my skin with suppleness and preventing more damage.  I&#x27;ve been using SkinCeuticals for 8 months now and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.  The brand is not too expensive, but it&#x27;s the best I have ever tried.  When you use this product, be sure to allow the serum to fully sink into your skin, don&#x27;t put your moisturizer on for three minutes after applying this to your face.  I bought this based on several reviews I read on the internet.</li>
            <li> i have been using skinceuticals for many years. my morning regimen is c e with ferulic acid....eye gel aox with l-ascorbic acid,and ferulic acid,&lt;br /&gt;and hydra b5 gel. i am 53 yrs. old and have been told i have beautiful skin. when i was younger we were not aware of the damage uv rays would cause on our skin, and i abused the sun by using baby-oil, and sun reflectors.....but on a recent visit to my dermatologist he said,\\&quot;i have no sun damage on my face\\&quot; i have to attribute this to the skinceutical products that i use. i also have my husband using these products, and he has smooth beautiful skin. we also use a retinol product at night, and i  feel we hit on a winning combination....so until they find the fountain of youth .....i will be using these products.</li>
            <li> I love this product; I can see results and I have only used it for two weeks. I would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me to reduce fine lines and even put my color. I have VERY dry skin and mild rosacea.  I love that this product has inf act reduced fine lines and rosacea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using C E Ferulic for about 5 yrs. I love this product it leaves my face very soft and help with anti-aging (prevention). I&#x27;ve been asked pretty often what products do I use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I do, in fact, have younger looking skin.  There is no doubt that this product works.  It was originally recommended to me by my derotologist.  While I am skeptical about other &amp;#34;youth&amp;#34; claiming skin treatments, this one works for me.  I hesitate to be without it ,so I always have one in the wings.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my skin.  I am 82 years and people think I am in my 60&#x27;s because of the products I use.  My&lt;br /&gt;dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> It seems to give a glowing look on day 1 but then I didn&#x27;t recognize any change later on. Unlike the other product-Phyto + that it still gradually improves my laser scar, this show no incremental benefits. Do not consider continue it once finished.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product, was recommended by friend &amp; Dr.&lt;br /&gt;Skinceuticals good reputation.&lt;br /&gt;Read reviews in magazine about it so bought it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with a Fraxel type derm procedure. It has helped rejuvenate my skin...smooth and glowing. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This product has helped keep my skin clear.  I&#x27;ve used for 3 years and it continues to be a favorite.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.  I am 33yrs old and was very close to shelling out almost a grand and taking a week off work to have the CO2 laser treatment to correct my acne scarring, sun damage (I&#x27;m a former sun godess who spent nearly a decade in a tanning bed), and some minor fine lines.  I had used the SkinCeuticals Serum 14(?) a couple of yrs back with some improvement in the past didn&#x27;t stick with it for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After deciding I didn&#x27;t want to take the time off work to have my face lasered.  That compounded by the fear that I could potentially make my skin worse with this procedure (I&#x27;m a picker so nervous about scarring), I canceled the appointment and decided to make one last ditch effort before going the invasive route.  I figured I had nothing to lose in the meantime (aside from some $$) by trying another serum, still cheaper than the laser treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading lots of Amazon reviews, I settled on the C E Ferulic and the Hydrating B serums.  I chose correctly!  Let me just say that I could not be more surprised and happy with the results.  I wish I had done before and after pictures as I almost can&#x27;t believe the improvement.  Almost ALL of my sun spots are gone, some acne scar improvement, and my fine lines have diminished significantly,  I am SO grateful I skipped the laser and tried this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to trying this, I had started wearing foundation for the first time in my life to try to hide the sun damage.  I hated it, my skin felt dirty, and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds or more trying to find something that looked natural, not cakey.  After using this for less than a month, I am THRILLED to report I no longer have to wear foundation.  Back to just concealer on blemishes, under eyes, and nose w/ a little powder to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!  This has been a godsend!</li>
            <li> I am 55, am often mistaken for 40&#x27;s, and have been using this product for 2 years, as well as many other Skinceutical products. I bought this after New Beauty magazine had their awards and said this was an incredible product, as well as all the reviews that confirmed this. I must say that I have always taken care of my skin, sunscreen, good skin care products, diet, water, etc., but who couldn&#x27;t use a little help to make it better? I have tried every formulation of retinol known to man, and just can&#x27;t use it, but wanted a great antioxidant product, with firming, and smoothing benefits. This would be the ticket. After several months I noticed that my fine lines were finer, the crease between my eyes smaller, my skin was smoother, and my discolorations less. I live in the south, so heat proof products are important. Follow the directions and let this dry before using moisturizer, and it is NEVER sticky, moisturizer goes on beautifully, and foundation is great to put on. It does have vitamin C, E and ferrulic acid, so it has a little &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; smell when you put it on, but this dissipates. The cheapest place to get it is on Amazon. When I was on a little austerity kick, I decided not to use it for a while, and oh, was I sorry. What a difference in the way my skin felt. I just put the money aside for it. Probably one of the most necessary products I have ever used. If you look good in your 50&#x27;s, this will bring you the &amp;#34;what do yo use on your face&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;you glow&amp;#34; complements that we want.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem as dark in color as the previous bottles that I purchased from other sites.  I think it may have been watered down.  As far as the product goes...I love CE Ferulic</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and well-packaged.  So far, I have not seen a marked change in my skin, but these products need to be used for a long time and consistently to show their effect.  It is too early to write an informed review.</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past and happy to find it at a more reasonable cost.  It is well worth the expense and your skin will show results.</li>
            <li> i have beenusing this for a month or so. i do like this product. my skin feels firmer.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie Coleman</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s very expensive but I do think it makes a difference in my skin.  This was the best price I could find on it.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this spendy little item when I had my last facial. I was told I had lots of sun damage on the sides of my face and that this would help with appearance and further damage. Yes, I used to worship the sun and she was right and...it has helped.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my dermatologist recommended this product. It is worn under your regular moisturizer and sun screen. It has been scientifically proven, with peer reviewed studys published in respected journals, not only to minimize the effects of UVA and UVB rays, but also to instigate collagen thickening which in turn will render your skin plumper and younger looking. Be advise that while the sun protection is immediate, the increases in collagen come after months of daily use. But the changes do come.  The cost is because of the high percentage of vitamin C which is necessary to effect improvement in collagen.</li>
            <li> I used this for years - stopped to try another routine - back to it and already see the clarity it provides for my complexion.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best on the market.  Leaves skin silky soft and smooth.  I  have been using for 15 years.  No need to change.  Great product</li>
            <li> Never 100% sure how well any product really works to improve damage to skin on face, but this product is easy to apply underneath moisturizer &amp; sunscreen. Feel it&#x27;s a good way to ward off effects of sun &amp; aging in am.</li>
            <li> this was not CE Ferulic inside the bottle. I took it to a skin doctor practice, they advised me it was a different product. NOT VERY HAPPY since i paid alot of money for it. thanks for asking???????????</li>
            <li> I have used this product for nine years and feel that that it has been great for my skin; I use it every day, just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is the best especially for clarifying and tightening.  I&#x27;ve used it for years - stopped for awhile due to&lt;br /&gt;expense but nothing I used compared.  Also I have found it helps prevent environmental damage (sun/wind).</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in the moisture of my skin within a couple of weeks. I highly recommend it to anyone who really loves to look good.</li>
            <li> I choose this product after reading reviews and deciding to give it a try since I have been paying so much for another product for many years!</li>
            <li> I have used everything!!! for my face, everything rated in Allure, La Mer, Kiels, etc....and this is by far the BEST thing I have ever put on my face...Within a few days I have been complimented so many times on how radiant and glowing my skin is.  I can almost not stop touching it!~~  So worth it, and I will never be without it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and went off it briefly and could really tell the difference.  I have very nice skin for 73 and am complimented on the nice skin I have.  This is not easy living on a lake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products that minimize pores and supposed to make the skin smoother but they just don&#x27;t work.  This product really surprised me because it really worked.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful! Skinceuticals is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I already notice my skin a lot better.</li>
            <li> Except there was no box!  The bottle had a safety seal on it but I wonder why did it come without the box?  I&#x27;m trusting the solution is the real thing and I&#x27;ve just started to use it.  The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive it may take a week or so to get used to the tingling sensation, however I am more than half way thru my bottle and will definitely order again.  Makes skin smooth and decreses wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is not the same product which I bout at the dermatologist. Sure, it&#x27;s $40 cheaper but it is not the same strength or intensity. It&#x27;s just not. Perhaps it&#x27;s a reject from the factory. I don&#x27;t now but I now there is a difference. It is not as intense.</li>
            <li> when I used this product, I noticed it did not smell like CE Ferulic, but I used it anyway.  Then I noticed that the label on the bottle was not the same label as CE Ferulic.  I then ordered CE Ferulic from Skin Ceuticcals and confirmed what I thought. I did not get the original CE Ferulic from this vendor.</li>
            <li> best vit c serum I&#x27;ve ever used!  so thin you can&#x27;t feel it on your skin at all.  my skin seems to glow more now, after a month of use.  love it!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product my combination skin reacted in two ways with both the dry and oily areas getting worse. I stopped using it on the oily parts of my face and have been applying it only to my cheeks (the dry parts) followed by the B5 gel and a moisturizer. The texture of my skin has improved since I started using this product. I just needed to figure out how to use it in a way that would work for me.</li>
            <li> I started using this two months ago and since then I have seen a positive improvement with my skin.  The best price I have seen is with Beauty Nation which sells on Amazon.  Not only were their prices amazingly low in comparison to other vendors, it was free shipping and I received my product within 2 days!  Great product and Beauty Nation is a great seller!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product for my face. After using this product for a few weeks, my skin is smoother and not as dry as it was before. I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Looks strange works well, skin looks brighter and fine lines look better&lt;br /&gt;Does have a strange smell but I put my cream over it and you can&#x27;t smell it anymore</li>
