            <li>Awesome color,the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.....</li>
            <li>beautiful color!</li>
            <li>but that is what makes this polish so awesome.</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>very good price</li>
            <li>great stuff, never chips and the color is so awesome.</li>
            <li>I always recommend OPI, it&#x27;s a good brand!</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful sparkly purple.</li>
            <li>The way the rocks and bay look when lit up by a beautiful sunset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m actually really happy</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li>The Liquid Sand texture of OPI is great--</li>
            <li>I think the liquid sand texture is so awesome, and I love the color of Alcatraz Rocks.</li>
            <li>But I really LOVED this one.</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly and has a great shine to it!</li>
            <li>Very pretty color &amp; great sand effect!  </li>
            <li>Love this color, looks great with shorter .</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>nice color</li>
            <li>But ive been doing my own nails for 50yrs</li>
            <li>Be sure to NOT put a top coat over it!</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s by far the best polish that OPI had come up with in 2013 (until the Mariah Holiday Collection).</li>
            <li>It has a very fine sandy texture, not clumpy whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>The wear on Peace and Love isn&#x27;t great though and the wear on this is stellar.</li>
            <li>Not what I initially ordered but I&#x27;m so happy with it!</li>
            <li>My favorite polish for elegant dressing up.</li>
            <li>Make sure to cap it on the nail and use a top coat.</li>
            <li>and I was able to keep it on for 5 days with zero chipping.</li>
            <li>I love the sand textured polishes.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Liquid Sand polish</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; texture,</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite nail polishes I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Love the color and love the liquid sand product.</li>
            <li>Love this polish.  </li>
            <li>My favorite one out of the Liquid Sand polishes.  </li>
            <li>So gorgeous, applies easily, dries fairly quickly and looks like a million bucks, without or with top coat.</li>
            <li>This color is gorgeous and by far my favorite textured polish.</li>
            <li>It did not stain my fingers, which is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s still going to be a texture issue for people who prefer a smooth finish, but</li>
            <li>It had fantastic wear</li>
            <li>The color is pretty, hoping for more gray.</li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite polishes by OPI.</li>
            <li>, it actually stays on my nails better than other polishes, and the color is great, and goes with anything!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sparkly, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Probably my new favorite color.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest using a clear top coat over it even though the directions say to not use a top coat.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t really explain it well enough because the end result is just gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I love the Opi Alcatraz Rocks nail polish because the matte sand texture is very unique while at the same time seems to have more staying power than regular polish.</li>
            <li>this color in particular goes really well with the shiny peace and love and OPI by OPI.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not a problem for me, so I love it, and having learned my lesson, I ordered a couple extra</li>
            <li>It is made up of so many different colored sparkles.</li>
            <li>i will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>The wear time isn&#x27;t stellar</li>
            <li>Peace and Love is a close second.</li>
            <li>So much so that this is the color I wore to my son&#x27;s wedding!  </li>
            <li>As far as the color its very pretty more dark blue, nice sparkle.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really looks like rocks.</li>
            <li>i really like the feel of the liquid sands colors.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really care about that.</li>
            <li>but I really like it</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t big on texture, but still fell in love with this polish when early swatches started popping up.</li>
            <li>I really loved OPI&#x27;s Mad as a Hatter color, and this is about as close as they&#x27;ve come to my favorite parts of that color since.</li>
            <li>The color is very stylish for fall and winter, a dark gray with shimmery particles that catch the light, making the polish appear navy or dark purple at times.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I was super pleased to find that it was not as hard as I imagined to remove.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d never seen the Alice in Wonderland shade, then this would probably go down as my favorite purple ever.</li>
            <li>Its a really dark purplish polish; great alternative to wearing blacks and dark colors in the fall/winter.  </li>
            <li>Love this dark color!</li>
            <li>The color was really nice, it actually dried really quickly compared to my other like 50 polishes, and I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with it because of the texture.</li>
            <li>A little different from the color my computer was showing but still nice.</li>
            <li>and i dont think this is a NEW bottle.</li>
            <li>More black than purple blue</li>
            <li>They seem to last longer and don&#x27;t show touch ups as much.  </li>
            <li>but I change my polish frequently</li>
            <li>and I reach for it, frequently.</li>
            <li>and this is my fav of the collection by far.</li>
            <li>Initially thought I&#x27;d skip the texture and go straight for the Seche Vite, but have only done that as an accent instead.</li>
            <li>It also lasted a few more days with out chipping than my other polishes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Even after several days it did not chip or recede from the tips as some other colors often do.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish a LOT except that after about a day of wear the polish looks very dull and drab.</li>
            <li> bottles!&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a ringer for the Mad as a Hatter shade, it&#x27;s not a full glitter, for one thing, and it doesn&#x27;t have the silver glitter brightening things up, and I don&#x27;t see any sign of the bits of orangey-red or grass-green microglitter that all made that polish such a versatile shade, but it&#x27;s very pretty, and only took two coats to get the color I see in the picture.</li>
            <li> It only took a little more scrubbing than usual, nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> top coat needed (i use a base coat)</li>
            <li> I guess you could say it is blackish with purple and green hues in it.  </li>
            <li> Lately my nail polish isn&#x27;t staying on but this polish is staying on and protecting my nails from breaking.</li>
            <li> There is microglitter in aqua and pinkish thistle in a deep grayed-blue purple base.</li>
            <li> In a weird way it does remind of of Alcatraz.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it arrived on time and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> This color is excellent-blue/black base and multicolor glitter</li>
            <li> Blurple base with microshimmer in holo colors.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the add didn&#x27;t mention that this polish is liquid sand which means it feels like sand.  nice color but I don&#x27;t care for the texture.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered a different polish, from the Opi shatter collection. I ended up getting this one by mistake but I&#x27;m actually really happy I ended up with this one. I&#x27;ve never actually had Opi before. Only cheaper brands. But I really LOVED this one. The color was really nice, it actually dried really quickly compared to my other like 50 polishes, and I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with it because of the texture. It also lasted a few more days with out chipping than my other polishes. Not what I initially ordered but I&#x27;m so happy with it!</li>

If I&#x27;d never seen the Alice in Wonderland shade, then this would probably go down as my favorite purple ever.</li>
            <li> My favorite polish for elegant dressing up. In the sunlight this polish has a purple hue to it. Make sure to cap it on the nail and use a top coat.</li>
            <li> I love the Opi Alcatraz Rocks nail polish because the matte sand texture is very unique while at the same time seems to have more staying power than regular polish. Even after several days it did not chip or recede from the tips as some other colors often do. The color is very stylish for fall and winter, a dark gray with shimmery particles that catch the light, making the polish appear navy or dark purple at times. I can highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Probably my new favorite color.  The &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; makes it wear longer.</li>
            <li> I had to have this color. I missed it when it was in stores so I came to Amazon! This color is gorgeous and by far my favorite textured polish. It is made up of so many different colored sparkles. It can be distracting while driving!</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite polishes by OPI. I think the liquid sand texture is so awesome, and I love the color of Alcatraz Rocks. It really looks like rocks. It is a beautiful sparkly purple. Additionally, I was super pleased to find that it was not as hard as I imagined to remove. It only took a little more scrubbing than usual, nothing crazy. It did not stain my fingers, which is a HUGE plus. It had fantastic wear and I was able to keep it on for 5 days with zero chipping. This is big for me since I am a mom of two and I am always using/washing my hands. I would give this polish 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> i really like the feel of the liquid sands colors. this color in particular goes really well with the shiny peace and love and OPI by OPI.</li>
            <li> great stuff, never chips and the color is so awesome. i will buy more in the future. very good price</li>
            <li> A little different from the color my computer was showing but still nice. More black than purple blue I thought.</li>
            <li> I love the sand textured polishes.  They seem to last longer and don&#x27;t show touch ups as much.  This color is excellent-blue/black base and multicolor glitter make it a go to for me.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color &amp; great sand effect!  It has a bluish purple shimmer.  I always recommend OPI, it&#x27;s a good brand!</li>
            <li> So gorgeous, applies easily, dries fairly quickly and looks like a million bucks, without or with top coat. The wear time isn&#x27;t stellar but I change my polish frequently so I don&#x27;t really care about that. This is my favorite Liquid Sand polish and I reach for it, frequently.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t big on texture, but still fell in love with this polish when early swatches started popping up. Totally surpassed my expectations. Initially thought I&#x27;d skip the texture and go straight for the Seche Vite, but have only done that as an accent instead. Cannot recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> Blurple base with microshimmer in holo colors. I&#x27;m a SF girl and this is my fav of the collection by far. Peace and Love is a close second. The wear on Peace and Love isn&#x27;t great though and the wear on this is stellar. Lately my nail polish isn&#x27;t staying on but this polish is staying on and protecting my nails from breaking. In a weird way it does remind of of Alcatraz. The way the rocks and bay look when lit up by a beautiful sunset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No top coat needed (i use a base coat) so it&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m in a hurry and I think it&#x27;s by far the best polish that OPI had come up with in 2013 (until the Mariah Holiday Collection). Buy this before it sells out and becomes a hit on evilbay.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty, hoping for more gray. But ive been doing my own nails for 50yrs and i dont think this is a NEW bottle. Neck of the bottle cakey when opened. If there is one thing i know its polish. As far as the color its very pretty more dark blue, nice sparkle.</li>
            <li> Awesome color,the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.....</li>
            <li> beautiful color! love it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; texture, but I really like it, it actually stays on my nails better than other polishes, and the color is great, and goes with anything!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite nail polishes I have ever owned.  When applied it looks different in different lights or the way you hold your hand.  I guess you could say it is blackish with purple and green hues in it.  That doesn&#x27;t really explain it well enough because the end result is just gorgeous.  So much so that this is the color I wore to my son&#x27;s wedding!  Needless to say it arrived on time and well packaged.  End statement:  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love the color and love the liquid sand product. It dries so quickly and has a great shine to it!</li>
            <li> Love this color, looks great with shorter . Glamorous day and night.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish a LOT except that after about a day of wear the polish looks very dull and drab. I highly suggest using a clear top coat over it even though the directions say to not use a top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this polish.  My favorite one out of the Liquid Sand polishes.  Its a really dark purplish polish; great alternative to wearing blacks and dark colors in the fall/winter.  It has a very fine sandy texture, not clumpy whatsoever.  Its not glossy so don&#x27;t expect that but that is what makes this polish so awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this dark color! The Liquid Sand texture of OPI is great--it&#x27;s sparkly, and it dries quickly. Be sure to NOT put a top coat over it!</li>
