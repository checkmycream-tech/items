    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>, this dryer has been wonderful!</li>
            <li>She is especially happy with its drying power.  </li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s the best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I received the InfinitiPro today &amp; perfect timing since I had just washed my hair.</li>
            <li>hair- this dryer styles well at great speed!  </li>
            <li>It was great!  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s the best reason for upgrading to this</li>
            <li>It is very good quality and works well.</li>
            <li>best thing about this product is that it&#x27;s a good hair dryer for an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>and this is a great dryer for the money.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works great.</li>
            <li>But, happy wife, happy life.  </li>
            <li>My wife LOVES this hair dryer, and it was a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for straightening though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice dryer, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;all that.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a Conair 1875 Hair Dryer for many years and it is the best hair dryer I have ever had,</li>
            <li>/&gt;InfinitPro by Conair has the most magnificent buttons for hot/cold and on/off aka low/high.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect, stylish looking hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but otherwise a good dryer.  </li>
            <li>but apart from that product is good</li>
            <li>I loved this dryer.  </li>
            <li>This will make a good guest dryer at my house.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT LOVE THE QUALITY</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can never have too many hair styling tools! &#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally Amazing</li>
            <li>The dryer is heavier than many, but it has plenty of power and i am getting good results.</li>
            <li>look of the dryer is really nice.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to get warm than the BaByliss</li>
            <li>I liked the brand, so I decided to try the InfinitiPro model.  </li>
            <li>so that is nice plus too.  </li>
            <li>(you cannot do any kind of styling with a brush simultaneously).</li>
            <li>That comes in handy when all you want to be doing in the morning is sipping coffee with your spouse not drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very stylish looking and smooth to the touch!</li>
            <li>The cool button is great and she uses it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toggle switches are very easy to operate to change settings.  </li>
            <li>it has many speeds and temps and comes with a nice attachment.  </li>
            <li>felt it was louder than ideal, but I&#x27;m very picky about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use buttons, nice construction.</li>
            <li>The easy toggle switches are a nice touch, and can allow changes with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My more portable dryer now has a permanent place in my suitcase</li>
            <li>I think my hair looks better too.</li>
            <li>I love the finishing and button lay out.</li>
            <li>But all and all its an OK dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this blow drier</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I was able to try it out</li>
            <li>and I think this one causes more frizz.  </li>
            <li>I love the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m comfortable exposing my hair to that kind of heat day after day.</li>
            <li>nuf said. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using that I was perfectly satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have always had a problem with how its buttons were placed, more like sliding switches that you had to rip a fingernail off using.</li>
            <li>Very powerful!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the cool blast is nice.</li>
            <li>Warm is actually beyond warm and fairly hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it easily.  </li>
            <li>It had more volume, was smooth with no frizz or static.</li>
            <li>If someone had limited strength in their arms or pain for some reason, then perhaps a lighter blow dryer would be best.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and stylish looking,</li>
            <li>, it looks great aftewards - smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Have to get used to the rocking buttons (hit them mistakenly often now) but should be easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>The toggle buttons are easy to push.</li>
            <li>(they stick out and click easily...</li>
            <li>It also has a removable filter that can be easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to manage, this blow dryer does all it was advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>removable filter, on the backside, is easy to remove and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong motor, built well, like the cleanable filter.</li>
            <li>Have just had this a few days, but so far the best hair dryer I have ever purchased, with quality construction, excellent airflow and head, with logical controls</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>She has proudly shown it to several of her good female friends,which she only does when she is very happy with something.  </li>
            <li>I did not even try the higher setting as I was sure it would blow my head off :)</li>
            <li>the InfinitiPro by Conair Full Size Salon Performance / AC Motor Dryer sound like what you may be looking for? :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously owned a Conair dryer that performed wonderfully until sparks shot out the side of it while I was blowing my hair.</li>
            <li>InfinitiPro by Conair is Impressive right out of the box with its Sleek -- gray on black -- design that goes with most any decor.</li>
            <li>, what I was told was that it should have come with a comb to fit at the end</li>
            <li>I just tousled it with my fingers &amp; then used a brush to smooth the ends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe the grossest part of this dryer package is the free bottle of \\&quot;Argan</li>
            <li>lint catcher is easy to remove and clean and it also comes with a removable concentrator.</li>
            <li>and I hope it goes smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more powerful and it gets hotter...</li>
            <li>I received this dryer free to review</li>
            <li>I like the 3 temperature settings, hot, warm, and cool.  </li>
            <li>Good results and quieter than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Strong air current---even on the cool</li>
            <li>The buttons are conveniently located and it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I first used this model at my yoga studio and had to get one for home, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I used the high setting on warm.</li>
            <li>This is a really strong dryer but it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of super fine baby hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a small hair dryer, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the best for travel, but it feels solid.  </li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like about this model is the part that you pull off to clean the filter.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t make sense that I have to use a special product to compensate for what seems an overkill with heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is significantly heavier than my old hair dryer, but it works so quickly you won&#x27;t have to hold for long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing.</li>
            <li>so I choose this one it was money we&#x27;ll spent quality and looks is great</li>
            <li>InfinitiPro by Conair Full Size Salon Performance / AC Motor Dryer</li>
            <li>sleek, stylish, modern and hairdryery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has 3 temperatures, 3 speeds, and a cool button.  </li>
            <li>Plus this Ombre look of the ceramic looks cool.  </li>
            <li>Cool setting is actually cool not warm.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>But in all fairness this dryer works well, has a cool shot, a concentrator and argan oil.</li>
            <li>This one is good, but it&#x27;s not any better than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li>Other than the &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work now&amp;#34; factor, it&#x27;s been a great hair dryer and all the features and design</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not any louder or more quiet than most hairdryers.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t terribly loud either which is surprising considering how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>Super fast, super strong air.</li>
            <li>Super powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*3 heat, 2 speed settings -- rocker type switches that are easy to switch -- while styling -- with gentle press of finger tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a super powerful hairdryer.</li>
            <li>This is louder and much powerful.</li>
            <li>Reliable and powerful.</li>
            <li>so I need a powerful hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>InfinitiPro  is a powerful hair dryer that should work for any type of hair.</li>
            <li>few things, among many, I liked about InfinitiPro by Conair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toggle switches are easy to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with small bottle of Argon Oil, good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has cut down her hair drying by 5 or 10 minutes, and has a nice strong flow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the appearance is very sleek and modern and it plugs in and is ready for use very easily</li>
            <li>The handle is just right for my hand</li>
            <li>absolute benefit of this Conair over the Revlon is the flip-out grill which is easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>However, to be fair, I cannot figure out why it blew my hair out so fast, and why my round brush curls were more intense.  </li>
            <li>Gets my hair dry in a &#x27;jiffy&#x27; which is the most important feature for me.  </li>
            <li>I got this on sale and it came with a small bottle of aregone oil which is great to use on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is really strong so does a quicker job than my old one.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I have to disclose that my previous hairdryer is a Conair, so I&#x27;m used to the heat and force that this line generates.</li>
            <li>recommend this for super fast blow-drying.</li>
            <li>her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to control with essentially six settings: high and low speed with cool, warm and hot temperatures.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty comparable to the Baby Bliss one I already had.</li>
            <li>Not too hot.</li>
            <li>There are several different settings for different needs - very happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li>I like them hot, and this one, being 1,875 Watts, isn&#x27;t as hot.  </li>
            <li>hot setting is really HOT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay for the speed.</li>
            <li>This may work better if used by a stylist holding the dryer considerably farther away from their client&#x27;s head, but for personal use I could not get the dryer nozzle far enough away from my head to be either pleasant or effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this blow dryer and have already recommended it to a few friends.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind pro dryers are meant to dry many heads a day not just 1 or 2</li>
            <li>My hair sets into the shape that I dry it in better with this.</li>
            <li>so I was very positively inclined to this new model from Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Conair, on the other hand, has nice tiny holes on the flip-out grill which catch hair and lint before going further, and are easy to clean</li>
            <li>all, I intended to use this for a full week to give it a full review trial, but I knew after two days (I swim, and dry my hair twice a day) to know that this was not going to work.  </li>
            <li>I am sure the incredible power comes at a price, but I am not sure I am going to get used to the heavy weight and the considerable vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I myself have been using the stuff for years, so a little more is nice but not really needed as a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>how much she likes it.</li>
            <li>However, I am used to it now and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>It was also very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been really wedded to my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This dries surprisingly fast.  </li>
            <li>This InfinitPro is so much lighter it is a relief to</li>
            <li>but the fan is very powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The three heat settings and two power settings make the drying options very versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, this is a sleek and modern looking dryer.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li>It blows very well.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using that one, out of not wanting to aim that much intense heat on my hair every time I use this.</li>
            <li>It has multiple settings (hot - cool), etc which will never be used.  </li>
            <li>That other Conair dryer experience was enough to scare me for good.</li>
            <li>As for drying, I just use the high and medium hot settings and wow!  </li>
            <li>so save your money unless you need the constant usage of a true pro line salon dryer.</li>
            <li>Plus it has a button for instant cool.</li>
            <li>I especially like it having variable speeds plus the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>WOW does it get HOT.</li>
            <li>If you really want high speed and high heat, this one is not for you.  </li>
            <li>There are 3 heat settings, a high &amp; low setting and a cool shot button.</li>
            <li>The silver/black color combo goes well in a contemporary bathroom.</li>
            <li>for several years, even buying a second one when I dropped it one too many times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used Conair for many years because it&#x27;s the only hair dryer that performs well for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it get pretty hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are still using an older dryer without the ionic technology, it&#x27;s time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li>My other dryer (also a conair but a folding model) does a fine job for my morning showers, not so much for the before bed shower.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Conair has a noticeably stronger motor than the Revlon, but doesn&#x27;t seem to maintain heat at the high speed setting.  </li>
            <li>, I think this is a HIGH QUALITY, HIGH EFFICIENCY hair dryer ...</li>
            <li>Both are fairly strong and don&#x27;t have any of the various problems I have experienced with cheaper hair dryers (being a man who didn&#x27;t like the idea of paying much for a non-manly product, I actually wasted more money trying to buy garbage) such as burning smells and scary noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, it was obvious</li>
            <li>When I was done, my hair actually looked better than it does at the salon when they dry it!</li>
            <li>It looks and operates like pretty much any hair dryer, but it does have plenty of power and heat (you do need to keep your distance with it) to dry hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a powerful dryer for straightening long curly hair this is your pick.</li>
            <li>This happens a lot when I go to the stylist (who then flattens them with a hot, hot, hot iron, which I really don&#x27;t like for everyday), so I think this hairdryer might have more in common with the dryers he uses (especially since it&#x27;s designed to be super fast drying - hard to be both fast AND fight frizz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a dude, I have short, coarse hair, and it dries it quickly without a fuss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has the usual hot/warm/cold settings, and the low and high power options of most dryers.</li>
            <li>Bought this on Today&#x27;s Deals as my old dryer was almost 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a professional hairstylist for over 10 years</li>
            <li>and it is also a bit loud.</li>
            <li>AND NOT HEAVY TOO.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nearly three inches longer than the BaByliss and even longer if you include the air directing attachment.  </li>
            <li>and I ended up holding this thing almost a foot away from my body to direct it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but since the nozzle&#x27;s so long -- and my arms are not -- it&#x27;s still pretty darned close to my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tucked this away for company&#x27;s use, though, and will continue to use my smaller, much lighter dryer in the meantime.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the fast drying when using it on my pets after their baths.</li>
            <li>&quot; button is fantastic for use with a round brush for adding plenty of volume -- at the roots, or for doing bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find I prefer my old one [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I prefer the soft to touch exterior of my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Professional quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only concern is how long it will last, but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and no troubles so far.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and had been using the other one for scrunching and drying, but this one is too powerful to do that without a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is a tad heavier than my current Conair, but the power and performance more than make-up for this small inconvenience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I cannot recommend this hair dryer for several reasons, none of which apply to my older Conair 1875 dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so hot that I only use it on the low heat setting.  </li>
            <li>THINKING it was set on high, when I discovered it was only on medium.  </li>
            <li>This dryer gets hot so be careful not to hold to closely to your scalp.</li>
            <li>It was still pretty wet</li>
            <li>I have never had a blow dryer dry this fast.</li>
            <li>I expected it to last a LOT longer than the old cheap one that finally broke on her last year.</li>
            <li>The Baby Bliss has a thick plastic screw on part that is substantial and easy to take on or off.</li>
            <li>My hair can get dried much quickly.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace my old Conair hair dryer with the same wattage.</li>
            <li>I have a similar Conair that is 15 years old and it works as well as it did on day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavy, but the output is worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with the attachment to target a section, has the cool shot feature which toggles on and off, and comes with a small bottle of Argon Oil.</li>
            <li>It did dry my hair extremely fast, even on the low setting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m a bit spoiled, using a &#x27;travel&#x27; style hairdryer, but even my husband (who has thicker hair that he doesn&#x27;t style but just wants to dry as quickly as possible) complains about the weight of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little heavy but love the amount of air it produces as well as the different setting level choices I have.</li>
            <li>The plus is that it is powerful, however the problem I find with this hair dryer is that the opening where the air comes out is small</li>
            <li>Although a bit on the heavy side, it is not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li>If it claims to dry 50% faster, do you then time your old one and see if this one blows that one away?</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and on the thin side, and it dries pretty fast as it is, but this dryer had my hair styled and ready to go in almost half the time.</li>

            <li> My wife LOVES this hair dryer, and it was a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for straightening though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice dryer, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;all that.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a Conair 1875 Hair Dryer for many years and it is the best hair dryer I have ever had,</li>
            <li> /&gt;InfinitPro by Conair has the most magnificent buttons for hot/cold and on/off aka low/high.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect, stylish looking hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but otherwise a good dryer.  </li>
            <li> but apart from that product is good</li>
            <li> I loved this dryer.  </li>
            <li> This will make a good guest dryer at my house.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT LOVE THE QUALITY</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can never have too many hair styling tools! &#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally Amazing</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavier than many, but it has plenty of power and i am getting good results.</li>
            <li> look of the dryer is really nice.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to get warm than the BaByliss</li>
            <li> I liked the brand, so I decided to try the InfinitiPro model.  </li>
            <li> so that is nice plus too.  </li>
            <li> (you cannot do any kind of styling with a brush simultaneously).</li>
            <li> That comes in handy when all you want to be doing in the morning is sipping coffee with your spouse not drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very stylish looking and smooth to the touch!</li>
            <li> The cool button is great and she uses it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The toggle switches are very easy to operate to change settings.  </li>
            <li> it has many speeds and temps and comes with a nice attachment.  </li>
            <li> felt it was louder than ideal, but I&#x27;m very picky about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use buttons, nice construction.</li>
            <li> The easy toggle switches are a nice touch, and can allow changes with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My more portable dryer now has a permanent place in my suitcase</li>
            <li> I think my hair looks better too.</li>
            <li> I love the finishing and button lay out.</li>
            <li> But all and all its an OK dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this blow drier</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I was able to try it out</li>
            <li> and I think this one causes more frizz.  </li>
            <li> I love the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m comfortable exposing my hair to that kind of heat day after day.</li>
            <li> nuf said. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using that I was perfectly satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with how its buttons were placed, more like sliding switches that you had to rip a fingernail off using.</li>
            <li> Very powerful!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the cool blast is nice.</li>
            <li> Warm is actually beyond warm and fairly hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I was able to use it easily.  </li>
            <li> It had more volume, was smooth with no frizz or static.</li>
            <li> If someone had limited strength in their arms or pain for some reason, then perhaps a lighter blow dryer would be best.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and stylish looking,</li>
            <li> , it looks great aftewards - smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Have to get used to the rocking buttons (hit them mistakenly often now) but should be easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> The toggle buttons are easy to push.</li>
            <li> (they stick out and click easily...</li>
            <li> It also has a removable filter that can be easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to manage, this blow dryer does all it was advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> removable filter, on the backside, is easy to remove and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong motor, built well, like the cleanable filter.</li>
            <li> Have just had this a few days, but so far the best hair dryer I have ever purchased, with quality construction, excellent airflow and head, with logical controls</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> She has proudly shown it to several of her good female friends,which she only does when she is very happy with something.  </li>
            <li> I did not even try the higher setting as I was sure it would blow my head off :)</li>
            <li> the InfinitiPro by Conair Full Size Salon Performance / AC Motor Dryer sound like what you may be looking for? :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned a Conair dryer that performed wonderfully until sparks shot out the side of it while I was blowing my hair.</li>
            <li> InfinitiPro by Conair is Impressive right out of the box with its Sleek -- gray on black -- design that goes with most any decor.</li>
            <li> , what I was told was that it should have come with a comb to fit at the end</li>
            <li> I just tousled it with my fingers &amp; then used a brush to smooth the ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe the grossest part of this dryer package is the free bottle of \\&quot;Argan</li>
            <li> lint catcher is easy to remove and clean and it also comes with a removable concentrator.</li>
            <li> and I hope it goes smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more powerful and it gets hotter...</li>
            <li> I received this dryer free to review</li>
            <li> I like the 3 temperature settings, hot, warm, and cool.  </li>
            <li> Good results and quieter than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Strong air current---even on the cool</li>
            <li> The buttons are conveniently located and it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I first used this model at my yoga studio and had to get one for home, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I used the high setting on warm.</li>
            <li> This is a really strong dryer but it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of super fine baby hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a small hair dryer, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the best for travel, but it feels solid.  </li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like about this model is the part that you pull off to clean the filter.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make sense that I have to use a special product to compensate for what seems an overkill with heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is significantly heavier than my old hair dryer, but it works so quickly you won&#x27;t have to hold for long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing.</li>
            <li> so I choose this one it was money we&#x27;ll spent quality and looks is great</li>
            <li> InfinitiPro by Conair Full Size Salon Performance / AC Motor Dryer</li>
            <li> sleek, stylish, modern and hairdryery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has 3 temperatures, 3 speeds, and a cool button.  </li>
            <li> Plus this Ombre look of the ceramic looks cool.  </li>
            <li> Cool setting is actually cool not warm.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> But in all fairness this dryer works well, has a cool shot, a concentrator and argan oil.</li>
            <li> This one is good, but it&#x27;s not any better than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> Other than the &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work now&amp;#34; factor, it&#x27;s been a great hair dryer and all the features and design</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not any louder or more quiet than most hairdryers.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t terribly loud either which is surprising considering how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> Super fast, super strong air.</li>
            <li> Super powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*3 heat, 2 speed settings -- rocker type switches that are easy to switch -- while styling -- with gentle press of finger tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a super powerful hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This is louder and much powerful.</li>
            <li> Reliable and powerful.</li>
            <li> so I need a powerful hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> InfinitiPro  is a powerful hair dryer that should work for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> few things, among many, I liked about InfinitiPro by Conair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toggle switches are easy to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with small bottle of Argon Oil, good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has cut down her hair drying by 5 or 10 minutes, and has a nice strong flow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the appearance is very sleek and modern and it plugs in and is ready for use very easily</li>
            <li> The handle is just right for my hand</li>
            <li> absolute benefit of this Conair over the Revlon is the flip-out grill which is easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> However, to be fair, I cannot figure out why it blew my hair out so fast, and why my round brush curls were more intense.  </li>
            <li> Gets my hair dry in a &#x27;jiffy&#x27; which is the most important feature for me.  </li>
            <li> I got this on sale and it came with a small bottle of aregone oil which is great to use on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is really strong so does a quicker job than my old one.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I have to disclose that my previous hairdryer is a Conair, so I&#x27;m used to the heat and force that this line generates.</li>
            <li> recommend this for super fast blow-drying.</li>
            <li> her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to control with essentially six settings: high and low speed with cool, warm and hot temperatures.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty comparable to the Baby Bliss one I already had.</li>
            <li> Not too hot.</li>
            <li> There are several different settings for different needs - very happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I like them hot, and this one, being 1,875 Watts, isn&#x27;t as hot.  </li>
            <li> hot setting is really HOT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay for the speed.</li>
            <li> This may work better if used by a stylist holding the dryer considerably farther away from their client&#x27;s head, but for personal use I could not get the dryer nozzle far enough away from my head to be either pleasant or effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this blow dryer and have already recommended it to a few friends.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind pro dryers are meant to dry many heads a day not just 1 or 2</li>
            <li> My hair sets into the shape that I dry it in better with this.</li>
            <li> so I was very positively inclined to this new model from Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Conair, on the other hand, has nice tiny holes on the flip-out grill which catch hair and lint before going further, and are easy to clean</li>
            <li> all, I intended to use this for a full week to give it a full review trial, but I knew after two days (I swim, and dry my hair twice a day) to know that this was not going to work.  </li>
            <li> I am sure the incredible power comes at a price, but I am not sure I am going to get used to the heavy weight and the considerable vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I myself have been using the stuff for years, so a little more is nice but not really needed as a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> how much she likes it.</li>
            <li> However, I am used to it now and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> It was also very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been really wedded to my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This dries surprisingly fast.  </li>
            <li> This InfinitPro is so much lighter it is a relief to</li>
            <li> but the fan is very powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The three heat settings and two power settings make the drying options very versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, this is a sleek and modern looking dryer.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li> It blows very well.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using that one, out of not wanting to aim that much intense heat on my hair every time I use this.</li>
            <li> It has multiple settings (hot - cool), etc which will never be used.  </li>
            <li> That other Conair dryer experience was enough to scare me for good.</li>
            <li> As for drying, I just use the high and medium hot settings and wow!  </li>
            <li> so save your money unless you need the constant usage of a true pro line salon dryer.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a button for instant cool.</li>
            <li> I especially like it having variable speeds plus the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> WOW does it get HOT.</li>
            <li> If you really want high speed and high heat, this one is not for you.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 heat settings, a high &amp; low setting and a cool shot button.</li>
            <li> The silver/black color combo goes well in a contemporary bathroom.</li>
            <li> for several years, even buying a second one when I dropped it one too many times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Conair for many years because it&#x27;s the only hair dryer that performs well for my needs.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it get pretty hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are still using an older dryer without the ionic technology, it&#x27;s time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li> My other dryer (also a conair but a folding model) does a fine job for my morning showers, not so much for the before bed shower.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Conair has a noticeably stronger motor than the Revlon, but doesn&#x27;t seem to maintain heat at the high speed setting.  </li>
            <li> , I think this is a HIGH QUALITY, HIGH EFFICIENCY hair dryer ...</li>
            <li> Both are fairly strong and don&#x27;t have any of the various problems I have experienced with cheaper hair dryers (being a man who didn&#x27;t like the idea of paying much for a non-manly product, I actually wasted more money trying to buy garbage) such as burning smells and scary noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, it was obvious</li>
            <li> When I was done, my hair actually looked better than it does at the salon when they dry it!</li>
            <li> It looks and operates like pretty much any hair dryer, but it does have plenty of power and heat (you do need to keep your distance with it) to dry hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a powerful dryer for straightening long curly hair this is your pick.</li>
            <li> This happens a lot when I go to the stylist (who then flattens them with a hot, hot, hot iron, which I really don&#x27;t like for everyday), so I think this hairdryer might have more in common with the dryers he uses (especially since it&#x27;s designed to be super fast drying - hard to be both fast AND fight frizz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a dude, I have short, coarse hair, and it dries it quickly without a fuss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has the usual hot/warm/cold settings, and the low and high power options of most dryers.</li>
            <li> Bought this on Today&#x27;s Deals as my old dryer was almost 8 years old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional hairstylist for over 10 years</li>
            <li> and it is also a bit loud.</li>
            <li> AND NOT HEAVY TOO.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly three inches longer than the BaByliss and even longer if you include the air directing attachment.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up holding this thing almost a foot away from my body to direct it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but since the nozzle&#x27;s so long -- and my arms are not -- it&#x27;s still pretty darned close to my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tucked this away for company&#x27;s use, though, and will continue to use my smaller, much lighter dryer in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the fast drying when using it on my pets after their baths.</li>
            <li> &quot; button is fantastic for use with a round brush for adding plenty of volume -- at the roots, or for doing bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find I prefer my old one [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I prefer the soft to touch exterior of my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Professional quality&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only concern is how long it will last, but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and no troubles so far.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and had been using the other one for scrunching and drying, but this one is too powerful to do that without a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is a tad heavier than my current Conair, but the power and performance more than make-up for this small inconvenience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I cannot recommend this hair dryer for several reasons, none of which apply to my older Conair 1875 dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so hot that I only use it on the low heat setting.  </li>
            <li> THINKING it was set on high, when I discovered it was only on medium.  </li>
            <li> This dryer gets hot so be careful not to hold to closely to your scalp.</li>
            <li> It was still pretty wet</li>
            <li> I have never had a blow dryer dry this fast.</li>
            <li> I expected it to last a LOT longer than the old cheap one that finally broke on her last year.</li>
            <li> The Baby Bliss has a thick plastic screw on part that is substantial and easy to take on or off.</li>
            <li> My hair can get dried much quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my old Conair hair dryer with the same wattage.</li>
            <li> I have a similar Conair that is 15 years old and it works as well as it did on day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, but the output is worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with the attachment to target a section, has the cool shot feature which toggles on and off, and comes with a small bottle of Argon Oil.</li>
            <li> It did dry my hair extremely fast, even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m a bit spoiled, using a &#x27;travel&#x27; style hairdryer, but even my husband (who has thicker hair that he doesn&#x27;t style but just wants to dry as quickly as possible) complains about the weight of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little heavy but love the amount of air it produces as well as the different setting level choices I have.</li>
            <li> The plus is that it is powerful, however the problem I find with this hair dryer is that the opening where the air comes out is small</li>
            <li> Although a bit on the heavy side, it is not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> If it claims to dry 50% faster, do you then time your old one and see if this one blows that one away?</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and on the thin side, and it dries pretty fast as it is, but this dryer had my hair styled and ready to go in almost half the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Powerful, fast drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ionic technology to tame frizz</li>
            <li> Wow, it doesn&#x27;t even compare the other one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have long hair to about the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it to dry my hair when it was very long</li>
            <li> The InfinitPro blows hot and hard...</li>
            <li> It seems to be just as hot, and it&#x27;s blowing just as hard, so I&#x27;m at a loss to explain this.</li>
            <li> the claims about the motor lasting a long time interest me as well.  </li>
            <li> I am glad, because upon my first use, I am very uncomfortable with the heavy weight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did not spend the crazy $$$ for a pro line dryer when I get the same result with InfinitiPro.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me so much, but it seems weird to have the option on the switch without it working very well.</li>
            <li> The weight is actually less than my old weaker one</li>
            <li> \\&quot;old\\&quot; hairdryer, is less than 3 years old.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had a professional model for a while which is actually quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Also, since I don&#x27;t just dry but also style with my blowdryer (first a rough dry, then section my hair and style using a round brush)</li>
            <li> I was able to thoroughly dry My (very thick) waist length hair, and style bangs and add volume to sides with round brush, in 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> dryer comes with a concentrator, but I was disappointed it does NOT come with a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging also includes a sample of Argan Oil, but I can not review the oil because I have very fine hair which is weighed down too much by oils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of cheap plastic that is hard to pull off and seems like it would be damaged easily if you pulled it off too hard or snapped it back wrong.</li>
            <li> When I turned it to high, the velocity was unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> It has a long cord and a hook for hanging.</li>
            <li> For this price point, I expected the InfinitiPro to be around the same level of quality and design intelligence.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise they both have the same features -- hot, cold, warm with the blue cold</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the controls for heat, volume of air and on/off are all on the grip exactly where you are holding it, so that it is very difficult to use without toggling one of the switches and changing the setting from where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, even the low volume of air is much, much too much - it blows the hair so forcefully that it makes anything but pure drying impossible</li>
            <li> I would feel like my hair was dry but would wake up looking like a q-tip (a sign of damp hair)</li>
            <li> I let it towel dry for about 5 minutes, applied product, then let it air dry about 10 minutes while I did my makeup.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to really dry out my hair either</li>
            <li> Cord is average, in length -- not too long, not too short.</li>
            <li> I never really had a preference with dryers before, they dried your hair, that was it as far as I was concerned</li>
            <li> this: It has a limited 4-year guarantee.  </li>
            <li> so it takes me a while to dry my hair and its harder to style.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer three times now, and I think I&#x27;ll go back to using the previous one and keep this one as a spare.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my hair smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think it actually takes a little longer to fully dry my hair.</li>
            <li> but I had the other hairdryer so long that I miss it</li>
            <li> dryer did produce a smooth style with minimal frizz, but not noticeably different than my previous, less expensive ionic dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nearly twice a heavy as my previous Revlon RV484 Ion 1875</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that normally takes a long time to dry, and I have found Conair dryers to work well for me.</li>
            <li> Minus a star because the argan oil is a chemical laden variant.</li>
            <li> With my old dryer, I would have to leave the dryer pointed at each section of hair for about a minute, and it still was limp when I removed my round brush.</li>
            <li> but I decided since one of the claims is that it will dry your hair in half the time</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer had my hair dry in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It literally takes me half the time it did before to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This is like buying olive oil that has 10 other chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping this one in the house and sending the other one camping.  </li>
            <li> my other dryer.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I&#x27;l use it but with extreme caution.</li>
            <li> , I have to be very careful when it comes to heat settings... and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually this takes about 5 or 6 minutes with previous blow driers of the same 1875 wattage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 2 tone silver &amp; black that fade into each other.</li>
            <li> -I would say it is slightly heavier than some other blow dryers, but I would not have noticed it without having read the reviews.  </li>

            <li> The only complaint is that it won&#x27;t turn on now after 7 months of use.</li>
            <li> I am also uncomfortable with how much vibration the motor produces.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad heavier and a tad longer/larger than my old dryer--which was not happy for my wrists.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer is a Revlon RV544.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt the dryer will cut my drying time in half.  </li>

            <li> It cut my drying time down by a few minutes.</li>

            <li> I had read some of the reviews of people saying it was heavy</li>
            <li> thing is HEAVY.</li>
            <li> I have been using a 20 dollar conair hair dryer for years and while it did the job, I now see what I have been missing out</li>
            <li> It dried our hair, it blew when it should.</li>
            <li> And it did seem to cut a few minutes off my drying time.</li>
            <li> It takes the round curve of my styling brush and stays that</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dryer is slightly heavy, but it&#x27;s a price</li>
            <li> As an engineer, I can&#x27;t see a difference between this one and five others that she has had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they include a small bottle of Argan oil which works to deflect some of the heat damage</li>
            <li> but I am very skeptical about getting used to the very heavy weight and considerable vibration.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I can say bad about it is that it is a bit heavy to hold</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it is quite heavy and awkward to hold - the weight is unbalanced and the grip is narrow, so it keeps feeling like it is falling out of your grasp and tires the wrist within a minute</li>
            <li> I have a less expensive [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no diffuser included, only a concentrator, and it is oddly annoying to attach--popped off three times before fitting.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to agree with other reviewers who felt that the length was really awkward to hold -</li>
            <li> my arms got very tired.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;cold, blue\\</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t awkward to hold or anything like that.</li>
            <li> (However, I would recommend this dryer instead if you utilize the cold air setting most.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cold shot toggle--sets hair into shape</li>
            <li> I was actually shocked.</li>
            <li> the InfinitiPro is a QUALITY hair dryer; but I was shocked [and disappointed] at the weight.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a LOT of super fine baby hair. My other dryer (also a conair but a folding model) does a fine job for my morning showers, not so much for the before bed shower. I would feel like my hair was dry but would wake up looking like a q-tip (a sign of damp hair), this dryer has been wonderful! My more portable dryer now has a permanent place in my suitcase so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the \\&quot;fans\\&quot; that hotels provide. This dryer gets hot so be careful not to hold to closely to your scalp. I&#x27;m so glad I did not spend the crazy $$$ for a pro line dryer when I get the same result with InfinitiPro. Keep in mind pro dryers are meant to dry many heads a day not just 1 or 2 so save your money unless you need the constant usage of a true pro line salon dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought this on Today&#x27;s Deals as my old dryer was almost 8 years old.  Strong motor, built well, like the cleanable filter.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is pretty nice. It&#x27;s pretty comparable to the Baby Bliss one I already had. The thing I don&#x27;t like about this model is the part that you pull off to clean the filter. It&#x27;s made of cheap plastic that is hard to pull off and seems like it would be damaged easily if you pulled it off too hard or snapped it back wrong. The Baby Bliss has a thick plastic screw on part that is substantial and easy to take on or off. Otherwise they both have the same features -- hot, cold, warm with the blue cold button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not any louder or more quiet than most hairdryers. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although I purchased this item, it is my wife that uses it so she is the one that loves it.  She is especially happy with its drying power.  She has proudly shown it to several of her good female friends,which she only does when she is very happy with something.  She has mentioned to me several times how much she likes it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Bought same dryer from target about 3 years ago, comparable price. This one is even nicer though. It dries faster. I&#x27;ve been a professional hairstylist for over 10 years and this is a great dryer for the money. I use this one at home.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace my old Conair hair dryer with the same wattage. This is louder and much powerful. My hair can get dried much quickly. I think my hair looks better too. I love the finishing and button lay out.</li>
            <li> Gets my hair dry in a &#x27;jiffy&#x27; which is the most important feature for me.  I wish it had a retractable cord but otherwise a good dryer.  Have to get used to the rocking buttons (hit them mistakenly often now) but should be easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> bought this for my g/f after my douche bag friend broke hers. This thing is beast. The InfinitPro blows hot and hard... just like I like my blow driers.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great. I like that it has 3 heat settings and a &amp;#34;blast&#x27; button. It is very stylish looking and smooth to the touch! The only thing that I can say bad about it is that it is a bit heavy to hold and it is also a bit loud. (even on the lowest setting!) I got this on sale and it came with a small bottle of aregone oil which is great to use on your skin. I would buy this again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Solid performance from Conair hair dryer. Easy to use buttons, nice construction. Reliable and powerful. The silver/black color combo goes well in a contemporary bathroom.</li>
            <li> What can I say I&#x27;m a guy so I was told to buy a dryer so I choose this one it was money we&#x27;ll spent quality and looks is great, what I was told was that it should have come with a comb to fit at the end this didn&#x27;t but apart from that product is good I give it a 4 with the comb it would have gotten a 5</li>
            <li> This conair hair dryer is just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for me. The plus is that it is powerful, however the problem I find with this hair dryer is that the opening where the air comes out is small so it takes me a while to dry my hair and its harder to style. But all and all its an OK dryer.</li>
            <li> I replaced an underpowered Remington dryer with this and I am very pleased with it.  The dryer is heavier than many, but it has plenty of power and i am getting good results.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER AND ME LIKES IT. VERY QUIET WHEN USING . AND NOT HEAVY TOO. GREAT PRODUCT LOVE THE QUALITY</li>
            <li> Very powerful!  I like the 3 temperature settings, hot, warm, and cool.  It is a bit heavy, but the output is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this blow drier it has many speeds and temps and comes with a nice attachment.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I first used this model at my yoga studio and had to get one for home, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. The first few times I used it to dry my hair when it was very long my arms got very tired. However, I am used to it now and it really does the job. If you are looking for a powerful dryer for straightening long curly hair this is your pick.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  As an engineer, I can&#x27;t see a difference between this one and five others that she has had in the past.  But, happy wife, happy life.  It has multiple settings (hot - cool), etc which will never be used.  A simple on/off switch would have saved money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend.  She said it&#x27;s the best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever owned.  It is very good quality and works well.</li>
            <li> I received the InfinitiPro today &amp; perfect timing since I had just washed my hair. I was able to try it out immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look of the dryer is really nice. It&#x27;s a 2 tone silver &amp; black that fade into each other. It has a long cord and a hook for hanging. There is a removable filter. The toggle buttons are easy to push. There are 3 heat settings, a high &amp; low setting and a cool shot button. It came with only one attachment, a concentrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself has an AC motor with both ceramic &amp; ionic technology. It&#x27;s 1875 watt. It also came with a little bottle of Argan oil. I didn&#x27;t try the oil, my hair tends to not like oils so I didn&#x27;t want to chance it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair to about the middle of my back. I let it towel dry for about 5 minutes, applied product, then let it air dry about 10 minutes while I did my makeup. It was still pretty wet but I decided since one of the claims is that it will dry your hair in half the time, I would go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer had my hair dry in less than 10 minutes. I was actually shocked. I used the high setting on warm. I just tousled it with my fingers &amp; then used a brush to smooth the ends. When I was done, my hair actually looked better than it does at the salon when they dry it! It had more volume, was smooth with no frizz or static. It was also very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this hair dryer! I never really had a preference with dryers before, they dried your hair, that was it as far as I was concerned but this one has changed my mind.</li>
            <li> I have been really wedded to my [[ASIN:B000ASDGK8 BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme  Dryer]] for several years, even buying a second one when I dropped it one too many times.  For this price point, I expected the InfinitiPro to be around the same level of quality and design intelligence.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with other reviewers who felt that the length was really awkward to hold - it&#x27;s nearly three inches longer than the BaByliss and even longer if you include the air directing attachment.  I blow dry my thick bangs every morning and I ended up holding this thing almost a foot away from my body to direct it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons are also in quite the awkward spot - I was always switching it from hot to cool to low while drying.  It takes longer to get warm than the BaByliss and I think this one causes more frizz.  My bangs definitely frizzed out at the ends after drying with a big brush.  This happens a lot when I go to the stylist (who then flattens them with a hot, hot, hot iron, which I really don&#x27;t like for everyday), so I think this hairdryer might have more in common with the dryers he uses (especially since it&#x27;s designed to be super fast drying - hard to be both fast AND fight frizz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the grossest part of this dryer package is the free bottle of \\&quot;Argan oil\\&quot; that comes in the package.  The ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;- Dimethicone (silicone), Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Fragrance, Argana Spinosa Kernel Oil (ah, THERE&#x27;s the actual argan oil!), yellow 11 (CI 470000), and Red 17 (CI 261000).  Compare that to the ingredients of actual argan oil like [[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]] -- there&#x27;s only one: argan oil.  This is like buying olive oil that has 10 other chemical ingredients.  Gross.  Don&#x27;t put that stuff on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I intended to use this for a full week to give it a full review trial, but I knew after two days (I swim, and dry my hair twice a day) to know that this was not going to work.  Back into the box it goes.  Maybe my stylist will want it.</li>
            <li> This is a bargain of a hair dryer.  It looks and operates like pretty much any hair dryer, but it does have plenty of power and heat (you do need to keep your distance with it) to dry hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt it was louder than ideal, but I&#x27;m very picky about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls work well (they stick out and click easily... you don&#x27;t really have to look to know what you&#x27;ve selected) and are dead simple.  You can control the temp (in a binary sense) and control the air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a small hair dryer, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the best for travel, but it feels solid.  the claims about the motor lasting a long time interest me as well.  I have a similar Conair that is 15 years old and it works as well as it did on day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is that it&#x27;s a good hair dryer for an excellent price.  On the basis of value, compared to about five hair dryers, I think this is a five star product.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair so I need a powerful hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve only used Conair for many years because it&#x27;s the only hair dryer that performs well for my needs.  I loved this dryer.  The buttons are conveniently located and it is very powerful.  It cut my drying time down by a few minutes. I love the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button.  You don&#x27;t have to hold it down and it really dispersed cold air.  It also has a removable filter that can be easily cleaned.  This dryer is a tad heavier than my current Conair, but the power and performance more than make-up for this small inconvenience.</li>
            <li> This dries surprisingly fast.  I have curly/wavy hair- this dryer styles well at great speed!  I had read some of the reviews of people saying it was heavy-I would say it is slightly heavier than some other blow dryers, but I would not have noticed it without having read the reviews.  If someone had limited strength in their arms or pain for some reason, then perhaps a lighter blow dryer would be best.  Otherwise, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Super powerful. Not too hot. It is significantly heavier than my old hair dryer, but it works so quickly you won&#x27;t have to hold for long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing.</li>
            <li> Good results and quieter than my old hair dryer. It gets a little bit heavy when I am trying to manipulate this and a round brush.</li>
            <li> My wife has long, thick hair and uses a hair dryer every day. She&#x27;s had a professional model for a while which is actually quite heavy. This InfinitPro is so much lighter it is a relief to her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to control with essentially six settings: high and low speed with cool, warm and hot temperatures.  Plus it has a button for instant cool. Not only does it get pretty hot but the fan is very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lint catcher is easy to remove and clean and it also comes with a removable concentrator. It is comfortable to hold and stylish looking, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InfinitiPro  is a powerful hair dryer that should work for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> My previous hair dryer is a Revlon RV544.  Both are fairly strong and don&#x27;t have any of the various problems I have experienced with cheaper hair dryers (being a man who didn&#x27;t like the idea of paying much for a non-manly product, I actually wasted more money trying to buy garbage) such as burning smells and scary noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One absolute benefit of this Conair over the Revlon is the flip-out grill which is easier to clean.  Yes, the Revlon has a flip-out grill, but with one fatal design flaw.  The flip-out portion of the Revlon has enormous holes which don&#x27;t catch anything, and all of the hair ends up clogged on the inner safety grill which is even deeper inside the dryer.  Blech.  The Conair, on the other hand, has nice tiny holes on the flip-out grill which catch hair and lint before going further, and are easy to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair has a noticeably stronger motor than the Revlon, but doesn&#x27;t seem to maintain heat at the high speed setting.  If you really want high speed and high heat, this one is not for you.  I don&#x27;t use hair dryers on the highest setting so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me so much, but it seems weird to have the option on the switch without it working very well.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this hair dryer, and it was a great value for the price. It has cut down her hair drying by 5 or 10 minutes, and has a nice strong flow. The cool button is great and she uses it quite a bit. The only complaint is that it won&#x27;t turn on now after 7 months of use. I expected it to last a LOT longer than the old cheap one that finally broke on her last year. I will be calling Conair tomorrow to place a warranty claim and I hope it goes smoothly. Other than the &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work now&amp;#34; factor, it&#x27;s been a great hair dryer and all the features and design are spot on.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, it was obvious the InfinitiPro is a QUALITY hair dryer; but I was shocked [and disappointed] at the weight.  It is nearly twice a heavy as my previous Revlon RV484 Ion 1875 Watt Hair Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astonished at the SHEER POWER.  I was drying my hair THINKING it was set on high, when I discovered it was only on medium.  When I turned it to high, the velocity was unbelievable.  There is no doubt the dryer will cut my drying time in half.  I am glad, because upon my first use, I am very uncomfortable with the heavy weight.  I am also uncomfortable with how much vibration the motor produces.  I am sure the incredible power comes at a price, but I am not sure I am going to get used to the heavy weight and the considerable vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toggle switches are very easy to operate to change settings.  The three heat settings and two power settings make the drying options very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with a concentrator, but I was disappointed it does NOT come with a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging also includes a sample of Argan Oil, but I can not review the oil because I have very fine hair which is weighed down too much by oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer did produce a smooth style with minimal frizz, but not noticeably different than my previous, less expensive ionic dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I think this is a HIGH QUALITY, HIGH EFFICIENCY hair dryer ... but I am very skeptical about getting used to the very heavy weight and considerable vibration.</li>
            <li> My last Conair dryer lasted for over 5 years before it blew out.  I liked the brand, so I decided to try the InfinitiPro model.  Lightweight and easy to manage, this blow dryer does all it was advertised to do.  I especially like it having variable speeds plus the cool shot button. My hair is long and on the thin side, and it dries pretty fast as it is, but this dryer had my hair styled and ready to go in almost half the time.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  It is really strong so does a quicker job than my old one.  The handle is just right for my hand and I was able to use it easily.  The weight is actually less than my old weaker one so that is nice plus too.  There are several different settings for different needs - very happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife to try and here is her reaction:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a Conair 1875 Hair Dryer for many years and it is the best hair dryer I have ever had, so I was very positively inclined to this new model from Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I cannot recommend this hair dryer for several reasons, none of which apply to my older Conair 1875 dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is quite heavy and awkward to hold - the weight is unbalanced and the grip is narrow, so it keeps feeling like it is falling out of your grasp and tires the wrist within a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the controls for heat, volume of air and on/off are all on the grip exactly where you are holding it, so that it is very difficult to use without toggling one of the switches and changing the setting from where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, even the low volume of air is much, much too much - it blows the hair so forcefully that it makes anything but pure drying impossible (you cannot do any kind of styling with a brush simultaneously). I did not even try the higher setting as I was sure it would blow my head off :) This may work better if used by a stylist holding the dryer considerably farther away from their client&#x27;s head, but for personal use I could not get the dryer nozzle far enough away from my head to be either pleasant or effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the appearance is very sleek and modern and it plugs in and is ready for use very easily, I don&#x27;t think this is a well designed product overall.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair. As a result, I don&#x27;t need a *ton* of power from my hair dryer, but I do need reliable temperature control. Also, since I don&#x27;t just dry but also style with my blowdryer (first a rough dry, then section my hair and style using a round brush), I have to be very careful when it comes to heat settings... and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is HEAVY. H-E-A-V-Y. It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m a bit spoiled, using a &#x27;travel&#x27; style hairdryer, but even my husband (who has thicker hair that he doesn&#x27;t style but just wants to dry as quickly as possible) complains about the weight of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the heat. WOW does it get HOT. I use the lowest heat setting on this but since the nozzle&#x27;s so long -- and my arms are not -- it&#x27;s still pretty darned close to my hair. I just can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m comfortable exposing my hair to that kind of heat day after day. Yes, they include a small bottle of Argan oil which works to deflect some of the heat damage but it doesn&#x27;t make sense that I have to use a special product to compensate for what seems an overkill with heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the cool blast is nice. It definitely sets a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tucked this away for company&#x27;s use, though, and will continue to use my smaller, much lighter dryer in the meantime.</li>
            <li> A little heavy but love the amount of air it produces as well as the different setting level choices I have.</li>
            <li> I have been using a 20 dollar conair hair dryer for years and while it did the job, I now see what I have been missing out on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this is a sleek and modern looking dryer.  Although a bit on the heavy side, it is not uncomfortably so. It feels very solid and well built. As for drying, I just use the high and medium hot settings and wow!  Super fast, super strong air. I have never had a blow dryer dry this fast. I especially appreciate the fast drying when using it on my pets after their baths. It doesn&#x27;t seem to really dry out my hair either, it looks great aftewards - smooth and soft. I am very pleased with this blow dryer and have already recommended it to a few friends.</li>
            <li> InfinitiPro by Conair Full Size Salon Performance / AC Motor Dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can never have too many hair styling tools! &#x27;nuf said. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InfinitiPro by Conair is Impressive right out of the box with its Sleek -- gray on black -- design that goes with most any decor. Cord is average, in length -- not too long, not too short. There is only one \\&quot;concentrator\\&quot; type attachment, included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things, among many, I liked about InfinitiPro by Conair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*3 heat, 2 speed settings -- rocker type switches that are easy to switch -- while styling -- with gentle press of finger tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The \\&quot;cold, blue\\&quot; button is fantastic for use with a round brush for adding plenty of volume -- at the roots, or for doing bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The removable filter, on the backside, is easy to remove and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The speed/force of the airflow.  I was able to thoroughly dry My (very thick) waist length hair, and style bangs and add volume to sides with round brush, in 3 minutes. Usually this takes about 5 or 6 minutes with previous blow driers of the same 1875 wattage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally Amazing! *smiles, sips espresso*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the InfinitiPro by Conair Full Size Salon Performance / AC Motor Dryer sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013</li>
            <li> I have a less expensive [[ASIN:B00005O0MZ Conair 1875 Watt Turbo Styler with Ionic Conditioning]]that I&#x27;d been using that I was perfectly satisfied with.  I needed another for the camper, so I decided to order this one to review.  Wow, it doesn&#x27;t even compare the other one.  It&#x27;s much more powerful and it gets hotter...so hot that I only use it on the low heat setting.  I have curly hair and had been using the other one for scrunching and drying, but this one is too powerful to do that without a diffuser.  It&#x27;s great for straightening though.  I&#x27;m keeping this one in the house and sending the other one camping.  :)</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have to disclose that my previous hairdryer is a Conair, so I&#x27;m used to the heat and force that this line generates. I have very thick hair that normally takes a long time to dry, and I have found Conair dryers to work well for me. This one is good, but it&#x27;s not any better than my previous dryer. In fact, I think it actually takes a little longer to fully dry my hair. It seems to be just as hot, and it&#x27;s blowing just as hard, so I&#x27;m at a loss to explain this. I have used this dryer three times now, and I think I&#x27;ll go back to using the previous one and keep this one as a spare. It&#x27;s a very nice dryer, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;all that.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> How does one review a hairdryer? If it claims to dry 50% faster, do you then time your old one and see if this one blows that one away? Do you compare looks? Ease of use? Measure the Cord length?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My \\&quot;old\\&quot; hairdryer, is less than 3 years old. I have always had a problem with how its buttons were placed, more like sliding switches that you had to rip a fingernail off using. It dried our hair, it blew when it should. But I wanted something I did not have to wrestle with to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InfinitPro by Conair has the most magnificent buttons for hot/cold and on/off aka low/high. It did dry my hair extremely fast, even on the low setting. That comes in handy when all you want to be doing in the morning is sipping coffee with your spouse not drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The looks of it? sleek, stylish, modern and hairdryery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a teeny bottle of Argan Oil that came with it, I dont know why...its all the rage these days. I myself have been using the stuff for years, so a little more is nice but not really needed as a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had the Blackbird Conair Pro 2,000 Watts.  It was great!  I like them hot, and this one, being 1,875 Watts, isn&#x27;t as hot.  However, to be fair, I cannot figure out why it blew my hair out so fast, and why my round brush curls were more intense.  This model, being comparable in price, has advantages over the Blackbird.  It has 3 temperatures, 3 speeds, and a cool button.  Plus this Ombre look of the ceramic looks cool.  It comes with a taster of argan oil and a spot attachment.  It is just well-designed, except for the fact that my finger keeps sliding the heat button off.  Maybe it is just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an AC motor for 3X longer life -&lt;br /&gt;It has a removable filter -&lt;br /&gt;It has ionic ceramic technology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this: It has a limited 4-year guarantee.  My Blackbird has 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like this may just be made better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  It blows very well.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this thing. As a dude, I have short, coarse hair, and it dries it quickly without a fuss. Only concern is how long it will last, but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and no troubles so far. Isn&#x27;t awkward to hold or anything like that. Minus a star because the argan oil is a chemical laden variant.</li>
            <li> I received this dryer free to review but I find I prefer my old one [[ASIN:B003V264WW Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer]] for my needs.  (However, I would recommend this dryer instead if you utilize the cold air setting most.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it almost got five stars.&lt;br /&gt;1)  Strong air current---even on the cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;2) Cool setting is actually cool not warm.&lt;br /&gt;3) I like the reusable cord tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it did not get five stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It&#x27;s a tad heavier and a tad longer/larger than my old dryer--which was not happy for my wrists.&lt;br /&gt;2) There&#x27;s no diffuser included, only a concentrator, and it is oddly annoying to attach--popped off three times before fitting.&lt;br /&gt;3) I think the finish of my hair is less shiny than with my other dryer.&lt;br /&gt;4) I prefer the soft to touch exterior of my Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not try the bonus hair oil.  This will make a good guest dryer at my house.</li>
            <li> This is a really strong dryer but it gets very hot. That&#x27;s what worries me. I&#x27;ve previously owned a Conair dryer that performed wonderfully until sparks shot out the side of it while I was blowing my hair. It scared me. But in all fairness this dryer works well, has a cool shot, a concentrator and argan oil. And it did seem to cut a few minutes off my drying time. I&#x27;l use it but with extreme caution. That other Conair dryer experience was enough to scare me for good.</li>
            <li> Have just had this a few days, but so far the best hair dryer I have ever purchased, with quality construction, excellent airflow and head, with logical controls</li>
            <li> Professional quality&lt;br /&gt;This is a super powerful hairdryer. It literally takes me half the time it did before to dry my hair. With my old dryer, I would have to leave the dryer pointed at each section of hair for about a minute, and it still was limp when I removed my round brush. With this, it&#x27;s literally 4 or 5 seconds, and it&#x27;s done. And that&#x27;s the best reason for upgrading to this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are still using an older dryer without the ionic technology, it&#x27;s time for an upgrade. It definitely makes my hair smoother and less frizzy. My hair sets into the shape that I dry it in better with this. It takes the round curve of my styling brush and stays that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has the usual hot/warm/cold settings, and the low and high power options of most dryers. The easy toggle switches are a nice touch, and can allow changes with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the attachment to target a section, has the cool shot feature which toggles on and off, and comes with a small bottle of Argon Oil. This isn&#x27;t terribly loud either which is surprising considering how fast it dries. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That hot setting is really HOT. I won&#x27;t be using that one, out of not wanting to aim that much intense heat on my hair every time I use this. Warm is actually beyond warm and fairly hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is slightly heavy, but it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay for the speed. This is like a wind tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, fast drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ionic technology to tame frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with attachment to target sections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has cold shot toggle--sets hair into shape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has hanger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toggle switches are easy to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with small bottle of Argon Oil, good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for super fast blow-drying. This is a perfect, stylish looking hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It works well but I had the other hairdryer so long that I miss it</li>
