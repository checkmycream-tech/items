    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It suits our needs perfectly, and am very happy with both the item and the seller.</li>
            <li>but once I used it I was truly impressed.</li>
            <li>Good, I use this for every shampoo, very good.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li>and it leaks badly...not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>That works great.</li>
            <li>Great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li>This item was good and serve the purpose.</li>
            <li>The funnel part is a good idea.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good using it on an elderly person to keep the soap and water out of their eyes.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;really love it!</li>
            <li>At first glance it looked like the perfect product for my needs, but when I used it</li>
            <li>Maybe after washing it in warm water it might loosen up.</li>
            <li>I think if you&#x27;re aware of what you&#x27;re purchasing, you will be happy.</li>
            <li>There are better solutions out there.  </li>
            <li>About to purchase one more.</li>
            <li>It may have more to do with that my grandmother cannot sit up like the woman in the picture.</li>
            <li>Might be better if there was more plastic at front</li>
            <li>It is okay for just shampoo and wash</li>
            <li>A garbage bag worked better.</li>
            <li>i really love this product.</li>
            <li>and the nurse said she was going to recommend it to many of her patients.</li>
            <li>this has taken a lot of the struggle out of shampooing my wife&#x27;s hair - goes on pretty easily and does a good job of containing the soapy water</li>
            <li>However, it was the more comfortable of the two.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a shame the designer didn&#x27;t put a little more thought into it because the use of elastic (instead of Velcro) and using a lighter weight of vinyl would have resulted in an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Amazing and very helpful for my mother!</li>
            <li>It works fine, but then the front and side hairlines get missed.</li>
            <li>This would work great if I had a low kitchen sink to wash my moms hair</li>
            <li>This product came with 2 smooth sides so they wouldn&#x27;t stick together.</li>
            <li>I use a wheelchair and cant fit in my restroom, so I brush my teeth in my room.</li>
            <li>i liked it very much&lt;br /&gt;ty</li>
            <li>For thoroughly clean hair I put it in front of the ears.  </li>
            <li>Wear in front of the ears, suffer the discomfort, but come away with thoroughly clean hair.</li>
            <li>I think it would work good if there was a proper fit, unfortunately, it is not a one-size-fits-all.</li>
            <li>The top part will not fasten around my client&#x27;s head, maybe if it were bigger or more like a cape.</li>
            <li>so you could effectively divert water toward the back.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was exactly what it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Other than that all is good.</li>
            <li>Went right into the garbage.</li>
            <li>It would not do for heavy duty use, but is easy to use for in-home care and easy to pack and keep clean.</li>
            <li>It gets daily use and lasts about a year before it gets to many tears to use.</li>
            <li>I do hair at a nursing home and use hair funnels on most of my clients but this one was just too big.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to order this product</li>
            <li>This is a good aid in the grooming of a bedridden or disabled patient.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well except that the funnel needs to be a few inches longer for washing the hair of an elderly person in a wheelchair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and does the job.  </li>
            <li>i ordered for my mom because she can&#x27;t really bend to wash her hair and salons</li>
            <li>My mother said it worked very well</li>
            <li>One is left with a choice:  wear as recommended and you&#x27;ll have to wash more frequently.  </li>
            <li>This product works great but is for a very small head!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this!!!</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>The top is too small to use on an adult&#x27;s head comfortably.</li>
            <li>It works and that&#x27;s the main thing.</li>
            <li>The front and sides do not come up as high making water splash out.</li>
            <li>The top part around the head is a little flimsy but if there are two people we don&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>This shampoo funnel worked very well for an elderly person or a young child who would have problems bending over a sink or shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this once before in a retail store but had to replace it online due to it no longer being available in stores.</li>
            <li>Being bedbound for a couple of months lately, this funnel came in very handy for getting my hair washed while laying down.  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The 1st was of thinner material and it developed a leak.  </li>
            <li>My 92 year old grandmother has issues with washing her hair.</li>
            <li>There are other products that claim to shampoo your hair without using water, but nothing perks up a client like clean, shampooed hair, especially if they are confined by illness.</li>
            <li>My mother is a small woman and still didn&#x27;t fit around her head.  </li>
            <li>He is paralyzed and can&#x27;t get a shampoo under normal circumstances, this was a big help.</li>
            <li>It has two separate velcro sections of which consists of one side rough and other smooth</li>
            <li>I could barely put it on her.</li>
            <li>I find it a little narrow on the top.  </li>
            <li>- still get a little down her back and onto the floor, but mostly because she&#x27;s so short - someone about 5&#x27;3\\&quot; or taller (or sat with the bottom of their hairline in back about 3\\&quot; above the sink) would not have that problem ...</li>
            <li>but I still can&#x27;t get head back far enough to stay dry.</li>

            <li> but I still can&#x27;t get head back far enough to stay dry.</li>
            <li> The plastic is not large enough to provide any protection from the water and so does not \\&quot;funnel\\&quot; the water anywhere,  </li>
            <li> It will not let loose.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t adjust this to be small enough for any of my female clients.</li>
            <li> Although it is tight enough to lines on forehead went you.</li>
            <li> Leaves the person totally wet and soaked.</li>
            <li> The item fights very tight, I wish it was a bit larger.</li>
            <li> I have a client who finds his final too small for the size of their skill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty well useless.</li>
            <li> I realized that this does not work well for thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing especially since it was really needed!</li>
            <li> elastic is too tight around the head.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought, little bit of a water mess..</li>
            <li> If my mother moves her head a little the funnel slips off the edge and the water runs all over the floor.</li>
            <li> Would not fit over my mom&#x27;s little head.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for my Mom who has a tough time leaning back in the shampoo bowl at her hairdressers.  </li>
            <li> We have used it a few time.</li>
            <li> She said it was not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> My mom passed within a few days of receiving.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> The binding around the head does not fit as snug so the water leaks.</li>
            <li> Unless you have very little hair and use very little water, this will not work for you.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mother who is disabled and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Never able to use.  </li>
            <li> This is an awful design and to small for most peoples heads.</li>
            <li> This one works well, but is very stiff at the front where the velcro closure is at the forehead.  </li>
            <li> This was extremely tight on my very thin client.</li>
            <li> So, in my case where nothing else worked, this was the only way I could get my hair washed without using those WORTHLESS no rinse shampoos,</li>
            <li> Directions for use recommend wearing behind the ears.</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable, and slips down the face throughout the washing process.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it uncomfortable, it leaks horribly around the hairline no matter how tight it is.  </li>
            <li> It leaks like crazy all around.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother who is very ill.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> Just a bad idea all around.</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The top is too small to use on an adult&#x27;s head comfortably.</li>
            <li> Unless you have very little hair and use very little water, this will not work for you.  I have medium length hair and wanted it for someone to wash my hair in the sink, while I am seated in my wheelchair.  The plastic is not large enough to provide any protection from the water and so does not \\&quot;funnel\\&quot; the water anywhere,  Cheaply made and poorly designed.  Please do not waste your money. There are better solutions out there.  This is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This would work great if I had a low kitchen sink to wash my moms hair but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  It kept the water and soap out of her eyes.</li>
            <li> This works well for my aunt who is confined to a wheelchair. The stylist can funnel the water back to the sink, with the aid of a shampoo tray, and in combination with the tray, it fits the bill. She&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother who is very ill. We waited patiently for this and when it came, it was defective. It has two separate velcro sections of which consists of one side rough and other smooth so they stick together. This product came with 2 smooth sides so they wouldn&#x27;t stick together. Very disappointing especially since it was really needed!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! It leaks like crazy all around. Leaves the person totally wet and soaked. I can see why they won&#x27;t allow returns. That will teach me to trust the \\&quot;Product Features\\&quot; statement of \\&quot;No drips, leaks or mess\\&quot;. WHAT A LIE. NEVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Being bedbound for a couple of months lately, this funnel came in very handy for getting my hair washed while laying down.  This was the 2nd one of this type (but not by same manufacturer) that we had.  The 1st was of thinner material and it developed a leak.  However, it was the more comfortable of the two.  This one works well, but is very stiff at the front where the velcro closure is at the forehead.  It digs into your forehead all the while you are shampooing, and heaven forbid you get any of your hair stuck in the velcro.  It will not let loose.  So, in my case where nothing else worked, this was the only way I could get my hair washed without using those WORTHLESS no rinse shampoos,</li>
            <li> I think if you&#x27;re aware of what you&#x27;re purchasing, you will be happy. It suits our needs perfectly, and am very happy with both the item and the seller. About to purchase one more.</li>
            <li> I work for a company that does in home care.  We have taken this item in to use for clients and it works well.  It would not do for heavy duty use, but is easy to use for in-home care and easy to pack and keep clean. There are other products that claim to shampoo your hair without using water, but nothing perks up a client like clean, shampooed hair, especially if they are confined by illness.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought, little bit of a water mess.. But worked for traveling and needed to wash someone&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> My 92 year old grandmother has issues with washing her hair. So we were looking for a solution. The lady that comes and does her hair had something like this. We have used it a few time. The top part around the head is a little flimsy but if there are two people we don&#x27;t have any issues. I there is just one it seems we get water everywhere. It may have more to do with that my grandmother cannot sit up like the woman in the picture. All in all it does the job.</li>
            <li> This item was good and serve the purpose. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo funnel worked very well for an elderly person or a young child who would have problems bending over a sink or shower.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Head size matters! I have a client who finds his final too small for the size of their skill. I think it would work good if there was a proper fit, unfortunately, it is not a one-size-fits-all.</li>
            <li> This was extremely tight on my very thin client. She said it was not comfortable at all. I could barely put it on her. Maybe after washing it in warm water it might loosen up. Sorry!</li>
            <li> The funnel part is a good idea.  The top part will not fasten around my client&#x27;s head, maybe if it were bigger or more like a cape.</li>
            <li> This is a good aid in the grooming of a bedridden or disabled patient. I use it to wash my son&#x27;s hair. He is paralyzed and can&#x27;t get a shampoo under normal circumstances, this was a big help.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mother who is disabled and it works like a charm! I love it! Try it out!</li>
            <li> Never able to use.  My mom passed within a few days of receiving.</li>
            <li> The item fights very tight, I wish it was a bit larger. Other than that all is good. It works and that&#x27;s the main thing. I just bought another for a back up if needed. Thanks</li>
            <li> I cannot comment because it has not been used. probably  helps if patient can hold in a wheelchair her head ...</li>
            <li> I am in a wheelchair and have my hair done at salon. They have a sink for wheelchair use but I still can&#x27;t get head back far enough to stay dry. Bought this to see if it would help. Although it is tight enough to lines on forehead went you. Re done it still leaks in back and front. Might be better if there was more plastic at front so you could effectively divert water toward the back.</li>
            <li> My mother is a small woman and still didn&#x27;t fit around her head.  Don&#x27;t waste money. Went right into the garbage.</li>
            <li> Good, I use this for every shampoo, very good.</li>
            <li> Does what you want it to do!!</li>
            <li> I dont use this for washing my hair. I use a wheelchair and cant fit in my restroom, so I brush my teeth in my room. I place this around my neck with the funnel facing forward into a tub on my lap. It gets daily use and lasts about a year before it gets to many tears to use.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and does the job.  Directions for use recommend wearing behind the ears. It works fine, but then the front and side hairlines get missed. For thoroughly clean hair I put it in front of the ears.  It is very uncomfortable, and slips down the face throughout the washing process.  Also leaks. One is left with a choice:  wear as recommended and you&#x27;ll have to wash more frequently.  Wear in front of the ears, suffer the discomfort, but come away with thoroughly clean hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes of keeping hair dye runoff off my body when rinsing post-dye in the shower. It&#x27;s really pretty well useless.</li>
            <li> this has taken a lot of the struggle out of shampooing my wife&#x27;s hair - goes on pretty easily and does a good job of containing the soapy water - still get a little down her back and onto the floor, but mostly because she&#x27;s so short - someone about 5&#x27;3\\&quot; or taller (or sat with the bottom of their hairline in back about 3\\&quot; above the sink) would not have that problem ...</li>
            <li> This product leaks from the sides and all over the floor. Do not waste your money on this!!! I tossed mine in the trash and am searching for something else.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Mom who has a tough time leaning back in the shampoo bowl at her hairdressers.  We tried this and it leaks badly...not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Would not fit over my mom&#x27;s little head.  Piece of junk.  Buy a 99 cent waterproof jacket instead.  That works great.</li>
            <li> I needed this for at home hair care ....</li>
            <li> I find it a little narrow on the top.  It is okay for just shampoo and wash but not if client has color to wash off.  Also water seeps through the elastic.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t adjust this to be small enough for any of my female clients. I do hair at a nursing home and use hair funnels on most of my clients but this one was just too big.</li>
            <li> This product was as described.  It&#x27;s really good using it on an elderly person to keep the soap and water out of their eyes.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my sister who had neck surgery.  Leaked all over her and the floor.  A garbage bag worked better.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well except that the funnel needs to be a few inches longer for washing the hair of an elderly person in a wheelchair. I back the wheelchair up to the sink as close as I can, and the hood just reaches the edge of the sink. However, there is no wiggle room. If my mother moves her head a little the funnel slips off the edge and the water runs all over the floor.</li>
            <li> Amazing and very helpful for my mother! At first I was hesitant to order this product but once I used it I was truly impressed.</li>
            <li> i liked it very much&lt;br /&gt;ty&lt;br /&gt;i use it for my son&lt;br /&gt;i hope you keep selling them&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe how well it worked. i really love this product. i ordered for my mom because she can&#x27;t really bend to wash her hair and salons take too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really love it!</li>
            <li> This product works great but is for a very small head!</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> In theory, this should work.  But it doesn&#x27;t.  And we tried - numerous times!  Not only is it uncomfortable, it leaks horribly around the hairline no matter how tight it is.  Just a bad idea all around.</li>
            <li> elastic is too tight around the head. would give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my elderly mother who has home health come in to bath and wash her hair.  My mother said it worked very well and the nurse said she was going to recommend it to many of her patients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this once before in a retail store but had to replace it online due to it no longer being available in stores. It shipped quickly and was exactly what it was supposed to be. The product itself is a godsend, I do my handicapped aunts hair twice a week and she is wheelchair bound. Great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> This is an awful design and to small for most peoples heads. It also hurt the clients head when trying to put it on Once it was on it would flip off and pull the persons hair. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for - it&#x27;s a shame the designer didn&#x27;t put a little more thought into it because the use of elastic (instead of Velcro) and using a lighter weight of vinyl would have resulted in an excellent product.</li>
            <li> We have had one of these for two years and decided to get another one. Problem is something is different. The front and sides do not come up as high making water splash out. The binding around the head does not fit as snug so the water leaks. Washing with this one is a disaster! Soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> At first glance it looked like the perfect product for my needs, but when I used it I realized that this does not work well for thick long hair. I used it one time and I won&#x27;t use it again. It may work, however, for someone elses hair type and/or length, just not for me.</li>
