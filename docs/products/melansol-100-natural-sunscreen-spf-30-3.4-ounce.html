    <ol>
            <li>But, it worked great! -</li>
            <li>It worked as promised to prevent the kids from burning and it smelled wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is the very best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin that never tans.</li>
            <li>, this sunscreen seems like a good choice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my face, under makeup, and been happy with the protection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t that great, but once the sunscreen is on, I don&#x27;t even notice</li>
            <li>we didn&#x27;t burn and over all felt it great product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, the smell is not too pleasant.</li>
            <li>- 80 degrees and bright sunny days -</li>
            <li>/&gt;He is in the sun a LOT and has given the effectiveness of this product a good run</li>
            <li>This is a really good sun block.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seventh, the product felt good, felt soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always in search of a good sunscreen--</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has given me good protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It required a good shake, and hasn&#x27;t been an issue</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>, the product itself is good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, when I opened it up, the oil has already separated a bit and it needed a good shake.</li>
            <li>good things about the product...</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m always searching for the perfect sunscreen, I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen (you know, all beachy and pleasant) and it came out kind of runny.  </li>
            <li>MelanSol sunscreen is the absolute very best I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It comes out beige but spreads nicely on the skin with no color.  </li>
            <li>the kind of thing you want to wash off immediately.  </li>
            <li>We picked this up for winter vacation and it was nice sunscreen to have -</li>
            <li>Yes it is pricey, more in line with a cosmetic lotion - this is what you will pay for quality ingredients which are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Generally it has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it to anyone who intends to spend any time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Camp</li>
            <li>have very fair skin and can burn in Spring&#x27;s first walk around the yard.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin, that doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li>The odor is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality sun screen that works great, has a nice texture, and feels good on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Still it is the best natural sunscreen that i have tried.</li>
            <li>It is very important that I use sun screen when out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I am or was blond and had very light skin</li>
            <li>Still it has done a decemt job for me as I live in Phoenix and need to have a good sunblock as I have fair skin and tend to burn</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin and have never found a product that protects me from sunburn--10 minutes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel any sunscreen should be over $10 at the most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fifth, the product did not soak in but instead formed a visible barrier on top of the skin still visible</li>
            <li>(of course that tip probably works better for women).  </li>
            <li>I have tried many sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I tried shaking the tube and massaging it to mix it up better, but it did not help.  </li>
            <li>Then I squeezed it and more oil, no product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had the opportunity to test its ability as a sunblock but will return to add more about that in a month or so.  </li>
            <li>But if you keep searching, you&#x27;ll find better alternatives.</li>
            <li>so can re-apply more sunscreen through out playing 18 holes of golf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sits on top of your skin and never absorbes into your skin.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen blocks the sun and seems pretty water repellant (have not had a chance to give it a good test at the beach.)</li>
            <li>The coverage was very good, I went walking with the hubby and we both wore it (pasty white people that we are...) and enjoyed a stroll by the shoreline for a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>Of course in Shiseido&#x27;s case, you are buying a brand, but the most important thing should be the ingredients that your body absorbs over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great option for a natural sunscreen if the price isn&#x27;t out of your range.</li>
            <li>The lotion was comfortable to wear, it sunk into my skin and my fingers didn&#x27;t come away greasy after touching it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have a truly all natural sunscreen option and would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This has a nice fresh scent, not too strong, not floral.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a good natural sunscreen and this one is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t rub into the skin easily and can leave a whitish residue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, given the strong scent and the consistency issues, I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
            <li>That sure sounds like it is filled with natural products and is SPF 30 which should give one good sun protection.  </li>
            <li>ingredients but not scent free or hypoallergenic</li>
            <li>so sun screen is important.  </li>
            <li>but it covers well and is smooth and spreads well over your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for an all natural good sunblock.</li>
            <li>Seems to be good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Offers good sun</li>
            <li>It is not scent free and has a rather strong tea like fragrance that is a bit sweet.  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was for me.</li>
            <li>These burn survivors love being at camp where they can wear a bathing suit, maybe for the first time since they had their injury.  </li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>I used it on my face, mostly, and after 3 weeks, my face has a nice flush to it, but not the beet red</li>
            <li>price is a bit steep, in my opinion, but then most natural products cost more to make.  </li>
            <li>Unfortuanely, it has not gotten warm enough for me to test out the water-resistance, but I&#x27;m not overly hopeful, considering my guess is the oil is the water resistant part, and most of that seems to have separated out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent for anyone who is allergic or sensitive to regular sunscreen products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a variety of natural and organic (or mostly organic) brands on the market and I am trying most of them.</li>
            <li>Although I have but been able to test this product or on the full heat of the sun, I can already say that I don&#x27;t like it all that much.</li>
            <li>This may be a good sunscreen, but your skin stays white and sticky.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen smells good, but not like &#x27;regular&#x27; sunscreens -</li>
            <li>Ok, first I&#x27;d like to admit that at first try I was not over the moon with the product.  </li>
            <li>: Soaks in rather quickly</li>
            <li>I also wish the spf were higher than 30-- personally I do better with a higher level of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works!!  </li>
            <li>But, like the others, it quickly settled in and created a nice layer of protection without white streaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has worked great for my family, especially for one of my children that has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pretty smelling, white sunscreen you probably won&#x27;t want this one, but if you are very fair and want a sunscreen that is bare bones and means business this just may be the ticket.  </li>
            <li>just about everyday we go through a lot of sunscreen--cost and quality issues matter greatly.</li>
            <li>but this one is by far the most protective,  </li>
            <li>I love that this sunscreen is 100% natural</li>
            <li>So, this is not a white colored sunscreen, it is kind of beige, like an apricot skin scrub....</li>
            <li>Kind of the same feeling as you get when you buy a moisturizer that stays on through hand washings.  </li>
            <li>We both liked and I would definitely consider purchasing this when my tube is used up.</li>
            <li>appearance that so many natural products create.</li>
            <li>and I am generally pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I also liked that SPF 10 was recommended for daily wear without prolonged exposure.  </li>
            <li>As you can see in the product description, the ingredients are natural, although I&#x27;m sure some purists will find something to quibble about.</li>
            <li>this right before our trip to Playa del Carmen and Cancun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this in the hot African sun and it works effectively.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, and I am not going to throw it out, but I am nut sure that I would recommend it unless someone wanted something all natural that didn&#x27;t leave a white tint.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this sunscreen is that it is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and does not have a strong scent though the smell that is present isn&#x27;t particularly pleasing.</li>
            <li>Many other &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens I&#x27;ve looked at either don&#x27;t have good reviews or are not all natural.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li>and I react to a lot of the chemicals in most standard brands.  </li>
            <li>You have to shake it first--</li>
            <li>Most of them work well, but reading some of the articles about regular sunscreen and how it can cause cancer made me want to try MelanSol without the chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, the cost is rather prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>, when I first opened the tube, there was some separation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one drawback is the price--it&#x27;s pretty steep.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first, and perhaps largest, strike against it was when I opened the lid some out a pool of oil</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is important and the MeanSol which is 100% natural appealed to me.  </li>
            <li>When I first squeezed out a bit of this sunscreen, I noticed that it had separated in the tube.  </li>
            <li>The chemicals in most sunscreens have actually been proven to cause skin cancer.</li>
            <li>My goal is to find a 100% organic sunscreen that does exactly what it says on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are no weird ingredients, and it neither smells flowery nor medicinal.  </li>
            <li>Living in central Texas we get many sunny day and plenty hot day in the summer</li>
            <li>it is something you want to take care of in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>but honestly my first thought was paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sounds good because it includes:  antioxidants, bio-melanin, and green tea.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly sensitive to strong smells, so other people might not have this problem if they are ok with scents.  </li>
            <li>It goes on greasy, but I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that quality as it&#x27;s obvious where you&#x27;ve applied it, and it&#x27;s easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is terrible--I got a lot of pure oil on my hands before I got anything like a lotion to come out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the lotion is a different color than I expected and I first wondered if it was still good.</li>
            <li>different, but fine.  </li>
            <li>Will go straight to manufacturer from now</li>
            <li>It goes on clear when absorbed, so I do not have to worry about having a &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34; that you can get from mineral sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t smell much at all.  </li>
            <li>I really need a product that protects my skin from the sun--</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, given the selling price and my experiences, I can&#x27;t really recommend this sunscreen over some cheaper brands out there.</li>
            <li>This product really does the job.  </li>
            <li>They are both really great products, especially compared to other natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>for the sunscreen, it&#x27;s okay; 10% titanium dioxide is the active ingredient, so</li>
            <li>If you really want 100% natural, use a parasol. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spouse has skin that tans nicely, but she usually slathers sunscreen on exposed skin.</li>
            <li>in all, a decent product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li>Because it has high reflectivity, it prevents the harmful rays from penetrating the skin (in theory).</li>
            <li>Normally, when I don&#x27;t like a sunscreen for my face, I use it on my hands instead</li>
            <li>Although my SPF 25 &amp;#34;nearly&amp;#34; all organic Green People sunscreen does a better job at blocking the sun.</li>
            <li>Now, this block doesn&#x27;t rub in nicely - it leaves a slight white tint because of the nature of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Right now I currently only use it on my arms or legs</li>
            <li>the product should be reliably mixed and fully usable from top to bottom of tube.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: not pleasant, not offensive, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;Coverage:  like most of the really good sunscreens we use this went on with that odd, heavy, feeling.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews accurately describe the consistency, fragrance, and appearance of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try this new sunscreen.</li>
            <li>my first squeeze of the tube, only oil came out.  </li>
            <li>Though different than what I expected I expect this once will be a nice one to throw in our bag that we take to the local baseball games where our seats are in the sun.  </li>
            <li>the high price, and also the fact that it often comes out of the bottle not mixed particularly well.  </li>
            <li>really, it works pretty much like any other sunscreen using the same.</li>
            <li>husband doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t create any issues for him.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the natural ingredients, though, it seems to separate in the tube, as others have noted.  </li>
            <li>And in this case, natural beats brand image.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are a family of five who spends a considerable amount of time at the beach during the summer months.  </li>
            <li>However, natural is not hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li>It turned me off and may not appeal to others with a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it seemed like a fairly natural smell; it reminded me of being stuck inside a greenhouse or surrounded by drying herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>It does eventually disappear, which serves as a gentle reminder to apply sunscreen well before you&#x27;ll actually need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just remember to apply it 15 to 30 minutes before you go out into the sun, try to stay out of the sun during peak hours, and reapply frequently if you&#x27;re swimming.  </li>
            <li>My initial reaction was that it seemed really greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>when I read about this I was looking for a natural product.</li>
            <li>MelanSol has a pleasant scent, absorbs into the skin without much trouble, and is slightly tinted to help avoid a the white residue.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use this for my daily walk.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the scent was so strong that I had a headache after ten minutes, and I had to wash it off before I was able to actually test it outside to see if it prevented sunburn.  </li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii and use sunscreen on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It was still very greasy, and it has a really pungent odor, and after a few minutes, I had to wash it off my face.  </li>
            <li>It might be a bit more expensive, but you also do not need as much.</li>
            <li>Second, when I first opened the tube of sunscreen, the product that came out was extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li>There was a very clear liquid and a solid white cream that were not mixed together.  </li>
            <li>Due to the record level of snow days and cold temperatures I&#x27;ve experienced this spring</li>
            <li>Living in the Florida sun, a year round horse trainer and avid fisherman  </li>
            <li>said, we won&#x27;t be buying it in the future because the Blue Lizard products work just as well for us, have higher EWG scores and are substantially less money.  </li>

            <li> I have fair skin, that doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li> The odor is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality sun screen that works great, has a nice texture, and feels good on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Still it is the best natural sunscreen that i have tried.</li>
            <li> It is very important that I use sun screen when out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I am or was blond and had very light skin</li>
            <li> Still it has done a decemt job for me as I live in Phoenix and need to have a good sunblock as I have fair skin and tend to burn</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin and have never found a product that protects me from sunburn--10 minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any sunscreen should be over $10 at the most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fifth, the product did not soak in but instead formed a visible barrier on top of the skin still visible</li>
            <li> (of course that tip probably works better for women).  </li>
            <li> I have tried many sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I tried shaking the tube and massaging it to mix it up better, but it did not help.  </li>
            <li> Then I squeezed it and more oil, no product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had the opportunity to test its ability as a sunblock but will return to add more about that in a month or so.  </li>
            <li> But if you keep searching, you&#x27;ll find better alternatives.</li>
            <li> so can re-apply more sunscreen through out playing 18 holes of golf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sits on top of your skin and never absorbes into your skin.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen blocks the sun and seems pretty water repellant (have not had a chance to give it a good test at the beach.)</li>
            <li> The coverage was very good, I went walking with the hubby and we both wore it (pasty white people that we are...) and enjoyed a stroll by the shoreline for a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> Of course in Shiseido&#x27;s case, you are buying a brand, but the most important thing should be the ingredients that your body absorbs over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great option for a natural sunscreen if the price isn&#x27;t out of your range.</li>
            <li> The lotion was comfortable to wear, it sunk into my skin and my fingers didn&#x27;t come away greasy after touching it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have a truly all natural sunscreen option and would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This has a nice fresh scent, not too strong, not floral.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good natural sunscreen and this one is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t rub into the skin easily and can leave a whitish residue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, given the strong scent and the consistency issues, I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
            <li> That sure sounds like it is filled with natural products and is SPF 30 which should give one good sun protection.  </li>
            <li> ingredients but not scent free or hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> so sun screen is important.  </li>
            <li> but it covers well and is smooth and spreads well over your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for an all natural good sunblock.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Offers good sun</li>
            <li> It is not scent free and has a rather strong tea like fragrance that is a bit sweet.  </li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was for me.</li>
            <li> These burn survivors love being at camp where they can wear a bathing suit, maybe for the first time since they had their injury.  </li>
            <li> I was excited</li>
            <li> I used it on my face, mostly, and after 3 weeks, my face has a nice flush to it, but not the beet red</li>
            <li> price is a bit steep, in my opinion, but then most natural products cost more to make.  </li>
            <li> Unfortuanely, it has not gotten warm enough for me to test out the water-resistance, but I&#x27;m not overly hopeful, considering my guess is the oil is the water resistant part, and most of that seems to have separated out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent for anyone who is allergic or sensitive to regular sunscreen products!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a variety of natural and organic (or mostly organic) brands on the market and I am trying most of them.</li>
            <li> Although I have but been able to test this product or on the full heat of the sun, I can already say that I don&#x27;t like it all that much.</li>
            <li> This may be a good sunscreen, but your skin stays white and sticky.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen smells good, but not like &#x27;regular&#x27; sunscreens -</li>
            <li> Ok, first I&#x27;d like to admit that at first try I was not over the moon with the product.  </li>
            <li> : Soaks in rather quickly</li>
            <li> I also wish the spf were higher than 30-- personally I do better with a higher level of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works!!  </li>
            <li> But, like the others, it quickly settled in and created a nice layer of protection without white streaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has worked great for my family, especially for one of my children that has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a pretty smelling, white sunscreen you probably won&#x27;t want this one, but if you are very fair and want a sunscreen that is bare bones and means business this just may be the ticket.  </li>
            <li> just about everyday we go through a lot of sunscreen--cost and quality issues matter greatly.</li>
            <li> but this one is by far the most protective,  </li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen is 100% natural</li>
            <li> So, this is not a white colored sunscreen, it is kind of beige, like an apricot skin scrub....</li>
            <li> Kind of the same feeling as you get when you buy a moisturizer that stays on through hand washings.  </li>
            <li> We both liked and I would definitely consider purchasing this when my tube is used up.</li>
            <li> appearance that so many natural products create.</li>
            <li> and I am generally pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I also liked that SPF 10 was recommended for daily wear without prolonged exposure.  </li>
            <li> As you can see in the product description, the ingredients are natural, although I&#x27;m sure some purists will find something to quibble about.</li>
            <li> this right before our trip to Playa del Carmen and Cancun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this in the hot African sun and it works effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, and I am not going to throw it out, but I am nut sure that I would recommend it unless someone wanted something all natural that didn&#x27;t leave a white tint.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this sunscreen is that it is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and does not have a strong scent though the smell that is present isn&#x27;t particularly pleasing.</li>
            <li> Many other &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens I&#x27;ve looked at either don&#x27;t have good reviews or are not all natural.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> and I react to a lot of the chemicals in most standard brands.  </li>
            <li> You have to shake it first--</li>
            <li> Most of them work well, but reading some of the articles about regular sunscreen and how it can cause cancer made me want to try MelanSol without the chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the cost is rather prohibitive.  </li>
            <li> , when I first opened the tube, there was some separation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one drawback is the price--it&#x27;s pretty steep.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first, and perhaps largest, strike against it was when I opened the lid some out a pool of oil</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is important and the MeanSol which is 100% natural appealed to me.  </li>
            <li> When I first squeezed out a bit of this sunscreen, I noticed that it had separated in the tube.  </li>
            <li> The chemicals in most sunscreens have actually been proven to cause skin cancer.</li>
            <li> My goal is to find a 100% organic sunscreen that does exactly what it says on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are no weird ingredients, and it neither smells flowery nor medicinal.  </li>
            <li> Living in central Texas we get many sunny day and plenty hot day in the summer</li>
            <li> it is something you want to take care of in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> but honestly my first thought was paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sounds good because it includes:  antioxidants, bio-melanin, and green tea.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly sensitive to strong smells, so other people might not have this problem if they are ok with scents.  </li>
            <li> It goes on greasy, but I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that quality as it&#x27;s obvious where you&#x27;ve applied it, and it&#x27;s easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is terrible--I got a lot of pure oil on my hands before I got anything like a lotion to come out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the lotion is a different color than I expected and I first wondered if it was still good.</li>
            <li> different, but fine.  </li>
            <li> Will go straight to manufacturer from now</li>
            <li> It goes on clear when absorbed, so I do not have to worry about having a &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34; that you can get from mineral sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t smell much at all.  </li>
            <li> I really need a product that protects my skin from the sun--</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, given the selling price and my experiences, I can&#x27;t really recommend this sunscreen over some cheaper brands out there.</li>
            <li> This product really does the job.  </li>
            <li> They are both really great products, especially compared to other natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> for the sunscreen, it&#x27;s okay; 10% titanium dioxide is the active ingredient, so</li>
            <li> If you really want 100% natural, use a parasol. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spouse has skin that tans nicely, but she usually slathers sunscreen on exposed skin.</li>
            <li> in all, a decent product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li> Because it has high reflectivity, it prevents the harmful rays from penetrating the skin (in theory).</li>
            <li> Normally, when I don&#x27;t like a sunscreen for my face, I use it on my hands instead</li>
            <li> Although my SPF 25 &amp;#34;nearly&amp;#34; all organic Green People sunscreen does a better job at blocking the sun.</li>
            <li> Now, this block doesn&#x27;t rub in nicely - it leaves a slight white tint because of the nature of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Right now I currently only use it on my arms or legs</li>
            <li> the product should be reliably mixed and fully usable from top to bottom of tube.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: not pleasant, not offensive, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;Coverage:  like most of the really good sunscreens we use this went on with that odd, heavy, feeling.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews accurately describe the consistency, fragrance, and appearance of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try this new sunscreen.</li>
            <li> my first squeeze of the tube, only oil came out.  </li>
            <li> Though different than what I expected I expect this once will be a nice one to throw in our bag that we take to the local baseball games where our seats are in the sun.  </li>
            <li> the high price, and also the fact that it often comes out of the bottle not mixed particularly well.  </li>
            <li> really, it works pretty much like any other sunscreen using the same.</li>
            <li> husband doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t create any issues for him.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the natural ingredients, though, it seems to separate in the tube, as others have noted.  </li>
            <li> And in this case, natural beats brand image.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are a family of five who spends a considerable amount of time at the beach during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> However, natural is not hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li> It turned me off and may not appeal to others with a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it seemed like a fairly natural smell; it reminded me of being stuck inside a greenhouse or surrounded by drying herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> It does eventually disappear, which serves as a gentle reminder to apply sunscreen well before you&#x27;ll actually need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just remember to apply it 15 to 30 minutes before you go out into the sun, try to stay out of the sun during peak hours, and reapply frequently if you&#x27;re swimming.  </li>
            <li> My initial reaction was that it seemed really greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> when I read about this I was looking for a natural product.</li>
            <li> MelanSol has a pleasant scent, absorbs into the skin without much trouble, and is slightly tinted to help avoid a the white residue.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use this for my daily walk.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scent was so strong that I had a headache after ten minutes, and I had to wash it off before I was able to actually test it outside to see if it prevented sunburn.  </li>
            <li> We live in Hawaii and use sunscreen on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It was still very greasy, and it has a really pungent odor, and after a few minutes, I had to wash it off my face.  </li>
            <li> It might be a bit more expensive, but you also do not need as much.</li>
            <li> Second, when I first opened the tube of sunscreen, the product that came out was extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> There was a very clear liquid and a solid white cream that were not mixed together.  </li>
            <li> Due to the record level of snow days and cold temperatures I&#x27;ve experienced this spring</li>
            <li> Living in the Florida sun, a year round horse trainer and avid fisherman  </li>
            <li> said, we won&#x27;t be buying it in the future because the Blue Lizard products work just as well for us, have higher EWG scores and are substantially less money.  </li>
            <li> The MelanSol is a thick, golden goo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, my sensitive, rash prone skin did not react to it nor did I experience any other allergy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick, and smoothes on pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but generally I prefer to use my other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While at first I thought that it would be a little greasy, that feeling passes within a few seconds after application.</li>
            <li> while MelanSol is 3.4 oz with no chemicals that the Shiseido one might have (Shiseido sunscreen is not natural).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I like that this product is recommended both for long term wear, and lets you know you should apply it after 40 min if on/in the water.  </li>
            <li> I walked around with a grey, tan, greasy product on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have pale, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> came in with an open mind, kneaded the tube a little (which mixed the ingredients together</li>
            <li> The active ingredient, TiO2, is a pigment for white paint.</li>
            <li> While I was hopeful at the option of a mostly natural, water-resistant sunscreen, I&#x27;m not sure this is</li>
            <li> It sinks in and the white disappears and gives me a nice base for makeup.  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that it would be slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat of a grayish color and looked a little gritty - although it didn&#x27;t feel it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seems to me that it should last a little longer than that.</li>
            <li> It is about 4 times more expensive than the sunscreens I usually buy, but a little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it the next day and did a few things...</li>
            <li> I not only burn after a few minutes in the sun, I often get an itchy rash (not because of sunscreens- the rash occurs when I don&#x27;t wear any sunscreen).</li>
            <li> As others have noted the components can seem separated, requiring you to apply carefully.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a little bit of a white sheen when rubbing it into the skin, like other mineral-based sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> At least I am guessing it is due to the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the strange consistency, I decided to try just a little bit of the sunscreen on my hands, as a test before putting it on my face or arms.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> At the least I&#x27;d like to be refunded the extra money paid for the product I didn&#x27;t receive.</li>
            <li> Generally, I hate most sunscreens because they seep into the corners of my eyes and burn, burn, burn.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a design flaw, by the bottle being stored upside down, all the oil that separates from the lotion comes out of the tube before any lotion does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a slight smell but the smell goes away after application, and I can trust that it water resistant for up to 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Walking in the sun without protection results in burns within about half hour at midday, so sunscreen is a must.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a little on the expensive side for the amount that is in this tube but most sunscreens you see in the store are all fairly expensive.  </li>
            <li> When you apply the cream, it adds a little color and an odd shimmer to your skin.  </li>
            <li> , it is not very strong and dissipates after a few minutes of applying.</li>
            <li> However, the sample I received was such poor quality, I am wondering if perhaps it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li> I have been unable to completely test this sunscreen that I selected in February</li>
            <li> maybe the green tea scent?  </li>
            <li> It is a medium consistency and didn&#x27;t feel overly greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it might be the green tea (which is not a smell I like)</li>
            <li> The funky color (again, I&#x27;m thinking the green tea...) is a turn-off, but, as I mentioned, does seem to dissipate after applying.</li>
            <li> In my experience, natural sunscreens are difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> On me, both the whitish and greasy look went away in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I could have gone hours with my Green People.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not cause any breakouts on my face, which is a common problem I experience with other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, there is no strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear it every day--the trick is not to use too much (a really small amount) for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> I usually experience.</li>
            <li> The texture and consistency of the MelanSol was a bit hard for me to get used to; I&#x27;ve law au wound up with cream or lotion sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint what it smells like</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too late to return them.</li>
            <li> We always wait at least 15 minutes to let it soak in before we get in the water.</li>
            <li> sunscreen is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> And, while this product is not perfect, it is doesn&#x27;t cause the sensitivity issues that other products I&#x27;ve tried (Neutrogena, Coppertone, Aveeno, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are children that have suffered serious burn injuries.  </li>
            <li> It smelled a little weird...</li>
            <li> Even after sitting in the sun during a two hour lacrosse game, my skin was protected.  </li>
            <li> that is water resistant for up to 40 min and is comes out like a thin lotion.  </li>
            <li> It has the look of thin clay as you squeeze it out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> However, it felt weird as I applied it and the smell is not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> While this product is natural, it is awful.</li>
            <li> We would go through a tube of MelanSol in a matter of days, making it quite an expensive option.  </li>
            <li> Absurd, considering we lather it on our bodies in an attempt not to get skin cancer and to not sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but so&#x27;s a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> The smell is sort of on the unpleasant side of neutral…not really bad, but not particularly pleasant either…sort of an herbal, medicinal smell.  </li>
            <li> Without irritating my skin!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to get these kids out of the water.  </li>
            <li> Non-organic sunscreen is bad for you.</li>
            <li> sunscreen is an ugly grayish-brown color, but once you put it on, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing it.  </li>
            <li> but I hate the &amp;#34;ghost white&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But honestly, I hate everything else about this.  </li>
            <li> others have noted, the product had separated in the tube and it was impossible to fully integrate the oil into the base product.&lt;br /&gt;For $30 a tube (almost $9/ounce!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> MelanSol sunscreen is the absolute very best I have tried.  Living in the Florida sun, a year round horse trainer and avid fisherman  I have tried LOTS of brands over the years but this one is by far the most protective,  I use the 20 and the 30 as well as the Moisturizer and have the SunBurn Relief but haven&#x27;t had to use yet, but I keep it on hand for those  who don&#x27;t use MelanSol after a log day on the boat or horse shows!  I highly recommend their products.</li>
            <li> However, ordered SPF 30 and received the 20. And yes, it makes a difference with this product. Will go straight to manufacturer from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BRAND is 5 stars all the way. Buy elsewhere!</li>
            <li> This may be a good sunscreen, but your skin stays white and sticky.  The whiteness fades after a while, but the stickiness does not go away.</li>
            <li> I ordered the SPF 30, and paid the exta .50 per bottle (2 bottles) and both of the bottles that were received were SPF 20. My vacation starts this weekend and it&#x27;s too late to return them. At the least I&#x27;d like to be refunded the extra money paid for the product I didn&#x27;t receive. Otherwise I won&#x27;t likely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This has a nice fresh scent, not too strong, not floral.  It comes out beige but spreads nicely on the skin with no color.  It&#x27;s not greasy. I would say it works even though I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the sun.  I mainly use this for my daily walk.  It does not break out my face.  I like it but I think it&#x27;s over priced.  I don&#x27;t feel any sunscreen should be over $10 at the most.</li>
            <li> Got a tube of this right before our trip to Playa del Carmen and Cancun. I have fair skin, that doesn&#x27;t tan easily. Spouse has skin that tans nicely, but she usually slathers sunscreen on exposed skin. Other reviews accurately describe the consistency, fragrance, and appearance of this sunscreen. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was for me. The active ingredient, TiO2, is a pigment for white paint. Because it has high reflectivity, it prevents the harmful rays from penetrating the skin (in theory). Well, it works! I used it on my face, mostly, and after 3 weeks, my face has a nice flush to it, but not the beet red I usually experience. And, I am experiencing NO peeling or blistering. Generally, I hate most sunscreens because they seep into the corners of my eyes and burn, burn, burn. Not so with MelanSol. My wife likes it too, but mentioned it does take a while for it to absorb. It is about 4 times more expensive than the sunscreens I usually buy, but a little of this goes a long way. We still have plenty left for the summer. I will definitely purchase more of this product.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m always searching for the perfect sunscreen, I was excited to try this product.  However, the sample I received was such poor quality, I am wondering if perhaps it&#x27;s gone bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first squeeze of the tube, only oil came out.  I shook the tube and rolledit between my hands, and that helped to improve the consistency.  The cream is a shiny beige color, which I did not expect.  When you apply the cream, it adds a little color and an odd shimmer to your skin.  It was still very greasy, and it has a really pungent odor, and after a few minutes, I had to wash it off my face.  Normally, when I don&#x27;t like a sunscreen for my face, I use it on my hands instead but this product is just too greasy and smelly for even that.</li>
            <li> My husband was the guinea pig for this product.&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the product had separated in the tube and it was impossible to fully integrate the oil into the base product.&lt;br /&gt;For $30 a tube (almost $9/ounce!) the product should be reliably mixed and fully usable from top to bottom of tube.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: not pleasant, not offensive, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;Coverage:  like most of the really good sunscreens we use this went on with that odd, heavy, feeling.  But, like the others, it quickly settled in and created a nice layer of protection without white streaks.&lt;br /&gt;My husband doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t create any issues for him.&lt;br /&gt;He is in the sun a LOT and has given the effectiveness of this product a good run and it works terrific.&lt;br /&gt;That said, we won&#x27;t be buying it in the future because the Blue Lizard products work just as well for us, have higher EWG scores and are substantially less money.  Since one or both of us are outside just about everyday we go through a lot of sunscreen--cost and quality issues matter greatly.</li>
            <li> This is a really good sun block. I have been trying to find a good natural sunscreen and this one is pretty good.  With the natural ingredients, though, it seems to separate in the tube, as others have noted.  At least I am guessing it is due to the natural ingredients.  Still it has done a decemt job for me as I live in Phoenix and need to have a good sunblock as I have fair skin and tend to burn easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit steep, in my opinion, but then most natural products cost more to make.  Still it is the best natural sunscreen that i have tried.</li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen is 100% natural so I do not have to worry about chemical reactions on my skin. It goes on clear when absorbed, so I do not have to worry about having a &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34; that you can get from mineral sunscreen. The price is on the steep side but its comparable to the &amp;#34;higher tier&amp;#34; sunscreens. For example Shiseido suncreen is about $35 for 2.1 oz  while MelanSol is 3.4 oz with no chemicals that the Shiseido one might have (Shiseido sunscreen is not natural). Of course in Shiseido&#x27;s case, you are buying a brand, but the most important thing should be the ingredients that your body absorbs over time. And in this case, natural beats brand image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight smell but the smell goes away after application, and I can trust that it water resistant for up to 40 minutes.  My only wish is that it would be slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> Due to the record level of snow days and cold temperatures I&#x27;ve experienced this spring (Global Warming my substantial rear end!) I have been unable to completely test this sunscreen that I selected in February (Yeah, that was well thought out!), but I will give you what I&#x27;ve got and promise to finish my testing and update this review when summer comes,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF summer ever comes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the foil seal came off inside the plastic cap, which is probably not how it is supposed to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, unlike some reviewers, my product hadn&#x27;t separated inside the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, there is no strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, my sensitive, rash prone skin did not react to it nor did I experience any other allergy symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, the product did not soak in but instead formed a visible barrier on top of the skin still visible 40 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixth, the product did not rinse off when splashed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventh, the product felt good, felt soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if the product will only protect against sunburn!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly WHITE skin and burn in moments of being in the sun. I have been looking for an all natural good sunblock. This works! I was out in the sun for 3 hours today and don&#x27;t have any evidence of it. Now, this block doesn&#x27;t rub in nicely - it leaves a slight white tint because of the nature of the ingredients. But, it worked great! - Without irritating my skin!! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This has worked great for my family, especially for one of my children that has very sensitive skin.  We always wait at least 15 minutes to let it soak in before we get in the water.</li>
            <li> Ok, first I&#x27;d like to admit that at first try I was not over the moon with the product.  It didn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen (you know, all beachy and pleasant) and it came out kind of runny.  It smelled a little weird...maybe the green tea scent?  Then I tried it the next day and did a few things...came in with an open mind, kneaded the tube a little (which mixed the ingredients together and I found, it wasn&#x27;t runny, it had settled).  So, this is not a white colored sunscreen, it is kind of beige, like an apricot skin scrub....different, but fine.  The smell of it didn&#x27;t linger and once put on just didn&#x27;t smell much at all.  The coverage was very good, I went walking with the hubby and we both wore it (pasty white people that we are...) and enjoyed a stroll by the shoreline for a couple hours.  No burning and after washing hands the sunscreen that I had put on the backs of mine seemed to stay on.  Kind of the same feeling as you get when you buy a moisturizer that stays on through hand washings.  It is a medium consistency and didn&#x27;t feel overly greasy or heavy.  Though different than what I expected I expect this once will be a nice one to throw in our bag that we take to the local baseball games where our seats are in the sun.  If you are looking for a pretty smelling, white sunscreen you probably won&#x27;t want this one, but if you are very fair and want a sunscreen that is bare bones and means business this just may be the ticket.  We both liked and I would definitely consider purchasing this when my tube is used up.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of a good sunscreen-- I have pale, sensitive skin and I react to a lot of the chemicals in most standard brands.  I not only burn after a few minutes in the sun, I often get an itchy rash (not because of sunscreens- the rash occurs when I don&#x27;t wear any sunscreen). I really need a product that protects my skin from the sun-- but I hate the &amp;#34;ghost white&amp;#34; appearance that so many natural products create. So I hold out hope when I hear of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product that might finally work for me.  And, while this product is not perfect, it is doesn&#x27;t cause the sensitivity issues that other products I&#x27;ve tried (Neutrogena, Coppertone, Aveeno, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: Soaks in rather quickly so initial greasy feel goes away.  Funky color (whitish/gray) also soaks in and disappears.  And I just use some face powder over it which brings back some color and decreases the shine (of course that tip probably works better for women).  Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, itching, etc.  Seems to be good for sensitive skin. Offers good sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not-so-good:  You have to shake it first-- and even then you get oily residue out of the tube. Funky smell-- I&#x27;m thinking it might be the green tea (which is not a smell I like) but something makes it smell like musty pine. The funky color (again, I&#x27;m thinking the green tea...) is a turn-off, but, as I mentioned, does seem to dissipate after applying. I also wish the spf were higher than 30-- personally I do better with a higher level of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using it and I am generally pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen that does not contain chemicals. We live in Hawaii and use sunscreen on a daily basis. I have tried many sunscreens. Most of them work well, but reading some of the articles about regular sunscreen and how it can cause cancer made me want to try MelanSol without the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is thick and creamy. It absorbs fast and does not leave an oily residue. I like the scent, it is not very strong and dissipates after a few minutes of applying. The sunscreen protects just as described. Went snorkeling for about an hour and did not burn. It might be a bit more expensive, but you also do not need as much.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen blocks the sun and seems pretty water repellant (have not had a chance to give it a good test at the beach.) However, it felt weird as I applied it and the smell is not pleasant at all. There was also quite a bit of separation, even after I tried to mix it up before using it. It&#x27;s okay, and I am not going to throw it out, but I am nut sure that I would recommend it unless someone wanted something all natural that didn&#x27;t leave a white tint. It does stand out in that area.</li>
            <li> I have the MelanSol Sunscreen as well as the MelanSol Baby formula.  They are both really great products, especially compared to other natural sunscreens.  In my experience, natural sunscreens are difficult to apply.  They don&#x27;t rub into the skin easily and can leave a whitish residue.  MelanSol has a pleasant scent, absorbs into the skin without much trouble, and is slightly tinted to help avoid a the white residue.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face, under makeup, and been happy with the protection.  Even after sitting in the sun during a two hour lacrosse game, my skin was protected.  It did not cause any breakouts on my face, which is a common problem I experience with other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things to consider with this sunscreen.  First, the cost is rather prohibitive.  We are a family of five who spends a considerable amount of time at the beach during the summer months.  We would go through a tube of MelanSol in a matter of days, making it quite an expensive option.  Second, when I first opened the tube of sunscreen, the product that came out was extremely greasy.  I tried shaking the tube and massaging it to mix it up better, but it did not help.  I had to squeeze out and discard about a quarter-sized blob of the product before usable, non-greasy sunscreen came out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great option for a natural sunscreen if the price isn&#x27;t out of your range.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! This sunscreen has given me good protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, when I first opened the tube, there was some separation.  It required a good shake, and hasn&#x27;t been an issue since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is an ugly grayish-brown color, but once you put it on, you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing it.  No whiteness, color, or visible residue.  I like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too thick, and smoothes on pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t that great, but once the sunscreen is on, I don&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is the price--it&#x27;s pretty steep.  Other than that, this sunscreen seems like a good choice!</li>
            <li> While I was hopeful at the option of a mostly natural, water-resistant sunscreen, I&#x27;m not sure this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first, and perhaps largest, strike against it was when I opened the lid some out a pool of oil ran out. Then I squeezed it and more oil, no product. Eventually, after some coaxing, actual sunscreen decided to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sunscreen, it&#x27;s okay; 10% titanium dioxide is the active ingredient, so really, it works pretty much like any other sunscreen using the same. Unfortuanely, it has not gotten warm enough for me to test out the water-resistance, but I&#x27;m not overly hopeful, considering my guess is the oil is the water resistant part, and most of that seems to have separated out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, given the selling price and my experiences, I can&#x27;t really recommend this sunscreen over some cheaper brands out there.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this sunscreen is that it is 100% natural.  That&#x27;s a big deal to me, so I will use it on my kids just for that.  But honestly, I hate everything else about this.  The smell is disgusting--just like bug repellant.  The consistency is terrible--I got a lot of pure oil on my hands before I got anything like a lotion to come out of the tube.  It separates horribly.  I did try shaking it, but I don&#x27;t think it helped.  Once on, it feels gross--sticky and oily--the kind of thing you want to wash off immediately.  It must have a lot of zinc oxide in it because it made me look even paler, almost vampiric, since it was so white going on.  I would be embarrassed to be seen in public with this stuff smeared all over my face and body.  I won&#x27;t be using this one on myself; just the kids, and I won&#x27;t be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is important and the MeanSol which is 100% natural appealed to me.  It sounds good because it includes:  antioxidants, bio-melanin, and green tea.  However, natural is not hypoallergenic.  It is not scent free and has a rather strong tea like fragrance that is a bit sweet.  It turned me off and may not appeal to others with a sensitive nose.  I like that that is water resistant for up to 40 min and is comes out like a thin lotion.  But it also leaves a sticky, chalky texture on your skin and since it contains titanium dioxide it gives you a pale/pasty color which people may not like on their face. Right now I currently only use it on my arms or legs but generally I prefer to use my other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients but not scent free or hypoallergenic and it also comes out with tacky texture that makes your skin whiter.</li>
            <li> Excellent for anyone who is allergic or sensitive to regular sunscreen products! It was a godsend for me. It has a nice smell too!</li>
            <li> We picked this up for winter vacation and it was nice sunscreen to have - we didn&#x27;t burn and over all felt it great product.</li>
            <li> When I first squeezed out a bit of this sunscreen, I noticed that it had separated in the tube.  There was a very clear liquid and a solid white cream that were not mixed together.  I tried shaking the tube vigorously, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the strange consistency, I decided to try just a little bit of the sunscreen on my hands, as a test before putting it on my face or arms.  Unfortunately, the scent was so strong that I had a headache after ten minutes, and I had to wash it off before I was able to actually test it outside to see if it prevented sunburn.  I am fairly sensitive to strong smells, so other people might not have this problem if they are ok with scents.  I will say that it seemed like a fairly natural smell; it reminded me of being stuck inside a greenhouse or surrounded by drying herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, given the strong scent and the consistency issues, I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
            <li> I work for a fire department and I am the regional coordinator for a children&#x27;s burn camp.  These are children that have suffered serious burn injuries.  These burn survivors love being at camp where they can wear a bathing suit, maybe for the first time since they had their injury.  It&#x27;s impossible to get these kids out of the water.  I was concerned about them being in the sun for prolong periods of time at camp until I found this product line.  The MelanSol was the answer to a prayer for our camp.  It worked as promised to prevent the kids from burning and it smelled wonderful.  This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it to anyone who intends to spend any time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Camp Queen Irene (as the kids call me)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a long time.  Many other &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreens I&#x27;ve looked at either don&#x27;t have good reviews or are not all natural.  This sunscreen smells good, but not like &#x27;regular&#x27; sunscreens - you won&#x27;t get that Coppertone smell!  The odor is light and pleasant.  When you squeeze the lotion out it looks a bit beige, when you apply it to your face it looks whitish and greasy. On me, both the whitish and greasy look went away in a few minutes.  The lotion was comfortable to wear, it sunk into my skin and my fingers didn&#x27;t come away greasy after touching it.  I like that this product is recommended both for long term wear, and lets you know you should apply it after 40 min if on/in the water.  I also liked that SPF 10 was recommended for daily wear without prolonged exposure.  Yes it is pricey, more in line with a cosmetic lotion - this is what you will pay for quality ingredients which are good for your skin.  I&#x27;m happy to have a truly all natural sunscreen option and would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen had separated by the time I received it.  I shook it well to try and reincorporate everything.  It has the look of thin clay as you squeeze it out of the tube.  The smell is sort of on the unpleasant side of neutral…not really bad, but not particularly pleasant either…sort of an herbal, medicinal smell.  It leaves a little bit of a white sheen when rubbing it into the skin, like other mineral-based sunscreens.  I&#x27;ve not had the opportunity to test its ability as a sunblock but will return to add more about that in a month or so.  In the meantime, based on everything else, I would not be likely to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Non-organic sunscreen is bad for you. Let&#x27;s face it. The chemicals in most sunscreens have actually been proven to cause skin cancer. Absurd, considering we lather it on our bodies in an attempt not to get skin cancer and to not sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a variety of natural and organic (or mostly organic) brands on the market and I am trying most of them. My goal is to find a 100% organic sunscreen that does exactly what it says on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with MelanSol I have come close. All of the ingredients are natural. Although it still contains some suspect ingredients like aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally it has a nice feel to it. Although it takes some effort to get it out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the sunscreen ability of it, it does alright. Although my SPF 25 &amp;#34;nearly&amp;#34; all organic Green People sunscreen does a better job at blocking the sun. Just one hour in the March Florida sun was enough with this supposed 30 SPF and I was cooked. Not burned, but close. I could have gone hours with my Green People.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a decent product. But if you keep searching, you&#x27;ll find better alternatives.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality sun screen that works great, has a nice texture, and feels good on your skin.  My only complaints....the high price, and also the fact that it often comes out of the bottle not mixed particularly well.  As others have noted the components can seem separated, requiring you to apply carefully.  Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> As you can see in the product description, the ingredients are natural, although I&#x27;m sure some purists will find something to quibble about. If you really want 100% natural, use a parasol. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this in the hot African sun and it works effectively.</li>
            <li> The texture and consistency of the MelanSol was a bit hard for me to get used to; I&#x27;ve law au wound up with cream or lotion sunscreens.  The MelanSol is a thick, golden goo.  It goes on greasy, but I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that quality as it&#x27;s obvious where you&#x27;ve applied it, and it&#x27;s easy to spread.  It does eventually disappear, which serves as a gentle reminder to apply sunscreen well before you&#x27;ll actually need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and can burn in Spring&#x27;s first walk around the yard.  I&#x27;m the MelanSol&#x27;s target consumer.  It works, and it works well.  There are no weird ingredients, and it neither smells flowery nor medicinal.  It&#x27;s expensive, but so&#x27;s a dermatologist.  Just remember to apply it 15 to 30 minutes before you go out into the sun, try to stay out of the sun during peak hours, and reapply frequently if you&#x27;re swimming.  It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> It is very important that I use sun screen when out in the sun.  Living in central Texas we get many sunny day and plenty hot day in the summer so sun screen is important.  This sunscreen was quite different from others I have used it says it is all natural with antioxidents, Natural Vitamin E, Bio-Melanin and green tea.  That sure sounds like it is filled with natural products and is SPF 30 which should give one good sun protection.  It also states it is water resistant so if you have humid weather you can wear this sun screen and not worry about getting sun burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say it has a different aroma almost metallic so no flowery odor but it covers well and is smooth and spreads well over your skin.  I am or was blond and had very light skin so I need to protect it whenever I am working in my yard or playing golf.  I always keep a tube of sunscreen in my golf cart so can re-apply more sunscreen through out playing 18 holes of golf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little on the expensive side for the amount that is in this tube but most sunscreens you see in the store are all fairly expensive.  Get what works for your skin it is something you want to take care of in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> Finally had a chance to try this now that the sun has started shining.  My initial reaction was that it seemed really greasy.  It seems to be a design flaw, by the bottle being stored upside down, all the oil that separates from the lotion comes out of the tube before any lotion does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once you get the lotion applied to your skin, it is not greasy at all.  I applied to my face and my arms, as those were the only exposed areas.  I was in and out of the sun, and driving, for 5 hours today.  I never felt greasy once, I did not burn at all, and I did not notice any smell whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the product itself is good.  The packaging design could use some work.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin that never tans. Walking in the sun without protection results in burns within about half hour at midday, so sunscreen is a must. I&#x27;m in Tampa this week - 80 degrees and bright sunny days - so I thought I&#x27;d try this new sunscreen. It worked well and protected my skin. No burns or redness. Out of the container, the screen is a tan ointment-like gel. It goes on easily and does not have a strong scent though the smell that is present isn&#x27;t particularly pleasing. While at first I thought that it would be a little greasy, that feeling passes within a few seconds after application. There is no obvious indication that you have applied sunscreen - that is, you can&#x27;t see the product once it has been applied and rubbed into your skin. It doesn&#x27;t appear to stain fabrics or transfer to clothing in any way.</li>
            <li> Although I have but been able to test this product or on the full heat of the sun, I can already say that I don&#x27;t like it all that much. (I will test it in the sun when I get the chance and definitely edit this review if my opinion changes.) Here are my reasons for disliking the MelanSol sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, when I opened it up, the oil has already separated a bit and it needed a good shake. (Not to big of a deal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the lotion is a different color than I expected and I first wondered if it was still good. It is somewhat of a grayish color and looked a little gritty - although it didn&#x27;t feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I checked the expiration date and it expires in May of this year. I only ordered this sunscreen in the middle of February abs it seems to me that it should last a little longer than that. I was hoping to use it through the summer but it didn&#x27;t look like that will be happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the smell is not too pleasant. It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint what it smells like but honestly my first thought was paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some good things about the product... it did not leave me with a greasy feeling on my skin and it did not seem to come off with water.</li>
            <li> This is the very best sunscreen I have ever used.  I have very fair and sensitive skin and have never found a product that protects me from sunburn--10 minutes and I&#x27;m red.  This product really does the job.  I wear it every day--the trick is not to use too much (a really small amount) for everyday wear.  It sinks in and the white disappears and gives me a nice base for makeup.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  It really works!!  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read about this I was looking for a natural product. While this product is natural, it is awful. It sits on top of your skin and never absorbes into your skin. I walked around with a grey, tan, greasy product on my skin. I felt I could not wear this in public.</li>
