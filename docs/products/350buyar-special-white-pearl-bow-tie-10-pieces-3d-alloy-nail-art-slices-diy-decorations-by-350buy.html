            <li>Super cute for nails!</li>
            <li>Looked super cute!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re easy to put on and everybody complimented me about them</li>
            <li>They are so pertty and elegant and they are just the right size for acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>Very nice curve in back to follow the curve of the nail.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I am excited to.</li>
            <li>But they all came quick and not missing a single pearl theyre perfect and cute</li>
            <li>Its a perfect size and came earlier than expected thank you</li>
            <li>Use them with nail glue rather than polish for longer lasting results :)</li>

            <li>I will order more if necessary.</li>
            <li>They have a curved back which will be awesome for my nails, because my nail bed is very curved (which means that any large, flat nail charms will have trouble sticking to my nails for more than like a day).</li>
            <li>I used these over one nail on top of hot pink nail polish.</li>
            <li>I like it so much its gorges</li>
            <li>Much prettier in person.  </li>
