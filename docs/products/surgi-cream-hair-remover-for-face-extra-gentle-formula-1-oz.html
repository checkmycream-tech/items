            <li>Happy to know I was able to find it online.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years, and very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the magic happens, but I&#x27;ll be darned if the peach fuzz is no longer there!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 15 years and for me it is the gentlest and most effective product I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Love the finishing balm with cucumber!  </li>
            <li>Definitely more bang for my buck!</li>
            <li>I liked this cream.  </li>
            <li>I found that it doesn&#x27;t remove hair at the root, it kind of chops or melts it off at the skin surface.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly in excellent condition and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Great product that arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value for a super product.</li>
            <li>Very easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried every face hair remover cream on the market and this is by far the very very best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the others and Surgi-cream is by far the best product for the face.</li>
            <li>The best product that I&#x27;ve found as I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Works great and it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Works better than Nair and if u use the cream after u r finished it feels smooth and most of all hairless!</li>
            <li>Others may have better luck, but it was hit and miss for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the included Surgi-Soothe Cream when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t leave it on more than the recommended 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product -</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years, and it&#x27;s wonderful!  </li>
            <li>im sure that it will subside..  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>but I use this the rest of the time as it is much more affordable that way.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to watch the time though and don&#x27;t go beyond the recommended time so as not to create a breakout.  </li>
            <li>I tried their replacement products and had problems with most of them.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>With all of them, they do a marginal job of removing hair and most of them have a &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; type cream to apply after the hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PRICE AND THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This cream was really safe on my face.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels afterwards</li>
            <li>The most important thing one MUST do is - stick to the 4 minutes</li>
            <li>product is easy to apply but please follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>So easy.</li>
            <li>AS THIS CREAM IS TOO STRONG TO BE ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li>I took a warm washcloth to take it off very gently and then splashed water on my face to get all of it off.  </li>
            <li>What can I say except every woman who is at that certain age needs this!!!  </li>
            <li>Gentle and easy to use, and effective.  </li>
            <li>Lightly dampened my skin.</li>
            <li>Pack of 3)]]have used this product many times before with success.</li>
            <li>Used with the included soothing cream that you apply afterwards, your face will feel quite smooth.</li>
            <li>I personally leave it on for fifteen minutes, but do follow directions initially and then find your own time for best results.</li>
            <li>Now I just order a multipack and always have it available.</li>
            <li>my mom uses this product,she says it makes her face feel smooth &amp; touchable</li>
            <li>A cheap electric shaver gives me a smoother finish than this product did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, fast, and most importantly, pain free.  </li>
            <li>A quick, easy, and inexpensive solution to an embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li>The other product caused a stinging sensation but this one is the best - and this product removed&lt;br /&gt;every fair hair that I had - and with the other brand I would have to use the scissors.  </li>
            <li>I only tell you that I am fair because I&#x27;m not a hairy person</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was supposed to be effective for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This works as advertised and it is the most gentle on my skin of any hair removal creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It was so gentle to my very sensitive and fair skin, I wasn&#x27;t even&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes it did start to burn,then I quickly removed it and put on the follow up cream, which is a neutralizer and helped relieve the burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Excitement quickly faded, when I realized that the product is misleading to call itself a hair remover.  </li>
            <li>but it went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly, just as described.</li>
            <li>product works quickly (depending on the coarseness of the hair)</li>
            <li>I have fine textured hair and this product takes the full eight minutes to give me a good result, so I suggest the regular version for those who say they didn&#x27;t get complete hair removal.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly tho!</li>
            <li>but oh so worth it.  </li>
            <li>It does a really good job of removing all facial hair, but is not as gentle as it says it is.</li>
            <li>With one or two more treatments, I suspect the hair will be completely gone.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth the price.</li>
            <li>That is why I gave it 3 stars and say that is good if you have peach fuzz or light hair but not dark and coarse.</li>
            <li>You get stubble right after you use it.</li>
            <li>and since this is one of the places we first show signs of ageing, we need to be as kind as possible to it.  </li>
            <li>Especially when considering that the hair removal is just average at best.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product,  I was excited that it was gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>This cream was easy to use and not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li>No burned skin - very gentle.</li>
            <li>It may be necessary to look, under good light, at any single hairs that may need tweezering.  </li>
            <li>a test area the first time you use this&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not remove facial hair despite leaving the remover on for more than the 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Others the hair seems to grow back much quicker (sometimes wonder if they actually put hair growth ingredients in it lol).  </li>
            <li>meaning, you should probably not leave the cream on for the max time listed on the instructions when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li>Update Tried it again, my third try, and it worked better.  </li>
            <li>It removed some hairs, but left many others, leaving a splotchy look that was unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I have pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; skin, and</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time..</li>
            <li>First of all, I get better overall results from shaving.</li>
            <li>The cream is ok, but for coarse hair it really doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li>It takes less than 10 minutes, is very gentle and keeps my skin soft and looking good.</li>
            <li>The after care cream was fine for the first two times, but as I write this (on the third attempt, and no, not in a row),</li>
            <li>I put on the calming cream that&#x27;s included, and then topped that off with a pure mixture of shea butter and coconut oil that I make myself.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to try this, as anything that says &#x27;gentle&#x27; isn&#x27;t usually effective.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Surgi-Cream works, just be sure to read the brochure carefully, including the precautions, and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>, the delivery is fast, the system is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because it said it was gentle.</li>
            <li>I will return to tweezing until I can find something that gently removes from the follicle, and doesn&#x27;t leave stubble.</li>
            <li>Was not as gentle as I thought.</li>
            <li>Water seems to just wash away the hair, and if you rub TOO much then you end up with irritation in some spots.</li>
            <li>But this worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Got rid of all my peach fuzz and some stubbles, AND was gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the cream was gently on my face, but wiping it off with a wash cloth I did go gentle..</li>
            <li>it burns too much after you wipe it off gently..</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>works really well on her gray  hair.</li>
            <li>gentle.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 2 stars because it was gentle and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin and really works.</li>
            <li>Although it is gentle, it removes everything with one swipe.  </li>
            <li>works better than any other hair removal cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I bought the reg. and sensitive skin formulas.&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin formula wasn&#x27;t strong enough and I ended up w/ roots showing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>what little hair I do have is very fine.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and it is no longer available in any of the stores around here.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>Works much better than other products on the shelf!</li>
            <li>... covers better with less.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product from local stores and pleased with this product but can no longer find locally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to get the job done in one application but gentle enough not to irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>The after cream is very soothing as the skin is sensitive but you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripped your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore where I live</li>
            <li>This is the best smelling hair remover I&#x27;ve have used, not that it smells good (it doesn&#x27;t), but it&#x27;s not the worst smelling one either and the lotion to slow down hair growth does smell really good, definitely use that to neutralize the smell of the hair remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - very little reaction by the face, and it works every time in removing that unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and buys the extra gentle formula.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but decided to try the extra gentle formula, too.  </li>
            <li>I used it just as instructed, and don&#x27;t have an exceptionally sensitive face, though this is the Extra Gentle formula.</li>
            <li>This cream does not remove hair like the old cream did that I bought at the store.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned from the two times I&#x27;ve used this product:&lt;br /&gt;~Only for use on face; don&#x27;t use near your eyes or on your eyebrows</li>
            <li>Remember, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00138Q4V2 Surgi-cream Hair Remover Extra Gentle Formula For Face, 1-Ounce Tubes (</li>
            <li>They also have sensitive skin versions of their products</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;hair stop\\&quot; cream that comes with the depilatory because I know I am sensitive to one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairs don&#x27;t seem to be growing back as fast or as noticeable.</li>
            <li>Now have baby soft, hairless skin.  </li>
            <li>skin is not overly sensitive</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t works for my, my skin was sensitive, I know that it&#x27;s not fault of the product, but for that reason, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>This Extra Gentle Formula  WORKS and does not irritate her skin.  </li>
            <li>my dermatologist recommended this for removing facial hair... works really well.</li>
            <li>Even though I have sensitive skin, this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>It completely removed the hair without taking a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>It also burns, and my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive.</li>
            <li>i have a sensitive skin and wil not use again</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much of the product to remove hair from the whole lower half of your face (not cheeks); however, please don&#x27;t exceed the 8 minute time limit.  </li>
            <li>Following directions, it does work better than any other depilatory I have tried over the years, and I even re-ordered this recent 3 pack.</li>
            <li>I wiped a small spot off after 4 minutes it took off the light hair but not the darker.</li>
            <li>new med causes  increased hair and noticed  peach like fuzz  above  lips,lower jaw and neck.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this works on fine hair, I don&#x27;t know, but if you have black, coarse facial hair like I do?</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough and as fast as I took it off (less than 45 seconds)</li>
            <li>since used on mother, i used it for longer timer period (generally 10-12 minutes) with a generous portion on chin...</li>
            <li>Also, when you are going to remove it make sure the water is not too hot or too cold.  </li>
            <li>But it did not remove any hair above my lip, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>Works well, especially for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the sensitive skin formula and my skin still gets red after 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>As far as we are concerned, that is reason enough to never buy this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Being a female with hair on your face is very embarrassing, and even more when it&#x27;s thick and black</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might work well for a woman, who would have far less (and much finer) facial hair to remove.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has facial hair on her upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this since I was unable to find anything suitable in retail stores.</li>
            <li>I am going to look pretty hideous for a few days until my skin heals.  </li>
            <li>my face was already burned and I had to deal with yet another 3 or 4 days worth of red raw</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave red irritation like other products I had used in the past, so naturally I was excited about this product.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been fortunate to grow older, I&#x27;ve been unfortunate to grow darker, coarser facial</li>
            <li>My skin might&#x27;ve been a little irritated the first time I used this..the results were a sunburn looking red spot that finally faded after 9 days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend leaving it on longer than the suggested time because it does start to burn a little at the very end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of a certain post menopausal age and have always had some facial hair (chin, upper lip) , which I took care of by bleaching and a few tweezings.</li>

            <li> This is the perfect solution to unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li> When removing the cream my best method is to use a cottonball and use a lot of water instead of a lot of rubbing.  </li>

            <li> No redness, removal was easy, the hair was gone, and I was just so amazingly happy!  </li>
            <li> Takes the hair off with ease and surprisingly for the price I got triple the product.</li>
            <li> but this one is good.</li>
            <li> Happy to know I was able to find it online.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, and very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the magic happens, but I&#x27;ll be darned if the peach fuzz is no longer there!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 15 years and for me it is the gentlest and most effective product I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> Love the finishing balm with cucumber!  </li>
            <li> Definitely more bang for my buck!</li>
            <li> I liked this cream.  </li>
            <li> I found that it doesn&#x27;t remove hair at the root, it kind of chops or melts it off at the skin surface.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly in excellent condition and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great product that arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a great value for a super product.</li>
            <li> Very easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried every face hair remover cream on the market and this is by far the very very best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the others and Surgi-cream is by far the best product for the face.</li>
            <li> The best product that I&#x27;ve found as I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Works great and it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Works better than Nair and if u use the cream after u r finished it feels smooth and most of all hairless!</li>
            <li> Others may have better luck, but it was hit and miss for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the included Surgi-Soothe Cream when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on more than the recommended 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product -</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and it&#x27;s wonderful!  </li>
            <li> im sure that it will subside..  </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> but I use this the rest of the time as it is much more affordable that way.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to watch the time though and don&#x27;t go beyond the recommended time so as not to create a breakout.  </li>
            <li> I tried their replacement products and had problems with most of them.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> With all of them, they do a marginal job of removing hair and most of them have a &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; type cream to apply after the hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRICE AND THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This cream was really safe on my face.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels afterwards</li>
            <li> The most important thing one MUST do is - stick to the 4 minutes</li>
            <li> product is easy to apply but please follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> So easy.</li>
            <li> AS THIS CREAM IS TOO STRONG TO BE ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li> I took a warm washcloth to take it off very gently and then splashed water on my face to get all of it off.  </li>
            <li> What can I say except every woman who is at that certain age needs this!!!  </li>
            <li> Gentle and easy to use, and effective.  </li>
            <li> Lightly dampened my skin.</li>
            <li> Pack of 3)]]have used this product many times before with success.</li>
            <li> Used with the included soothing cream that you apply afterwards, your face will feel quite smooth.</li>
            <li> I personally leave it on for fifteen minutes, but do follow directions initially and then find your own time for best results.</li>
            <li> Now I just order a multipack and always have it available.</li>
            <li> my mom uses this product,she says it makes her face feel smooth &amp; touchable</li>
            <li> A cheap electric shaver gives me a smoother finish than this product did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, fast, and most importantly, pain free.  </li>
            <li> A quick, easy, and inexpensive solution to an embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li> The other product caused a stinging sensation but this one is the best - and this product removed&lt;br /&gt;every fair hair that I had - and with the other brand I would have to use the scissors.  </li>
            <li> I only tell you that I am fair because I&#x27;m not a hairy person</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was supposed to be effective for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised and it is the most gentle on my skin of any hair removal creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It was so gentle to my very sensitive and fair skin, I wasn&#x27;t even&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes it did start to burn,then I quickly removed it and put on the follow up cream, which is a neutralizer and helped relieve the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Excitement quickly faded, when I realized that the product is misleading to call itself a hair remover.  </li>
            <li> but it went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly, just as described.</li>
            <li> product works quickly (depending on the coarseness of the hair)</li>
            <li> I have fine textured hair and this product takes the full eight minutes to give me a good result, so I suggest the regular version for those who say they didn&#x27;t get complete hair removal.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions exactly tho!</li>
            <li> but oh so worth it.  </li>
            <li> It does a really good job of removing all facial hair, but is not as gentle as it says it is.</li>
            <li> With one or two more treatments, I suspect the hair will be completely gone.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> That is why I gave it 3 stars and say that is good if you have peach fuzz or light hair but not dark and coarse.</li>
            <li> You get stubble right after you use it.</li>
            <li> and since this is one of the places we first show signs of ageing, we need to be as kind as possible to it.  </li>
            <li> Especially when considering that the hair removal is just average at best.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product,  I was excited that it was gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This cream was easy to use and not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> No burned skin - very gentle.</li>
            <li> It may be necessary to look, under good light, at any single hairs that may need tweezering.  </li>
            <li> a test area the first time you use this&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not remove facial hair despite leaving the remover on for more than the 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> Others the hair seems to grow back much quicker (sometimes wonder if they actually put hair growth ingredients in it lol).  </li>
            <li> meaning, you should probably not leave the cream on for the max time listed on the instructions when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li> Update Tried it again, my third try, and it worked better.  </li>
            <li> It removed some hairs, but left many others, leaving a splotchy look that was unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I have pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; skin, and</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time..</li>
            <li> First of all, I get better overall results from shaving.</li>
            <li> The cream is ok, but for coarse hair it really doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 10 minutes, is very gentle and keeps my skin soft and looking good.</li>
            <li> The after care cream was fine for the first two times, but as I write this (on the third attempt, and no, not in a row),</li>
            <li> I put on the calming cream that&#x27;s included, and then topped that off with a pure mixture of shea butter and coconut oil that I make myself.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try this, as anything that says &#x27;gentle&#x27; isn&#x27;t usually effective.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surgi-Cream works, just be sure to read the brochure carefully, including the precautions, and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> , the delivery is fast, the system is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because it said it was gentle.</li>
            <li> I will return to tweezing until I can find something that gently removes from the follicle, and doesn&#x27;t leave stubble.</li>
            <li> Was not as gentle as I thought.</li>
            <li> Water seems to just wash away the hair, and if you rub TOO much then you end up with irritation in some spots.</li>
            <li> But this worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Got rid of all my peach fuzz and some stubbles, AND was gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the cream was gently on my face, but wiping it off with a wash cloth I did go gentle..</li>
            <li> it burns too much after you wipe it off gently..</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> works really well on her gray  hair.</li>
            <li> gentle.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 2 stars because it was gentle and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin and really works.</li>
            <li> Although it is gentle, it removes everything with one swipe.  </li>
            <li> works better than any other hair removal cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the reg. and sensitive skin formulas.&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin formula wasn&#x27;t strong enough and I ended up w/ roots showing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> what little hair I do have is very fine.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and it is no longer available in any of the stores around here.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> Works much better than other products on the shelf!</li>
            <li> ... covers better with less.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product from local stores and pleased with this product but can no longer find locally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to get the job done in one application but gentle enough not to irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> The after cream is very soothing as the skin is sensitive but you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripped your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore where I live</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling hair remover I&#x27;ve have used, not that it smells good (it doesn&#x27;t), but it&#x27;s not the worst smelling one either and the lotion to slow down hair growth does smell really good, definitely use that to neutralize the smell of the hair remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - very little reaction by the face, and it works every time in removing that unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin and buys the extra gentle formula.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but decided to try the extra gentle formula, too.  </li>
            <li> I used it just as instructed, and don&#x27;t have an exceptionally sensitive face, though this is the Extra Gentle formula.</li>
            <li> This cream does not remove hair like the old cream did that I bought at the store.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned from the two times I&#x27;ve used this product:&lt;br /&gt;~Only for use on face; don&#x27;t use near your eyes or on your eyebrows</li>
            <li> Remember, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They also have sensitive skin versions of their products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;hair stop\\&quot; cream that comes with the depilatory because I know I am sensitive to one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairs don&#x27;t seem to be growing back as fast or as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Now have baby soft, hairless skin.  </li>
            <li> skin is not overly sensitive</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t works for my, my skin was sensitive, I know that it&#x27;s not fault of the product, but for that reason, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This Extra Gentle Formula  WORKS and does not irritate her skin.  </li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended this for removing facial hair... works really well.</li>
            <li> Even though I have sensitive skin, this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> It completely removed the hair without taking a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> It also burns, and my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive.</li>
            <li> i have a sensitive skin and wil not use again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very much of the product to remove hair from the whole lower half of your face (not cheeks); however, please don&#x27;t exceed the 8 minute time limit.  </li>
            <li> Following directions, it does work better than any other depilatory I have tried over the years, and I even re-ordered this recent 3 pack.</li>
            <li> I wiped a small spot off after 4 minutes it took off the light hair but not the darker.</li>
            <li> new med causes  increased hair and noticed  peach like fuzz  above  lips,lower jaw and neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this works on fine hair, I don&#x27;t know, but if you have black, coarse facial hair like I do?</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough and as fast as I took it off (less than 45 seconds)</li>
            <li> since used on mother, i used it for longer timer period (generally 10-12 minutes) with a generous portion on chin...</li>
            <li> Also, when you are going to remove it make sure the water is not too hot or too cold.  </li>
            <li> But it did not remove any hair above my lip, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> Works well, especially for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the sensitive skin formula and my skin still gets red after 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> As far as we are concerned, that is reason enough to never buy this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Being a female with hair on your face is very embarrassing, and even more when it&#x27;s thick and black</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might work well for a woman, who would have far less (and much finer) facial hair to remove.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has facial hair on her upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this since I was unable to find anything suitable in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I am going to look pretty hideous for a few days until my skin heals.  </li>
            <li> my face was already burned and I had to deal with yet another 3 or 4 days worth of red raw</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave red irritation like other products I had used in the past, so naturally I was excited about this product.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been fortunate to grow older, I&#x27;ve been unfortunate to grow darker, coarser facial</li>
            <li> My skin might&#x27;ve been a little irritated the first time I used this..the results were a sunburn looking red spot that finally faded after 9 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend leaving it on longer than the suggested time because it does start to burn a little at the very end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of a certain post menopausal age and have always had some facial hair (chin, upper lip) , which I took care of by bleaching and a few tweezings.</li>
            <li> I think that after I shaved (a couple of hours following the application of Surgi-Cream), the appearance of the shadow might have been slightly less than it normally would have</li>
            <li> I have coarse facial hair for some strange reason in my genetics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product long enough to use two tubes</li>
            <li> At 8 minutes it removed all the light hair was gone and only a few of the thick hairs.</li>
            <li> This is no better and no worse than any other hair removal product I have used for my face -- it works the same as the competitors like Nair, Sally Hansen, Veet, etc.  </li>
            <li> so I figured a gentle formula wouldn&#x27;t cause any type of negative reaction</li>
            <li> Works really well and does not cause any discomfort or redness at least for me.</li>
            <li> My face was sensitive for a few hours after</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve bought this, I haven&#x27;t paid for facial waxing for the upper lip and the lower half of my face - it has saved me a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a very long time for a cream to remove this hair since I was 14 and now 31, has been long search.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, a different person may not mind the stubble and might give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than some</li>
            <li> I have had my face burn and stay red for four days using other products (and I just wish I was exaggerating here).  </li>
            <li> It is better to pluck the hair, than to use this lousy stuff!</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and very coarse hair.</li>
            <li> medication before caused me to loose a lot of hair on head, all my eyebrows, all hair everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I am a Black female and my hair is a bit course.  </li>
            <li> Rubbing my tongue on my upper lip made me realize this, as I felt all of the little stubble.</li>
            <li> face a little red but  </li>
            <li> a huge plus...but the cream you use afterwards burns and does smell a little weird.</li>
            <li> This was a much more costly, timely and painful method.  </li>
            <li> MUCH better than painful waxing</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s not gentle.  </li>
            <li> She has tried the regular formula and found it too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully, but the hair was still on my face after the process.</li>
            <li> It stays red for a few days &amp; is extremely irritated &amp; burn even when water touches.</li>
            <li> not ever use again.&lt;br /&gt;be careful!</li>
            <li> but my face was still on fire, then I used the other cream that came with it</li>
            <li> Other creams like this that I have tried don&#x27;t remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> I even had several small blisters on my chin.</li>
            <li> Having read other reviews of this product, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely hairy on my face and neck area.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair thin and natural looking opposed to shaving!  </li>
            <li> Back to bleaching I guess, at least that works well</li>
            <li> Each time I&#x27;ve used this, the area above my lip has felt like it&#x27;s sunburned for at least 3 hours afterward.  </li>
            <li> Slows down hair re-growth.</li>
            <li> Left on for 8 minutes, though the bad smell mixed with heavy fragrance nearly made me vomit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that were so harsh and damaging to my skin, but this one seems to work without causing any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> had a slight stinging sensation after rinsing</li>
            <li> THIS LEFT A SERIOUS MARK ON MY LIPS</li>
            <li> I put it on for a bit less time than is suggested.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try this in hopes that it would make the hair less noticeable and be an improvement on</li>
            <li> Works well with minimum mess.</li>
            <li> It takes at least this long for it to work.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work but it awkwardly whitens your mouth area making it evident you use this type of cream</li>

            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was hopeful but not sure what my outcome would be.  </li>
            <li> I wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these.</li>
            <li> a couple of years ago I bought the no no hair remover that was advertised on tv, it cost a little over 200 dollars, and that product doesn&#x27;t remove hair like it says it would..</li>
            <li> I make little money and 2.</li>
            <li> but I think that is due to my excessive hair growth.</li>
            <li> It is way too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this hair remover since I had tried others like neet and nair, which proved to be too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li> or you may experience unnecessary burning and redness, and ultimate damage to the skin -</li>
            <li> I, sometimes, need to pluck a few hairs.</li>
            <li> But Surgo-cream has an after-removal cream that has the most sickening, over-powering, flowery smell ever.  </li>
            <li> I am going to use this again in a few days and will follow up with an update to my review.</li>
            <li> From my past experiences, I&#x27;ve found that when stubble grows out it feels stiff and whiskery.  </li>
            <li> The soothing cream included did help a bit, but I have red blotches and my skin is starting to blister as if I got a bad sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I used the sensitive skin formula, I&#x27;d hate to see what the regular version would do to me.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with this product at all.</li>
            <li> If not for that, I would have given it one star because when I did a patch test on a small area of my chin, it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair, and I could feel stubble where it did remove hair.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to slow hair regrowth, but I am not sure it does.</li>
            <li> It hardly removes any at all.</li>
            <li> It has gotten hard to find in store&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not to mention the ease of shopping for a hard to find item in my area.</li>
            <li> If this is supposed to be the gentle product I would hate to see what the hard stuff does to your skin.</li>
            <li> Well I was happily surprised because it didn&#x27;t start to burn until about 5 minutes, and then not too badly.  </li>
            <li> at least hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your fingertips and apply thickly at skin level</li>
            <li> Thick</li>
            <li> You do have to slowly introduce it to your skin,</li>
            <li> had no problems or unpleasant experience with the product except what I noted above about it not meeing my expectations...or</li>
            <li> and I got rashes, burns, and bad red marks every where.</li>
            <li> Not a good product, didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> After 4 treatments the hair has noticeably decreased, and she continues to use it and see results.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when this did not have the very bad smell</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the smell is bad - like other hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> i bought some wax and strips before and it killed me...too messy to put on and very painful ripping.</li>
            <li> I do give it 2 stars because at least the fragrance used isn&#x27;t horrible, just heavy.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Was unable to use.</li>
            <li> It became difficult to find in stores,so I  turned to Amazon</li>
            <li> and then I hold a cold flannel on the area for a minute.</li>
            <li> Waxing can be expensive!  </li>
            <li> product feels very uncomfortable to me during the 4-8 minutes it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all...</li>
            <li> like I got a bad sunburn....</li>
            <li> After bad experiences with hair removal cream for my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless for chin hair.</li>
            <li> I hate this crap!</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> even though I put petroleum jelly on my lips as a precaution, it blistered them terribly all the way around the margin!</li>
            <li> I looked horrible for over a week!!!</li>
            <li> It is awful and made my eyes water.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to get the job done in one application but gentle enough not to irritate your skin.  It&#x27;s the only brand I use.</li>
            <li> Works much better than other products on the shelf!</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as it used too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand but amazon.com didn&#x27;t carry it so I purchased these.  It was so gentle to my very sensitive and fair skin, I wasn&#x27;t even&lt;br /&gt;aware that I had it on the area above my lip.  The other product caused a stinging sensation but this one is the best - and this product removed&lt;br /&gt;every fair hair that I had - and with the other brand I would have to use the scissors.  I only tell you that I am fair because I&#x27;m not a hairy person&lt;br /&gt;and what little hair I do have is very fine.  AAAA+++++</li>
            <li> This cream does not remove hair like the old cream did that I bought at the store. I have dark hair and very coarse hair. It hardly removes any at all.</li>
            <li> I liked this cream.  I have sensitive skin and it worked well for me.  A little tingling immediately after but calming cream that was included helped.  Lasted for a couple of weeks.  Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions. Started with makeup and moisturizer-free face. Lightly dampened my skin. Left on for 8 minutes, though the bad smell mixed with heavy fragrance nearly made me vomit. Removed with applicator (de-applicator, I guess) and NO HAIR HAD BEEN REMOVED. My face was sensitive for a few hours after and I had a blotchy red spot or two for a day. But it did not remove any hair above my lip, as far as I could tell. Back to bleaching I guess, at least that works well no matter what brand I use. I do give it 2 stars because at least the fragrance used isn&#x27;t horrible, just heavy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this worked as well as it should have. Others may have better luck, but it was hit and miss for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice. It was recommended by a friend who has been using it for years.  She has sensitive skin and buys the extra gentle formula.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but decided to try the extra gentle formula, too.  I&#x27;m glad I did. The first time I used it, it left a small, sunburn type spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve learned from the two times I&#x27;ve used this product:&lt;br /&gt;~Only for use on face; don&#x27;t use near your eyes or on your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;~Do not use on irritated skin&lt;br /&gt;~Read all the precautions before beginning&lt;br /&gt;~Do a test area the first time you use this&lt;br /&gt;~Dampen your skin first&lt;br /&gt;~Use your fingertips and apply thickly at skin level; I try to dab it on thickly&lt;br /&gt;~Don&#x27;t rub it in&lt;br /&gt;~Remove any Surgi-Cream that gets on your lips with a damp cloth&lt;br /&gt;~Do not leave it on longer than 8 minutes&lt;br /&gt;~You will probably need to use this every 10-14 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels very uncomfortable to me during the 4-8 minutes it&#x27;s working. If you don&#x27;t apply it thickly enough at skin level it won&#x27;t work. Be sure to use the included Surgi-Soothe Cream when you&#x27;re finished. I tried the applicator but found it easier to use my fingers. My skin might&#x27;ve been a little irritated the first time I used this..the results were a sunburn looking red spot that finally faded after 9 days. Each time I&#x27;ve used this, the area above my lip has felt like it&#x27;s sunburned for at least 3 hours afterward.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to touch it; it&#x27;s not red; but feels like it&#x27;s been burned. Remember, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surgi-Cream works, just be sure to read the brochure carefully, including the precautions, and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product at all. For me, my skin burned after I used it and the hair was still there.</li>
            <li> Product Satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as promised! The [product is great, the delivery is fast, the system is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the great service.&lt;br /&gt;S. Cohen</li>
            <li> Gentle and easy to use, and effective.  I&#x27;ve used other products that were so harsh and damaging to my skin, but this one seems to work without causing any skin irritation.  Just don&#x27;t leave it on more than the recommended 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> Bought this product from local stores and pleased with this product but can no longer find locally.  Happy to know I was able to find it online.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00138Q4V2 Surgi-cream Hair Remover Extra Gentle Formula For Face, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]]have used this product many times before with success. however, my last order seems to be outdated/weak. did not remove facial hair despite leaving the remover on for more than the 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s not gentle.  I left it on for the minimum time and it kept burning my skin after removing.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for facial hair removal.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore where I live so I have to find it online.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because it said it was gentle. This doesn&#x27;t remove the hair at all, it begins to.burn my skin &amp; it turn red almost immediately after rinsing it. It stays red for a few days &amp; is extremely irritated &amp; burn even when water touches. I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It is way too harsh on my skin. I have to take it off within 1 min of putting it in because it burns immediately. My skin is pretty sensitive so I figured a gentle formula wouldn&#x27;t cause any type of negative reaction but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product - Have used it for years  - Hair does grwo back finer but regrowth does take a while</li>
            <li> Works well, especially for sensitive skin.  Removes the hair within 8 minutes--don&#x27;t leave it on any longer. Used with the included soothing cream that you apply afterwards, your face will feel quite smooth. Have been using this since I was unable to find anything suitable in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Have used this for year&#x27;s. It has gotten hard to find in store&#x27;s so I ordered it here.....great price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommened that I try this prduct. In my opinion, it is no differant then nair, neet or veet. They also have sensitive skin versions of their products and I simply see no differance, except shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this hair remover since I had tried others like neet and nair, which proved to be too harsh for my skin.  When I first used this product,  I was excited that it was gentle on the skin. Directions say to leave on for 4-8 minutes. After 5 minutes it did start to burn,then I quickly removed it and put on the follow up cream, which is a neutralizer and helped relieve the burning sensation. It didn&#x27;t leave red irritation like other products I had used in the past, so naturally I was excited about this product. Excitement quickly faded, when I realized that the product is misleading to call itself a hair remover.  I found that it doesn&#x27;t remove hair at the root, it kind of chops or melts it off at the skin surface.  Rubbing my tongue on my upper lip made me realize this, as I felt all of the little stubble. From my past experiences, I&#x27;ve found that when stubble grows out it feels stiff and whiskery.  I will return to tweezing until I can find something that gently removes from the follicle, and doesn&#x27;t leave stubble. Not too impressed with this product for myself, as I give it 2 stars. On the other hand, a different person may not mind the stubble and might give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the perfect solution!</li>
            <li> works better than any other hair removal cream I have ever used. From now on I will only purchase this hair removal cream. Slows down hair re-growth.</li>
            <li> great item. Does the job well and arrived earlier than predicted</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was hopeful but not sure what my outcome would be.  Well I was happily surprised because it didn&#x27;t start to burn until about 5 minutes, and then not too badly.  I took a warm washcloth to take it off very gently and then splashed water on my face to get all of it off.  I put on the calming cream that&#x27;s included, and then topped that off with a pure mixture of shea butter and coconut oil that I make myself.  I don&#x27;t know how the magic happens, but I&#x27;ll be darned if the peach fuzz is no longer there! A quick, easy, and inexpensive solution to an embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried every face hair remover cream on the market and this is by far the very very best! Others the hair seems to grow back much quicker (sometimes wonder if they actually put hair growth ingredients in it lol).  A little more expensive than some maybe but oh so worth it.  Thick and I like that... covers better with less.  Never irritates my skin.  Just wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Was unable to use. Was not as gentle as I thought. It still irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years, and very satisfied with the results. No scaring or pain from using it on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product that arrived quickly.  Not to mention the ease of shopping for a hard to find item in my area.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea that requires antibiotic medication to control.  My skin reacts to almost everything.  This is the only depilatory I can use now.  I don&#x27;t use the \\&quot;hair stop\\&quot; cream that comes with the depilatory because I know I am sensitive to one of the ingredients.  That cream burns my skin.  Read the labels and follow directions, folks.  Ask your dermatologist for a recommendation.  I bet she says Surgi-Cream.  I have fine textured hair and this product takes the full eight minutes to give me a good result, so I suggest the regular version for those who say they didn&#x27;t get complete hair removal.</li>
            <li> Use this on my face periodically. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution to unwanted hair.  Keeps hair thin and natural looking opposed to shaving!  You do have to slowly introduce it to your skin, meaning, you should probably not leave the cream on for the max time listed on the instructions when you first start using it.  Also, when you are going to remove it make sure the water is not too hot or too cold.  Using water that&#x27;s too hot usually irritates my skin.  When removing the cream my best method is to use a cottonball and use a lot of water instead of a lot of rubbing.  Water seems to just wash away the hair, and if you rub TOO much then you end up with irritation in some spots.</li>
            <li> I use it about every 5-6 weeks. I used to go to the beautician for the upper lip to be waxed. This was a much more costly, timely and painful method.  Actually, even though I probably needed to go every 4 weeks, because of the cost, time and pain factor, I had to stretch it to 5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to apply but please follow the instructions.  The most important thing one MUST do is - stick to the 4 minutes or you may experience unnecessary burning and redness, and ultimate damage to the skin - and since this is one of the places we first show signs of ageing, we need to be as kind as possible to it.  I actually set an alarm clock at 4 minutes from when it is applied. Afterwards,  I wiped it off with the applicator and a tissue and then I hold a cold flannel on the area for a minute. Then I apply the moisturizer that comes with the packet. This works well every time.  It may be necessary to look, under good light, at any single hairs that may need tweezering.  Between the 5-6 week applications I, sometimes, need to pluck a few hairs. This is all gentler than a beautician waxing and re-waxing and re-waxing until she&#x27;s got every last hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product long enough to use two tubes and I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairs don&#x27;t seem to be growing back as fast or as noticeable. Co-incidental? I&#x27;m not sure, but I love it! Please don&#x27;t stop making this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff ! Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else :)</li>
            <li> Works well with minimum mess.</li>
            <li> The directions say leave on for 4-8 minutes.  left on for four - not enough.  Reapplied and left on for 5 - perfect!Skin had a slight stinging sensation after rinsing but it went away quickly.  Now have baby soft, hairless skin.  MUCH better than painful waxing</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and left the product on for 6 minutes (4-8 minutes recommended).  The hair was gone alright, but my face is still on fire hours later.  The soothing cream included did help a bit, but I have red blotches and my skin is starting to blister as if I got a bad sunburn.  I&#x27;m taking Advil and putting Aloe Vera for the pain.  I am going to look pretty hideous for a few days until my skin heals.  I used the sensitive skin formula, I&#x27;d hate to see what the regular version would do to me.  As others have mentioned, the smell is bad - like other hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years with excellent results. It became difficult to find in stores,so I  turned to Amazon and there it was. I personally leave it on for fifteen minutes, but do follow directions initially and then find your own time for best results.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this product at all. I followed th instructions and tested it on a different patch of skin, and it had no adverse effect. However, when it was applies to the desired areas for the shortest amount of time recommended it severely burned my skin. If this is supposed to be the gentle product I would hate to see what the hard stuff does to your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and it&#x27;s wonderful!  Since I&#x27;ve bought this, I haven&#x27;t paid for facial waxing for the upper lip and the lower half of my face - it has saved me a lot of money.  I have extra-sensitive skin (Rosacea), and it doesn&#x27;t turn my face red.  It works just as it&#x27;s advertised.  It doesn&#x27;t take very much of the product to remove hair from the whole lower half of your face (not cheeks); however, please don&#x27;t exceed the 8 minute time limit.  It will start to burn (the face still doesn&#x27;t turn red though).</li>
            <li> I thought that it might remove facial hair deely enough that the beard &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; might not be visible any longer. Not only was the beard shadow still visible, but I still needed to shave afterward, even though I had only a one-day growth when I applied Surgi-Cream.  I think that after I shaved (a couple of hours following the application of Surgi-Cream), the appearance of the shadow might have been slightly less than it normally would have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems or unpleasant experience with the product except what I noted above about it not meeing my expectations...or at least hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work well for a woman, who would have far less (and much finer) facial hair to remove.</li>
            <li> Not a good product, didn&#x27;t work.  Update Tried it again, my third try, and it worked better.  I&#x27;m using the sensitive skin formula and my skin still gets red after 7 minutes. It takes at least this long for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it does the trick on on wanted facial hair with no problems.  Does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, even leaving it on longer than suggested. It removed some hairs, but left many others, leaving a splotchy look that was unacceptable. I didn&#x27;t break out or have an allergic reaction, so it was &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;, but didn&#x27;t remove all upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to try this, as anything that says &#x27;gentle&#x27; isn&#x27;t usually effective.  But this worked very well.  Got rid of all my peach fuzz and some stubbles, AND was gentle on my face.  Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> It does a really good job of removing all facial hair, but is not as gentle as it says it is. I have pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; skin, and even though I put petroleum jelly on my lips as a precaution, it blistered them terribly all the way around the margin! I looked horrible for over a week!!! If using this, stay away from your lips at all costs...&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all...a huge plus...but the cream you use afterwards burns and does smell a little weird. It is supposed to slow hair regrowth, but I am not sure it does.</li>
            <li> This worked great and I didn&#x27;t realize it was a 3 pack. Bargain!</li>
            <li> tore the skin off my face!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;my skin is not overly sensitive either.&lt;br /&gt;will not ever use again.&lt;br /&gt;be careful!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - very little reaction by the face, and it works every time in removing that unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent shopping experience.  I wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these. Great Shopping Experience.</li>
            <li> Takes the hair off with ease and surprisingly for the price I got triple the product. This is the best deal ever could not get a better deal anywhere else.</li>
            <li> medication before caused me to loose a lot of hair on head, all my eyebrows, all hair everywhere.  new med causes  increased hair and noticed  peach like fuzz  above  lips,lower jaw and neck.  i bought some wax and strips before and it killed me...too messy to put on and very painful ripping. so  sent for this.  it works!  i didnt do the  test area just put it on  , left it for 8 min washed off with damp cloth. face a little red but  im sure that it will subside..  it does smell like elephant poo &amp; rotten eggs but hey....&lt;br /&gt;try it</li>
            <li> Product was just as promised  and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a super product. I&#x27;ve tried all the others and Surgi-cream is by far the best product for the face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t have a terrible smell and it works great! It also doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin, which is a big plus for me. Only have to leave it on for 5 minutes also! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t works for my, my skin was sensitive, I know that it&#x27;s not fault of the product, but for that reason, I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time.. it did remove all of my hair on my face.. but I left it on for ten minutes and I wiped the hair off my face, and then my face was on fire.. I got red blotches and my face was red... the cream was gently on my face, but wiping it off with a wash cloth I did go gentle.. but my face was still on fire, then I used the other cream that came with it hoping that it would stop the burning and the redness, but it didn&#x27;t.. I love the product but I don&#x27;t like the way it makes your face so red.. I was embarrassed to go out into public looking like I got a bad sunburn.... I wish  their was something else to use besides shaving.. a couple of years ago I bought the no no hair remover that was advertised on tv, it cost a little over 200 dollars, and that product doesn&#x27;t remove hair like it says it would.. I rather shave than go through that.. but the shaving you get stubble like a man&#x27;s face.. I&#x27;m not going to use this product again... it burns too much after you wipe it off gently.. I&#x27;m not ordering this product ever again...</li>
            <li> The best product that I&#x27;ve found as I have sensitive skin.  I wax about every 6 weeks when I get a salon facial  but I use this the rest of the time as it is much more affordable that way.  Waxing can be expensive!  Be sure to watch the time though and don&#x27;t go beyond the recommended time so as not to create a breakout.  My local pharmacies used to carry this but stopped for some reason.  I tried their replacement products and had problems with most of them.  I was pleased to find this on Amazon.  Now I just order a multipack and always have it available.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom who is \\&quot;over 60\\&quot;  She has tried the regular formula and found it too harsh.  This Extra Gentle Formula  WORKS and does not irritate her skin.  I have been buying in bulk 6 to 12 AT A TIME. (Saves shipping, TOO!)  She&#x27;s Happy ... I&#x27;m Happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly, just as described.</li>
            <li> Works better than Nair and if u use the cream after u r finished it feels smooth and most of all hairless!</li>
            <li> This is no better and no worse than any other hair removal product I have used for my face -- it works the same as the competitors like Nair, Sally Hansen, Veet, etc.  With all of them, they do a marginal job of removing hair and most of them have a &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; type cream to apply after the hair removal.  But Surgo-cream has an after-removal cream that has the most sickening, over-powering, flowery smell ever.  It is awful and made my eyes water.  My husband begged me to shower to get the smell all off.  As far as we are concerned, that is reason enough to never buy this stuff.  Especially when considering that the hair removal is just average at best.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 15 years and for me it is the gentlest and most effective product I have ever used!  Definitely makes life easier to handle without worrying about hair!  It takes less than 10 minutes, is very gentle and keeps my skin soft and looking good. Follow the directions exactly tho!</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended this for removing facial hair... works really well. its gentle without a harsh smell. since used on mother, i used it for longer timer period (generally 10-12 minutes) with a generous portion on chin... works really well on her gray  hair.</li>
            <li> THIS LEFT A SERIOUS MARK ON MY LIPS AS THIS CREAM IS TOO STRONG TO BE ON THE MARKET...I WOULD LIKE A REFUND....</li>
            <li> No redness, removal was easy, the hair was gone, and I was just so amazingly happy!  I have had my face burn and stay red for four days using other products (and I just wish I was exaggerating here).  One product I tried I had wasn&#x27;t even finished applying it and all the sudden my face was on fire I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough and as fast as I took it off (less than 45 seconds) my face was already burned and I had to deal with yet another 3 or 4 days worth of red raw skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this on for about the max time before removing.  I experienced no burning, no irritation  and no remorse!  This was a 3 box purchase but I will reorder when I need to I&#x27;ll be using Surgi until it either gets discontinued or my skin decides it doesn&#x27;t like it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and it is no longer available in any of the stores around here. The product arrived quickly in excellent condition and it was reasonably priced. Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRICE AND THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Being a female with hair on your face is very embarrassing, and even more when it&#x27;s thick and black and you have a mustache, beard and side burns to boot. I have been searching for a very long time for a cream to remove this hair since I was 14 and now 31, has been long search. Some might ask &amp;#34;Why not electrolysis?&amp;#34; or waxing? 1. I make little money and 2. since I have to go out daily and the hair has to grow out &#x3D; public embarrassment. After bad experiences with hair removal cream for my face. I was surprised when this did not have the very bad smell and it did not burn. I read and reread the instructions over and set my timer I used my chin as the test. I wiped a small spot off after 4 minutes it took off the light hair but not the darker. At 8 minutes it removed all the light hair was gone and only a few of the thick hairs. But the next day I had stubble on my chin but I think that is due to my excessive hair growth. I kid not when I say That I can shave in the morning  and have stubble the next morning. That is why I gave it 3 stars and say that is good if you have peach fuzz or light hair but not dark and coarse.</li>
            <li> Great product. Even though I have sensitive skin, this does not irritate it. You MUST, however, remember to moisten your face before you apply it ...</li>
            <li> Works great!  I put it on for a bit less time than is suggested.</li>
            <li> You have to leave it on there longer than it suggests for product to work</li>
            <li> This stuff does work but it awkwardly whitens your mouth area making it evident you use this type of cream</li>
            <li> Works really well and does not cause any discomfort or redness at least for me.</li>
            <li> I bought the reg. and sensitive skin formulas.&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin formula wasn&#x27;t strong enough and I ended up w/ roots showing.&lt;br /&gt;The regular formula left redness and stringing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Still have roots after use of both.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works the way it says.  Other creams like this that I have tried don&#x27;t remove the hair.  Surgi cream removes all the hair and I have no skin reactions from it!</li>
            <li> This cream was easy to use and not harsh at all.  It completely removed the hair without taking a layer of skin.  No irritation after.  The after cream is very soothing as the skin is sensitive but you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripped your skin.</li>
            <li> HAIR TODAY,GONE TODAY! my mom uses this product,she says it makes her face feel smooth &amp; touchable she happy the amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Very easy on the skin. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom! This is the only one that seems to work for her.</li>
            <li> What can I say except every woman who is at that certain age needs this!!!  So easy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Followed directions and worked great without having skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have coarse facial hair for some strange reason in my genetics. I tend to shave because I lack the pain tolerance to wax or pluck every hair, and can&#x27;t afford the once-ever-six-month visit to have the hair follicle lasered. So I thought I&#x27;d try this in hopes that it would make the hair less noticeable and be an improvement on shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. First of all, I get better overall results from shaving. It also burns, and my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive. The after care cream was fine for the first two times, but as I write this (on the third attempt, and no, not in a row), my face burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this works on fine hair, I don&#x27;t know, but if you have black, coarse facial hair like I do? Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This product broke my skin out and I got rashes, burns, and bad red marks every where. I used it just as instructed, and don&#x27;t have an exceptionally sensitive face, though this is the Extra Gentle formula. I hate this crap! I will NEVER use it again, and regardless that people like it, I think I am just going to throw the extra out rather than sell it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was supposed to be effective for sensitive skin. I followed the directions carefully, but the hair was still on my face after the process. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> i used the product now and i have a red face all over and its still burning i have a sensitive skin and wil not use again</li>
            <li> I have only used this once and it did not remove the hair like I thought it would.  I am going to use this again in a few days and will follow up with an update to my review.</li>
            <li> it says extra. gentle. it burned my chin instantly . Then I washed it off kept burning my skin. I even had several small blisters on my chin.</li>
            <li> I was impressed. No burned skin - very gentle. Love the finishing balm with cucumber!  What&#x27;s the moisture back in your skin!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has facial hair on her upper lip.  After 4 treatments the hair has noticeably decreased, and she continues to use it and see results. With one or two more treatments, I suspect the hair will be completely gone.  She&#x27;ll continue to use it for maintenance.  It&#x27;s easy, fast, and most importantly, pain free.  She has not had any reactions to the product at all.</li>
            <li> OK,here goes... I&#x27;m of a certain post menopausal age and have always had some facial hair (chin, upper lip) , which I took care of by bleaching and a few tweezings. Since I&#x27;ve been fortunate to grow older, I&#x27;ve been unfortunate to grow darker, coarser facial hair.&lt;br /&gt; Having read other reviews of this product, I gave it a try.  Yes! Following directions, it does work better than any other depilatory I have tried over the years, and I even re-ordered this recent 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Works great and it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with unwanted facial hair.  I gave this product 2 stars because it was gentle and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  If not for that, I would have given it one star because when I did a patch test on a small area of my chin, it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair, and I could feel stubble where it did remove hair.  A cheap electric shaver gives me a smoother finish than this product did.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised and it is the most gentle on my skin of any hair removal creams I have tried.  I only use this product now.</li>
            <li> This product is the best one I have ever used. It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin and really works. I don&#x27;t recommend leaving it on longer than the suggested time because it does start to burn a little at the very end. I will never use another product. Very happy! Plus - it comes with 3 boxes! Definitely more bang for my buck!</li>
            <li> This cream was really safe on my face. I have&lt;br /&gt;allergies to a lot of products but this one is good.</li>
            <li> The cream is ok, but for coarse hair it really doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. Also, need to watch the time it set on (like directions state) makes skin sensiitive.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling hair remover I&#x27;ve have used, not that it smells good (it doesn&#x27;t), but it&#x27;s not the worst smelling one either and the lotion to slow down hair growth does smell really good, definitely use that to neutralize the smell of the hair remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works quickly (depending on the coarseness of the hair), I leave it on for 5 to 6 minutes.  This product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am extremely hairy on my face and neck area.  I am a Black female and my hair is a bit course.  Although it is gentle, it removes everything with one swipe.  I love it and I would not use anything else. I love how my skin feels afterwards and I never feel like it has overdried it or somehow irritated it.  It keeps the ingrown hair to a minimum and in 8 mins I&#x27;m done. Normally the results last nearly a month, but I usually keep it up to every 3 weeks or so.  The Subscribe and Save is necessary to keep me stocked up!</li>
            <li> Out of date merchandise so would not work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless for chin hair. You get stubble right after you use it. It is better to pluck the hair, than to use this lousy stuff!</li>
            <li> since I chose not to take hormones, I now have chin hair to remove, Even though you&#x27;re advised not to, I have to apply it twice to my chin to remove it.</li>
