            <li>They are nice and sharp so it makes them easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I can easily fit these in the top edge of my toenail because of the way they are curved.&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp and it didn&#x27;t take much effort to clip my toenails.</li>
            <li>It was either the Texas Toenail Massacre using a chain saw or find some more reasonable device used by knowledgeable medical professionals.</li>

            <li>Just flip it up to the inside of the handle and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>They are made of  stainless steel.</li>
            <li>If you know someone like that get these to make it so much easier to clip their nails.</li>
            <li>- it really works - WELL</li>
            <li>and I am really liking them.</li>
            <li>: these are really made for toenails.</li>
            <li>I have a couple other of Veluxio Naturals products, and I just love those.</li>
            <li>For large toenails, the clipper was barely adequate compared to this much larger scissors</li>
            <li>He always complains about other clippers not being strong enough or not cutting right.</li>
            <li>husband has super gross feet.</li>
            <li>Great for the little sharp points that start to grow in the sides of our toes..</li>
            <li>Works as expected, good heavy duty clipper.</li>
            <li>My husband also gets hard, dead skin around the edges of this toenails, with care, I am able to clip those off with these easily as well.</li>
            <li>My husband has used these multiple times now and absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>and it just isn&#x27;t sharp or angled enough to cut through a fine nail like on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He is not a fan because he&#x27;s super ticklish and thinks everything hurts, but he lets me to a degree.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I mention my husband is because they are AMAZING for cutting his crazy long (and THICK) toenails and getting them to an nice rounded top instead of leaving the sides squared with the top, which is where all the black stuff from his socks resides.</li>
            <li>Got me a white lab coat at the local thrift shop, got bottles of iodine, peroxide, bactine, a can of Backwoods OFF, a couple of gooseneck lamps with high intensity bulbs and one of them boxes of 120 band-aids that they sell @</li>

            <li> Terrible. They are HUGE and terrible. They are no name and not branded... The worst.</li>
            <li> Great for the little sharp points that start to grow in the sides of our toes.. I use them on both my husband and myself, because it seems like this is always happening to us when we wear shoes for prolonged periods of time. My husband also gets hard, dead skin around the edges of this toenails, with care, I am able to clip those off with these easily as well. These are really good and really sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I was afforded the opportunity to review these Veluxio Naturals Toenail Nippers in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. I have a couple other of Veluxio Naturals products, and I just love those. These toenail nippers are made entirely of stainless steel. They are very sharp, so be careful. I am used to the clipper style toenail cutters. My mom uses this type only. It The handle is very comfortable to hold and use. It just takes a little bit of practice to get used to it. With this pair, you have to move the spring into position to use them. Just flip it up to the inside of the handle and you are ready to go. Thank you..;)</li>
            <li> the clipper edges do not come together well...thus do not clip ones nails but just smushes them...not worth the buy and I will just throw them away since they are useless</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, it wouldn&#x27;t even cut paper.</li>
            <li> Too small for a man&#x27;s use. I should have sent them back............</li>
            <li> These are very sharp. They are made of  stainless steel. I have noticed they will handle the heavy duty clipping for thick toe nails. I would suggest to soak your feet first. I have used these on someone who drinks a lot of milk and nails have broken pairs of my clippers before. If you know someone like that get these to make it so much easier to clip their nails. I have not noticed any dulling to my nippers. I love they will stay mildew proof as I am allergic to mildew. Just remember to be careful when handling these they will cut you if not careful. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> These Veluxio Toenail Nippers finally solved my problem! My toenails are very thick and strong,; I have tried other clippers, but they did not work. This item REALLY does the job! Now I do not have to pay for a pedicure just to have my nails clipped! Thank you for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> item shipped was not the one depicted in photos, no where is the name Veluxio on the clippers, jaws do open 1&amp;#34; wide, maybe 5/8&amp;#34; at best, they are small, about 3 1/2&amp;#34; long with the cutting head part being only 1/2&amp;#34; long. They do cut thick nails however, I just do not like substitutions for a questionable product, though seemingly well made, that is supposedly name brand. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price and does the job. Can also be used for toy dogs toenails. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For large toenails, the clipper was barely adequate compared to this much larger scissors</li>
            <li> All I gotta say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;. The reverse curve on the cutting blades make this the perfect toenail cutting device ever.  A family member who wishes to remain anonymous for obvious reasons had toenails so long and curved and thick that she coulda perched on a stick like a parrot!  It was either the Texas Toenail Massacre using a chain saw or find some more reasonable device used by knowledgeable medical professionals. Boy, am I good!  Got me a white lab coat at the local thrift shop, got bottles of iodine, peroxide, bactine, a can of Backwoods OFF, a couple of gooseneck lamps with high intensity bulbs and one of them boxes of 120 band-aids that they sell @ Wally Mart. The nippers arrived the same day and I prepared the operating theatre and invited the victim. er, patient to inspect the arrangement. After she recovered from her first impression, I proceeded to put the nippers to work. I was duly impressed.  You can use these nippers to cut the cables on the Brooklyn Bridge!  The bad news is, now that her feet appear almost human again, she wants to fill her closet with sandals. Seriously though, this is one tough mojo - it really works - WELL</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, better for small shrubs</li>
            <li> I have large hands and they were easy to use.</li>
            <li> finally something that does the trick</li>
            <li> Works as expected, good heavy duty clipper.</li>
            <li> Fast service and an excellent product.</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty Toenail Nippers. They do a great job and I am really liking them. They should last a very long time because of the durability. They are nice and sharp so it makes them easier to use.  I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have seen these being used on my toes when I get a pedicure, but I have never used them myself before now. I wasn&#x27;t sure how easy they would be to hold and clip, but they worked wonderfully. I am glad that I got the opportunity to try these for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are very easy to grip and hold in my hand while clipping my toenails.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are very well made and durable, so I didn&#x27;t feel like they were going to break even while pushing hard on the handles.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect to clip the edges of my toenails. Regular toenail cutters don&#x27;t get the edges the way I like them to. I can easily fit these in the top edge of my toenail because of the way they are curved.&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp and it didn&#x27;t take much effort to clip my toenails.</li>
            <li> Did not cut thick toe nails even with extreme hand pressure!</li>
            <li> These are great! (gross out warning)&lt;br /&gt;My husband has super gross feet. He never does anything to take care of them. He actually told me it was normal to have black stuff under your toenails and he clips them like twice per YEAR. NO LIE. I&#x27;m afraid of him losing his feet to infection, so I have started begging him to let me care for his feet some. He is not a fan because he&#x27;s super ticklish and thinks everything hurts, but he lets me to a degree.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I mention my husband is because they are AMAZING for cutting his crazy long (and THICK) toenails and getting them to an nice rounded top instead of leaving the sides squared with the top, which is where all the black stuff from his socks resides. He actually only complains about tickling-not pain-when I use these on him. Great design!&lt;br /&gt;Note: these are really made for toenails. I did a test on fingernails and it just isn&#x27;t sharp or angled enough to cut through a fine nail like on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Cuts very poorly. Not at all sharp. Cannot get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I received these toenail nippers in exchange of my honest review. They arrived in perfect shape and are very strong and sturdy. These will cut any ones nails thin or thick. My husband has used these multiple times now and absolutely loves them. He always complains about other clippers not being strong enough or not cutting right.</li>
