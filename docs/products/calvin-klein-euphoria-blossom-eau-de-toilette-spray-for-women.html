            <li>I smelled this at a department store and loved it but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $70 - $75 for it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, a very fresh feminine scent ...</li>
            <li>I love this perfume a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, elegant and lil sweet.</li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s just the perfect different scent that i normally wear at night, not too strong, i just love it..</li>
            <li>i absolutely love the scent and it arrived right on time.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li>Fav is original.  </li>
            <li>plus it was in its original boz not even used...</li>
            <li>and I loved it, but I did not think it was right for my new spring/ summer scent...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell that is not too over powering.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sweet and soft smell.  </li>
            <li>This is extremely light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>thanks to my love</li>
            <li>smells sooooo good, like a cologne but for women, obviously...</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I went to Amazon&#x27;s website and realized that it was available for almost half the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be my new Signature scent:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, very feminine scent, and I receive compliments literally every time I wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely scent , soft and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell is very flowery and makes you feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>There is really nothing much to write about a perfume, just that it has a very inviting and refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>if you are in the least bit worried about whether the scent smells great, it absolutely smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>A little more flowery, but not an overwhelming amount.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day....not so strong and not so soft.</li>
            <li>I love the light fragrance and so do a lot of other people.</li>
            <li>The initial notes of this perfume are lily of the valley, which I love.  </li>
            <li>It has a scent similar to DG&#x27;s &amp;#34;Light Blue,&amp;#34; in that it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;clean musk&amp;#34; type of smell.  </li>
            <li>this for me is better suited for work rather than specail occasions where I might want to make a bigger statement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the first times</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful scent, soft not over powering and very feminine&lt;br /&gt;Great for a young woman</li>
            <li>Its the real deal!</li>
            <li>This is the best scent out of all 3 Euphoria perfumes (at least I think there are only 3).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available for only $39.61, and it smells just as fresh as it did in the store.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered in time at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume I have use for a long time</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original Euphoria but that OK with my body.</li>
            <li>; top notes contain Kumquat,Orchid blossom &amp; Pink peony which makes it much sweeter.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try Euphoria Blossom</li>
            <li>My fiance absolutely loves this scent.</li>
            <li>I have the original Euphoria in the smaller bottle which I paid $50 for at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The blossum is a little more flowery and a little less musky and a very good fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it is very evident that they are different.</li>
            <li>Would HIGHLY recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>But it was worth it to finally find it!  </li>
            <li>Live as signature sent.  </li>
            <li>The regular Euphoria smells too much like cologne and has a very &amp;#34;alcohol-y&amp;#34; scent, and the Forbidden Euphoria</li>
            <li>I actually am very sensitive to scents to the point of nausea</li>
            <li>Off and on, I have using  original Euphoria for years and have tried the many other variations of Euphoria, but Euphoria Blossom is definitely not a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Pomegranate, Persimmon &amp; &amp;#34;Lush Green Accord&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>but the Blossom just has a little something extra that&#x27;s really appealing.</li>
            <li>smells too much like a teenage girl.  </li>
            <li>I actually used the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not super sweet</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is very sensual and lasts a long time on my body.  </li>
            <li>I have some left from the old bottle</li>
            <li>I really like Euphoria but wanted something a little lighter but still a floral</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wasted my money on the other two versions of Euphoria first.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it isn&#x27;t very common, so your scent is distinct.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this from somewhere a long time ago, and it took me forever to figure out that this was the one I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li> Stays in your skin almost all day long.</li>
            <li> It seems a little lighter than the regular Euphoria scent.  </li>
            <li> Not able to buy locally.  </li>
            <li> so I tracked it down on amazon and the no one else</li>
            <li> I have received a few compliments at work for this.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money...</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I finished my old bottle of discontinued perfume.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that this bottle does not smell the same as the original bottle that I was hoping to replace.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the Smell doesn&#x27;t stay on :(</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been so hard to find!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am allergic to something in the heavier floral scents that are underneath.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad it has been dicontinued.</li>
            <li> It had a faint unpleasant odor, so I used it once and threw it in the trash.  </li>
            <li> So sad that ia not being produced anymore :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is almost impossible to write a review for a scent because everyone&#x27;s body chemicals are different.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this fragrance! So sad that ia not being produced anymore :(</li>
            <li> The initial notes of this perfume are lily of the valley, which I love.  Unfortunately, I am allergic to something in the heavier floral scents that are underneath.  A terrific perfume that I sometimes wear anyway.</li>
            <li> My hubby brought me a sampler of different perfumes that he purchased on a trip back from overseas.  This was my favorite, so set out on a search to buy more.  I have since purchase 3 big bottles from Amazon.  Best price and since this scent is discontinued, I believe, am very happy to be able to stock up.  It&#x27;s a light, very feminine scent, and I receive compliments literally every time I wear.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, elegant and lil sweet. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original Euphoria but that OK with my body. It brings me comfort, confidence and many compliments from others :)&lt;br /&gt;Try it once and u&#x27;ll never regret</li>
            <li> I smelled this at a department store and loved it but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $70 - $75 for it. I was so happy when I went to Amazon&#x27;s website and realized that it was available for almost half the price. Great deal.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing much to write about a perfume, just that it has a very inviting and refreshing fragrance. Surely gives Davidoff coolwater a run for money. I got it for my wife on her birthday and she Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Must buy!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect scent for me. I continuously have friends and strangers ask me what perfume I have on.  Shipping was fast and packaging and bottle were in perfect condition.  I will probably continue to buy my perfume here as opposed to a department or discount store.</li>
            <li> This is the best scent out of all 3 Euphoria perfumes (at least I think there are only 3).  The regular Euphoria smells too much like cologne and has a very &amp;#34;alcohol-y&amp;#34; scent, and the Forbidden Euphoria smells too much like a teenage girl.  This is extremely light and fresh.  It has a scent similar to DG&#x27;s &amp;#34;Light Blue,&amp;#34; in that it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;clean musk&amp;#34; type of smell.  I had received a sample of this from somewhere a long time ago, and it took me forever to figure out that this was the one I had been looking for.  I wasted my money on the other two versions of Euphoria first.  But it was worth it to finally find it!  I like it because it isn&#x27;t very common, so your scent is distinct.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragrance after trying it at a cosmetics store, but didn&#x27;t want to have to pay $70 for it.  After searching online, I found that here on Amazon it&#x27;s available for only $39.61, and it smells just as fresh as it did in the store.  Definitely worth the buy, don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> I have received a few compliments at work for this. I categorised my perfumes based on scents..this for me is better suited for work rather than specail occasions where I might want to make a bigger statement. Smells good and is recommended to buy.</li>
            <li> I was trying to order different Euphoria that daughter had and mistakenly ordered this one.  This is a Nice, pleasant fragrance.  Pleased with price and scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of the great price, but when I received it, it did not smell like the ones in the store.  It had a faint unpleasant odor, so I used it once and threw it in the trash.  What a waste of money...</li>
            <li> very good quality nice smell my customers loved it will definetely buy again</li>
            <li> I love the smell i got it as a gift wrap and everything smells good :) thanks to my love</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift from my husband&#x27;s cousin and fell in love... so I tracked it down on amazon and the no one else can beat the price</li>
            <li> Perfect fragrance for me.  Price was excellent.  Not able to buy locally.  Amazon always a good  and easy place to shop.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I finished my old bottle of discontinued perfume.  Appreciate Amazon for offering a great deal!</li>
            <li> I like smell of it I have it for men myself ,its the best that&#x27;s out there for me fantastic!</li>
            <li> this was a great purchase!!!  i absolutely love the scent and it arrived right on time.  if you are in the least bit worried about whether the scent smells great, it absolutely smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> smells sooooo good, like a cologne but for women, obviously... it&#x27;s not super sweet, it&#x27;s just the perfect different scent that i normally wear at night, not too strong, i just love it.. i like it more than the original euphoria by calvin klein!!! it smells wonderful, i like it a lot and wear it often.</li>
            <li> Great price cheaper than overstock thank you for this great deal going to buy euphoria once again thank you everyone love the fragrance</li>
            <li> I have the original Euphoria in the smaller bottle which I paid $50 for at Macy&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s one of the first times I actually used the whole bottle.  I really wanted to try Euphoria Blossom and when I saw the price and the fact the bottle was a lot bigger than the Euphoria I had I needed to get it.  I love the smell of both but the Blossom just has a little something extra that&#x27;s really appealing.</li>
            <li> Love, LoVe, LOVE this perfume.  Great price and quick shipping through Amazon.com.  Would HIGHLY recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful scent, soft not over powering and very feminine&lt;br /&gt;Great for a young woman</li>
            <li> The staying power on this perfume, not that great! After an hour the scent is gone! Not for me!&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
            <li> I love this edt spray.I really like Euphoria but wanted something a little lighter but still a floral and this is the one! it really is a very nice fragrance glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that this bottle does not smell the same as the original bottle that I was hoping to replace. I have some left from the old bottle and it is very evident that they are different. Perhaps it has been reformulated but that should have been indicated. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it every day....not so strong and not so soft. Stays in your skin almost all day long. I love it!</li>
            <li> It has a nice sweet and soft smell.  Nice spring scent.  I prefer the traditional Euphoria personally after using both.</li>
            <li> plan on ordering more</li>
            <li> I love love love the smell of this. I&#x27;m so sad it has been dicontinued.</li>
            <li> I now have 3 euphoria a to alternate.  Great price/ value.  Fav is original.  I will alt with floral and save forbidden for evening.  Live as signature sent.  I actually am very sensitive to scents to the point of nausea and I love these.  I used to loathe eternity on my boy friend years ago.  I have a signature scent again!  Bravo CK</li>
            <li> Received on time and paid a great price!</li>
            <li> It is floral, not as strong as the original Euphoria, I think it is perfect for the spring and summer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the Euphoria blossom for a while now but I cannot find it in stores anymore because they have discontinued it.  The smell is very flowery and makes you feel fresh and clean.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite scent.  I got exactly what I ordered in time at a reasonable price.  Excellent scent!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, a very fresh feminine scent ... My only complaint is that the Smell doesn&#x27;t stay on :(</li>
            <li> My fiance absolutely loves this scent. I must say I&#x27;m quite the fan myself. It&#x27;s a clean smell that is not too over powering.</li>
            <li> very nice light floral scent , very good price .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:none .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price is a great deal. I am recommending it for every one who likes floral scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume I have use for a long time and I didn&#x27;t get no smell on my bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> I try to change perfumes with the seasons and I have been looking for something new.&lt;br /&gt;I had a scent strip for regular Euphoria perfume in a magazine and I loved it, but I did not think it was right for my new spring/ summer scent... so on a whim, I took a chance on the Blossom version without even a sample.  I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is almost impossible to write a review for a scent because everyone&#x27;s body chemicals are different.&lt;br /&gt;But that being said, give this scent a try.  It seems a little lighter than the regular Euphoria scent.  A little more flowery, but not an overwhelming amount.  I will be buying this scent again when this bottle is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very sensual and lasts a long time on my body.  I have gotten plenty of compliments by both men and women on this perfume, even as the day has worn on.&lt;br /&gt;The pink frosted bottle is absolutely beautiful and looks attractive on your dresser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely scent , soft and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it all the time. I get so many complement.&lt;br /&gt;It may be my new Signature scent:)</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Its the real deal!</li>
            <li> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</li>
            <li> I was more then satisfy it smells very good plus it was in its original boz not even used... And well when i ran out im going to purchased more ♥♥</li>
            <li> I have always loved calvin klein euporia.  The blossum is a little more flowery and a little less musky and a very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Off and on, I have using  original Euphoria for years and have tried the many other variations of Euphoria, but Euphoria Blossom is definitely not a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Pomegranate, Persimmon &amp; &amp;#34;Lush Green Accord&amp;#34;  top notes of Euphoria, &amp;#34;Euphoria Blossom&#x27;s&amp;#34; top notes contain Kumquat,Orchid blossom &amp; Pink peony which makes it much sweeter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifer of Calvin Klein and all Euphoria products! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. I love the light fragrance and so do a lot of other people. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Excelente servicio, recib&amp;iacute; mi perfume en perfectas condiciones, y fue una muy buena elecci&amp;oacute;n huele muy bien... Recomendado 100%. Desde Venezuela</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been so hard to find! It&#x27;s one of the only perfumes that I have finished and needed another.</li>
            <li> great buy, great service</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the scent of the perfume. Very soft and pleasant. If you want a  perfume that will last this is the one.</li>
