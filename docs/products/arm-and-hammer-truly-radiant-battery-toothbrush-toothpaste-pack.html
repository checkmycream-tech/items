    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product does an excellent job in cleaning all areas of your mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome gift set for someone who has never tried an electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: a great gift set to switch over a manual brush user!</li>
            <li>Excellent value on a pair of electric toothbrushes with 2 spare brush heads and a tube of Arm &amp; Hammer</li>
            <li>Both my dentist and hygienist were SO HAPPY!!  </li>
            <li>EXCELLENT set!</li>
            <li>then I fell in love with this set!!!  </li>
            <li>: The toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li>My kids were thrilled to both get one, plus toothpaste, plus replacement heads!</li>
            <li>For the price, I think that this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>It is a good size but a bit noisy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price, it does what it should.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is excellent for removing plaque and getting a deeper clean than a manual brush could offer.</li>
            <li>I think for most folks this would be a great product.</li>
            <li>for the toothpaste included in the set, that&#x27;s my favorite part!</li>
            <li>They seem to work perfectly well and the body fits nicely in your hand, with a simple on/off slider conveniently located under your thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, perfectly good brushes and great for taking on a trip or something where you don&#x27;t want to be waiting for anything to recharge.</li>
            <li>It would also be nice to have a cap to cover the brush head when not in use.</li>
            <li>think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product.</li>
            <li>think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product.</li>
            <li>Over all I find it to be a quite nice and affordable &amp;#34;electric-like&amp;#34; (aka battery) toothbrush system.</li>
            <li>, while I like the convenience of buying the two pack toothbrushes, two replacement heads, and the toothpaste in one shot, I question why anyone would want to purchase it in a set when buying everything individually is more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I am not exaggerating when I say that this is a  HUGE improvement over the toothbrush and toothpaste that I have been using - and I&#x27;ve always been good about brushing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my own homemade blend for years and this tastes so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Truly Radiant Toothbrush set works well for the cost, and when using along with a good flossing, my teeth feel wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li>For those who want a long-term solution, invest upmarket to Sonicare or Oral B&#x27;s more robust electric toothbrush options.</li>
            <li>and it does work better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a refreshing flavor as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to a manual brush, it is still much, much better.</li>
            <li>These electric toothbrushes work as well as ones that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>Like most electric/battery powered toothbrushes</li>
            <li>though not my favorite brand...was actually ok.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It was a family favorite.</li>
            <li>Apparently many people don&#x27;t buy electric toothbrushes because the electric toothbrush  &amp; replacement heads cost  quite a</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>The brushes are kind of on the noisy side for electric toothbrushes, but it&#x27;s not annoying or anything.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the batteries may take more oomph that you anticipate.  </li>
            <li>now!I seriously LOVE how clean my teeth feel now!</li>
            <li>Easy to power with AA batteries (included), the spinning motion of these brushes give a nice even clean throughout the mouth.</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find Brilliant Sparkle anymore, I purchased Advance White Extreme Whitening (I liked their Brilliant Sparkle formula better).  </li>
            <li>The brushes work great and really leave your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>used Arm &amp; Hammer Brilliant Sparkle toothpaste for several years.</li>
            <li>I find that they are more thorough and consistent than my own brushing motion.  </li>
            <li>had loads of fun with it...and in the end...said she really liked the way it cleaned.</li>
            <li>But I seriously LOVE how clean my teeth feel</li>
            <li>and they are easy to install.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste does not have a strong flavor, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much I liked the toothpaste!</li>
            <li>toothpaste is fine.  </li>
            <li>The bristles quickly rotate to get teeth very clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my dental hygienist didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference between the Spinbrush (which was what I used before sonicare) and my sonicare, I&#x27;d rather use the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We really enjoy the spinbrush set.</li>
            <li>Toothbrushes:&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes in this kit use two AA batteries (included) that fit in the handle.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t available for purchase yet (8/22/15), so I don&#x27;t know if you will have a choice of colors.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t available for purchase yet (8/22/15), so I don&#x27;t know if you will have a choice of colors.</li>
            <li>I have vertigo and, honestly, this thing vibrates my whole face</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as advanced as say a Sonic Care</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush does a fine job of getting teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Toothpaste included has a very fresh minted flavor.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel fresh and clean after brushing for a looong tme!</li>
            <li>WINNER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(end update, original review</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re familiar with Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste</li>
            <li>This toothbrush makes my teeth feel just as clean as if I just went to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the complete set.</li>
            <li>With kids in braces, finding a brush the helps them get the surface of their teeth clean is a must.</li>
            <li>Spinbrush Radiant toothbrush gets my teeth just as clean as the Phillips Powerup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Truly Radiant and will update my review if I have a more radiant smile in 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Truly Radiant also strengthens your tooth</li>
            <li>much as I like the toothbrush, I like the toothpaste even better.</li>
            <li>Overall a good experience.</li>
            <li>Overall a good experience.</li>
            <li>this is probably not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>this is probably not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>The clean feeling in my mouth is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may consider ordering more but that will likely mostly be determined by price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m sure this will be normal after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think they do a good enough job cleaning but again are considerably louder and offer a more jarring brushing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Spinbrushes in the past and LOVED them!</li>
            <li>The brushes do a very good job, compatible with more expensive brushes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the top brushes of the head being bent somewhat due to shipping (the plastic was pushed in), the brush itself was comfortable, and easy to remove for replacing.  </li>
            <li>It is a step below Sonicare, but also far more affordable the the premier electric brushes.</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush Truly Radiant Regimen pack is a nice starter set if you&#x27;re making the move from traditional manual toothbrushes to something electric.  </li>
            <li>After two days I have had zero bleeding even after using it when I ate popcorn, which is when they are most sensitive.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was not as thrilled with this as I hoped.</li>
            <li>but I will say I did get a comment on my smile this week</li>
            <li>The extra replacement heads are nice.</li>
            <li>The use factor seems very positive though.</li>
            <li>I gave my grandkids (ages 4 &amp; 5) a child&#x27;s battery operated toothbrush, they were really excited &amp; told their parents how much cleaner their teeth</li>
            <li>From the first time using this toothbrush I found my teeth feeling extra clean and smooth, the paste says you&#x27;ll see whiter teeth in just 5 days!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, and because the head size is fairly large, I&#x27;m able to get all my teeth clean very well.  </li>
            <li>That is very much the case here with the brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li>They both told me to keep using the new toothbrush, and keep using the new brand of toothpaste, because my teeth are so much better than before!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also think that this particular toothpaste, because it’s a tiny bit grainy, might not be liked by everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush head consists of a a spinning spherical brush on top and an oblong bottom that goes back and forth.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t used a Sonicare first, I would likely be just as pleased with the spinbrush as my husband is</li>
            <li>I needn&#x27;t have worried as it has more than enough power.</li>
            <li>She could tell the difference that my teeth were much cleaner, my gums were healthier!  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell for sure if they are whiter, but my teeth definitely feel CLEANER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was her first battery powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>first thing</li>
            <li>These are nice little toothbrushes, they&#x27;ve got two groups of bristles which both &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; or oscillate quickly.  </li>
            <li>The two different colored toothbrushes (a his &amp; hers kind of deal) was a small, but nice touch.</li>
            <li>I like the way you can put the brush part over the top of the tooth  &amp; clean it straight down to the gums.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m brushing a greater area so in the two minutes I take to brush, I&#x27;m covering more &amp;#34;ground&amp;#34; than I do with the Sonicare which has a very small, almost child sized rectangular brush area.</li>
            <li>I really like the baking soda and peroxide toothpaste &amp;#34;Truly Radiant&amp;#34; this was the first time I&#x27;ve ever used it.</li>
            <li>so I was concerned as to whether it would be strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>As for the battery operated brushes, I have a large mouth</li>
            <li>They actually look forward to brushing with their new spin brush, and even I can tell that their teeth are very clean.  </li>
            <li>She consulted my chart and said &amp;#34;Not too much.</li>
            <li>Also, the Spinbrushes don&#x27;t make me want to sneeze and are not so intense as to be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth were much whiter after just one brushing but that may have had just as much to do with the brushes.</li>
            <li>the electric ones really DO leave your teeth feeling cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>It brushes very well.</li>
            <li>wife really likes the toothbrush because she says that it makes her teeth feel almost like she just came from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how they compare with battery operated toothbrushes; however, battery operated toothbrushes get my teeth much cleaner than manually brushing them.  </li>
            <li>I mentioned that I was using a battery operated toothbrush to my dental hygenist, she asked how much the replacement heads were.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re light but sturdy and the batteries last forever.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set which includes two different color coded power toothbrushes with batteries, plus two extra brudh heads, plus a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am not sure how it compares to other electric brushes, but I do know I find this particular toothbrush and paste to be excellent.</li>
            <li>But for me, I don&#x27;t like holding objects for long that have strong, intense vibrations, and two minutes can seem like a lifetime when something is uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed some reviewers received one blue toothbrush &amp; one green.h, they were really excited &amp; told their parents how much cleaner their teeth felt.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tootpaste itself tastes more like baking soda than mint, but at least it leaves the mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>feeling cleaner than many of the other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On Amazon, purchasing two  [[ASIN:B00J42G2UW Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean, Colors May Vary]] and one [[ASIN:B001U9JY8O Spinbrush Sonic Power</li>
            <li>when I was finished, my teeth felt SO CLEAN, like I had just left the dentist!  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful about using Arm and Hammer toothpaste due to gums receding, but the taste of the paste is pretty good</li>
            <li>My new fave!</li>
            <li>I mainly tasted a baking soda/peroxide taste.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to try an electric toothbrush, and my seven-year-old daughter loves her Monster High one.</li>
            <li>The brushes in this set, which actually do have spinning brush heads, were an upgrade to his first electric toothbrush and he loves it!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a 4.3 oz Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, though it doesn&#x27;t matter much what toothpaste is used unless you have particular dental issues (sensitive gums, enamel decay, etc.).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not familiar with brushing with Arm &amp; Hammer products then just be aware that these pastes feature baking soda as a primary ingredient.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Spinbrush and most likely that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Spinbrush and most likely that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt fresher than with our normal paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are well used to electric toothbrushes or intense, rough cleanings, you&#x27;ll likely have a better experience.</li>
            <li>He also prefers harder bristles, and this brush was just right for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, however, received a Philips Sonicare as my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so the brush heads (*which are larger than my daughters Sonicare electric toothbrush) fit fine into my adult size mouth but for a young child these would be too big for their smaller mouths.</li>
            <li>or they came out with a new style that I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or they came out with a new style that I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anybody looking for a toothbrush like this that can live with the noise.</li>
            <li>The brush heads clean two different ways, the top round brush spins while the lower brush goes back and forth.</li>
            <li>Mine is still working, but the battery is only half as powerful as it originally was.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I found this to be too powerful for me, which can be good if you want a daily cleaning like you&#x27;re at your dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>, the other part rotates in a circular motion, and my teeth are CLEAN.</li>
            <li>you tend not to accumulate scale at an above average rate like I do, maybe the sonicare would help you better</li>
            <li>you tend not to accumulate scale at an above average rate like I do, maybe the sonicare would help you better</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced, I can easily find the replacement heads where I live and I like not having to charge them and especially since there is only one lonely plugin in my bathroom</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced, I can easily find the replacement heads where I live and I like not having to charge them and especially since there is only one lonely plugin in my bathroom</li>
            <li>I am not sure if that is why is seems significantly more powerful than the current brush I am using or if there is a larger motor in this brush or a combination of both.  </li>
            <li>Despite this, Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Spinbrush offers practical way to improve your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>like the Sonicare well enough except it&#x27;s intense and when I brush the backs of my front teeth, I have to hold the bridge of my nose because the vibration will make me want to sneeze</li>
            <li>set includes Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste (which we really like), two brushes and two extra heads</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is gentle to your teeth but at the same time cleans perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sensitive gums that sometimes bleed when I brush them vigorously.</li>
            <li>The bristles themselves ar what I would deem &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; I would have preferred a soft or a medium at the hardest so for hat</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like the product, and I like that they sell a complete package with backup heads and even package it with a decent-sized tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste has a distinct flavor that sort of gave me an after taste that was not as expected for a mint flavor, hence the 4 star.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the brush is very loud in an unpleasant way, but for the price, it&#x27;s a very good deal I think.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s product page currently doesn&#x27;t have a price (item is unavailable) but looking at other retailers this does seem to fit within the budget conscious market of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s product page currently doesn&#x27;t have a price (item is unavailable) but looking at other retailers this does seem to fit within the budget conscious market of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; paste is bland - not bad, just not minty that I could</li>
            <li>so this will last me probably about 5-6 months before I have to buy more heads and in the past</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about that claim but am pleased with the performance given the low cost compared to Philips Sonicare or Oral-B PRO.</li>
            <li>It took a few brushings for me to get used to the slightly &#x27;salty&#x27; flavor – I assume from the baking soda and/or peroxide – but, once I did, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>The vibration is pretty low, lower than a more expensive model that I have, and that I really like, the vibration can be irritating, so less is better!</li>
            <li>I never expected that a new toothbrush and toothpaste could make such a difference.  </li>
            <li>That said, this is not nearly as good as a Sonicare level toothbrush - but for the price range, this is a lot better than using a manual or tiny headed Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The heads last me a really long time, they really hold up well.  </li>
            <li>The batteries themselves seemed slick, which makes me wonder how secure the compartment is from moisture, and worries me that the brush won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud enough that it might wake up your spouse if they&#x27;re still asleep while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li>The only reason for a four rather than a five star rating is because it is so loud, loud enough to wake my wife up when I used it before I went to bed.</li>
            <li>The common theme with these types of electric brushes are that they&#x27;re generally a bit larger and more noisy than the more refined (and expensive) brands like Oral B and Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works very well</li>
            <li>The only reason this means anything to me now is that my dentist recently insisted I switch from a medium toothbrush to a soft bristle because my gums are receding.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the greatest taste and made my wife a little sick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say right off the bat that if you&#x27;re already using an electric toothbrush there&#x27;s very little reason to switch to this kit unless you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►</li>
            <li>I put the toothpaste on the brush and turned it on and the stuff vibrated right off, so I knew I might be in trouble!</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud, but not much more than my OralB 4000 at home and not so much that you cannot tolerate it for two minutes.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s missing relative to the higher end alternatives is a timer.</li>
            <li>As I write this, it is five hours since I brushed, and my teeth still feel cleaner than they ever used to (except for the first few days after visiting the dentist).&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, though, it was a little too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product does an excellent job in cleaning all areas of your mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome gift set for someone who has never tried an electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: a great gift set to switch over a manual brush user!</li>
            <li> Excellent value on a pair of electric toothbrushes with 2 spare brush heads and a tube of Arm &amp; Hammer</li>
            <li> Both my dentist and hygienist were SO HAPPY!!  </li>
            <li> EXCELLENT set!</li>
            <li> then I fell in love with this set!!!  </li>
            <li> : The toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li> My kids were thrilled to both get one, plus toothpaste, plus replacement heads!</li>
            <li> For the price, I think that this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> It is a good size but a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price, it does what it should.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is excellent for removing plaque and getting a deeper clean than a manual brush could offer.</li>
            <li> I think for most folks this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> for the toothpaste included in the set, that&#x27;s my favorite part!</li>
            <li> They seem to work perfectly well and the body fits nicely in your hand, with a simple on/off slider conveniently located under your thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, perfectly good brushes and great for taking on a trip or something where you don&#x27;t want to be waiting for anything to recharge.</li>
            <li> It would also be nice to have a cap to cover the brush head when not in use.</li>
            <li> think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product.</li>
            <li> think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product.</li>
            <li> Over all I find it to be a quite nice and affordable &amp;#34;electric-like&amp;#34; (aka battery) toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> , while I like the convenience of buying the two pack toothbrushes, two replacement heads, and the toothpaste in one shot, I question why anyone would want to purchase it in a set when buying everything individually is more cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say that this is a  HUGE improvement over the toothbrush and toothpaste that I have been using - and I&#x27;ve always been good about brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my own homemade blend for years and this tastes so much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Truly Radiant Toothbrush set works well for the cost, and when using along with a good flossing, my teeth feel wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li> For those who want a long-term solution, invest upmarket to Sonicare or Oral B&#x27;s more robust electric toothbrush options.</li>
            <li> and it does work better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a refreshing flavor as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to a manual brush, it is still much, much better.</li>
            <li> These electric toothbrushes work as well as ones that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> Like most electric/battery powered toothbrushes</li>
            <li> though not my favorite brand...was actually ok.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It was a family favorite.</li>
            <li> Apparently many people don&#x27;t buy electric toothbrushes because the electric toothbrush  &amp; replacement heads cost  quite a</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more</li>
            <li> The brushes are kind of on the noisy side for electric toothbrushes, but it&#x27;s not annoying or anything.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the batteries may take more oomph that you anticipate.  </li>
            <li> now!I seriously LOVE how clean my teeth feel now!</li>
            <li> Easy to power with AA batteries (included), the spinning motion of these brushes give a nice even clean throughout the mouth.</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find Brilliant Sparkle anymore, I purchased Advance White Extreme Whitening (I liked their Brilliant Sparkle formula better).  </li>
            <li> The brushes work great and really leave your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> used Arm &amp; Hammer Brilliant Sparkle toothpaste for several years.</li>
            <li> I find that they are more thorough and consistent than my own brushing motion.  </li>
            <li> had loads of fun with it...and in the end...said she really liked the way it cleaned.</li>
            <li> But I seriously LOVE how clean my teeth feel</li>
            <li> and they are easy to install.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste does not have a strong flavor, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how much I liked the toothpaste!</li>
            <li> toothpaste is fine.  </li>
            <li> The bristles quickly rotate to get teeth very clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my dental hygienist didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference between the Spinbrush (which was what I used before sonicare) and my sonicare, I&#x27;d rather use the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We really enjoy the spinbrush set.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes:&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes in this kit use two AA batteries (included) that fit in the handle.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t available for purchase yet (8/22/15), so I don&#x27;t know if you will have a choice of colors.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t available for purchase yet (8/22/15), so I don&#x27;t know if you will have a choice of colors.</li>
            <li> I have vertigo and, honestly, this thing vibrates my whole face</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as advanced as say a Sonic Care</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush does a fine job of getting teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothpaste included has a very fresh minted flavor.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel fresh and clean after brushing for a looong tme!</li>
            <li> WINNER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(end update, original review</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re familiar with Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth feel just as clean as if I just went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the complete set.</li>
            <li> With kids in braces, finding a brush the helps them get the surface of their teeth clean is a must.</li>
            <li> Spinbrush Radiant toothbrush gets my teeth just as clean as the Phillips Powerup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Truly Radiant and will update my review if I have a more radiant smile in 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Truly Radiant also strengthens your tooth</li>
            <li> much as I like the toothbrush, I like the toothpaste even better.</li>
            <li> Overall a good experience.</li>
            <li> Overall a good experience.</li>
            <li> this is probably not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> this is probably not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> The clean feeling in my mouth is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may consider ordering more but that will likely mostly be determined by price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m sure this will be normal after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think they do a good enough job cleaning but again are considerably louder and offer a more jarring brushing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Spinbrushes in the past and LOVED them!</li>
            <li> The brushes do a very good job, compatible with more expensive brushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the top brushes of the head being bent somewhat due to shipping (the plastic was pushed in), the brush itself was comfortable, and easy to remove for replacing.  </li>
            <li> It is a step below Sonicare, but also far more affordable the the premier electric brushes.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush Truly Radiant Regimen pack is a nice starter set if you&#x27;re making the move from traditional manual toothbrushes to something electric.  </li>
            <li> After two days I have had zero bleeding even after using it when I ate popcorn, which is when they are most sensitive.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was not as thrilled with this as I hoped.</li>
            <li> but I will say I did get a comment on my smile this week</li>
            <li> The extra replacement heads are nice.</li>
            <li> The use factor seems very positive though.</li>
            <li> I gave my grandkids (ages 4 &amp; 5) a child&#x27;s battery operated toothbrush, they were really excited &amp; told their parents how much cleaner their teeth</li>
            <li> From the first time using this toothbrush I found my teeth feeling extra clean and smooth, the paste says you&#x27;ll see whiter teeth in just 5 days!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, and because the head size is fairly large, I&#x27;m able to get all my teeth clean very well.  </li>
            <li> That is very much the case here with the brushes in this kit.</li>
            <li> They both told me to keep using the new toothbrush, and keep using the new brand of toothpaste, because my teeth are so much better than before!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also think that this particular toothpaste, because it’s a tiny bit grainy, might not be liked by everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush head consists of a a spinning spherical brush on top and an oblong bottom that goes back and forth.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t used a Sonicare first, I would likely be just as pleased with the spinbrush as my husband is</li>
            <li> I needn&#x27;t have worried as it has more than enough power.</li>
            <li> She could tell the difference that my teeth were much cleaner, my gums were healthier!  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell for sure if they are whiter, but my teeth definitely feel CLEANER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was her first battery powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> first thing</li>
            <li> These are nice little toothbrushes, they&#x27;ve got two groups of bristles which both &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; or oscillate quickly.  </li>
            <li> The two different colored toothbrushes (a his &amp; hers kind of deal) was a small, but nice touch.</li>
            <li> I like the way you can put the brush part over the top of the tooth  &amp; clean it straight down to the gums.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m brushing a greater area so in the two minutes I take to brush, I&#x27;m covering more &amp;#34;ground&amp;#34; than I do with the Sonicare which has a very small, almost child sized rectangular brush area.</li>
            <li> I really like the baking soda and peroxide toothpaste &amp;#34;Truly Radiant&amp;#34; this was the first time I&#x27;ve ever used it.</li>
            <li> so I was concerned as to whether it would be strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> As for the battery operated brushes, I have a large mouth</li>
            <li> They actually look forward to brushing with their new spin brush, and even I can tell that their teeth are very clean.  </li>
            <li> She consulted my chart and said &amp;#34;Not too much.</li>
            <li> Also, the Spinbrushes don&#x27;t make me want to sneeze and are not so intense as to be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth were much whiter after just one brushing but that may have had just as much to do with the brushes.</li>
            <li> the electric ones really DO leave your teeth feeling cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> It brushes very well.</li>
            <li> wife really likes the toothbrush because she says that it makes her teeth feel almost like she just came from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how they compare with battery operated toothbrushes; however, battery operated toothbrushes get my teeth much cleaner than manually brushing them.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned that I was using a battery operated toothbrush to my dental hygenist, she asked how much the replacement heads were.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re light but sturdy and the batteries last forever.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set which includes two different color coded power toothbrushes with batteries, plus two extra brudh heads, plus a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how it compares to other electric brushes, but I do know I find this particular toothbrush and paste to be excellent.</li>
            <li> But for me, I don&#x27;t like holding objects for long that have strong, intense vibrations, and two minutes can seem like a lifetime when something is uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviewers received one blue toothbrush &amp; one green.h, they were really excited &amp; told their parents how much cleaner their teeth felt.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tootpaste itself tastes more like baking soda than mint, but at least it leaves the mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> feeling cleaner than many of the other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On Amazon, purchasing two  [[ASIN:B00J42G2UW Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean, Colors May Vary]] and one [[ASIN:B001U9JY8O Spinbrush Sonic Power</li>
            <li> when I was finished, my teeth felt SO CLEAN, like I had just left the dentist!  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful about using Arm and Hammer toothpaste due to gums receding, but the taste of the paste is pretty good</li>
            <li> My new fave!</li>
            <li> I mainly tasted a baking soda/peroxide taste.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try an electric toothbrush, and my seven-year-old daughter loves her Monster High one.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set, which actually do have spinning brush heads, were an upgrade to his first electric toothbrush and he loves it!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a 4.3 oz Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, though it doesn&#x27;t matter much what toothpaste is used unless you have particular dental issues (sensitive gums, enamel decay, etc.).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with brushing with Arm &amp; Hammer products then just be aware that these pastes feature baking soda as a primary ingredient.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Spinbrush and most likely that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Spinbrush and most likely that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt fresher than with our normal paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are well used to electric toothbrushes or intense, rough cleanings, you&#x27;ll likely have a better experience.</li>
            <li> He also prefers harder bristles, and this brush was just right for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, however, received a Philips Sonicare as my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so the brush heads (*which are larger than my daughters Sonicare electric toothbrush) fit fine into my adult size mouth but for a young child these would be too big for their smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> or they came out with a new style that I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or they came out with a new style that I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anybody looking for a toothbrush like this that can live with the noise.</li>
            <li> The brush heads clean two different ways, the top round brush spins while the lower brush goes back and forth.</li>
            <li> Mine is still working, but the battery is only half as powerful as it originally was.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found this to be too powerful for me, which can be good if you want a daily cleaning like you&#x27;re at your dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> , the other part rotates in a circular motion, and my teeth are CLEAN.</li>
            <li> you tend not to accumulate scale at an above average rate like I do, maybe the sonicare would help you better</li>
            <li> you tend not to accumulate scale at an above average rate like I do, maybe the sonicare would help you better</li>
            <li> They are reasonably priced, I can easily find the replacement heads where I live and I like not having to charge them and especially since there is only one lonely plugin in my bathroom</li>
            <li> They are reasonably priced, I can easily find the replacement heads where I live and I like not having to charge them and especially since there is only one lonely plugin in my bathroom</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is why is seems significantly more powerful than the current brush I am using or if there is a larger motor in this brush or a combination of both.  </li>
            <li> Despite this, Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Spinbrush offers practical way to improve your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> like the Sonicare well enough except it&#x27;s intense and when I brush the backs of my front teeth, I have to hold the bridge of my nose because the vibration will make me want to sneeze</li>
            <li> set includes Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste (which we really like), two brushes and two extra heads</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is gentle to your teeth but at the same time cleans perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sensitive gums that sometimes bleed when I brush them vigorously.</li>
            <li> The bristles themselves ar what I would deem &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; I would have preferred a soft or a medium at the hardest so for hat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like the product, and I like that they sell a complete package with backup heads and even package it with a decent-sized tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a distinct flavor that sort of gave me an after taste that was not as expected for a mint flavor, hence the 4 star.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the brush is very loud in an unpleasant way, but for the price, it&#x27;s a very good deal I think.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s product page currently doesn&#x27;t have a price (item is unavailable) but looking at other retailers this does seem to fit within the budget conscious market of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s product page currently doesn&#x27;t have a price (item is unavailable) but looking at other retailers this does seem to fit within the budget conscious market of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; paste is bland - not bad, just not minty that I could</li>
            <li> so this will last me probably about 5-6 months before I have to buy more heads and in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about that claim but am pleased with the performance given the low cost compared to Philips Sonicare or Oral-B PRO.</li>
            <li> It took a few brushings for me to get used to the slightly &#x27;salty&#x27; flavor – I assume from the baking soda and/or peroxide – but, once I did, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> The vibration is pretty low, lower than a more expensive model that I have, and that I really like, the vibration can be irritating, so less is better!</li>
            <li> I never expected that a new toothbrush and toothpaste could make such a difference.  </li>
            <li> That said, this is not nearly as good as a Sonicare level toothbrush - but for the price range, this is a lot better than using a manual or tiny headed Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The heads last me a really long time, they really hold up well.  </li>
            <li> The batteries themselves seemed slick, which makes me wonder how secure the compartment is from moisture, and worries me that the brush won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud enough that it might wake up your spouse if they&#x27;re still asleep while you&#x27;re brushing.</li>
            <li> The only reason for a four rather than a five star rating is because it is so loud, loud enough to wake my wife up when I used it before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> The common theme with these types of electric brushes are that they&#x27;re generally a bit larger and more noisy than the more refined (and expensive) brands like Oral B and Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works very well</li>
            <li> The only reason this means anything to me now is that my dentist recently insisted I switch from a medium toothbrush to a soft bristle because my gums are receding.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the greatest taste and made my wife a little sick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say right off the bat that if you&#x27;re already using an electric toothbrush there&#x27;s very little reason to switch to this kit unless you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►</li>
            <li> I put the toothpaste on the brush and turned it on and the stuff vibrated right off, so I knew I might be in trouble!</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud, but not much more than my OralB 4000 at home and not so much that you cannot tolerate it for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s missing relative to the higher end alternatives is a timer.</li>
            <li> As I write this, it is five hours since I brushed, and my teeth still feel cleaner than they ever used to (except for the first few days after visiting the dentist).&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, though, it was a little too much.</li>
            <li> I like the brush action in comparison to other brands.</li>
            <li> I like the dual action brush heads - one spins,can other reciprocates.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell exactly without using a chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And my first impressions were negative</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant Soft Replacement Brush Heads, 2 Heads]] is less than $23.  </li>
            <li> The head on this spinbrush feels too large and hard for me to fully like</li>
            <li> The only other thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the toothbrushes are the same color.  </li>

            <li> Spinbrush Truly Radiant&#x27;s Regimen Pack is Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s entry into the mid-priced powered toothbrush market. It is a step below Sonicare, but also far more affordable the the premier electric brushes. Spinbrush is battery-powered (included and installed) and offer above-average cleaning capability at the touch of a button. What&#x27;s missing relative to the higher end alternatives is a timer. You can brush for 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or 10 and never know. Until you press off, it will continue running. The timed brush feature is standard fare for Oral B and Sonicare&#x27;s electric line. This kit comes with two powered two brushes each with a replacement brush head. There&#x27;s also a 4.3 oz Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste, though it doesn&#x27;t matter much what toothpaste is used unless you have particular dental issues (sensitive gums, enamel decay, etc.). The brush head consists of a a spinning spherical brush on top and an oblong bottom that goes back and forth. This is excellent for removing plaque and getting a deeper clean than a manual brush could offer. One concern that may affect some users is that the motor on this brush is very loud, making it difficult to brush and watch TV at the same time. It&#x27;s loud enough that it might wake up your spouse if they&#x27;re still asleep while you&#x27;re brushing. It would also be nice to have a cap to cover the brush head when not in use. Despite this, Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Spinbrush offers practical way to improve your dental hygiene. 4/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As of 10/14/15, my wife&#x27;s Spinbrush stopped working abruptly. Mine is still working, but the battery is only half as powerful as it originally was. This powered toothbrush is not a long-term solution. It will last about 6-8 weeks with regular usage. For those who want a long-term solution, invest upmarket to Sonicare or Oral B&#x27;s more robust electric toothbrush options.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think that this is a good deal. I have to be careful about using Arm and Hammer toothpaste due to gums receding, but the taste of the paste is pretty good, I am fond of the flavor. The brushes do a very good job, compatible with more expensive brushes I&#x27;d say, one part vibrates in a side to side motion, the other part rotates in a circular motion, and my teeth are CLEAN. The vibration is pretty low, lower than a more expensive model that I have, and that I really like, the vibration can be irritating, so less is better! The only drawback is that the brush is very loud in an unpleasant way, but for the price, it&#x27;s a very good deal I think.</li>
            <li> I like the brush action in comparison to other brands. This product does an excellent job in cleaning all areas of your mouth/teeth. The toothpaste has a distinct flavor that sort of gave me an after taste that was not as expected for a mint flavor, hence the 4 star. In any case I did notice a difference in color after about 5 days of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using a sonicare toothbrush for about the past 18 months or so. Around 6 weeks or maybe 2 months ago, I had my teeth cleaned. At that time, I asked the dental tech if she noticed any difference in the scale on my teeth. She consulted my chart and said &amp;#34;Not too much. You tend to accumulate scale a bit faster than average&amp;#34;.  I was disappointed because I thought the Sonicare would help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Sonicare well enough except it&#x27;s intense and when I brush the backs of my front teeth, I have to hold the bridge of my nose because the vibration will make me want to sneeze and it&#x27;s not good to sneeze with a mouthful of saliva and toothpaste. Big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have just continued to use my sonicare because it was costly and it does work better than a manual toothbrush but then Vine offered me this set of Spinbrushes. I&#x27;ve used Spinbrushes in the past and LOVED them! I like that they are battery operated so no charging. If I&#x27;m away from home and it begins to run down, I just change the batteries. If the sonicare brush quits at home then I have to finish using a manual toothbrush. I never have that happen with the Spinbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that they have both a round head and the rectangular section. I feel like I&#x27;m brushing a greater area so in the two minutes I take to brush, I&#x27;m covering more &amp;#34;ground&amp;#34; than I do with the Sonicare which has a very small, almost child sized rectangular brush area. Also, the Spinbrushes don&#x27;t make me want to sneeze and are not so intense as to be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my dental hygienist didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference between the Spinbrush (which was what I used before sonicare) and my sonicare, I&#x27;d rather use the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste (which we really like), two brushes and two extra heads so this will last me probably about 5-6 months before I have to buy more heads and in the past, I&#x27;ve had the Spinbrush base last literally a couple of years. Lots of times I just replaced them because I wanted a different color or they came out with a new style that I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tend not to accumulate scale at an above average rate like I do, maybe the sonicare would help you better but I prefer the Spinbrush and most likely that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be using for a long time to come. They are reasonably priced, I can easily find the replacement heads where I live and I like not having to charge them and especially since there is only one lonely plugin in my bathroom and it&#x27;s always taken up with other appliances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these.nbrush base last literally a couple of years.

            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth feel just as clean as if I just went to the dentist. They are surly getting my and my daughters teeth cleaner than our regular brushes. It is a good size but a bit noisy. The toothpaste does not have a strong flavor, which I appreciate. My teeth were much whiter after just one brushing but that may have had just as much to do with the brushes. I have not used that paste in two days but my teeth still look white even though I drink a lot of coffee. My new fave!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush for 20 years so I am not sure how it compares to other electric brushes, but I do know I find this particular toothbrush and paste to be excellent. The toothbrush is gentle to your teeth but at the same time cleans perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like the toothbrush, I like the toothpaste even better. There is no doubt that it whitens your teeth after using just a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This packet includes everything you need:&lt;br /&gt;2 battery operated toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;1 tube of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;2 replacement brushes&lt;br /&gt;4 pre-installed AA batteries (2 for each toothbrush)</li>
            <li> We really enjoy the spinbrush set. The brushes work great and really leave your teeth feeling clean. The toothpaste has a refreshing flavor as well. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t need a charging base! The only down side of the toothbrush is the fact that it is a little loud. Overall very happy with the complete set.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush Truly Radiant Regimen pack is a nice starter set if you&#x27;re making the move from traditional manual toothbrushes to something electric.  That said, this is not nearly as good as a Sonicare level toothbrush - but for the price range, this is a lot better than using a manual or tiny headed Oral-B toothbrushes.  The Spinbrush does a fine job of getting teeth clean.  The bristles quickly rotate to get teeth very clean.  The bristles are soft, and because the head size is fairly large, I&#x27;m able to get all my teeth clean very well.  The brushes are not rechargeable and you will need to purchase AA batteries, which is a downer.  There are two replacement heads, and the package comes with a tube of the Truly Radiant Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, while I like the convenience of buying the two pack toothbrushes, two replacement heads, and the toothpaste in one shot, I question why anyone would want to purchase it in a set when buying everything individually is more cost effective.  On Amazon, purchasing two  [[ASIN:B00J42G2UW Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean, Colors May Vary]] and one [[ASIN:B001U9JY8O Spinbrush Sonic Power Truly Radiant Soft Replacement Brush Heads, 2 Heads]] is less than $23.  The local bullseye store carried the toothpaste for ~$4 for a 4.3 ounce tube.  Unless you&#x27;re gifting a couple, you may want to purchase everything separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Truly Radiant Toothbrush set works well for the cost, and when using along with a good flossing, my teeth feel wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome gift set for someone who has never tried an electric toothbrush! The husband and I recently tossed our manual brushes in the trash after receiving two different battery-operated brushes. I don&#x27;t think we could ever go back to manual...the electric ones really DO leave your teeth feeling cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the brush my husband received was a spinbrush (although it didn&#x27;t actually spin)! The brushes in this set, which actually do have spinning brush heads, were an upgrade to his first electric toothbrush and he loves it! He also prefers harder bristles, and this brush was just right for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, however, received a Philips Sonicare as my first electric toothbrush. Though it was their cheapest version, I prefer the Sonicare to these spinbrushes. The head on this spinbrush feels too large and hard for me to fully like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a manual brush, it is still much, much better. If I hadn&#x27;t used a Sonicare first, I would likely be just as pleased with the spinbrush as my husband is (who hasn&#x27;t used a Sonicare and thinks the brush head looks too small for him).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the toothpaste included in the set, that&#x27;s my favorite part! I was surprised by how much I liked the toothpaste! It took a few brushings for me to get used to the slightly &#x27;salty&#x27; flavor – I assume from the baking soda and/or peroxide – but, once I did, I really liked it. My mouth felt fresher than with our normal paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: a great gift set to switch over a manual brush user!</li>
            <li> Excellent value on a pair of electric toothbrushes with 2 spare brush heads and a tube of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant whitening tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes come with two AA Duracell batteries already installed so they&#x27;re ready to go. The brush heads clean two different ways, the top round brush spins while the lower brush goes back and forth. From the first time using this toothbrush I found my teeth feeling extra clean and smooth, the paste says you&#x27;ll see whiter teeth in just 5 days! I&#x27;m not sure about that claim but am pleased with the performance given the low cost compared to Philips Sonicare or Oral-B PRO. The batteries last a long time and no messy charger base on the bathroom vanity not to mention electric power cords that can be unsafe near water.</li>
            <li> These electric toothbrushes work as well as ones that cost a lot more. It brushes very well. I sensitive gums that sometimes bleed when I brush them vigorously. After two days I have had zero bleeding even after using it when I ate popcorn, which is when they are most sensitive. I like the way you can put the brush part over the top of the tooth  &amp; clean it straight down to the gums. I&#x27;ve never used a battery (as opposed to a rechargeable) toothbrush before so I was concerned as to whether it would be strong enough to do the job. I needn&#x27;t have worried as it has more than enough power. The only reason for a four rather than a five star rating is because it is so loud, loud enough to wake my wife up when I used it before I went to bed. Other than that it works very well and I recommend it to anybody looking for a toothbrush like this that can live with the noise.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:7422e1ebf7266e7bebcd2ee670c5a282]]Love Spinbrush toothbrushes. Easy to power with AA batteries (included), the spinning motion of these brushes give a nice even clean throughout the mouth. With kids in braces, finding a brush the helps them get the surface of their teeth clean is a must.I think they feel like the brushes dental hygienists  use when polishing your teeth.Spinbrushes have helped them go through orthodontics cavity free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste included has a very fresh minted flavor.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I had my regular dental checkup / cleaning last night.  The hygienist asked if I had changed toothbrushes!  She could tell the difference that my teeth were much cleaner, my gums were healthier!  I have four gaps where my gums are receding, and three these gaps were measurably smaller!  Both my dentist and hygienist were SO HAPPY!!  They both told me to keep using the new toothbrush, and keep using the new brand of toothpaste, because my teeth are so much better than before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS SET IS A WINNER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(end update, original review follows)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect to like this.  I expected to try it, review it, and pass it on to my kids (who like power toothbrushes). I&#x27;ve also always been a &amp;#34;Crest guy&amp;#34; - the only brand of toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever bought.  And my first impressions were negative: both brushes are identical; how do I know which is mine and which is my wife&#x27;s?  Then I tried it - wet the brush, put the paste on, turned it on - and the toothpaste went flying.  So I made a mental note - put the brush in my mouth before turning it on.  The &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; paste is bland - not bad, just not minty that I could tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I fell in love with this set!!!  Why?  Simple - when I was finished, my teeth felt SO CLEAN, like I had just left the dentist!  I never expected that a new toothbrush and toothpaste could make such a difference.  I am not exaggerating when I say that this is a  HUGE improvement over the toothbrush and toothpaste that I have been using - and I&#x27;ve always been good about brushing.  As I write this, it is five hours since I brushed, and my teeth still feel cleaner than they ever used to (except for the first few days after visiting the dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell for sure if they are whiter, but my teeth definitely feel CLEANER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small downside, in that it&#x27;s a little messy when I brush, but totally worth it.  And if my wife uses the second brush in the package, I&#x27;ll put stickers or something on them so we can tell them apart.  But I seriously LOVE how clean my teeth feel now!I seriously LOVE how clean my teeth feel now!</li>
            <li> I just received this item and I like it.  Like most electric/battery powered toothbrushes, it makes a little noise...but then again you have a rotating device inside your mouth so you&#x27;re going to hear it.  The brush bristles are not to hard and do not hurt my gums.  The rotation of the brush heads don&#x27;t rattle my teeth or hurt my gums like some other brushes I have tried.  The brush works and cleans well.  The tooth paste...though not my favorite brand...was actually ok.  Since my wife already had a rechargeable electric toothbrush, I shared the other one with my daughter.  It was her first battery powered toothbrush.  Though 40, she acted like a teenager...had loads of fun with it...and in the end...said she really liked the way it cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste with my electric toothbrush for several years and figured I&#x27;d give this electric toothbrush + toothpaste pack a try. I&#x27;ll say right off the bat that if you&#x27;re already using an electric toothbrush there&#x27;s very little reason to switch to this kit unless you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Toothbrushes:&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes in this kit use two AA batteries (included) that fit in the handle. The common theme with these types of electric brushes are that they&#x27;re generally a bit larger and more noisy than the more refined (and expensive) brands like Oral B and Sonicare. That is very much the case here with the brushes in this kit. The other negative for me is that I felt the brushes were a bit too stiff; I already have a bad habit of brushing too hard so paired with these stiffer brushes I&#x27;m not doing my teeth any favors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush is considerably larger than both my Oral B and Sonicare brushes and features a multi-action head. I think they do a good enough job cleaning but again are considerably louder and offer a more jarring brushing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Truly Radiant Toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste then you&#x27;ll probably like the Truly Radiant formula. If you&#x27;re not familiar with brushing with Arm &amp; Hammer products then just be aware that these pastes feature baking soda as a primary ingredient. So your brushing experience will tend to be grittier than with other non-baking soda formulas. Personally the combination of baking soda and peroxide just leaves my teeth and mouth feeling cleaner than many of the other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My everyday brand is Arm &amp; Hammer Complete Care Plus Whitening and honestly I&#x27;m not able to tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after using the Truly Radiant brand. I may consider ordering more but that will likely mostly be determined by price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Included in the Kit:&lt;br /&gt;1) 2 Spinbrush toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;2) 4 AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;3) 4 Toothbrush heads&lt;br /&gt;4) 1 Truly Radiant toothpaste tube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Closing Comments:&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is targeting two types of people: those that do not already own and electric toothbrush and those that are looking for a non-strip based whitening product. If you find yourself in either group this is probably not a bad purchase. Amazon&#x27;s product page currently doesn&#x27;t have a price (item is unavailable) but looking at other retailers this does seem to fit within the budget conscious market of electric toothbrushes. Overall a good experience.

            <li> I really like the baking soda and peroxide toothpaste &amp;#34;Truly Radiant&amp;#34; this was the first time I&#x27;ve ever used it. I&#x27;ve been using my own homemade blend for years and this tastes so much better. Teeth feel fresh and clean after brushing for a looong tme! As for the battery operated brushes, I have a large mouth so the brush heads (*which are larger than my daughters Sonicare electric toothbrush) fit fine into my adult size mouth but for a young child these would be too big for their smaller mouths. The bristles themselves ar what I would deem &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; I would have preferred a soft or a medium at the hardest so for hat I&#x27;m deducting 1 star. I just try to not be as aggressive as I am when manually brushing my teeth. Over all I find it to be a quite nice and affordable &amp;#34;electric-like&amp;#34; (aka battery) toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set which includes two different color coded power toothbrushes with batteries, plus two extra brudh heads, plus a tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the family uses power toothbrushes.  At home we use OralB and Sonicare, but I took Spinbrush to work to use after lunch.  I think it works as well as more expensive brushed we use at home.  The handle is comfortable,vand I like the dual action brush heads - one spins,can other reciprocates.  It is a bit loud, but not much more than my OralB 4000 at home and not so much that you cannot tolerate it for two minutes.  The clean feeling in my mouth is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is fine.  It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but it could be because I have been using whitening toothpastes for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice set overall</li>
            <li> Overall I like this pack a lot. The two different colored toothbrushes (a his &amp; hers kind of deal) was a small, but nice touch. I admit I was a little confused if the toothpaste was a bonus for the toothbrushes, or the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed that the bristles seemed very stiff for something advertised as a “soft” toothbrush. The only reason this means anything to me now is that my dentist recently insisted I switch from a medium toothbrush to a soft bristle because my gums are receding. To me these don’t feel like soft bristles, but my wife points out that the way the brush is designed, the bristles are less likely to brush away my gum line than an ordinary medium bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside that I’ve seen using this is that it’s larger than what I’m used to in a toothbrush, so it feels a tiny bit awkward brushing. I’m sure this will be normal after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really likes the toothbrush because she says that it makes her teeth feel almost like she just came from the dentist.  I don’t have quite the same opinion, but I do feel like my teeth are a little bit cleaner than when I use a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus –they threw in some Whitening toothpaste. The tube of toothpaste says that your teeth will be amazingly white after just 5 days of use… I’m not sure about that, but my teeth didn’t get less white, so there’s that. I also think that this particular toothpaste, because it’s a tiny bit grainy, might not be liked by everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product, and I like that they sell a complete package with backup heads and even package it with a decent-sized tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT set! My kids were thrilled to both get one, plus toothpaste, plus replacement heads! They actually look forward to brushing with their new spin brush, and even I can tell that their teeth are very clean.  I&#x27;ve been using a spin brush for awhile and I love it.  The heads last me a really long time, they really hold up well.  I love that they are portable and refer the batteries (which last a long tine as well) over the charging base,  I prefer the Spinbrush over my Braun.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try an electric toothbrush, and my seven-year-old daughter loves her Monster High one. Unfortunately, I found this to be too powerful for me, which can be good if you want a daily cleaning like you&#x27;re at your dentist&#x27;s office. But for me, I don&#x27;t like holding objects for long that have strong, intense vibrations, and two minutes can seem like a lifetime when something is uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the top brushes of the head being bent somewhat due to shipping (the plastic was pushed in), the brush itself was comfortable, and easy to remove for replacing.  I can&#x27;t say the same for the battery compartment, which says to turn and pull, but it&#x27;s hard to turn a rectangular piece. The batteries themselves seemed slick, which makes me wonder how secure the compartment is from moisture, and worries me that the brush won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tootpaste itself tastes more like baking soda than mint, but at least it leaves the mouth feeling clean. Overall, I was not as thrilled with this as I hoped. If you are well used to electric toothbrushes or intense, rough cleanings, you&#x27;ll likely have a better experience. For me, though, it was a little too much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned an electric toothbrush in years so I don&#x27;t know how they compare with battery operated toothbrushes; however, battery operated toothbrushes get my teeth much cleaner than manually brushing them.  I&#x27;ve been using a battery operated toothbrush for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush Radiant toothbrush gets my teeth just as clean as the Phillips Powerup.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the Spinbrush would automatically turn off after 2 minutes. I deducted 1/2 star because it doesn&#x27;t have a timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush toothbrush is not as jarring as Phillips Powerup battery operated toothbrush.  However, the brush heads are thicker than the Powerup&#x27;s; they&#x27;re thicker than a regular toothbrush too.  The thicker brush head is hard for me to get used to. Deducted 1/2 star for thick brush head.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I got used to the thicker brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Arm &amp; Hammer Brilliant Sparkle toothpaste for several years. It was a family favorite. When I couldn&#x27;t find Brilliant Sparkle anymore, I purchased Advance White Extreme Whitening (I liked their Brilliant Sparkle formula better).  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Truly Radiant and will update my review if I have a more radiant smile in 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Truly Radiant also strengthens your tooth enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The toothpaste is great. My teeth are two or three shades whiter. It&#x27;s hard to tell exactly without using a chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit has everything you need:&lt;br /&gt;2 battery operated toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;1 tube of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;2 replacement brushes&lt;br /&gt;4 pre-installed AA batteries (2 for each toothbrush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I mentioned that I was using a battery operated toothbrush to my dental hygenist, she asked how much the replacement heads were. Apparently many people don&#x27;t buy electric toothbrushes because the electric toothbrush  &amp; replacement heads cost  quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s a concern of yours, give this battery operated toothbrush a try. It&#x27;s more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I gave my grandkids (ages 4 &amp; 5) a child&#x27;s battery operated toothbrush, they were really excited &amp; told their parents how much cleaner their teeth felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star deducted because the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a timer &amp; the brush head is thicker than the average brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors:&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering, I received one pink toothbrush &amp; one purple toothbrush. They aren&#x27;t available for purchase yet (8/22/15), so I don&#x27;t know if you will have a choice of colors. I noticed some reviewers received one blue toothbrush &amp; one green.h, they were really excited &amp; told their parents how much cleaner their teeth felt.    One star deducted because the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a timer &amp; the brush head is thicker than the average brush head.    Colors:  In case you&#x27;re wondering, I received one pink toothbrush &amp; one purple toothbrush.

            <li> Only personal complaints here. I think for most folks this would be a great product. It&#x27;s a good price, it does what it should. However, it is a bit jiggly for me. I have vertigo and, honestly, this thing vibrates my whole face and I don&#x27;t like that. I put the toothpaste on the brush and turned it on and the stuff vibrated right off, so I knew I might be in trouble! My husband is also using and he LOVES it - he claims it&#x27;s the lazy way to brush your teeth but he might have been working too hard before. We&#x27;ve only been using for about a week so I can&#x27;t comment totally on the toothpaste but I will say I did get a comment on my smile this week so something&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> These are nice little toothbrushes, they&#x27;ve got two groups of bristles which both &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; or oscillate quickly.  They run on two AA batteries, which are included.  You also get two extra brush heads for four total, plus a tube of Arm and Hammer toothpaste.  The brushes are kind of on the noisy side for electric toothbrushes, but it&#x27;s not annoying or anything.  Just not as quiet as some others.  They seem to work perfectly well and the body fits nicely in your hand, with a simple on/off slider conveniently located under your thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, perfectly good brushes and great for taking on a trip or something where you don&#x27;t want to be waiting for anything to recharge.</li>
            <li> Have used a similar spinbrush in the past and this one works well.  It has a circle part that spins and a wedge part that moves up and down.  It does a good job of cleaning your teeth.  Works on 2 AA batteries.  Batteries are in a waterproof area and wont get wet.  Toothpaste that comes in pack is a cleaning toothpaste.  The toothpaste says it is mint flavor.  I mainly tasted a baking soda/peroxide taste.  It wasn&#x27;t the greatest taste and made my wife a little sick.  Toothpaste is a whitening toothpaste but I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in color after a week of use.  The only other thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the toothbrushes are the same color.  I wish they would have been different colors as I had to draw a design on one so my wife and I could tell them apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for over a year. They&#x27;re fantastic. It&#x27;s not as advanced as say a Sonic Care but at the same time, they&#x27;re cheap enough that you wouldn&#x27;t feel like a moron if you accidentally left it in a hotel room. They do they job, they&#x27;re light but sturdy and the batteries last forever. In terms of this two pack kit. It reminds me of something you might grab at Costco. The extra replacement heads are nice. That it comes with a $3 tube of toothpaste is not such a big deal.</li>
            <li> I like electric toothbrushes.  I find that they are more thorough and consistent than my own brushing motion.  These brushes use two AA batteries.  I am not sure if that is why is seems significantly more powerful than the current brush I am using or if there is a larger motor in this brush or a combination of both.  This brush has a spinning head that seems to get into the nooks and crannies.  I like that it comes with two replacement heads and they are easy to install.  Replacing the batteries may take more oomph that you anticipate.  Although once the battery case was open, it was easier to open the second time.  There is no price currently listed on Amazon so I can&#x27;t comment on the price practicality of the item.  The use factor seems very positive though.</li>
