            <li>This product is inexpensive and works amazingly well!  </li>
            <li>but I didnt see any remarkable results using this product.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Adavanced Solutions facewash and spf15 lotion, the acne lotion worked, but not as good as</li>
            <li>But even though it is a good product to try.</li>
            <li>Cream did a good job at decreasing my breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream does a good job of drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what makes this product so good, but it is.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good for someone who just has sporadic breakouts.</li>
            <li>but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I am super happy!!!</li>
            <li>It seemed to be working ok, and I did a search on Amazon.com for it, and seen all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and what I like the most is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>but he smiles a lot more!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product isn&#x27;t advertised more because I wish we would of found it sooner!  </li>
            <li>but you will love this!</li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for more than 10 years!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be perfect for people with mild acne, just not for me.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff</li>
            <li>and I have seen an amazing improvement.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>After reading all the amazing reviews, I went ahead and bought 5 packs.</li>
            <li>The vanishing cream is amazing, I am yet to see noticeable changes from the pills.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>A must have for me, and I&#x27;m glad I can find them now on Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li>Incredibly effective product.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, really works.</li>
            <li>This product works 100% along with a good healthy diet.</li>
            <li>Always nice to have a homeopathic alternative.</li>
            <li>Product arrived within the estimated delivery time nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I will ALSO agree that the pills are kind of optional/</li>
            <li>The ingredients in the product were all perfectly harmless and the reviews were positive, but I also know that if something sounds too good to be true-it often isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>My pores clogs very easily, even by using lotion..</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really think the pills worked for me, but the cream that they include is very good.</li>
            <li>We have tried a lot of products, of course the most popular ones and none of them worked.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think the cream is more effective then the pills were.</li>
            <li>I think the nature cure cream was actually more effective then the pills.  </li>
            <li>By far the best product out there!</li>
            <li>The pills are working great for me, I don&#x27;t really use the cream.  </li>
            <li>Man am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>i have try everything this have to be the product with most results</li>
            <li>The Nature&#x27;s Cure and Zinc Gluconate combo has been an outstanding 1-2 punch for me against acne.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been acne free for YEARS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li>face to face when I suddenly realized how GREAT his skin looked!</li>
            <li>My son ran out of this and literally pestered me into ordering him some more.</li>
            <li>He did say that he noticed much better results when he used both products together rather than when he forgot to take the pills but used the cream alone.</li>
            <li>would not recommend taking more then 4 a day)</li>
            <li>it works GREAT and very inexpensive compared to what we were using.</li>
            <li>I have even tried the womans version and love it.</li>
            <li>Made me break out even more...</li>
            <li>I feel more confident now taking selfies....</li>
            <li>Hopefully others have better luck with this product.</li>
            <li>The bp cream is better than most but still don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle cure</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product and it works!  </li>
            <li>I believe the Acne Cream is the magic.</li>
            <li>But did not see a notable difference.</li>
            <li>This is a FABULOUS product!  </li>
            <li>My son uses this and if it wasn&#x27;t for your store, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>It is way better than it was before I started.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna give it 5 stars if it clears even more.</li>
            <li>I would get a pimple here and there on my face, but I&#x27;m not getting as many on my face either now.</li>
            <li>AFTER you shower, the fading will be faster and your skin tone more even.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks now and most of my acne is gone.</li>
            <li>Also make sure you take the am/pm pills along with the cream to get the best results possible.</li>
            <li>I used this as a teenager, it worked better than anything out there, when my son started having break outs</li>
            <li>This works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>and I have for sure seen improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>BUT I would say make sure u take them like they tell you to and dont skip a day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this acne treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not a miracle worker, but I think it sorta work?</li>
            <li>on it didn&#x27;t seem to get much better.</li>
            <li>My now 15-year-old son has now been using these pills for more than six months.</li>
            <li>The cream works like magic, not too sure about the tablets though because sometimes i forgot to eat them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m way MORE oily because my face is trying to compensate</li>
            <li>Together, the cream and tablets seemed very effective at first (someone even commented on it), but the cream ran out very quickly</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get good consistent results.  </li>
            <li>First off - the cream does a good job at drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m very confident about my self and become more positive</li>
            <li>the creme is very good not to mention the pills that works wonders internally...</li>
            <li>but on day 4 the clearing began and by day 14 my skin is 100% blemish free which I have never been able to say.  </li>
            <li>I combine it with \\&quot;Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash\\&quot; and I saw incredible results in only one week!</li>
            <li>The cream had some effect, but there are better products available.  </li>
            <li>and I can imagine that many people enjoy the convenience and privacy of monthly deliveries of their health items.</li>
            <li>so it really does work in combination with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool huh?\\&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li>so you can easily distinguish when you&#x27;re suppose to take them -</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for anybody who has gone to a Dermatoligist for years (i&#x27;m 28, been going since I was 13).</li>
            <li>I didnt took the pills because I dont know whats in them, but I strongly recommend buying this product just for the Acne Cream.</li>
            <li>Highly suggested and and goes good under a coating of coco butter.</li>
            <li>Fine.  </li>
            <li>Second package was in great condition.     </li>
            <li>I gave it Two stars because its not worthless just BS markup</li>
            <li>and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>also use Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C alongside this product.</li>
            <li>I followed the regimen precisely.</li>
            <li>but the cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for my teenage son.</li>
            <li>working great the only thing that seems to work for me</li>
            <li>This is a product that we can no longer find in stores, so he was elated when I found it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>just wish they offered a subscribe and save option as I enjoy savings</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this company!!!</li>
            <li>, I noticed a difference after 2 or 3 days, then 1 week was even better, 2 weeks was more and going a month strong, almost completely clear, if I do get any breakouts, gone in a day almost.</li>
            <li>Original package was tampered with and part of it was stolen/lost.</li>
            <li>so i took 4 a day but started out with 2 a day to make sure there were no weird side affects(i</li>
            <li>which could ultimately lead to a successful product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see significant results in the beginning, but gradually my skin improved dramatically.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I only give it four stars because I still have a pack to go, and plan to buy more, but overall I am honestly impressed with this acne medication!</li>
            <li>have used this product previously and have seen wonderful results with consistent use.</li>
            <li>I tried this along with drinking a significant amount more water and my skin is clearer now than it has been my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it will be two full weeks since that day.</li>
            <li>Could be entirely coincidental or self-esteem related-but either way-it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>My niece wants to know how to get more.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good, but I can get 10% at my local drug store.</li>
            <li>Initially this product is good to treat my acne but after not using it, my acne appears again.</li>
            <li>It works and its the most gentle product like this in my opinion and experience.</li>
            <li>This is quite true for teenagers.  </li>
            <li>the ingredients in it all is very strong because my skin is betta very sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far he has only taken the medicine for a week and the results are truely amazing!!</li>
            <li>My skin get super oily and causes me to break out on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>a couple of years ago - I will agree with people that say it&#x27;s kind of gimmicky, or \\&quot;kind of\\</li>
            <li>All the positive reviews got me really excited</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li>I came across Nature&#x27;s Cure and decided it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my acne will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked was the cream.</li>
            <li>Worth a try though.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s been more than 3 months, and my skin is almost completely clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i think that it&#x27;s worth a try for everyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li>I rarely miss a dose</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to him by a friend who had success with it.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot for those that are &amp;#34;desperate&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li>I say this product is worth a try</li>
            <li>So many positive reviews on Amazon so I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I used to have moderate - severe acne for more than 7 years, and no product gave significant results.</li>
            <li>some of the things I have tried is neutrogena acne stress relief, clean and clear acne free scrub, de la Cruz sulfur treatment.  </li>
            <li>I emailed them right away</li>
            <li>It came quickly and he is enjoying the same results as before.</li>
            <li>and I bought the female version for my teenage daughter and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review on Amazon.com - this product worked</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product, I thought I had nothing to lose</li>
            <li>Now I didnt feel stressed about the medication because it is not complicated at all to take.</li>
            <li>years ago when I first purchased this product, I never thought \\&quot;nature\\&quot; could cure my breakouts.</li>
            <li>The first month after using the pills and cream twice per day, I did not see any results.</li>
            <li>I only wish more stores carried it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order online.</li>
            <li>But to cut to the chase i would recommend it to anyone with acne and wants it gone!</li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t know and just found out reading a book about acne, is that benzoyl peroxide is heat sensitive and it&#x27;s important to keep it in the refrigerator.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought this product I had redness and acn&amp;eacute; in my face.</li>
            <li>I have an oily skin and the hot weather</li>
            <li>so I am pretty consistent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the cream the first time though, but I started using it now on my face.</li>
            <li>Most of the local retailers used to carry this - but then about 5 years ago they all stopped.  </li>
            <li>For about another $60, you can get that with .05% topical Retinol, even better - your skin will be smooth and natural again within 3-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has been using it for several months and it really works! :)</li>
            <li>But I am getting more because this is the only stuff that ended up working out for</li>
            <li>This product worked pretty well for my boyfriend who I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>He used this regimen in conjunction with the Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth Acne Treatment for Teens scrub and soap.</li>
            <li>Overall, I just dont get how it has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>if you read the active ingredients on the pack and you&#x27;ll find that 5% benzoyl won&#x27;t help reduce the acnes effectively as they said on advertisement.</li>
            <li>Though, like most, I wish they had an a la carte option - I have a whole lot of benzol peroxide left over</li>
            <li>First two weeks I did not notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>At first I was really wondering whether it will work or not, but for me it worked.</li>
            <li>so if you have a sensitive skin problem with dry skin and need lotion buy more!</li>
            <li>got it because of the good should of read the negative reviews first.</li>
            <li>Combined with a great facial cleanser (St. Ives green tea scrub), the Nature&#x27;s Cure Two Part Acne Treatment has worked very well for me!  </li>
            <li>everything works ok for a couple weeks, and then right back to baseline - infuriating doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it, but it&#x27;s more a resigned, depressed kind of fury at this point, after so much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so well I absolutely had to write about it.  </li>
            <li>But this treatment is really working well for me.</li>
            <li>The product is working very well , thank you .</li>
            <li>&quot; through immune system seemed like a reasonable concept.  </li>
            <li>the try - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I started using Oxy wash and that has some very favorable results.</li>
            <li>Seem to be working very well.</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful this product would work for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really buy a stuff in Amazon and shipping</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within a couple days of using this, my acne really improved a lot</li>
            <li>Vanishing cremed dint really use, was very watery.</li>
            <li>It came on time and it really helps my skin.  </li>
            <li>Ehh, the pills dont really do anything.</li>
            <li>When applying dont put too much.</li>
            <li>Im telling you is real.</li>
            <li>Took it for almost a month straight.</li>
            <li>My son has been using this for 2 months on the recommendation of a friend and his skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li>All i know is that it worked very well for me</li>
            <li>there is no words to explain how much this has helped me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much to say about the pills.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really do all that much for me.</li>
            <li>The pills had no effect for the whole 2.5 to 3 months that I took them.</li>
            <li>so if the price isnt much to you.</li>
            <li>Ordered this acne cream and A months dosage of pills its seems to be working really well</li>
            <li>If you know of anyone who has had any type of copmplection issues this is a product that really, really does work.</li>
            <li>so we really like the brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has not used the vanishing cream much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that this product is doing absolutely nothing for me whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference using this product</li>
            <li>I used to use this product during my adolescent years and remember that it worked very well.</li>
            <li>or so it was getting progressively worse - more pain, more frequency, scarring, etc.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on the surface were totally gone and his skin was so SOFT and healthy looking.     </li>
            <li>Using a popular off-the-shelf skin moisturizer, it&#x27;s stopped major breakouts and limited ones that were going to appear.  </li>
            <li>AFTER NC:The first thing we both noticed was that the rate of new ones dropped drastically, I&#x27;d say about an 80% drop.</li>
            <li>Cream is strong and overuse will dry out your face - but it does work.</li>
            <li>His acne is clearing up very quickly and he has no new outbreaks.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty resistant acne though, so I&#x27;m surprised that this helped at all.</li>
            <li>We have only try for two weeks and so far, the face lotion with the pills seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>BEFORE Nature&#x27;s Cure(NC):no matter what we tried topically, his skin was fairly \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; even where no pimples had erupted, he would get 4 or 5 new ones a day, and at any given time he&#x27;d have 4 or 5 previous ones that he was trying to heal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s with mild acne (with occasional flare ups) and have been on Proactiv for years.  </li>
            <li>My son has mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>The acne cream that it came with did a decent job though.</li>
            <li>Ive seen a decent difference in my acne</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>I can only say that it was helpful because he was only consistent with taking them for the first 2wks then after that he rarely took them.</li>
            <li>The pills dont do anything, but I already take a high end multivitamin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I tried this product years ago, beginning of high school?  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for any stage of compection isues.</li>
            <li>But after two months my skin really started to clear up.</li>
            <li>His skin is clear once again thanks to Natures Cure.</li>
            <li>He is 18 years old and loves this product, he told me that he has not had a problem with his back acne since starting this (though most has cleared up,some doesn&#x27;t go away FULLY, but it will help with itchiness and swelling).</li>
            <li>and I love that it isn&#x27;t any harsh chemicals going into his body and on his face.</li>
            <li>no complaint&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>All of my adult life I&#x27;ve had mild to moderate outbreaks of acne and I tried lots of OTC medicines but nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>I would really reccommend this product and the best part is that it is not as expensive as other products.</li>
            <li>and they sent me out a new one that day.</li>
            <li>I live</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t live without it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li>At least I look kind of young still.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this acne treatment actually worked, i will definitely buy again, it was overall a pretty good buy, and i would recommend this to anyone willing to wait for a slow pace acne recovery system..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear as a bell!  </li>
            <li>I tried it years ago when I first started but all it seemed to do was leave white residue on my face.</li>
            <li>My acne and skin is exactly the same since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>in the first week blemishes were starting to disappear and it seems like my acne marks are also disappearing.</li>
            <li>And on occasion I even break out more than usual.</li>
            <li>The key is to use it consistently and remember that it takes time to start working.</li>
            <li>but now this product and the facial cleanser is really helping me get rid of my scars an acne!</li>
            <li>Give it several weeks, but stay consistent drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Facial scrubs made my face \\&quot;feel\\&quot; clean but did nothing for the actual acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok, so for a little back story - I have had acne for about 15 years - started in high school, and I am 30 now - I have come to terms with the fact that I will just have oily skin until I&#x27;m 100.</li>
            <li>When I use it consistently my face is almost always clear or occasionally (1 or 2 a month)</li>
            <li>Its been about a month and a half of using this product pretty consistently.</li>
            <li>, the cream is the ONLY proper mixture of BOTH benzoil peroxide to dry the skin and THEN herbal moisturizers to keep the skin from needing to crank out more oil that I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>and I would continue my search for a product that would clear up his acne with out horriable side effects.  </li>
            <li>BUT without this product my skin would not be as clear as it is.</li>
            <li>And I know its Nature&#x27;s Cure keeping my face clear because whenever I run out (it&#x27;s not sold anywhere</li>
            <li>I reccomend water sence when you trying to clear up</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;m still waiting to see how much it&#x27;ll clear up.</li>
            <li>After a couple days on this product, my skin was COMPLETELY CLEAR.</li>
            <li>Never help clear out the acne.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>murad, proactiv, klear action, clearasil, stridex, retin-a, etc.  </li>
            <li>I am 18 years old, and a freshman in college.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help my 15 year old son with his acne and read the reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>We marked my son&#x27;s \\&quot;start date\\&quot; on the calendar and tomorrow</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li>The box says the pills are marked AM and PM</li>
            <li>well, i bought this is because it says this product cures/diminishes acnes in a natural way.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s 30 years old</li>
            <li>and it s natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not drinking soda or sugary drinks just water and Natural juices sometimes.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d like is a supply of the pills and the pills alone as I don&#x27;t really care for the ointment.</li>
            <li>it really lightens it but takes a while to totally vanish it..</li>
            <li>My 13 yr old son has been using it about a month</li>
            <li>I am adult with acne.</li>
            <li>(I had to use quite a bit, but regardless, I can&#x27;t see the creme lasting a whole month), and from then</li>
            <li>It really depends on your skin type and personal needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for my acne and now purchased it for my 13 year old son.  </li>
            <li>Well, so far ive been taking the pills 15 days and havent see any progress.</li>
            <li>I encourage anyone to try this product as a cheaper alternative to the above acne solutions and recommend it to the minority of people that haven&#x27;t had success with the big names.</li>
            <li>But the price was minimal and worth the risk.    </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products (sulfur, different homeopathy, soaps, buck-thorn oils, creams, etc) and this is the only product that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>we have wasted so much money on so many other products.  </li>
            <li>I would probably strongly recommend this product if you have a small amount of surface acne.</li>
            <li>Not a whole lot mind you, and maybe it&#x27;s just that his self-confidence is improving as his skin does, but he&#x27;s been more easy going and less snippy at his siblings than usual.</li>
            <li>It is not a magic solution but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I rarely get pimples now and the ones I do are small and go away fast.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, but upon re-reading my first review, I&#x27;m seeing the same improvement in his moodiness (when he&#x27;s using the product)that</li>
            <li>at first I thought they could be related to using my daily meds...NOT!  </li>
            <li>I hope nature&#x27;s cure never changes their formula, and is around for at least a few more decades, because I am a loyal fan at this point...</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Cure has no side-effects except a little dry skin on my face, which is ok.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this simple system.  </li>
            <li>that finds the proper benzoil peroxide/natural moisturizer mix for a topical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coupled this with natural tea-tree oil soap, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, as my face wash, and for the first time in the last half of my life, my skin looks what I would call \\&quot;pretty ok\\&quot;  ....</li>
            <li>Works really well for my son, but does dry his face in areas.</li>
            <li>Personal Info: 23, Male, VERY oily, olive complected, skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had really embarrassing acne on my upper back.</li>
            <li>Wow, I forgot about this stuff, but back when I was 20-23-24 years old I was getting acne and could not get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>The tablets do nothing and the cream is less powerful than any off the shelf product from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>since starting...i have not had one major pimple.</li>
            <li>For more serious acne, and larger areas, I probably wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Pills don&#x27;t taste bad which is great, if you&#x27;re buying these as candy...</li>
            <li>My back is almost clear.</li>
            <li>I started taking the pills as directed, twice daily, and WOW.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son had tried several products.</li>
            <li>As expected, and product really works for my son.</li>
            <li>so its kind a expensive.</li>
            <li>The second thing we noticed was that the ones he was getting were FAR less severe and were healing much faster.</li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews on other sites and they have some of the same exact people posting the same reviews for this product as on amazon.  </li>
            <li>i barely have any left on my face.</li>
            <li>One of the biggest benefits is that there are no side effects and no long process for it to work.</li>
            <li>It worked at first, but the effects started to fade after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really clearing up my face and causing me to have less acne.  </li>
            <li>The pills didn&#x27;t do squat for me for the whole month and a half I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li>Once my face was clear I only took the pills every once in a while so a 10 dollar box lasted a really long time!</li>
            <li>I saw no changes...  good or bad.  </li>
            <li>person!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to eat a junk food or chocolate before because make my skin really bad, but now at least I&#x27;m able to eat some chocolate.</li>

            <li> but I didnt see any remarkable results using this product.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Adavanced Solutions facewash and spf15 lotion, the acne lotion worked, but not as good as</li>
            <li> But even though it is a good product to try.</li>
            <li> Cream did a good job at decreasing my breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream does a good job of drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes this product so good, but it is.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good for someone who just has sporadic breakouts.</li>
            <li> but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I am super happy!!!</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working ok, and I did a search on Amazon.com for it, and seen all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and what I like the most is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> but he smiles a lot more!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product isn&#x27;t advertised more because I wish we would of found it sooner!  </li>
            <li> but you will love this!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for more than 10 years!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be perfect for people with mild acne, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff</li>
            <li> and I have seen an amazing improvement.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> After reading all the amazing reviews, I went ahead and bought 5 packs.</li>
            <li> The vanishing cream is amazing, I am yet to see noticeable changes from the pills.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> A must have for me, and I&#x27;m glad I can find them now on Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> Incredibly effective product.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, really works.</li>
            <li> This product works 100% along with a good healthy diet.</li>
            <li> Always nice to have a homeopathic alternative.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within the estimated delivery time nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I will ALSO agree that the pills are kind of optional/</li>
            <li> The ingredients in the product were all perfectly harmless and the reviews were positive, but I also know that if something sounds too good to be true-it often isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> My pores clogs very easily, even by using lotion..</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really think the pills worked for me, but the cream that they include is very good.</li>
            <li> We have tried a lot of products, of course the most popular ones and none of them worked.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think the cream is more effective then the pills were.</li>
            <li> I think the nature cure cream was actually more effective then the pills.  </li>
            <li> By far the best product out there!</li>
            <li> The pills are working great for me, I don&#x27;t really use the cream.  </li>
            <li> Man am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> i have try everything this have to be the product with most results</li>
            <li> The Nature&#x27;s Cure and Zinc Gluconate combo has been an outstanding 1-2 punch for me against acne.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been acne free for YEARS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> face to face when I suddenly realized how GREAT his skin looked!</li>
            <li> My son ran out of this and literally pestered me into ordering him some more.</li>
            <li> He did say that he noticed much better results when he used both products together rather than when he forgot to take the pills but used the cream alone.</li>
            <li> would not recommend taking more then 4 a day)</li>
            <li> it works GREAT and very inexpensive compared to what we were using.</li>
            <li> I have even tried the womans version and love it.</li>
            <li> Made me break out even more...</li>
            <li> I feel more confident now taking selfies....</li>
            <li> Hopefully others have better luck with this product.</li>
            <li> The bp cream is better than most but still don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle cure</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and it works!  </li>
            <li> I believe the Acne Cream is the magic.</li>
            <li> But did not see a notable difference.</li>
            <li> This is a FABULOUS product!  </li>
            <li> My son uses this and if it wasn&#x27;t for your store, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It is way better than it was before I started.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna give it 5 stars if it clears even more.</li>
            <li> I would get a pimple here and there on my face, but I&#x27;m not getting as many on my face either now.</li>
            <li> AFTER you shower, the fading will be faster and your skin tone more even.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks now and most of my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> Also make sure you take the am/pm pills along with the cream to get the best results possible.</li>
            <li> I used this as a teenager, it worked better than anything out there, when my son started having break outs</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> and I have for sure seen improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> BUT I would say make sure u take them like they tell you to and dont skip a day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this acne treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not a miracle worker, but I think it sorta work?</li>
            <li> on it didn&#x27;t seem to get much better.</li>
            <li> My now 15-year-old son has now been using these pills for more than six months.</li>
            <li> The cream works like magic, not too sure about the tablets though because sometimes i forgot to eat them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way MORE oily because my face is trying to compensate</li>
            <li> Together, the cream and tablets seemed very effective at first (someone even commented on it), but the cream ran out very quickly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get good consistent results.  </li>
            <li> First off - the cream does a good job at drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m very confident about my self and become more positive</li>
            <li> the creme is very good not to mention the pills that works wonders internally...</li>
            <li> but on day 4 the clearing began and by day 14 my skin is 100% blemish free which I have never been able to say.  </li>
            <li> I combine it with \\&quot;Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash\\&quot; and I saw incredible results in only one week!</li>
            <li> The cream had some effect, but there are better products available.  </li>
            <li> and I can imagine that many people enjoy the convenience and privacy of monthly deliveries of their health items.</li>
            <li> so it really does work in combination with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool huh?\\&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> so you can easily distinguish when you&#x27;re suppose to take them -</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for anybody who has gone to a Dermatoligist for years (i&#x27;m 28, been going since I was 13).</li>
            <li> I didnt took the pills because I dont know whats in them, but I strongly recommend buying this product just for the Acne Cream.</li>
            <li> Highly suggested and and goes good under a coating of coco butter.</li>
            <li> Fine.  </li>
            <li> Second package was in great condition.     </li>
            <li> I gave it Two stars because its not worthless just BS markup</li>
            <li> and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> also use Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C alongside this product.</li>
            <li> I followed the regimen precisely.</li>
            <li> but the cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> working great the only thing that seems to work for me</li>
            <li> This is a product that we can no longer find in stores, so he was elated when I found it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> just wish they offered a subscribe and save option as I enjoy savings</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this company!!!</li>
            <li> , I noticed a difference after 2 or 3 days, then 1 week was even better, 2 weeks was more and going a month strong, almost completely clear, if I do get any breakouts, gone in a day almost.</li>
            <li> Original package was tampered with and part of it was stolen/lost.</li>
            <li> so i took 4 a day but started out with 2 a day to make sure there were no weird side affects(i</li>
            <li> which could ultimately lead to a successful product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see significant results in the beginning, but gradually my skin improved dramatically.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I only give it four stars because I still have a pack to go, and plan to buy more, but overall I am honestly impressed with this acne medication!</li>
            <li> have used this product previously and have seen wonderful results with consistent use.</li>
            <li> I tried this along with drinking a significant amount more water and my skin is clearer now than it has been my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it will be two full weeks since that day.</li>
            <li> Could be entirely coincidental or self-esteem related-but either way-it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> My niece wants to know how to get more.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good, but I can get 10% at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> Initially this product is good to treat my acne but after not using it, my acne appears again.</li>
            <li> It works and its the most gentle product like this in my opinion and experience.</li>
            <li> This is quite true for teenagers.  </li>
            <li> the ingredients in it all is very strong because my skin is betta very sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far he has only taken the medicine for a week and the results are truely amazing!!</li>
            <li> My skin get super oily and causes me to break out on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> a couple of years ago - I will agree with people that say it&#x27;s kind of gimmicky, or \\&quot;kind of\\</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews got me really excited</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li> I came across Nature&#x27;s Cure and decided it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my acne will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked was the cream.</li>
            <li> Worth a try though.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s been more than 3 months, and my skin is almost completely clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i think that it&#x27;s worth a try for everyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> I rarely miss a dose</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to him by a friend who had success with it.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot for those that are &amp;#34;desperate&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li> I say this product is worth a try</li>
            <li> So many positive reviews on Amazon so I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I used to have moderate - severe acne for more than 7 years, and no product gave significant results.</li>
            <li> some of the things I have tried is neutrogena acne stress relief, clean and clear acne free scrub, de la Cruz sulfur treatment.  </li>
            <li> I emailed them right away</li>
            <li> It came quickly and he is enjoying the same results as before.</li>
            <li> and I bought the female version for my teenage daughter and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon.com - this product worked</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product, I thought I had nothing to lose</li>
            <li> Now I didnt feel stressed about the medication because it is not complicated at all to take.</li>
            <li> years ago when I first purchased this product, I never thought \\&quot;nature\\&quot; could cure my breakouts.</li>
            <li> The first month after using the pills and cream twice per day, I did not see any results.</li>
            <li> I only wish more stores carried it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order online.</li>
            <li> But to cut to the chase i would recommend it to anyone with acne and wants it gone!</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t know and just found out reading a book about acne, is that benzoyl peroxide is heat sensitive and it&#x27;s important to keep it in the refrigerator.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I had redness and acn&amp;eacute; in my face.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin and the hot weather</li>
            <li> so I am pretty consistent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the cream the first time though, but I started using it now on my face.</li>
            <li> Most of the local retailers used to carry this - but then about 5 years ago they all stopped.  </li>
            <li> For about another $60, you can get that with .05% topical Retinol, even better - your skin will be smooth and natural again within 3-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has been using it for several months and it really works! :)</li>
            <li> But I am getting more because this is the only stuff that ended up working out for</li>
            <li> This product worked pretty well for my boyfriend who I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel the difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> He used this regimen in conjunction with the Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth Acne Treatment for Teens scrub and soap.</li>
            <li> Overall, I just dont get how it has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> if you read the active ingredients on the pack and you&#x27;ll find that 5% benzoyl won&#x27;t help reduce the acnes effectively as they said on advertisement.</li>
            <li> Though, like most, I wish they had an a la carte option - I have a whole lot of benzol peroxide left over</li>
            <li> First two weeks I did not notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> At first I was really wondering whether it will work or not, but for me it worked.</li>
            <li> so if you have a sensitive skin problem with dry skin and need lotion buy more!</li>
            <li> got it because of the good should of read the negative reviews first.</li>
            <li> Combined with a great facial cleanser (St. Ives green tea scrub), the Nature&#x27;s Cure Two Part Acne Treatment has worked very well for me!  </li>
            <li> everything works ok for a couple weeks, and then right back to baseline - infuriating doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it, but it&#x27;s more a resigned, depressed kind of fury at this point, after so much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so well I absolutely had to write about it.  </li>
            <li> But this treatment is really working well for me.</li>
            <li> The product is working very well , thank you .</li>
            <li> &quot; through immune system seemed like a reasonable concept.  </li>
            <li> the try - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I started using Oxy wash and that has some very favorable results.</li>
            <li> Seem to be working very well.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful this product would work for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really buy a stuff in Amazon and shipping</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within a couple days of using this, my acne really improved a lot</li>
            <li> Vanishing cremed dint really use, was very watery.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it really helps my skin.  </li>
            <li> Ehh, the pills dont really do anything.</li>
            <li> When applying dont put too much.</li>
            <li> Im telling you is real.</li>
            <li> Took it for almost a month straight.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this for 2 months on the recommendation of a friend and his skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li> All i know is that it worked very well for me</li>
            <li> there is no words to explain how much this has helped me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to say about the pills.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t really do all that much for me.</li>
            <li> The pills had no effect for the whole 2.5 to 3 months that I took them.</li>
            <li> so if the price isnt much to you.</li>
            <li> Ordered this acne cream and A months dosage of pills its seems to be working really well</li>
            <li> If you know of anyone who has had any type of copmplection issues this is a product that really, really does work.</li>
            <li> so we really like the brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has not used the vanishing cream much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that this product is doing absolutely nothing for me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference using this product</li>
            <li> I used to use this product during my adolescent years and remember that it worked very well.</li>
            <li> or so it was getting progressively worse - more pain, more frequency, scarring, etc.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on the surface were totally gone and his skin was so SOFT and healthy looking.     </li>
            <li> Using a popular off-the-shelf skin moisturizer, it&#x27;s stopped major breakouts and limited ones that were going to appear.  </li>
            <li> AFTER NC:The first thing we both noticed was that the rate of new ones dropped drastically, I&#x27;d say about an 80% drop.</li>
            <li> Cream is strong and overuse will dry out your face - but it does work.</li>
            <li> His acne is clearing up very quickly and he has no new outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty resistant acne though, so I&#x27;m surprised that this helped at all.</li>
            <li> We have only try for two weeks and so far, the face lotion with the pills seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> BEFORE Nature&#x27;s Cure(NC):no matter what we tried topically, his skin was fairly \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; even where no pimples had erupted, he would get 4 or 5 new ones a day, and at any given time he&#x27;d have 4 or 5 previous ones that he was trying to heal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s with mild acne (with occasional flare ups) and have been on Proactiv for years.  </li>
            <li> My son has mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> The acne cream that it came with did a decent job though.</li>
            <li> Ive seen a decent difference in my acne</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> I can only say that it was helpful because he was only consistent with taking them for the first 2wks then after that he rarely took them.</li>
            <li> The pills dont do anything, but I already take a high end multivitamin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried this product years ago, beginning of high school?  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for any stage of compection isues.</li>
            <li> But after two months my skin really started to clear up.</li>
            <li> His skin is clear once again thanks to Natures Cure.</li>
            <li> He is 18 years old and loves this product, he told me that he has not had a problem with his back acne since starting this (though most has cleared up,some doesn&#x27;t go away FULLY, but it will help with itchiness and swelling).</li>
            <li> and I love that it isn&#x27;t any harsh chemicals going into his body and on his face.</li>
            <li> no complaint&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> All of my adult life I&#x27;ve had mild to moderate outbreaks of acne and I tried lots of OTC medicines but nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I would really reccommend this product and the best part is that it is not as expensive as other products.</li>
            <li> and they sent me out a new one that day.</li>
            <li> I live</li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t live without it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> At least I look kind of young still.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this acne treatment actually worked, i will definitely buy again, it was overall a pretty good buy, and i would recommend this to anyone willing to wait for a slow pace acne recovery system..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear as a bell!  </li>
            <li> I tried it years ago when I first started but all it seemed to do was leave white residue on my face.</li>
            <li> My acne and skin is exactly the same since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> in the first week blemishes were starting to disappear and it seems like my acne marks are also disappearing.</li>
            <li> And on occasion I even break out more than usual.</li>
            <li> The key is to use it consistently and remember that it takes time to start working.</li>
            <li> but now this product and the facial cleanser is really helping me get rid of my scars an acne!</li>
            <li> Give it several weeks, but stay consistent drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Facial scrubs made my face \\&quot;feel\\&quot; clean but did nothing for the actual acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok, so for a little back story - I have had acne for about 15 years - started in high school, and I am 30 now - I have come to terms with the fact that I will just have oily skin until I&#x27;m 100.</li>
            <li> When I use it consistently my face is almost always clear or occasionally (1 or 2 a month)</li>
            <li> Its been about a month and a half of using this product pretty consistently.</li>
            <li> , the cream is the ONLY proper mixture of BOTH benzoil peroxide to dry the skin and THEN herbal moisturizers to keep the skin from needing to crank out more oil that I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> and I would continue my search for a product that would clear up his acne with out horriable side effects.  </li>
            <li> BUT without this product my skin would not be as clear as it is.</li>
            <li> And I know its Nature&#x27;s Cure keeping my face clear because whenever I run out (it&#x27;s not sold anywhere</li>
            <li> I reccomend water sence when you trying to clear up</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;m still waiting to see how much it&#x27;ll clear up.</li>
            <li> After a couple days on this product, my skin was COMPLETELY CLEAR.</li>
            <li> Never help clear out the acne.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> murad, proactiv, klear action, clearasil, stridex, retin-a, etc.  </li>
            <li> I am 18 years old, and a freshman in college.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help my 15 year old son with his acne and read the reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> We marked my son&#x27;s \\&quot;start date\\&quot; on the calendar and tomorrow</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li> The box says the pills are marked AM and PM</li>
            <li> well, i bought this is because it says this product cures/diminishes acnes in a natural way.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s 30 years old</li>
            <li> and it s natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not drinking soda or sugary drinks just water and Natural juices sometimes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d like is a supply of the pills and the pills alone as I don&#x27;t really care for the ointment.</li>
            <li> it really lightens it but takes a while to totally vanish it..</li>
            <li> My 13 yr old son has been using it about a month</li>
            <li> I am adult with acne.</li>
            <li> (I had to use quite a bit, but regardless, I can&#x27;t see the creme lasting a whole month), and from then</li>
            <li> It really depends on your skin type and personal needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for my acne and now purchased it for my 13 year old son.  </li>
            <li> Well, so far ive been taking the pills 15 days and havent see any progress.</li>
            <li> I encourage anyone to try this product as a cheaper alternative to the above acne solutions and recommend it to the minority of people that haven&#x27;t had success with the big names.</li>
            <li> But the price was minimal and worth the risk.    </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products (sulfur, different homeopathy, soaps, buck-thorn oils, creams, etc) and this is the only product that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> we have wasted so much money on so many other products.  </li>
            <li> I would probably strongly recommend this product if you have a small amount of surface acne.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot mind you, and maybe it&#x27;s just that his self-confidence is improving as his skin does, but he&#x27;s been more easy going and less snippy at his siblings than usual.</li>
            <li> It is not a magic solution but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I rarely get pimples now and the ones I do are small and go away fast.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but upon re-reading my first review, I&#x27;m seeing the same improvement in his moodiness (when he&#x27;s using the product)that</li>
            <li> at first I thought they could be related to using my daily meds...NOT!  </li>
            <li> I hope nature&#x27;s cure never changes their formula, and is around for at least a few more decades, because I am a loyal fan at this point...</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Cure has no side-effects except a little dry skin on my face, which is ok.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this simple system.  </li>
            <li> that finds the proper benzoil peroxide/natural moisturizer mix for a topical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coupled this with natural tea-tree oil soap, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, as my face wash, and for the first time in the last half of my life, my skin looks what I would call \\&quot;pretty ok\\&quot;  ....</li>
            <li> Works really well for my son, but does dry his face in areas.</li>
            <li> Personal Info: 23, Male, VERY oily, olive complected, skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had really embarrassing acne on my upper back.</li>
            <li> Wow, I forgot about this stuff, but back when I was 20-23-24 years old I was getting acne and could not get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> The tablets do nothing and the cream is less powerful than any off the shelf product from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> since starting...i have not had one major pimple.</li>
            <li> For more serious acne, and larger areas, I probably wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Pills don&#x27;t taste bad which is great, if you&#x27;re buying these as candy...</li>
            <li> My back is almost clear.</li>
            <li> I started taking the pills as directed, twice daily, and WOW.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son had tried several products.</li>
            <li> As expected, and product really works for my son.</li>
            <li> so its kind a expensive.</li>
            <li> The second thing we noticed was that the ones he was getting were FAR less severe and were healing much faster.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews on other sites and they have some of the same exact people posting the same reviews for this product as on amazon.  </li>
            <li> i barely have any left on my face.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest benefits is that there are no side effects and no long process for it to work.</li>
            <li> It worked at first, but the effects started to fade after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really clearing up my face and causing me to have less acne.  </li>
            <li> The pills didn&#x27;t do squat for me for the whole month and a half I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> Once my face was clear I only took the pills every once in a while so a 10 dollar box lasted a really long time!</li>
            <li> I saw no changes...  good or bad.  </li>
            <li> person!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to eat a junk food or chocolate before because make my skin really bad, but now at least I&#x27;m able to eat some chocolate.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it makes my skin super dry, to the point where it is very noticable and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and I nearly stopped using the product due to pain and sensitivity,</li>
            <li> What I want to know is how much these people are being paid to give positive reviews for a mediocre product.  </li>
            <li> Within a month, I have maybe one or two single breakouts, but they don&#x27;t last as long, and the scars from prior to taking this are now starting to fade.</li>
            <li> After the first couple of days watching him (just in case he had any negative side effects from the tablets, which he did not)I forgot all about it.</li>
            <li> I use it with a heavy-duty body brush, and cover the surface with the acne cream when showering - leaving the lather on long enough to soak into my pores, and kill the bacteria in my skin that causes problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not commenting on the product itself yet since my son hasn&#x27;t been taking it long enough to comment yet.  </li>
            <li> The first month was slow but started showing results.</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my fourteen year old son and he has been taking it for less than a week</li>
            <li> Literally, his complexion made a vast improvement over night, and in a few days his skin is perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> Still get occasional tiny breakouts but its expected.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, what works for one person might not work for other people.</li>
            <li> Due to health reasons I have been breaking out again recently and decided to go back with what I knew worked</li>
            <li> so I was using this to get rid of minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> not only physcally but mentally.</li>
            <li> (He had noticed long before I did because he obsesses about his face every day)</li>
            <li> I do get the expected occasional pimple every once and awhile.</li>
            <li> but they are NOT marked AM / PM...</li>
            <li> My back was pretty bad and now it doesn&#x27;t break out much.</li>
            <li> problem with all of these treatments is that they&#x27;re all topical and don&#x27;t correct the imbalances within the body due stress, etc.  </li>
            <li> The cream is a little bit drying so he only uses occasionally.</li>
            <li> &quot; the same thing as other benzoil peroxide creams, and</li>
            <li> just with I could have the money back for all the other bajillion crappy ineffective things I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 weeks ago because I had really bad acne going at the time and now 3 weeks later my skin looks way better.  </li>
            <li> this product does cause your skin to dry up, but i will take that over acne any day.</li>
            <li> Also makes skin dry?</li>
            <li> Never worked and it made my face really dry</li>
            <li> No new acne recurring anymore after i using this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t miss a single dose.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see if it will still work on the long run.</li>
            <li> and i am only half way with the product.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed that this happened especially since I&#x27;ve ordered this product many times now.</li>
            <li> I got my order in less than a week and have been taking it religiously ever since.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dry when using topical medication.</li>
            <li> As I got a better routine down with the tablets and the cream (tablet in the morning after breakfast and another one in the evening before bed along with applying cream after a shower in the morning, if I get sweaty or dirty during the day and before bed at night).</li>
            <li> I expected it to be some bogus treatment just like everything else I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> In only a few days I notice my skin clearing up.</li>
            <li> be careful of the cream as it will bleach out any color from cloth it touches,</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the few products out there that does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> Which i expected of corse.</li>
            <li> I had used this product and had success when all else failed.</li>
            <li> Acne has gone down substantially, I would recommend using a moisturizer after applying the cream as it seems to dry out my skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> this product should be only used for males 20 and older, i believe it is only used for a dirty face, if you&#x27;re a teenager i believe your breakouts are due to hormones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately two weeks now, and I am totally clear!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> the other had 14 with, and 16 without.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d say this worsened the condition, but it definitely did not help at ALL.</li>
            <li> Every other benzoil peroxide cream dries the hell out of my skin, and by the end of the day</li>
            <li> it might dry out your skin a little</li>
            <li> I truly believe in this product - the pills work for me - since using, I have very few facial or body pimple break outs.  </li>
            <li> Now, he STILL has some pimples, but they are random and small, and it hadn&#x27;t even been two full weeks</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but this helped clear up my son&#x27;s acne on his face, chest and back.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, my back was not breaking out nearly half as much, and those that did break out were smaller and less painful.</li>
            <li> All of them left my skin oily or dry or irritated and none stopped future breakouts from happening plus they were quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in local stores</li>
            <li> but i figured that was for a average person 5&#x27;10&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is just your average vanishing cream plus sugar pills.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re tried plenty of other products with little to no success, then I suggest you give this a</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 16-year-old and they seem to have calmed down his acne would recommend</li>
            <li> other part, the all-natural pills -- they work!</li>
            <li> down side is acne - horrible in high school - still not great since - EVERY product, cure, herb, cream, pill, diet regimen, EVERY idea for curing acne pretty much on the planet earth, I have tried - hundreds, thousands of dollars....and no dice -</li>
            <li> The pill/vitamin portion of this is bologna and the cream is just your average benzoyl peroxide you can buy in any drugstore for less, if you get the store brand.</li>
            <li> so I just eat one everyday with my other meds.</li>
            <li> i agree with a few of these other review, saying that the cream doesnt seem like it lasts all month.</li>
            <li> My acne became less and less noticeable during the proceeding 6 months.</li>
            <li> in 2 weeks half of it was gone thank the lord.</li>
            <li> Half of the product is smeared on the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> 3 days and EVERY SINGLE PIMPLE IS GOOONE!!!!</li>
            <li> And in those two wks there was a little difference.</li>
            <li> The last couple of years it&#x27;s gotten slightly worse.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The cream dried and damaged my skin.</li>
            <li> Missing the vanishing cream.</li>
            <li> After one month, my face actually got worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few dermatologists and they all say I have hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> my face starts to develop acne within a few days.</li>
            <li> and it would be a waste to throw it away.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all for me waste of money</li>
            <li> The first few days of using the pills and cream my acne got twice as bad</li>
            <li> I break out heavily on my back when stressed; painful enough to cause problems when driving or carrying a backpack.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t really have a bad acne problem</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work for someone who really has it bad.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from acne, but for the past 8 months</li>
            <li> Tablets are chewable and it&#x27;s just a twice a day commitment and doesn&#x27;t require multiple steps and products like the expensive Proactive or a $130.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 3 of these at a time for my partner who, without them, has moderate-to-severe acne.</li>
            <li> no better acne treatment on the market.</li>
            <li> Product did not work, waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken Minocycline and Tetracycline before and those pills made me sick to my stomach and very dizzy.</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared it up in two days and he&#x27;s had very few pimples since.</li>
            <li> I guess i am just one of the few that will have to wait out the acne instead of using products to get rid of them because i have seriously tried everything.  </li>
            <li> He hardly touched the cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would not cure, but at least help control my acne.</li>
            <li> After a few years, I noticed Proactiv was really irritating my skin and</li>
            <li> It was extremely frustrating and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t do any harm to your body, might work slow but it works.</li>
            <li> It starts to work slowly</li>
            <li> I mean if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> My acne wasn&#x27;t that bad when I started but taking to pills made it far worse.</li>
            <li> spray not good for peice</li>
            <li> but I know the side effect is very bad but works really well (they said)</li>
            <li> I seemed to get worse</li>
            <li> It has stopped the painful pimples and the blemishes have toned down a lot in a couple of months use.</li>
            <li> I believe if he continued taking them like he should then there would have been a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I been having a horrible acne since when I was 15years old, (now I&#x27;m 20)</li>
            <li> I wanted it so badly to work for me, but it cannot be forced.</li>
            <li> We had tried a number of treatments and this is the only thing that has helped my son&#x27;s horrible acne.</li>
            <li> This product is like a fake proactiv, and proactiv is garbage.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about the pill, but since i am proof that this works...i wont question it.</li>
            <li> I thought she was weird for buying me these naturopathic pills, but I have to say that this product has saved my life.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist were unable to help him but Nature&#x27;s Cure truly works.</li>
            <li> We were so sad to see it no longer on the store shelves.  </li>
            <li> - I cannot use salicylic acid, as it makes me break out to an extreme, even horrifying degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wash is almost unnecessary for him, but he says he will use it if he is having a bad acne day.</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s also terribly unsightly, and knocks down one&#x27;s self-esteem;</li>
            <li> My grandson who has had terrible acne for the past 4 years was timid and shy because he looked so bad.</li>
            <li> my son has bad acne and this seems to be doing the trick to get rid of it</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son who started getting bad acne.</li>
            <li> Frustrated with my situation, I decided to give Nature&#x27;s Cure a try.  </li>
            <li> My stepmother was an aestethician, and even she was frustrated with her inability to get things under control with her help.</li>
            <li> The doctor said that if Minocycle won&#x27;t help, we should start Accutane, which is known for very bad side effects.</li>
            <li> very bad product, don&#x27;t recommended to my fiend</li>
            <li> so I always shop via Amazon and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> and i was completely disappointed!</li>
            <li> im sorry, my son HAD acne!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have horrible acne</li>
            <li> this product is terrible</li>
            <li> I also had awful breakouts during puberty as well, despite how well I took care of my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my first review on Amazon.com - this product worked so well I absolutely had to write about it.  I have always suffered from acne, but for the past 8 months or so it was getting progressively worse - more pain, more frequency, scarring, etc.  I have tried many other products (sulfur, different homeopathy, soaps, buck-thorn oils, creams, etc) and this is the only product that worked for me.  The first few days of using the pills and cream my acne got twice as bad and I nearly stopped using the product due to pain and sensitivity, but on day 4 the clearing began and by day 14 my skin is 100% blemish free which I have never been able to say.  Side note: homeopathic skin treatments seem to work well for me.</li>
            <li> some of the things I have tried is neutrogena acne stress relief, clean and clear acne free scrub, de la Cruz sulfur treatment.  Out of all of them I didn&#x27;t get good consistent results.  But this treatment is really working well for me. It&#x27;s really clearing up my face and causing me to have less acne.  I bought this 3 weeks ago because I had really bad acne going at the time and now 3 weeks later my skin looks way better.  The pills are working great for me, I don&#x27;t really use the cream.  I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> I dont think this actually helped me as I still have pimples.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have horrible acne but my forehead has always been oily and I get flair ups and get some natsty ones once in a while.  The last couple of years it&#x27;s gotten slightly worse.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous things over the years.  Clearasil cream, pads, various 3 part systems, washing my face numerous times a day, etc.  Nothing worked.  I stumbled on this on sale tucked away in a bottom shelf at the store.  Thought I&#x27;d try it.  Taking the pills alone my skin has totally cleared up and I haven&#x27;t had any blemishes.  This is one of the best homeopathic products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> my son has bad acne and this seems to be doing the trick to get rid of it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first. The only way I found out about this product was at Rite-Aid with 1 bottle of the Body spray. It seemed to be working ok, and I did a search on Amazon.com for it, and seen all the great reviews. So for $10, I was like why not?  Man am I glad I did. Amazing stuff, I noticed a difference after 2 or 3 days, then 1 week was even better, 2 weeks was more and going a month strong, almost completely clear, if I do get any breakouts, gone in a day almost. Strongly recommended for anybody who has gone to a Dermatoligist for years (i&#x27;m 28, been going since I was 13). Tried Retina, tretinoin, differin, all topicals, oral prescripts. Proactiv and others over the counter. I use Neutrogena Adavanced Solutions facewash and spf15 lotion, the acne lotion worked, but not as good as natures cure lotion.(almost the same, but natures cure has twice the benzoyl peroxide and additional aloe for cooling) with Natures Cure 2 step process. I&#x27;m sold.    Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 71 and started to have zits on my face.  This product has reduced the breakout substantially.</li>
            <li> Original package was tampered with and part of it was stolen/lost. I emailed them right away and they sent me out a new one that day. Second package was in great condition.     Thank you!</li>
            <li> this stuff actually works. i can see the difference in my acne. i barely have any left on my face. and i am only half way with the product. i have try everything this have to be the product with most results</li>
            <li> my son has acne. im sorry, my son HAD acne!!! 3 days and EVERY SINGLE PIMPLE IS GOOONE!!!! will buy this product forever!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my twenties so I was using this to get rid of minor breakouts. The pill/vitamin portion of this is bologna and the cream is just your average benzoyl peroxide you can buy in any drugstore for less, if you get the store brand. Its all the same stuff, don&#x27;t fall for this marketing ploy. I gave it Two stars because its not worthless just BS markup</li>
            <li> The product is working very well , thank you .</li>
            <li> Like many others, I was a bit skeptical of the homeopathic concept when it came to acne treatment.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s with mild acne (with occasional flare ups) and have been on Proactiv for years.  After a few years, I noticed Proactiv was really irritating my skin and my face ended up really red and I was starting to break out again.    Frustrated with my situation, I decided to give Nature&#x27;s Cure a try.  Working from the \\&quot;inside out\\&quot; through immune system seemed like a reasonable concept.  First two weeks I did not notice much of a difference.  So I decided to also supplement with 50 mg of Zinc Gluconate daily which helps boost your immune system (and has been shown in studies to help with acne).    WOW.  I&#x27;m on week 7 now and my skin is in GREAT shape.  I rarely get pimples now and the ones I do are small and go away fast.  The Nature&#x27;s Cure and Zinc Gluconate combo has been an outstanding 1-2 punch for me against acne.  The Nature&#x27;s Cure triggers my immune system to respond, the Zinc boosts the efficacy of my immune system and also helps wound healing.      It&#x27;s definitely worth the try - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! My son has suffered with acne for a couple of years. We have tried a lot of products, of course the most popular ones and none of them worked. I started to research various products online.  I came across Nature&#x27;s Cure and decided it was worth a try.  I mean if it didn&#x27;t work I was only out $11 and I would continue my search for a product that would clear up his acne with out horriable side effects.  So far he has only taken the medicine for a week and the results are truely amazing!! His acne is clearing up very quickly and he has no new outbreaks.  Not only has it made a difference in his skin but he smiles a lot more! I can&#x27;t believe this product isn&#x27;t advertised more because I wish we would of found it sooner!  I would recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> It works for me. I combine it with \\&quot;Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash\\&quot; and I saw incredible results in only one week! I am super happy!!! I will keep on using this product since this is the only one that has worked for me!!! Of course keep in mind that what works for me might not work for you. But even though it is a good product to try.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my son, but does dry his face in areas.</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews got me really excited but it didnt get rid of anything for me.  I guess i am just one of the few that will have to wait out the acne instead of using products to get rid of them because i have seriously tried everything.  3 stars for the price</li>
            <li> It worked at first, but the effects started to fade after a few weeks. I have pretty resistant acne though, so I&#x27;m surprised that this helped at all. I&#x27;m sure it would be perfect for people with mild acne, just not for me. 3/5</li>
            <li> There are several acne treatment solutions out there and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them...murad, proactiv, klear action, clearasil, stridex, retin-a, etc.  All of them left my skin oily or dry or irritated and none stopped future breakouts from happening plus they were quite expensive.  I think I&#x27;m the minority in which months of proactiv did not help stop future breakouts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem with all of these treatments is that they&#x27;re all topical and don&#x27;t correct the imbalances within the body due stress, etc.  When I first saw this product, I thought I had nothing to lose and it was cheap.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for months.  Using a popular off-the-shelf skin moisturizer, it&#x27;s stopped major breakouts and limited ones that were going to appear.  The results I had with this product compared to the ones above were the difference between night and day.  I believe the tablets helped cure the body&#x27;s internal imbalances, which were ultimately leading to breakouts that topical creams could not stop.  I encourage anyone to try this product as a cheaper alternative to the above acne solutions and recommend it to the minority of people that haven&#x27;t had success with the big names.</li>
            <li> I have no ideas if the pills work. But it tastes alright so I just eat one everyday with my other meds.</li>
            <li> Miracle treatment for severe acne. We had tried a number of treatments and this is the only thing that has helped my son&#x27;s horrible acne. Great product.</li>
            <li> Does not make any difference. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i had severe acne. i had tried multiple products before but none made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;after taking this product, i noticed a difference. not only physcally but mentally. Now I didnt feel stressed about the medication because it is not complicated at all to take. Just take the pill and you dont have to worry about cleansers, toners, etc. I would really reccommend this product and the best part is that it is not as expensive as other products.</li>
            <li> I am 18 years old, and a freshman in college. I saw Nature&#x27;s cure at my local wal-mart while trying to decide on what acne treatment product to try next (None of them ever work). When I saw this, I was intrigued by the fact that it&#x27;s a pill, not a topical cream or wash. So, on a whim, I bought it. I expected it to be some bogus treatment just like everything else I&#x27;ve ever tried (I&#x27;ve been experimenting with acne treatment for years). I started taking the pills as directed, twice daily, and WOW. In only a few days I notice my skin clearing up. I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately two weeks now, and I am totally clear!! I haven&#x27;t been acne free for YEARS! All that&#x27;s left on my face are the scars from years of pimple popping. This product is the real deal. I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son who started getting bad acne. He is 18 years old and loves this product, he told me that he has not had a problem with his back acne since starting this (though most has cleared up,some doesn&#x27;t go away FULLY, but it will help with itchiness and swelling). The wash is almost unnecessary for him, but he says he will use it if he is having a bad acne day. So the product works!! Ty natures cure!</li>
            <li> FINALLY, after years and years of trying acne products I find one that actually does something for me. It&#x27;s been a week and I have seen an amazing improvement. Can&#x27;t wait until the end of the month supply. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used carefully following but have not got any results at the end of the month. The cream irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything for my son&#x27;s moderate acne on his face. This stuff cleared it up in two days and he&#x27;s had very few pimples since. He hardly touched the cream. The pills do the trick. I just wish you could order only the pills because we are going to have a ton of tubes of cream left.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help my 15 year old son with his acne and read the reviews on this product. Knowing that hormones and genetic makeup have a lot to do with persistent skin problems, it only made sense to use a product that worked on both the inside (where they start) and the outside. The ingredients in the product were all perfectly harmless and the reviews were positive, but I also know that if something sounds too good to be true-it often isn&#x27;t true. But the price was minimal and worth the risk.    We marked my son&#x27;s \\&quot;start date\\&quot; on the calendar and tomorrow it will be two full weeks since that day. He and I both are totally AMAZED.   BEFORE Nature&#x27;s Cure(NC):no matter what we tried topically, his skin was fairly \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; even where no pimples had erupted, he would get 4 or 5 new ones a day, and at any given time he&#x27;d have 4 or 5 previous ones that he was trying to heal/dry out/deal with too.   AFTER NC:The first thing we both noticed was that the rate of new ones dropped drastically, I&#x27;d say about an 80% drop. The second thing we noticed was that the ones he was getting were FAR less severe and were healing much faster. After the first couple of days watching him (just in case he had any negative side effects from the tablets, which he did not)I forgot all about it. A couple of days ago he was talking to me face to face when I suddenly realized how GREAT his skin looked! My eyes widened and he stopped in the middle of a sentence and asked \\&quot;What?\\&quot; I grinned and said \\&quot;Can I touch your face?\\&quot; He grinned and said \\&quot;Yeah! It&#x27;s cool huh?\\&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t believe it! The \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on the surface were totally gone and his skin was so SOFT and healthy looking.     Now, he STILL has some pimples, but they are random and small, and it hadn&#x27;t even been two full weeks before there was a visible difference to others. (He had noticed long before I did because he obsesses about his face every day) And maybe I&#x27;m just imagining this part-but I&#x27;d SWEAR that the tablets, which are supposed to help counteract the stressful hormones that cause acne, have improved his moodiness! Not a whole lot mind you, and maybe it&#x27;s just that his self-confidence is improving as his skin does, but he&#x27;s been more easy going and less snippy at his siblings than usual. Either way I&#x27;m SO thankful for this product and my son has already asked me to reorder it so he doesn&#x27;t run out.    VERY impressed, and VERY satisfied.    UPDATE- 2/18/2011    My son ran out of this and literally pestered me into ordering him some more. It came quickly and he is enjoying the same results as before. He did say that he noticed much better results when he used both products together rather than when he forgot to take the pills but used the cream alone. Not only that, but upon re-reading my first review, I&#x27;m seeing the same improvement in his moodiness (when he&#x27;s using the product)that I noted before. Could be entirely coincidental or self-esteem related-but either way-it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old son. I can only say that it was helpful because he was only consistent with taking them for the first 2wks then after that he rarely took them. And in those two wks there was a little difference. The pills worked well along with using the cream. I believe if he continued taking them like he should then there would have been a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I dont understand the great ratings. This product is like a fake proactiv, and proactiv is garbage. The cream dried and damaged my skin. The pills dont do anything, but I already take a high end multivitamin. Overall, I just dont get how it has so many positive reviews. I started using Oxy wash and that has some very favorable results.</li>
            <li> Personal Info: 23, Male, VERY oily, olive complected, skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago when I first purchased this product, I never thought \\&quot;nature\\&quot; could cure my breakouts. I decided to go ahead and follow the rave reviews of this product, giving Nature Cure&#x27;s homeopathic remedy a chance. The first month after using the pills and cream twice per day, I did not see any results. But after two months my skin really started to clear up. My acne became less and less noticeable during the proceeding 6 months. 2 years later... it is still working. I do get the expected occasional pimple every once and awhile. BUT without this product my skin would not be as clear as it is. People actually ask me how my skin is so \\&quot;flawless.\\&quot; I tell them to give this product a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note:&lt;br /&gt;I also use Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C alongside this product. It&#x27;s also a reason my acne has cleared up.</li>
            <li> Missing the vanishing cream. I received the box completely open with only the pills. There was no cream in the box. Extremely disappointed that this happened especially since I&#x27;ve ordered this product many times now.</li>
            <li> First off - the cream does a good job at drying out your skin. My skin get super oily and causes me to break out on my forehead. Cream did a good job at decreasing my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills though... The box says the pills are marked AM and PM so you can easily distinguish when you&#x27;re suppose to take them - but they are NOT marked AM / PM... Some have a couple letters on them, some dont. And the ratio between the ones with letters and without are NOT the same. one pack had like 13 with, and 17 without. the other had 14 with, and 16 without. So the instructions on the box do not match up with the product. I dont think i&#x27;ll be taking these....</li>
            <li> If you have a teenager with acne.... save them from some embarrassment.  This product is inexpensive and works amazingly well!  Both of my son&#x27;s used (one still does) this and I sent my niece the Female treatment.  My niece wants to know how to get more.  I only wish more stores carried it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order online.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but this helped clear up my son&#x27;s acne on his face, chest and back. If he forgets to take it he gets flare ups. so it really does work in combination with a good cleanser. Very happy to buy off amazon. used to have this in stores, but no longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son and the results are awesome.  We really like the tablets; it seemed like they started working in a few days.  The cream is a little bit drying so he only uses occasionally. Now if I could just get him to remember to take them every day.</li>
            <li> well, i bought this is because it says this product cures/diminishes acnes in a natural way. however, after taking the pills almost for 3 weeks and theres no any improvements on my face. (it turned out that the pills are just sugar candy)and the acne treatment gel included in this pack is actually working for nothing. if you read the active ingredients on the pack and you&#x27;ll find that 5% benzoyl won&#x27;t help reduce the acnes effectively as they said on advertisement.</li>
            <li> This , Product is great, I bought this stuff for , my son , and let me tell you it works . My son takes two pills,in morning, two at night . The cream , he uses only on the stubborn pimples . But my son is happy , and me too .</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about two weeks now. since starting...i have not had one major pimple. i was skeptical about the pill, but since i am proof that this works...i wont question it. i agree with a few of these other review, saying that the cream doesnt seem like it lasts all month. the amount is pretty small. but i havent ran out yet. this product does cause your skin to dry up, but i will take that over acne any day. i will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had really embarrassing acne on my upper back. I took 2 pills in the morning and 2 pills at night along with the cream provided, and it is starting to disappear rapidly. in 2 weeks half of it was gone thank the lord. the box says only take 2 pills a day but i figured that was for a average person 5&#x27;10&#x27;&#x27; 170LBS, i am 6&#x27;5&#x27;&#x27; 220LBS so i took 4 a day but started out with 2 a day to make sure there were no weird side affects(i would not recommend taking more then 4 a day) But to cut to the chase i would recommend it to anyone with acne and wants it gone!</li>
            <li> Only been on the pills for three weeks.  Seem to be working very well.</li>
            <li> After trying numerous more expensive products my wife bought these for me. I thought she was weird for buying me these naturopathic pills, but I have to say that this product has saved my life. Nothing else I have tried works this well, and I cannot go without them. A must have for me, and I&#x27;m glad I can find them now on Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful this product would work for me. After reading all the amazing reviews, I went ahead and bought 5 packs. After one month, my face actually got worse. I stuck with it anyway, and now it&#x27;s been 4 months of use, and my face hasn&#x27;t improved. I&#x27;ve seen a few dermatologists and they all say I have hormonal acne. Looks like accutane it is...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 4 solid days In. Although my acne hasn&#x27;t vanished, I feel it&#x27;s drying out my skin ( reducing oil) which could ultimately lead to a successful product. I give it a 5 because I truly feel my Acne will be gone by next week</li>
            <li> All of my adult life I&#x27;ve had mild to moderate outbreaks of acne and I tried lots of OTC medicines but nothing seemed to work. Facial scrubs made my face \\&quot;feel\\&quot; clean but did nothing for the actual acne.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Nature&#x27;s Cure about 10 years ago and have used it since. When I use it consistently my face is almost always clear or occasionally (1 or 2 a month) I&#x27;ll have a red bump pop up on my face. And I know its Nature&#x27;s Cure keeping my face clear because whenever I run out (it&#x27;s not sold anywhere I live so I have to order it online) my face starts to develop acne within a few days. As I type this I&#x27;m about a week without NC and my face is getting splotchy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I never use the creme that comes with it. I tried it years ago when I first started but all it seemed to do was leave white residue on my face. The pills alone work great for me, I throw the creme away.</li>
            <li> The vanishing cream is amazing, I am yet to see noticeable changes from the pills.</li>
            <li> This does work if used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful of the cream as it will bleach out any color from cloth it touches,</li>
            <li> I have bought proactive for my teen son for years. A friend of his had left some at our house and my son tried it. it works GREAT and very inexpensive compared to what we were using. I have even tried the womans version and love it. Just keep it away from your eyes but you will love this!</li>
            <li> Those this product work on women ?</li>
            <li> this acne treatment actually worked, i will definitely buy again, it was overall a pretty good buy, and i would recommend this to anyone willing to wait for a slow pace acne recovery system..</li>
            <li> this product is terrible I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and nothing has changed i do not recommend buying</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this company!!! Now I&#x27;m very confident about my self and become more positive person!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to eat a junk food or chocolate before because make my skin really bad, but now at least I&#x27;m able to eat some chocolate. I been having a horrible acne since when I was 15years old, (now I&#x27;m 20) and I try a lot of product and went to dermatologist but didn&#x27;t work at all. I was about to try acuten but I know the side effect is very bad but works really well (they said) but I just decided to  try this product since the review was great. I wish they sale this in local store such a king soopers or wal-mart becasue I don&#x27;t really buy a stuff in Amazon and shipping was like $6 so its kind a expensive.</li>
            <li> Incredibly effective product. Cleared my acne, blackheads, and oily skin. Though, like most, I wish they had an a la carte option - I have a whole lot of benzol peroxide left over and it would be a waste to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Made me break out even more... My acne wasn&#x27;t that bad when I started but taking to pills made it far worse. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d say this worsened the condition, but it definitely did not help at ALL. Pills don&#x27;t taste bad which is great, if you&#x27;re buying these as candy...</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within a couple days of using this, my acne really improved a lot and if I continue using it I&#x27;m sure my acne will be completely gone. The problem is that it makes my skin super dry, to the point where it is very noticable and uncomfortable. So I will have to find a way to alternate between this and a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product. I bout this product for my nepthew. He is now 19. He have been big issue with his acne. It works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week 2 haven&#x27;t seen any difference but I ll be optimistic giving this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I  bought this for my fourteen year old son and he has been taking it for less than a week but his skin has improved dramatically.  One thing I didn&#x27;t know and just found out reading a book about acne, is that benzoyl peroxide is heat sensitive and it&#x27;s important to keep it in the refrigerator.  I do highly recommend this simple system.  Tablets are chewable and it&#x27;s just a twice a day commitment and doesn&#x27;t require multiple steps and products like the expensive Proactive or a $130. dermatologist visit (before buying a prescription) does.</li>
            <li> I have severe acne and I don&#x27;t really think the pills worked for me, but the cream that they include is very good.</li>
            <li> I followed the regimen precisely. It&#x27;s a bogus product. I saw no improvement whatsoever. It was extremely frustrating and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I get deep cyst like blemishes, and this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I seemed to get worse but I would necessarily blame the product for that. I found blending/juicing fruit and vege has helped though. Vanishing cremed dint really use, was very watery.</li>
            <li> I see a difference when my husband uses this product. His skin clears up well. He&#x27;s 30 years old so it&#x27;s not just for teens!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and what I like the most is that s homeopathic and it s natural so it won&#x27;t do any harm to your body, might work slow but it works.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it really helps my skin.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I chose to give this a five star because it is working great for me! All i&#x27;m doing is taking the two pills twice a day as directed. I&#x27;m not drinking soda or sugary drinks just water and Natural juices sometimes. I wash my face in the morning and apply the medication they provide. I believe is the 2% benzoyl peroxide and at night i wash my face and apply sacilyc acid (sold seperatly from different vendor). After 2 weeks i have no breakouts! UNBELIEAVEABLE!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 28y and have suffered from acne for years! I bought this because of all the reviews and now I am halfway through the pills and everyone has noticed! The only thing I&#x27;d like is a supply of the pills and the pills alone as I don&#x27;t really care for the ointment. I am wondering if anyone has tried clearzine... seems to be the same thing but just the pills but I am reluctant to switch to something I don&#x27;t know anything about. I will be purchasing this again for now and now that I know something actually works I&#x27;ll be recommending it to others. I don&#x27;t understand why doctors do not recommend this if it works so well.</li>
            <li> My son has mild to moderate acne. He has used this product faithfully for a month and there is no improvement.</li>
            <li> The pills and creme works for me. I feel more confident now taking selfies.... Just follow the instructions on package... the creme is very good not to mention the pills that works wonders internally... my only problem is, i wish and thought the creme was gona vanish the spots quicker.. it really lightens it but takes a while to totally vanish it.. the ingredients in it all is very strong because my skin is betta very sensitive. My pores clogs very easily, even by using lotion.. the Natures cure creme. Cleans your pores. Kills all bacteria and prevent developments.. i can go on and on but i leave you to try it for yourself..  im on my Third Dosage..</li>
            <li> Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!</li>
            <li> So many positive reviews on Amazon so I had high hopes for this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last three weeks and I&#x27;ve had no improvement. My acne and skin is exactly the same since I&#x27;ve started using it. Perhaps it&#x27;s my skin type but for me, this product was ineffective. The cream does a good job of drying out your skin. In fact, I think the cream is more effective then the pills were. Hopefully others have better luck with this product.</li>
            <li> Ehh, the pills dont really do anything. The bp cream is better than most but still don&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle cure</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and it works!  It is hard to find in local stores so I always shop via Amazon and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> The first month was slow but started showing results. I think I had to find my balance. As I got a better routine down with the tablets and the cream (tablet in the morning after breakfast and another one in the evening before bed along with applying cream after a shower in the morning, if I get sweaty or dirty during the day and before bed at night). It has stopped the painful pimples and the blemishes have toned down a lot in a couple of months use.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I had redness and acn&amp;eacute; in my face. Including some scars. I believe the Acne Cream is the magic. I didnt took the pills because I dont know whats in them, but I strongly recommend buying this product just for the Acne Cream. Try it yourself. When applying dont put too much. Only put in the spaces where you have the problems. Wait for 5 minutes and if you want to hide it you can put make up, sun block, or whatever you wana put. Try it and about a week later you will see what Im telling you is real.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for more than 10 years! its the only acne reducing product that he has found to reduce the acne he has AND reduce the future outbreaks he has as well.</li>
            <li> I actually started using these I reccomend water sence when you trying to clear up you should drink water, these you gotta chew then drink a liquid If you take these like how it says you should see results. Also makes skin dry? so if you have a sensitive skin problem with dry skin and need lotion buy more! because it like drys the acne up it feels like.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would not cure, but at least help control my acne. The pills didn&#x27;t do squat for me for the whole month and a half I&#x27;ve used them. The only thing I liked was the cream.</li>
            <li> spray not good for peice</li>
            <li> Took it for almost a month straight. Maybe missed two or three days. But did not see a notable difference. Worth a try though. Look into Apple cider vinegar!!!! That is definitely the answer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for us. My kids used these faithfully with no clearing of acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the 5 star reviews but now I feel like a fool for falling for this deal.  This is just your average vanishing cream plus sugar pills.  I read some of the reviews on other sites and they have some of the same exact people posting the same reviews for this product as on amazon.  What I want to know is how much these people are being paid to give positive reviews for a mediocre product.  If you feel like paying 10 dollars for something you could get for $4 at a drug store, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 3 of these at a time for my partner who, without them, has moderate-to-severe acne. He likes it because it&#x27;s very effective at clearing up his face and I like it because I don&#x27;t find it bleaching or staining my towels like some creams can. A win all the way around.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne but I do have \\&quot;late-in-life\\&quot; blemishes that aren&#x27;t as severe as acne.  I used this product years ago and stopped when my Walmart quit carrying it.  This is a FABULOUS product!  If you take the pills accordingly and use the vanishing cream, your blemishes will disappear in about a week.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different but I know mine did.  I had red blemishes on my nose and on my forehead and at first I thought they could be related to using my daily meds...NOT!  I have an oily skin and the hot weather doesn&#x27;t help...it stresses the skin.  I&#x27;ve been taking these pills and using the cream for almost a month and I have NO blemishes on my face...it&#x27;s clear as a bell!  I don&#x27;t know what makes this product so good, but it is.  I hope they never quit making it.  I&#x27;ll be taking it forever and I&#x27;ll purchase it from the same vendor.  I got my order in less than a week and have been taking it religiously ever since.  Try it for a month and see if you don&#x27;t agree how excellent it works!!</li>
            <li> This is working well for my son and I love that it isn&#x27;t any harsh chemicals going into his body and on his face.</li>
            <li> My son uses this and if it wasn&#x27;t for your store, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it. He likes it.</li>
            <li> The tablets dont seem to do anyting... but the cream is fantastic. It dries up acne in an instant. love it</li>
            <li> Wow, I forgot about this stuff, but back when I was 20-23-24 years old I was getting acne and could not get rid of it.  I found this, Nature&#x60;s cure at Wal Mart one night, decided to give it a shot.  I used it for a year I would say and it cleared up.  7 years later I have not had breakouts again.  My experience</li>
            <li> They need to put out commercials because this stuff works! Nothing has ever worked for me like this product has! Once my face was clear I only took the pills every once in a while so a 10 dollar box lasted a really long time! LOVE this product! Thank you natures cure!</li>
            <li> My son has been using this for 2 months on the recommendation of a friend and his skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li> I used to have moderate - severe acne for more than 7 years, and no product gave significant results. Nature&#x27;s Cure was the only treatment system that worked for me. I didn&#x27;t see significant results in the beginning, but gradually my skin improved dramatically. Now, it&#x27;s been more than 3 months, and my skin is almost completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Apparently, what works for one person might not work for other people. All i know is that it worked very well for me and i think that it&#x27;s worth a try for everyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> Just a little dry when using topical medication. But it&#x27;s OK. No new acne recurring anymore after i using this product.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years and it works great. I will continue to use it daily for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> It is not a magic solution but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Update after 3 months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking the 3rd pack of the pills, and I have to say that it is helping. My back is almost clear. It is way better than it was before I started. I rarely miss a dose so I am pretty consistent. I&#x27;ve taken Minocycline and Tetracycline before and those pills made me sick to my stomach and very dizzy. Nature&#x27;s Cure has no side-effects except a little dry skin on my face, which is ok. The doctor said that if Minocycle won&#x27;t help, we should start Accutane, which is known for very bad side effects. Forget that, I&#x27;m continuing Nature&#x27;s Cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my second order. I am giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;m still waiting to see how much it&#x27;ll clear up. But I&#x27;ve seen improvements already. My back was pretty bad and now it doesn&#x27;t break out much. I&#x27;m gonna give it 5 stars if it clears even more. I would get a pimple here and there on my face, but I&#x27;m not getting as many on my face either now. I didn&#x27;t use the cream the first time though, but I started using it now on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried literally EVERYTHING for my moderate acne!! there is no words to explain how much this has helped me. in the first week blemishes were starting to disappear and it seems like my acne marks are also disappearing. it might dry out your skin a little but it&#x27;s totally worth it. loved it!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  Most of the local retailers used to carry this - but then about 5 years ago they all stopped.  Amazon.com is the best place to find it and has the best price.  I truly believe in this product - the pills work for me - since using, I have very few facial or body pimple break outs.  Cream is strong and overuse will dry out your face - but it does work.</li>
            <li> I received the product with the lid off and the package damaged. Half of the product is smeared on the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> I break out heavily on my back when stressed; painful enough to cause problems when driving or carrying a backpack. Of course, it&#x27;s also terribly unsightly, and knocks down one&#x27;s self-esteem; especially when 30-something. I also had awful breakouts during puberty as well, despite how well I took care of my skin. My stepmother was an aestethician, and even she was frustrated with her inability to get things under control with her help. I have tried tons of OTC and Rx products, trust me! Now, everyone&#x27;s bodies are different, so I cannot guarantee this product will work for you - but if you&#x27;re tried plenty of other products with little to no success, then I suggest you give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide acne treatment in a bottle for your skin. That&#x27;s good, but I can get 10% at my local drug store. I use it with a heavy-duty body brush, and cover the surface with the acne cream when showering - leaving the lather on long enough to soak into my pores, and kill the bacteria in my skin that causes problems. However, it doesn&#x27;t last all day - especially if you&#x27;re being active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other part, the all-natural pills -- they work! Again, they work for me. Within 2 weeks, my back was not breaking out nearly half as much, and those that did break out were smaller and less painful. Within a month, I have maybe one or two single breakouts, but they don&#x27;t last as long, and the scars from prior to taking this are now starting to fade. If you can mix the acne medicine with 2% hydroquinone (a.k.a. &#x27;Porcelana&#x27; in some drug stores) AFTER you shower, the fading will be faster and your skin tone more even. If you have the $60 or so extra to spare, see a dermatologist or go to a MedSpa, and have the nurse get you a 5% hydroquinone treatment. For about another $60, you can get that with .05% topical Retinol, even better - your skin will be smooth and natural again within 3-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10-$15 for &#x27;Nature&#x27;s Cure,&#x27; this is a great product, and Ihighly recommend it. I only wish they sold a version without the cream, so I could just buy a double-dose of tablets to last longer than 30 days. That&#x27;s my only gripe, and admittedly, a tiny one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I think the nature cure cream was actually more effective then the pills.  It&#x27;s been two weeks now and most of my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and it helps a lot. No need for me to go to the dermatologist anymore and pay $25 for the visit and $30 for the medicine. At first I was really wondering whether it will work or not, but for me it worked. After a couple days on this product, my skin was COMPLETELY CLEAR. This product works 100% along with a good healthy diet. Also make sure you take the am/pm pills along with the cream to get the best results possible. I will buy this product again. If I can&#x27;t find this product in stores I know I will have to buy it on here.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to say about the pills. They didn&#x27;t really do all that much for me. The acne cream that it came with did a decent job though. Could just be me, but overall didn&#x27;t do anything at all. Took on a schedule, twice a day, with breakfast and dinner. Didn&#x27;t miss a single dose.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and as described.  I&#x27;m not commenting on the product itself yet since my son hasn&#x27;t been taking it long enough to comment yet.  This was recommended to him by a friend who had success with it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work with me. Never help clear out the acne. And on occasion I even break out more than usual.</li>
            <li> The cream is benzoyl peroxide, and it had the same effect that any benzoyl peroxide product had.  The cream had some effect, but there are better products available.  The pills had no effect for the whole 2.5 to 3 months that I took them.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my teenage son. He has been using it for several months and it really works! :)</li>
            <li> My grandson who has had terrible acne for the past 4 years was timid and shy because he looked so bad. I bought the women&#x27;s for me and it worked well for me, but my grandson&#x27;s change was nothing short of miraculous. Literally, his complexion made a vast improvement over night, and in a few days his skin is perfectly clear. I am not inclined to exaggerate. Dermatologist were unable to help him but Nature&#x27;s Cure truly works.</li>
            <li> The product works just like they say. I have used it for 6 months and its great.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, great price.  I will definately buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My husband has tried everything for his acne for over 17 years. This is the only product that works for him. It&#x27;s is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I used this as a teenager, it worked better than anything out there, when my son started having break outs I got it for him, he loves it! I would tell any one who is having break outs to use this.</li>
            <li> The tablets are a joke in my opinion... and of course the benzole peroxide is effective.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusions, just buy generic benzole peroxide because I didn&#x27;t see any difference. I gave it a shot</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product, he is in his 50s, and has always had oily skin.  This is the only products that keeps his skin equalized.  He can&#x27;t live without it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. The key is to use it consistently and remember that it takes time to start working.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the few products out there that does what it says it does.  This used to be sold in the stores and I bought the female version for my teenage daughter and it worked great.  We were so sad to see it no longer on the store shelves.  Thank goodness I have found it still online - this is now a lifesaver for my teenage son!  The ONLY thing that works and we have wasted so much money on so many other products.  Please don&#x27;t stop selling this!!!</li>
            <li> no better acne treatment on the market. end of story</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide is benzoyl peroxide, you can get it at walmart for about $3.50. The pills do not work/ It&#x27;s a bunch of herbs that have no impact on acne.</li>
            <li> I tried this product years ago, beginning of high school?  I have had persistent acne up til recently.  Combined with a great facial cleanser (St. Ives green tea scrub), the Nature&#x27;s Cure Two Part Acne Treatment has worked very well for me!  Still get occasional tiny breakouts but its expected.  I had horrific acne but now this product and the facial cleanser is really helping me get rid of my scars an acne! Would recommend for everyone!!</li>
            <li> this must be for something else but not acne. i tried it for 2 months and then stop using it since i dont see any effect</li>
            <li> Have been taking 1 pill in the morning and 1 in the evening. Along with applying the cream once to twice a day and I have for sure seen improvements in my skin. Acne has gone down substantially, I would recommend using a moisturizer after applying the cream as it seems to dry out my skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> working great the only thing that seems to work for me</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 16-year-old and they seem to have calmed down his acne would recommend</li>
            <li> I saw no changes...  good or bad.  Worth a shot for those that are &amp;#34;desperate&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows, may work for you</li>
            <li> so it worked great while i was taking them. Within the week I saw a difference. BUT I would say make sure u take them like they tell you to and dont skip a day.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 4 star because 2-3 weeks after the pills finished, my face started acting up again. Which i expected of corse. But I am getting more because this is the only stuff that ended up working out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and btw my acne is not severe. Wouldn&#x27;t know how it works out for people that have severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps</li>
            <li> My 13 yr old son has been using it about a month and we can see somewhat of a reduction in acne.</li>
            <li> Its been about a month and a half of using this product pretty consistently. Ive seen a decent difference in my acne but idk if its because of this product or my use of lysine and biotin also. There hasnt been any drastic changes even after a month so if the price isnt much to you. I say this product is worth a try</li>
            <li> The tablets do nothing and the cream is less powerful than any off the shelf product from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for 8 years until I got the natures cure acne treatment. 3 months after using  this my acne is not even visibly that I had acne.</li>
            <li> Ordered this acne cream and A months dosage of pills its seems to be working really well no complaint&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I am adult with acne. I&#x27;ve had it all my life. Not too severe, but definitely a problem. I tried this along with drinking a significant amount more water and my skin is clearer now than it has been my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried yet, please try to drink 8-10 glasses of water a day and see if that makes a difference. Give it several weeks, but stay consistent drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing to use this product as well, because it seems to be helping as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but I didnt see any remarkable results using this product. I guess the effect is different in every one of us.</li>
            <li> If you know of anyone who has had any type of copmplection issues this is a product that really, really does work. One of the biggest benefits is that there are no side effects and no long process for it to work. Highly recommended for any stage of compection isues.</li>
            <li> Initially this product is good to treat my acne but after not using it, my acne appears again.</li>
            <li> I love this acne treatment. I will go out my way to get this stuff. I use it all over my body for bumps. It works and its the most gentle product like this in my opinion and experience. Highly suggested and and goes good under a coating of coco butter.</li>
            <li> This product worked pretty well for my boyfriend who I purchased it for. He doesn&#x27;t really have a bad acne problem so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work for someone who really has it bad. But it&#x27;s good for someone who just has sporadic breakouts.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son had tried several products. He does not use the pills, however the cream works well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and accidentally ordered the one for males instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used it for about a week but it didn&#x27;t make a lot of difference, but cannot be totally sure because I did order it for the wrong gender. That is why I am giving it 3 stars still.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not a miracle worker, but I think it sorta work?</li>
            <li> The only product that has ever worked. You&#x27;ll feel the difference the first time you use it. You&#x27;ll see clearer skin in just days. No out brake before results. By far the best product out there!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne on my back and neck. Together, the cream and tablets seemed very effective at first (someone even commented on it), but the cream ran out very quickly (I had to use quite a bit, but regardless, I can&#x27;t see the creme lasting a whole month), and from then on it didn&#x27;t seem to get much better. I would probably strongly recommend this product if you have a small amount of surface acne. For more serious acne, and larger areas, I probably wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My son has the face wash as well so we really like the brand.&lt;br /&gt;He only remembers to take pill once a day and he still had great results within a week.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile now and see Improvements, which I am very happy about. I only give it four stars because I still have a pack to go, and plan to buy more, but overall I am honestly impressed with this acne medication!</li>
            <li> As expected, and product really works for my son.</li>
            <li> this product should be only used for males 20 and older, i believe it is only used for a dirty face, if you&#x27;re a teenager i believe your breakouts are due to hormones so i think you should just take pantothenic acid, but maybe this product will work for you.</li>
            <li> very bad product, don&#x27;t recommended to my fiend</li>
            <li> Worked well for me but I need something different. It really depends on your skin type and personal needs. but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> My now 15-year-old son has now been using these pills for more than six months. He definitely can tell the difference when he hasn&#x27;t used it. Although it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of his acne, it has minimized the severity of the breakouts. He used this regimen in conjunction with the Carley&#x27;s Clear &amp; Smooth Acne Treatment for Teens scrub and soap. He has not used the vanishing cream much.</li>
            <li> Product did not work, waste of money! based on reviews i gave it a try and i was completely disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used it for my acne and now purchased it for my 13 year old son.  It starts to work slowly and you can start off with 2 pills a day and then when in control, use 1 pill a day and manage with the cream and regular washing of the face.  Plus a diet change helps too.  No or reduced amounts of caffiene or fried foods or foods that produce heat in the body.  This is quite true for teenagers.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that this product is doing absolutely nothing for me whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been taking the pills twice a day and applying the facial cream, but i&#x27;m not seeing my acne vanish.I wanted it so badly to work for me, but it cannot be forced.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product multiple times for both my husband and teenage son. Works great, and it is convenient.</li>
            <li> have used this product previously and have seen wonderful results with consistent use. Always nice to have a homeopathic alternative. Product arrived within the estimated delivery time nicely packaged. Will reorder when needed again.</li>
            <li> The cream works like magic, not too sure about the tablets though because sometimes i forgot to eat them. Rcommended for all</li>
            <li> got it because of the good should of read the negative reviews first. doesn&#x27;t work at all for me waste of money</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! It worked for me!</li>
            <li> I had used this product and had success when all else failed. I recommended it to my boyfriend&#x27;s teenage son and it worked for him too. Great product! Wish it was sold in stores.</li>
            <li> We have only try for two weeks and so far, the face lotion with the pills seems to work just fine. I am curious to see if it will still work on the long run.</li>
            <li> Well, so far ive been taking the pills 15 days and havent see any progress. hope it works with time</li>
            <li> Never worked and it made my face really dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference using this product but I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne medication that works for my husband&#x27;s skin. This is a product that we can no longer find in stores, so he was elated when I found it available on Amazon. His skin is clear once again thanks to Natures Cure.</li>
            <li> Ok, so for a little back story - I have had acne for about 15 years - started in high school, and I am 30 now - I have come to terms with the fact that I will just have oily skin until I&#x27;m 100. Fine.  At least I look kind of young still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is acne - horrible in high school - still not great since - EVERY product, cure, herb, cream, pill, diet regimen, EVERY idea for curing acne pretty much on the planet earth, I have tried - hundreds, thousands of dollars....and no dice - everything works ok for a couple weeks, and then right back to baseline - infuriating doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it, but it&#x27;s more a resigned, depressed kind of fury at this point, after so much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN I found nature&#x27;s cure a couple of years ago - I will agree with people that say it&#x27;s kind of gimmicky, or \\&quot;kind of\\&quot; the same thing as other benzoil peroxide creams, and I will ALSO agree that the pills are kind of optional/ambiguously effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the cream is the ONLY proper mixture of BOTH benzoil peroxide to dry the skin and THEN herbal moisturizers to keep the skin from needing to crank out more oil that I&#x27;ve ever found.  Every other benzoil peroxide cream dries the hell out of my skin, and by the end of the day I&#x27;m way MORE oily because my face is trying to compensate - I cannot use salicylic acid, as it makes me break out to an extreme, even horrifying degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the mixture in the nature&#x27;s cure cream, it is the ONLY cream I&#x27;ve found in 15 years, of thousands of products, that finds the proper benzoil peroxide/natural moisturizer mix for a topical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coupled this with natural tea-tree oil soap, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, as my face wash, and for the first time in the last half of my life, my skin looks what I would call \\&quot;pretty ok\\&quot;  ....I hope nature&#x27;s cure never changes their formula, and is around for at least a few more decades, because I am a loyal fan at this point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS No, no one paid me to review thispositively - I just with I could have the money back for all the other bajillion crappy ineffective things I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li> Item was as seller mentioned purchase price and shipping speed was satisfactory I have used this product in the past and it works.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product during my adolescent years and remember that it worked very well. Due to health reasons I have been breaking out again recently and decided to go back with what I knew worked and I am already starting to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they offered a subscribe and save option as I enjoy savings and I can imagine that many people enjoy the convenience and privacy of monthly deliveries of their health items.</li>
            <li> Its working  great and I recommend it to people with acne.will definely keep buying it when I run out soon</li>
    </ol>
