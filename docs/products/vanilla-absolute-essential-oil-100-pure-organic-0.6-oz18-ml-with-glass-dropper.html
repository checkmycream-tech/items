            <li>After receiving it today I could not be more happy.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and smells awesome!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>but my granddaughter used it to make her own perfume</li>
            <li>I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shopped with Dr. Adorable before and have yet to receive an oil I haven&#x27;t liked or</li>
            <li>It is however a wonderful essential oil and the smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Rich and decadent, LOVE this vanilla!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I will be getting more of this.</li>
            <li>It is the most enticing, fragrant, and appealing scent you could hope for in vanilla.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  </li>
            <li>Nice to find real products and Dr. Adorable seems to have them.</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla scent its super strong</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>The auracacia dilution of vanilla has a genuine vanilla scent</li>
            <li>Most people have never smelled the real thing.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like sweet hippie heaven.</li>
            <li>This smells like real vanilla, not artificial flavoring.  </li>
            <li>the scent of wooden booths mingled with top quality vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a spice in the background.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Adorable vanilla has a more complex scent.  </li>
            <li>But, this is my first time ever buying REAL vanilla.</li>
            <li>Darker,  pretty thick, and will not run down the side of the bottle real easy until you set the bottle in warm water, to soften it up.</li>
            <li>I was very leery about purchasing the sent.</li>
            <li>This does not smell like real vanilla.</li>
            <li>I work in a cafe and we use real ground vanilla beans</li>
            <li>It was really gooey and had a rancid smell.</li>
            <li>My god this smells amazing, vanilla absolute smells different than vanilla extract you would buy at the grocery store because it is extracted differently.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with essential oils, so as far as I can tell, in my limited experience, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I mixed about 12 drops with patchouli oil, orange oil, and lemon oil in a 1oz bottle 3/4 full of Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>This is not sweet smelling and does not smell like a birthday cake or ice cream, but much better.</li>
            <li>Smells like its  real old</li>
            <li>Then later like a more powdery vanilla with a slight woody/spicy scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural form.  </li>
            <li>I used it in my cold process soap, and it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>At first, I though something was wrong with this, as it has many different scents going on, besides just vanilla.</li>
            <li>Takes me back to an old fashioned ice cream parlor in Chicago that has long since been replaced by a gas station.....</li>
            <li>This is not a true absolute.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to add this to my blends, as I know it will enhance all of the other essential oils!!</li>
            <li> While not super strong, it lasts and can be used as a perfume oil - riiiiight behind the ears where hubby likes to see what scent I have on!  </li>
            <li> It does not smell remotely close to vanilla and does not combine well with butters and oils when heated.</li>
            <li> One smells like a candle and the other like vanilla room spray merged with butterscotch candy.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I smell the woodsy scent of the beans, which are in this as well, as the smell of a dark musky scent, like Cedarwood or Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> It did not accelerate my soap, nor cause any other issues!  </li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of vanilla scent</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, and was thoroughly disgusted once I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> Recently bought from two other places and the price was a bit cheaper, however the products are horrible.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too weak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> It smells artificial, it&#x27;s too smokey.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Smells awful!</li>

            <li> Absolutely fantastic!  Great price, wonderful product.  This smells like real vanilla, not artificial flavoring.  Recently bought from two other places and the price was a bit cheaper, however the products are horrible.  One smells like a candle and the other like vanilla room spray merged with butterscotch candy.  Dr. Adorable vanilla has a more complex scent.  Initially like vanilla bean pods, with a hint of wood and spice in the distance.  Then later like a more powdery vanilla with a slight woody/spicy scent.  Takes me back to an old fashioned ice cream parlor in Chicago that has long since been replaced by a gas station.....the scent of wooden booths mingled with top quality vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a spice in the background.  Thank you for a great product......please do not stop selling this!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!  I love it!  I used it in my cold process soap, and it smells amazing!  It did not accelerate my soap, nor cause any other issues!  I would buy this again in a heart beat! Awesome!</li>
            <li> At first, I though something was wrong with this, as it has many different scents going on, besides just vanilla. But, this is my first time ever buying REAL vanilla. I have always used extract, or flavoring, or fragrance, like everyone else. Most people have never smelled the real thing. This has a combination of wonderful smells. I smell the woodsy scent of the beans, which are in this as well, as the smell of a dark musky scent, like Cedarwood or Sandalwood. It&#x27;s like vanilla blended with an earth scent, but it&#x27;s the way it smells in it&#x27;s natural form.  This is not sweet smelling and does not smell like a birthday cake or ice cream, but much better. Darker,  pretty thick, and will not run down the side of the bottle real easy until you set the bottle in warm water, to soften it up.I mixed about 12 drops with patchouli oil, orange oil, and lemon oil in a 1oz bottle 3/4 full of Jojoba oil. Now, it makes a great hand lotion or face lotion or good in the bathwater. As for getting this to diffuse, I don&#x27;t think you can. It&#x27;s thicker then Sandalwood. I will be getting more of this. Nice to find real products and Dr. Adorable seems to have them.</li>
            <li> Received and bottle was not tamper sealed.</li>
            <li> Smell terrible. Smells like its  real old</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla scent its super strong so a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> What is the advantage of having an organic vanilla extracted from solvent?! I bought without noticing that. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest. I was very leery about purchasing the sent. After receiving it today I could not be more happy. It is the most enticing, fragrant, and appealing scent you could hope for in vanilla. Extremely happy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with essential oils, so as far as I can tell, in my limited experience, it&#x27;s good.  It arrived faster than all the other items I ordered that day from different sellers.  I used it to whip in to my shea butter.  My husband says it smells like bubble gum.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like real vanilla. It smells artificial, it&#x27;s too smokey. The auracacia dilution of vanilla has a genuine vanilla scent but it&#x27;s too weak, that&#x27;s why I took a chance on this one. I do not like it at all. I work in a cafe and we use real ground vanilla beans, I know what vanilla smells like. This is not vanilla, nor is it oil. It separates in oil. This is sub-par vanilla extract. Wish I could get my money back. This is some BS.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and smells awesome! Can&#x27;t wait to use it in my homemade organic lip balm this week!! 😊</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, and was thoroughly disgusted once I opened the bottle. Smells awful!</li>
            <li> This did not smell like vanilla. It was really gooey and had a rancid smell. I could not get it to mix, it would always seperate into clumps. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful scent.  While not super strong, it lasts and can be used as a perfume oil - riiiiight behind the ears where hubby likes to see what scent I have on!  I&#x27;ve shopped with Dr. Adorable before and have yet to receive an oil I haven&#x27;t liked or hasn&#x27;t lived up to its name.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like sweet hippie heaven. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again. Needs a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> My god this smells amazing, vanilla absolute smells different than vanilla extract you would buy at the grocery store because it is extracted differently.</li>
            <li> Smells delish, works well!</li>
            <li> This is not a true absolute. It is not oil soluble.  It is however a wonderful essential oil and the smell is amazing.  I could smell it before I even opened it.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent!! Can&#x27;t wait to add this to my blends, as I know it will enhance all of the other essential oils!!</li>
