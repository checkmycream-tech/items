            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make it better than not using any</li>
            <li>I am not so sure that it does the job.</li>
            <li>AT HOME, AND LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I also make sure I wear gloves to wash dishes to keep my nails protected.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying another type and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>I love the shorter brush on this product.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and good deal</li>
            <li>I switched to No Lift Nails nail primer and it works much better with no curing involved.  </li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bonder it works great</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just a cheap top.</li>
            <li>so i tried IBD Bonder and it works perfectly fine up to now.</li>
            <li>I like how smooth the gel gets my nails.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the bonder, personally.  </li>
            <li>, I do my own nails as a hobby and the binder definitely comes in handy.</li>
            <li>great hold for gel base coat, very good brush makes it easy to work with</li>
            <li>i started to do a quick over lay of gel over my fingers.</li>
            <li>Turns out the top part is completely cracked on the inside.</li>
            <li>A thin coat works best.</li>
            <li>I got this product pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Works really good with the other ibd products</li>
            <li>and it is a very large supply.  </li>
            <li>so far it is easy to use and appears to be working under my gel and tips</li>
            <li>very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I USED EXACTLY AS DIRECTED AND GOT THE RESULTS I WAS HOPING FOR.</li>
            <li>First time I tried this product and I like it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty disapointed in this product...</li>
            <li>The price and the amount was a better buy than what I could purchase at a local store.  </li>
            <li>A must have if your interested in doing gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>JUST REMEMBER A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, AND TAKE YOUR TIME IF YOU ARE NEW SINCE PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived with a loose top that leaked inside the packaging.</li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>much appreciated.</li>
            <li>Love it, just need to get use to not put on too much, since it won&#x27;t cure all the way.</li>
            <li>Once I used this, it held the gel product to my nail very well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll return it because that&#x27;s just too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Ive been looking for something that really works</li>
            <li>My hands take a real beating.</li>
            <li>It really bonds the gel on.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>would reccomend the whole IBD line for all nail needs.</li>
            <li>I like the bonder, I just really don&#x27;t like the brush...</li>
            <li>I am also very pleased with the small applicator/brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the only one ive found so far will be ordering more</li>
            <li>My nails are short, only visible from the palm, they do look lovely.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality bonder.</li>
            <li>and now i can do fill ins like a normal person.</li>
            <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li>I used this very minimally around the free edge of my nails and then cured according to directions to assist with lifting issues I was having with gel polish.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really use much on just one set and with the size of the bottle I can tell its gonna last a while.</li>
            <li>This is good product but there are better, less expensive products to choose from.</li>
            <li>I do believe this product is meant for use with hard gels or acrylics but at the recommendation of a friend after I spent so much time and did so many different things and tried so many different brands to keep my gel polish from lifting, this is what worked.</li>
            <li>SINCE MY GROWING DAUGHTER WANTS HER NAILS DONE, I CANNOT AFFORD CONSTANT SALON VISITS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that this was necessary when doing gel manicures of all types, and it&#x27;s really done its job.</li>
            <li>it was completely covered with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Even though some people might say you don&#x27;t need this product buy it, it will make your enhancements last that much longer.</li>
            <li>seriously if I knew that I wouldnt have bought it, it is not like this stuff if cheap and for it not to work and the seller to not stand by their product really upsets me</li>
            <li>I had a major problem with lifting.  </li>
            <li>at first I thought i was using too much bonder because i have read that too much can make lifting worse....</li>
            <li>you have to make sure to apply a THIN coat or else it will spread all over your fingers.</li>
            <li>They work well, and are much cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li>I have tried the gel cured polishes quite a few times, and most of the time within a few days, it would start popping up from my nails which would get me picking/pulling off the polish in sheets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my mani on for two weeks, and even though I cut my nails down, the only real sign of age is my gap in the bottom.</li>

            <li> doesn.t seem to last that long for a bonding agent with gel products</li>
            <li> and you just barely want to wet the surface with it.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional</li>
            <li> after several process changes and careful application i still get lifting just at the tips...</li>
            <li> and I will definitely keep using this brand and all other ibd products</li>
            <li> this into the whole process (cleanse, use ph balancer, then bonder, then base coat, then color, and finally the top coat) was the missing piece that I needed!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a total necessity, and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with your soak off, or your nails might peel.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails, very bendable and everything peels off them</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Now my gel colors stay on until I HAVE to remove them, due to them growing out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it came well before the due date.  </li>
            <li> I use this bonder with my other IBD products.</li>
            <li> I also got the other products for the system and they work as described.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand</li>
            <li> I have had less and less luck as days go on.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that before I received this product I received the gel and being the impatient person that I am</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold well and the polish will literally peel off within just a few days.</li>
            <li> Im now using Gelish base gel and IBD pink, white, and clear over that and dont seem to have the lifting problem...</li>
            <li> The brush is thin and doesn&#x27;t distribute the bonder well enough...</li>
            <li> if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> im not easy on on nails</li>
            <li> I have just started using this as opposed to another foundation I had previously used that I had found too thick.</li>
            <li> This is NOT healthy, and seemed to pull off a bit of the nail finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> and I have in the past.</li>
            <li> had purchased the &amp;#34;Sensational&amp;#34; gel nail kit and the kit came with small samples to use....</li>
            <li> For use with ibd hard gels.  </li>
            <li> Sucks...</li>
            <li> well DUH</li>
            <li> No more lifting!</li>
            <li> This bonder is so thin that it is watery and runs past my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Poor product, when using this item the gel will peal off within 2 days, when I contacted seller they said they would not refund or let me return if it had been used,</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> This stopped that cold.</li>
            <li> but my brush came with a sticking out stubborn bristles that the I ended up cutting out and it made the brush even thinner than it already is.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base coat under builder gel and as a foundation for gel polish when I don&#x27;t build my nails.</li>

            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> This bonder will make gels stick like cement. Had mine until they grew out. Just be careful with your soak off, or your nails might peel.</li>
            <li> This goes along with the above product. It is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it together with ibd stick primer, maybe that will help. I have thin nails, very bendable and everything peels off them</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make it better than not using any</li>

This is NOT healthy, and seemed to pull off a bit of the nail finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding this into the whole process (cleanse, use ph balancer, then bonder, then base coat, then color, and finally the top coat) was the missing piece that I needed! Now my gel colors stay on until I HAVE to remove them, due to them growing out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the IBD colors, too! They work well, and are much cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I am not so sure that it does the job. with or without seems to not make a difference and it shouldn&#x27;t be that way!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO DO NAILS AT HOME, AND LOVE IT. I USED EXACTLY AS DIRECTED AND GOT THE RESULTS I WAS HOPING FOR. JUST REMEMBER A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, AND TAKE YOUR TIME IF YOU ARE NEW SINCE PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. THIS IS PERFECT TO SAVE US MONEY SINCE MY GROWING DAUGHTER WANTS HER NAILS DONE, I CANNOT AFFORD CONSTANT SALON VISITS AND THIS IS SALON RESULTS :) I HAVENT HAD ANY LIFTING ISSUES AND WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> First time I tried this product and I like it. It seems to be a great bonder and I even use it to help my tip to stick to my fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
            <li> Bonder didn&#x27;t bond and gel burned my skin so this product is not for me.  Perhaps it is an allergy but nonetheless just thinking about it makes me cringe!</li>
            <li> With out this product my gel nail lift and fall off almost immediately. The product works wonders and couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> this bonder works well with the primer.  I like how smooth the gel gets my nails.  this is a good buy.  everything is packaged properly too.  it came well before the due date.  much appreciated.</li>
            <li> This bonder is so thin that it is watery and runs past my cuticles. you have to make sure to apply a THIN coat or else it will spread all over your fingers. i would rather use a thicker bonder that i can control such as the gelish foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;ve had lifting on 2 nails I&#x27;ve used this on...I&#x27;ll do an update.</li>
            <li> Love it, just need to get use to not put on too much, since it won&#x27;t cure all the way.</li>
            <li> I was using an acrylic primer and I was still experiencing alot of lifting. Once I used this, it held the gel product to my nail very well and now i can do fill ins like a normal person.I also make sure I wear gloves to wash dishes to keep my nails protected. I am not a professional I do my own gel nails to save money. This is a must have and has solved my lifting problem. I also use the IBD dehydrator to help me have maxium adhesion. good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that this was necessary when doing gel manicures of all types, and it&#x27;s really done its job. I know that it&#x27;s the reason that my gel manicures stick, it&#x27;s the hardest part to soak off LOL. I think it&#x27;s a total necessity, and a little goes a LONG way. I&#x27;ve had my mani on for two weeks, and even though I cut my nails down, the only real sign of age is my gap in the bottom.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality bonder. I use it with Gel Manicures as well as IBD Builder gel.</li>
            <li> I got this product pretty quickly. I opened it but when I went to close it back I heard a cracking noise. Turns out the top part is completely cracked on the inside. I don&#x27;t think it was because of the shipping...it was completely covered with plastic wrap. I think it&#x27;s just a cheap top. Sucks... Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll return it because that&#x27;s just too much of a hassle. I&#x27;ll figure something out.</li>
            <li> Poor product, when using this item the gel will peal off within 2 days, when I contacted seller they said they would not refund or let me return if it had been used, well DUH it had been used how do you think I know it doesnt work? seriously if I knew that I wouldnt have bought it, it is not like this stuff if cheap and for it not to work and the seller to not stand by their product really upsets me and I will NEVER be purchasing from this seller every again. and I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for something that really works and I finally found it im not easy on on nails and this product sticks thru everything the only one ive found so far will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a DIY with acrylic nails.  I had a major problem with lifting.  This stopped that cold. BTW,  I work with my hands, and POWER tools.  My hands take a real beating. My nails are short, only visible from the palm, they do look lovely. No more lifting!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bonder it works great and I will definitely keep using this brand and all other ibd products</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the bonder, personally.  Again, I had hoped to start doing my own nails, but it just doesn&#x27;t turn out well at all and this doesn&#x27;t work as a bonder.</li>
            <li> I purchased IBD Bonder because after reading online I found out this was the step preceding the application of the gel enhancements. I have to say that before I received this product I received the gel and being the impatient person that I am i started to do a quick over lay of gel over my fingers. As soon as Had finished taken my fingers out of the UV Lap the overlays had popped off. After using the bonder I could tell the difference. I have done some sets on myself and friends and family and have seen great results in the enhancements staying power. Even though some people might say you don&#x27;t need this product buy it, it will make your enhancements last that much longer.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for such a good price. You don&#x27;t really use much on just one set and with the size of the bottle I can tell its gonna last a while. when I run out I will definitely buy from this seller. very fast shipping. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this bonder but it doesnt work as good as I would have hoped it would. I ended up buying another type and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> I started using this instead of the bonder that came with my nail kit. It doesn&#x27;t hold well and the polish will literally peel off within just a few days. It won&#x27;t even hold a week.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great, product just not so good.</li>
            <li> works perfect with the soak off gel.</li>
            <li> I am pretty disapointed in this product... It was recommended becuase I have lifting on the tips of my nails.. at first I thought i was using too much bonder because i have read that too much can make lifting worse.... after several process changes and careful application i still get lifting just at the tips... Ive been using Gelish products but wanted to go back to IBD becuase i like the consistancy of IBD gel... Im now using Gelish base gel and IBD pink, white, and clear over that and dont seem to have the lifting problem...</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product. It really bonds the gel on. Last until your next manicure.  I recommend it. I used to use &#x27;something wonderful&#x27; (thats the name of the product) but couldnt find it so i tried IBD Bonder and it works perfectly fine up to now.</li>
            <li> I love the shorter brush on this product. It makes it so much easier to apply. This product also makes a great bond. I would buy this again and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this! Great price!  Thank you amazon!  Will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> Like this bonder. I use this as a base coat under builder gel and as a foundation for gel polish when I don&#x27;t build my nails. A very good product.</li>
            <li> great hold for gel base coat, very good brush makes it easy to work with</li>
            <li> I use this bonder with my other IBD products. It helps adhere the gel to the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to receive</li>
            <li> Workers great. I also got the other products for the system and they work as described. Overall great product and good deal</li>
            <li> I have just started using this as opposed to another foundation I had previously used that I had found too thick. so far it is easy to use and appears to be working under my gel and tips</li>
            <li> Very nice product. For use with ibd hard gels.  UPDATE:  I have had less and less luck as days go on.  I switched to No Lift Nails nail primer and it works much better with no curing involved.  It is an acid primer, but does the job, and does it well!</li>
            <li> If you are doing your own nails this bonder is a must have with ibd products.  I did a lot of research when purchasing ibd products and didn&#x27;t buy the bonder to begin but you must have this for the gel to set.  would reccomend the whole IBD line for all nail needs.</li>
            <li> I used this very minimally around the free edge of my nails and then cured according to directions to assist with lifting issues I was having with gel polish. I do believe this product is meant for use with hard gels or acrylics but at the recommendation of a friend after I spent so much time and did so many different things and tried so many different brands to keep my gel polish from lifting, this is what worked. A little goes a long way and you just barely want to wet the surface with it. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Another good IBD product.</li>
            <li> I like the bonder, I just really don&#x27;t like the brush... I know that it&#x27;s a hit or miss thing but my brush came with a sticking out stubborn bristles that the I ended up cutting out and it made the brush even thinner than it already is. The brush is thin and doesn&#x27;t distribute the bonder well enough...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brand but I am satisfied with this product. I would buy it again when I finish it.</li>
            <li> Works really good with the other ibd products</li>
            <li> IBD makes a very good bonder.  I am also very pleased with the small applicator/brush. A thin coat works best.</li>
            <li> Good product! Arrived in timely manner. Shipped and packaged well. I would recommend. Does help in application and wear of your nails (tips). Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product does the job and it is a very large supply.  The price and the amount was a better buy than what I could purchase at a local store.  I will order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased the &amp;#34;Sensational&amp;#34; gel nail kit and the kit came with small samples to use....so, I will need to replenish those products to use the kit in my future applications.</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> Good product but package was leaking</li>
            <li> Very good product. No complain</li>
            <li> The bottle looked different from the picture.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product. Instead of a &amp;#34;IBD Bonder&amp;#34; I got a &amp;#34;ORLY Bonder&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A must have if your interested in doing gel nails at home. Has your gel nails last longer</li>
            <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
