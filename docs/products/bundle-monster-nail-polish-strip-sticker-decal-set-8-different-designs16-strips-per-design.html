            <li>But again very cute designs!</li>
            <li>But for what you get, it&#x27;s a great value.lage).</li>
            <li>But for what you get, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>well I have a boat load of daughters and they all loved them so that makes me happy b b</li>
            <li>She was impressed with the many colors it contained - all in one package.</li>
            <li>Every time, I&#x27;ve had a good experience.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen is the original and Sally Hansen is the BEST.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something cheap that you can wear for a day and then easily peel off, these are perfect....</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice variety of colors and patterns.</li>
            <li>I bought them because I had tried Sally Hansen nail strips, and really liked them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to have really clean nails, pushed-back cuticles, and a bit of patience for the best results.</li>
            <li>I can actually very easily peel them off my nails</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the emery board to trim the top b/c it isn&#x27;t as nice an edge.</li>
            <li>There are a number of cute patterns that I really liked.</li>
            <li>so you can try and find the best fit, but I also have trimmed the width with scissors very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will order more and recommend my family, friends about the brand and product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the price because I had seen something similar to this in the stores and they cost $10 just for one, so getting 8 here is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t complain but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for them.</li>
            <li>but you will have to pay more.</li>
            <li>Sally nail strips are much better.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because I am in love with the Sally Hanson version of them and was amazed at the price.</li>
            <li>If the design--and your nail size--permit, you can then apply the top of the decal to another nail and repeat.</li>
            <li>When I did my nails with the purple camoflauge design, I got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>As soon as they come up with more designs I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Also, the colors and designs are more for kids or teens.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast application, very nice design.</li>
            <li>Instead they are just stickers that easily chip away.</li>
            <li>easy to apply</li>
            <li>If you want higher quality and more sophisticated designs, I would purchase another brand.</li>
            <li>Smooth and tuck with the cuticle stick, apply topcoat, and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I gave it such a great review because it everything I thought it would be.....</li>
            <li>I was attracted to these because they seemed like a great deal, and I liked quite a few of the designs.</li>
            <li>Also, I think you really need to apply top coat to these, otherwise they peel easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other nail foils but these are the best by far.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect because they are  thin and easy to fit around your nails without having to cut them before applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly give this product 5 stars if the pattern choice were more to my liking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d certainly give this product 5 stars if the pattern choice were more to my liking.</li>
            <li>These are cute but they kinda slide around your nail if you use your hands a lot &amp; they leave a really sticky residue when you take them off.</li>
            <li>I bought this back in April, thinking i&#x27;d be getting a good deal</li>
            <li>Of the 8 designs, I think 3 are pretty cute, 3 are so-so (fine for toes as the shock factor works better there, and it&#x27;s not so necessary that they coordinate with your wardrobe--especially in winter), and 2 are \\&quot;whuh?\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got these for my daughter and we both had fun putting them on.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s young and probably picked at it more.</li>
            <li>On my fingernails, with a topcoat, the decals last about a week, looking nice.</li>
            <li>The nail polish strips are perfect for a messy pre-teen girl, who wants nail polish but still can&#x27;t responsibly handle the polish and remover.</li>
            <li>Amazing!\\&quot; I do think it&#x27;s worth not starting with your favorite pattern.</li>
            <li>Amazing!\\&quot; I do think it&#x27;s worth not starting with your favorite pattern.</li>
            <li>These certainly don&#x27;t last as long as the more popular brand.</li>
            <li>My nails, both fingers and toes, top out a bit above 1/2\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The design hides the flaws much better than fixing a chip in regular nail</li>
            <li>I applied these the same way I have applied Sally Hansen Salon Effects and added a top coat.</li>
            <li>While initially they seemed to be ok, as soon as they began to set the strip began shrinking and wrinkling around the edges.</li>
            <li>I choose that design during the first week of games (GO RAVENS).</li>
            <li>I only wish they had more designs.  </li>
            <li>they are difficult to apply, the instructions were covered up by amazons bar code sticker...not impressed with this product at all</li>
            <li>I really have to cut these to fit my nails more than other nail stickers I use like salley Hansen.</li>
            <li>The sets I buy are usually $12 for one, so this is a good value if you are buying for kids.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as nice as the Sally Hansen or Sephora nail decals I have previously purchased.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a big fan of how HUGE they are.</li>
            <li>actually had difficulty with removal, but no damage to my natural nail which is a huge plus for me!</li>
            <li>Mine stayed on for about 5 days before it really started not looking</li>
            <li>There is not much variety in the sizes but the designs are cute.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t put that much pressure on it.  </li>
            <li>The only cool thing about this brand is that they ship from Hawaii.</li>
            <li>would purchase more of these if they come out with different designs or when my daughter finally uses them all up.</li>
            <li>They also do not stay on more than five minutes and leave a sticky mess on your nails.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve learned a little more.</li>
            <li>Normally the Sally Hanson ones are up to 9 dollars for one set.</li>
            <li>These were cute and easy to apply but they only last a few days before peeling starts.</li>
            <li>It also took a while to dry with the top coat so smudging and smearing was possible afterwards.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, but not worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li>so I can share some, but I&#x27;m really wishing for different patterns.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li>It means careful application with no wastage, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I guess that is a positive thing if you are putting them on a child, or want to use them for just a day and don&#x27;t care about how long they last.</li>
            <li>I even did my 7 year old daughters nails with the left overs.  </li>
            <li>The stickers are fun to play with but they are poor in quality and they don&#x27;t stick very well when compared to Avon</li>
            <li>These decals while easy to use are designs not very becoming to small areas such as finger or toe nails.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand!</li>
            <li> the longest I have worn them is 3 weeks and usually as an accent (one finger, just the tips, corners).</li>
            <li> These are thick and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Hi, am sorry to give such a bad review.</li>
            <li> I did try doing it twice to see if it had been a fluke, but alas not.</li>
            <li> they could have lasted longer, but the polish on the rest of my nails was wearing thin.</li>
            <li> Sadly, with this product, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how they looked in person.</li>
            <li> These were awful and peeled off within an hour.</li>

            <li> well I have a boat load of daughters and they all loved them so that makes me happy b b</li>
            <li> Easy and fast application, very nice design. I will order more and recommend my family, friends about the brand and product.</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter and we both had fun putting them on. It comes with a nice variety of colors and patterns. My daughter put them on every finger and I just put them on my thumbs and then painted the rest of my nails with regular nail polish in a matching color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each design has 8 different sizes/widths (two of each, so 16 strips all together for each pattern) so you can try and find the best fit, but I also have trimmed the width with scissors very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s started wearing off within a few days but she&#x27;s young and probably picked at it more. Mine stayed on for about 5 days before it really started not looking so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the price because I had seen something similar to this in the stores and they cost $10 just for one, so getting 8 here is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase more of these if they come out with different designs or when my daughter finally uses them all up.</li>
            <li> These were cute and easy to apply but they only last a few days before peeling starts. For the price you can&#x27;t complain but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more for them. Sally Hansen polish strips last longer (7-10 days) but you will have to pay more.</li>
            <li> These are cute but they kinda slide around your nail if you use your hands a lot &amp; they leave a really sticky residue when you take them off. Sally nail strips are much better.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for granddaughter. She was impressed with the many colors it contained - all in one package.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter they didn&#x27;t even last 5 hours and she had to redo 2 of them complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I am in love with the Sally Hanson version of them and was amazed at the price. Normally the Sally Hanson ones are up to 9 dollars for one set. Sadly, with this product, you get what you pay for. I was a little concerned when I opened the package and realized that all 8 sets were sealed into one package. I knew that with pervious sets I&#x27;ve used, the left over strips dry out after you open the package, so I am not sure how well they will stay in a ziplock bag. There is not much variety in the sizes but the designs are cute. These do NOT seal to your nail and become hard like normal nail polish or the Sally Hanson strips. Instead they are just stickers that easily chip away. I can actually very easily peel them off my nails and I put them on 3 days ago. I guess that is a positive thing if you are putting them on a child, or want to use them for just a day and don&#x27;t care about how long they last. Personally, I am going to pay extra for a much better quality product that won&#x27;t look like crap 3 days later. The Sally Hanson strips last at least 2 weeks and rarely chip, but are difficult to remove. If you are looking for something cheap that you can wear for a day and then easily peel off, these are perfect....otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Hi, am sorry to give such a bad review. I bought this item for my mum who lives is Mexico and she has not received it</li>
            <li> Amazon reminds me I bought these nail decals on 12/10/11. It&#x27;s 2/6/12, and I&#x27;ve just done my toes for the third time. I&#x27;ve only done my fingers twice. Every time, I&#x27;ve had a good experience. And I&#x27;ve learned a little more. I read someplace that these decals are actually a layer of polish and will dry out if kept for long. So I&#x27;ve wrapped the unused strips tightly in plastic wrap between uses and had no trouble. I&#x27;ve found that, with care, I can get two uses out of each pattern of 16 decals as each is about 1.5\\&quot; long. My nails, both fingers and toes, top out a bit above 1/2\\&quot;. It means careful application with no wastage, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. On my fingernails, with a topcoat, the decals last about a week, looking nice. I cook, knit and crochet and do beadwork, so they get a workout. On my toes, I take them off after about 10 days, but I think they could go longer. The last time, I didn&#x27;t even put a topcoat on my toes; same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to have really clean nails, pushed-back cuticles, and a bit of patience for the best results. I lay the sticky side on my nail, rub it carefully with a tissue to seal it down, then gently bend and pull off the extra decal parts. I don&#x27;t use the emery board to trim the top b/c it isn&#x27;t as nice an edge. If the design--and your nail size--permit, you can then apply the top of the decal to another nail and repeat. Smooth and tuck with the cuticle stick, apply topcoat, and enjoy. I have found that you can also fix a chip with leftover decal if necessary. The design hides the flaws much better than fixing a chip in regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m buying another set of these so I can share some, but I&#x27;m really wishing for different patterns. Of the 8 designs, I think 3 are pretty cute, 3 are so-so (fine for toes as the shock factor works better there, and it&#x27;s not so necessary that they coordinate with your wardrobe--especially in winter), and 2 are \\&quot;whuh?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with and learned a lot on the \\&quot;whuh?\\&quot; decals (purple camouflage). Strange, but they got a lot of compliments and a lot of \\&quot;did you do that yourself? Amazing!\\&quot; I do think it&#x27;s worth not starting with your favorite pattern. I&#x27;d certainly give this product 5 stars if the pattern choice were more to my liking. But for what you get, it&#x27;s a great value.lage).

            <li> I was attracted to these because they seemed like a great deal, and I liked quite a few of the designs. I applied these the same way I have applied Sally Hansen Salon Effects and added a top coat. While initially they seemed to be ok, as soon as they began to set the strip began shrinking and wrinkling around the edges. It also took a while to dry with the top coat so smudging and smearing was possible afterwards. I did try doing it twice to see if it had been a fluke, but alas not. Though Sally Hansen is more expensive, I did prefer the results.</li>
            <li> When I did my nails with the purple camoflauge design, I got so many compliments. I choose that design during the first week of games (GO RAVENS). I wore them that week to show my PURPLE PRIDE!! RAVENSNATION!!!</li>
            <li> These decals while easy to use are designs not very becoming to small areas such as finger or toe nails.  I was disappointed in how they looked in person.</li>
            <li> The stickers are fun to play with but they are poor in quality and they don&#x27;t stick very well when compared to Avon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other nail foils but these are the best by far.  I even did my 7 year old daughters nails with the left overs.  I only wish they had more designs.  The other brands that I have tried were too thick and wouldn&#x27;t stick to my nails (which are natural).  These are perfect because they are  thin and easy to fit around your nails without having to cut them before applying. As soon as they come up with more designs I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> These certainly don&#x27;t last as long as the more popular brand. There are a number of cute patterns that I really liked. Wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> These were awful and peeled off within an hour. Do not waste your money on these. Sally Hansen and Incoco brand is the way to go.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package, I knew these were not very high quality.  One of the strips ripped as I was putting it on, I didn&#x27;t put that much pressure on it.  They lasted a day.  I bought them because I had tried Sally Hansen nail strips, and really liked them.  Those, lasted almost a week.  In the future, I will go with the name brand, not these.  They are easy to use, but not worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li> they are difficult to apply, the instructions were covered up by amazons bar code sticker...not impressed with this product at all</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as nice as the Sally Hansen or Sephora nail decals I have previously purchased. Also, the colors and designs are more for kids or teens. The sets I buy are usually $12 for one, so this is a good value if you are buying for kids. If you want higher quality and more sophisticated designs, I would purchase another brand. Also, I think you really need to apply top coat to these, otherwise they peel easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in April, thinking i&#x27;d be getting a good deal and they would be like the same quality as Sally Hansen. Sally Hansen is the original and Sally Hansen is the BEST. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand! The only cool thing about this brand is that they ship from Hawaii. That&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> I do like the designs of the stickers but I&#x27;m not a big fan of how HUGE they are. I really have to cut these to fit my nails more than other nail stickers I use like salley Hansen. But again very cute designs!</li>
            <li> easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;withstands dishes and other cleaning&lt;br /&gt;lasts for weeks! the longest I have worn them is 3 weeks and usually as an accent (one finger, just the tips, corners). they could have lasted longer, but the polish on the rest of my nails was wearing thin. actually had difficulty with removal, but no damage to my natural nail which is a huge plus for me!</li>
            <li> I gave it such a great review because it everything I thought it would be..... can&#x27;t wait to use them......</li>
            <li> The nail polish strips are perfect for a messy pre-teen girl, who wants nail polish but still can&#x27;t responsibly handle the polish and remover.</li>
            <li> These are thick and hard to use. They also do not stay on more than five minutes and leave a sticky mess on your nails.</li>
