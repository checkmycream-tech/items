            <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great and keeps my hands from cracking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances.</li>
            <li>To top it off, this is the BEST value I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li>None works as good for a length of time that these two products do.</li>
            <li>I also use the Light lotion and sunscreen from this brand; very good products.</li>
            <li>After many years using Aquaphor, I am so happy we switched.</li>
            <li>amazing.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, we&#x27;ve used Vanicream for years, but my daughter&#x27;s eczema outbreak on her hands in winter required something stronger.</li>
            <li>So far, works perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin as it is fragrance-free and non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li>i am so happy to find it on amazon, and order it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for more than a week</li>
            <li>I bought some more after using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better suited for winter moisturizing than summer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can use more for more protection.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it only took ONE APPLICATION!!</li>
            <li>I love Vaniply.</li>
            <li>I have found I am allergic to many chemicals that are in most hand creams.  </li>
            <li>Vaniply is not as greasy and seems to soak into the skin better.</li>
            <li>you made.&lt;br /&gt;Since this has petroleum in it, you&#x27;d be better off using Vaseline anyway.</li>
            <li>Vaseline lasts longer and is a better better.</li>
            <li>but Vaniply seems to help more when the dryness has turned into cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li>Love them and since switching to this line</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks and feels, but it just didn&#x27;t seem moisturizing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we were able to avoid using a steroid.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, fine and not irritating product.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, I use it as lip balm throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and makes for a lovely look.</li>
            <li>You can order through Amazon Prime or go to  a Medical Supply store, and the price is incredible.  </li>
            <li>It cleared up his rash quickly, doesn&#x27;t have any oder (unlike most kid products)</li>
            <li>It melts into the skin, goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable sheen.</li>
            <li>Pay higher prices for name brand eye moisturizers but you won&#x27;t get better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we tried this first.  </li>
            <li>It also works great on dry, chapped lips, but I prefer</li>
            <li>It also works great on dry, chapped lips, but I prefer</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry skin!</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have this ointment, I would need to use a full mask at night</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful with a thick consistency and no odor.</li>
            <li>Vaniply clearly knows nothing about their own product.</li>
            <li>Love this, great for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient is dimethicone (1%), which is a great occlusive for sealing in moisture (Gold Bond also contains dimethicone).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really greasy and does not like to absorb very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for nighttime, but not so much when facing the general public.</li>
            <li>Works fine although the price per that size tube is quite high.</li>
            <li>and right away my lips felt relieved.</li>
            <li>This is just the right amount of protection.</li>
            <li>Unlike Aquaphor or Vaseline, the Vaniply seems to absorb/dry quickly, leaving the skin smooth, supple and soft, with a matte appearance.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my baby&#x27;s very, very stubborn drool rash practically overnight.  </li>
            <li>I often run into allergic reactions with many topical liquids/creams</li>
            <li>The first time I used Vaniply was when my dermatologist sent me home with a sample</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and one big jar is like a lifetime supply since you need such a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>The ointment is opaque, rather than clear like Aquaphor and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>soap was heaven, the lotion a must, and the ointment perfect for either cold or very hot days for running.  </li>
            <li>It is thick, perhaps a bit more like vasoline, but more breatheable.  </li>
            <li>I liked the results, but no matter how thin a layer I applied, I still had more shine and greasiness than I would like.</li>
            <li>Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot believe how well this stuff works.</li>
            <li>For someone with dry/cracked/chapped skin it is an absolute god-send.</li>
            <li>It is an ointment, so very greasy, but it does eventually absorb and it has no smell.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I then started using Elta MD Intense Moisturizer, which is basically just petrolatum &amp; paraffin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ointment, much like Aquaphor, but isn&#x27;t petroleum-based.</li>
            <li>Much better than a lot of other over-the-counter&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, unlike Vaseline, and does not have a strange taste.</li>
            <li>My already sensitive skin and become even more sensitive recently.  </li>
            <li>My doctor then suggested this particular ointment as a replacement to the lip conditioners I was using.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me several samples and I sparingly used the product and determined with all the other moisturizers we have that only VaniCream and VaniPly work the best with my dry and cracking skin problems.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist highly recommended this line of products.  </li>
            <li>Very healing to dry, chapped hands, and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Many hand lotions actually made my hands worse instead of better.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a vaniply lip ointment and body moisturizer cream here, right now my lips and skin are all back to normal.</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive and this is the only product I can use.</li>
            <li>I found this is the only thing i can put on my lips right now,</li>
            <li>I live for this stuff...</li>
            <li>This is my new go to lip gloss.</li>
            <li>When they are empty, I just put the tubes in boiled water to sanitize and clean, and then refill.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Vaniply products for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts, clogged pores or milia, even though my skin is so very sensitive.</li>
            <li>4 year old can even do it herself!</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this ointment helps the area around my nose to not be irritated when I use my CPAP machine with nasal pillows.  </li>
            <li>I tried all natural lip balms but everything seemed to irritate my skin and make my lips even drier.</li>
            <li>Use it regularly on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well as eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li>When I return from running I am not swollen up, my face feels soft, no itches, and I can rinse the ointment off, put the lotion on and am on my way.</li>
            <li>I emailed them and asked if it had any petroleum or petroleum-derivatives in it as I have severe adult eczema on the majority of my body</li>
            <li>and so I have developed an allergy to petrochemicals.</li>
            <li>Professionally I work around a lot of paper and it dries my skin and eventually cracks if I don&#x27;t moisturize them.</li>
            <li>My son tends to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In particular, I have to avoid anything that works as a hormone/estrogen in the body such as paraben preservatives, which are in almost all cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li>Excellent skin protectant against harsh chemicals, soap, and cold weather.</li>
            <li>I put it on one night and the next morning my hands were soft and healed!</li>
            <li>This product was a lifesaver - it didn&#x27;t totally solve the problem but it certainly went a long way to making her life bearable.</li>
            <li>I neglected to say that the vaniply sunscreen (at least the 30 SPF) is fabulous on my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my eyes at night and if I have a particular dry spot.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to put any sunscreen on my face without horrible swelling, even the most sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly dry and sensitive skin, and I also don&#x27;t want cancer.  </li>
            <li>I do not have particularly sensitive skin, but in the winter my hands dry out and my knuckles crack and often end up bleeding.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>For sensitive, dry skin this version is the only version that works.</li>
            <li>I use it only at night  as it is rather thick and does not absorb quickly.</li>

            <li> I put it on one night and the next morning my hands were soft and healed!</li>
            <li> This product was a lifesaver - it didn&#x27;t totally solve the problem but it certainly went a long way to making her life bearable.</li>
            <li> I neglected to say that the vaniply sunscreen (at least the 30 SPF) is fabulous on my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my eyes at night and if I have a particular dry spot.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to put any sunscreen on my face without horrible swelling, even the most sensitive.  </li>

            <li> They didn&#x27;t start to get dry again for about 3 weeks, so I re-applied and haven&#x27;t needed to use it again since!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than petroleum jelly, but has similar uses.</li>

            <li> Very few products don&#x27;t cause my son to react, and I rely heavily on this entire line....</li>
            <li> I had never experienced any skin sensitivity prior to about a year ago, so it was pretty scary.  </li>
            <li> It seems to hold moisture in but leaves a sheen and slightly greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I will say that it is a bit greasy, but it is significantly LESS greasy than Vaseline or Neosporin.</li>
            <li> if i did not do it for a half day, my lips will start to peel off again.</li>
            <li> I felt that other chapped lip products were only making the problem worse.</li>
            <li> If you use a little and rub it in, it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little greasey, but that goes away as you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> A little too greasy.</li>
            <li> I like to apply the Vaniply over slightly damp skin, or over a thin layer of Vanicream if in need of extra moisture.</li>
            <li> It is like a less thick petroleum jelly (without the petroleum smell).It handles that raw feeling on your lips after brushing your teeth or eating a meal.</li>
            <li> When his skin is exceptionally dry, I will apply a thin coat of this on his arms and legs before bedtime instead of Vanicream lotion.  </li>

            <li> We usually use Aquafor</li>
            <li> Vaniply, we also use this along with vanicream lite which is more of a lotion then cream, and this has cleared up the worst of the eczema with in 4 days at this point.</li>
            <li> Winter makes it 100x worse, thanks to the low humidity and frigid temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried lotions, and they usually just sting and make the problem worse, not better.</li>
            <li> the morning, I was using a thin layer of Aquaphor to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> The only stuff that works for really bad eczema!</li>
            <li> I hope my lips did not got addicted to it, but it did save my life.&lt;br /&gt;Thank god!</li>
            <li> And thank you for not writing back to me when I told you of this horrible error</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also tried Vaseline, but couldn&#x27;t get past the faint petroleum smell, and the texture was absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> We used CeraVe first that made it worst, then Aveeno BABY, that made it worst and now</li>

            <li> My skin is sensitive and this ointment helps the area around my nose to not be irritated when I use my CPAP machine with nasal pillows.  If I didn&#x27;t have this ointment, I would need to use a full mask at night but now I don&#x27;t!  A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. My husband it every day on his lips.</li>
            <li> I used this all over my face and even under my eyes.  Great product for contact dermatitis!  Much better than a lot of other over-the-counter&lt;br /&gt;products I&#x27;ve used.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great Moisturizer!!! Best I&#x27;ve found, and it does not aggravate my acne by clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry and sensitive skin, and I also don&#x27;t want cancer.  In particular, I have to avoid anything that works as a hormone/estrogen in the body such as paraben preservatives, which are in almost all cosmetics.  This is the perfect product.  I use it on my eyes at night and if I have a particular dry spot.  But most importantly, I use it as lip balm throughout the day.  I bought 10 empty lip balm tubes with caps - I wanted the ultra thin ones, which I found on Etsy, but I know that Amazon at least has the normal size ones - and filled them with Vaniply.  When they are empty, I just put the tubes in boiled water to sanitize and clean, and then refill.  So far, works perfect.  I also use the Light lotion and sunscreen from this brand; very good products.</li>
            <li> Works great!  love it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Just a little of this goes a long way.  I like using it as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my eczema. Seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I recently paid a visit to my Dermatologist as I was suffering from some allergic reaction to my lip balm (EOS). I often run into allergic reactions with many topical liquids/creams and so I was not surprised to get a reaction to the lip balm I was using. My doctor then suggested this particular ointment as a replacement to the lip conditioners I was using. She said that the product is quite similar to petrolleum jelly (Vaseline). I&#x27;ve been using it now for more than a week and I&#x27;m definitely making the switch a permanent one. It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin as it is fragrance-free and non-comedogenic. I apply this liberally throughout the day with no irritation. I only wish that the packaging was smaller since I only use this as chap stick.</li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my dermatologist gave this to me after some injectables in my lips. I bought some more after using it. This is a great, fine and not irritating product. I would buy it again. But, alittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have been using Cetaphil for years but I could not find anything for... my lips! I tried all natural lip balms but everything seemed to irritate my skin and make my lips even drier. The first time I used Vaniply was when my dermatologist sent me home with a sample and right away my lips felt relieved. It&#x27;s light, unlike Vaseline, and does not have a strange taste. This is the only product I use now.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our pediatrician to treat eczema. It seems to hold moisture in but leaves a sheen and slightly greasy feel. It&#x27;s better suited for winter moisturizing than summer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works fine although the price per that size tube is quite high. Still, I would recommend it to anyone considering the benefits</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Recommended to me by my dermatologist and allergist for eye eczema. It works like a charm and it great as a lip balm, too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for some skin problems she is experiencing--similar to rosacea.  It was recommended by her dermatologist and Mom now swears by the stuff.  Ordering and delivery was flawless.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to. And they work well. I use the Hair Gel, Shampoo, Conditioner, Skin Cream, Lite Lotion, Vaniply Ointment, and Liquid Cleanser. All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ointment is soothing and non-irritating. If you use a little and rub it in, it&#x27;s not sticky. You can use more for more protection. It makes my nails shiny. It&#x27;s less greasy than petroleum jelly, but has similar uses.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Cleared up my baby&#x27;s very, very stubborn drool rash practically overnight.  Note that it contains dimethicone, so it&#x27;s not like the Vanicream lotion/cream (which don&#x27;t have dimethicone).</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I do not have particularly sensitive skin, but in the winter my hands dry out and my knuckles crack and often end up bleeding. It&#x27;s extremely painful. I have tried lotions, and they usually just sting and make the problem worse, not better. I have tried putting Vaseline on my hands before I went to bed, and even finally resorted to coating them in Neosporin every night before bed - which can get extremely messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like a miracle cure! I will say that it is a bit greasy, but it is significantly LESS greasy than Vaseline or Neosporin. The best part is that it only took ONE APPLICATION!! I put it on one night and the next morning my hands were soft and healed! They didn&#x27;t start to get dry again for about 3 weeks, so I re-applied and haven&#x27;t needed to use it again since! I absolutely cannot believe how well this stuff works. For someone with dry/cracked/chapped skin it is an absolute god-send. Especially if you have to wash your hands a lot during the day (i.e. working in a hospital or restaurant.). Great product!</li>
            <li> I moved to the a very dry area from CA one year ago, the location change did lots of damage to my body.&lt;br /&gt;my face started to peel off because of the dryness, especially my lips, it is burning red and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;I tried all kinds of lip bar, and went to see allergists, but they did not help.&lt;br /&gt;So i scheduled a dermatologist, she looked at my lips, and recommended me to try some sample lip ointment, and it works like a miracle. My lips healed immediately that afternoon after applied this product.&lt;br /&gt;And i am so happy to find it on amazon, and order it right away. It is a big tube, i can use it for 9 months at least. I found this is the only thing i can put on my lips right now, if i did not do it for a half day, my lips will start to peel off again. I hope my lips did not got addicted to it, but it did save my life.&lt;br /&gt;Thank god!</li>
            <li> Vaniply was prescribed by my dermatologist.  I have been using it for less than one month but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Love this, great for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great for my use.</li>
            <li> Our toddler has had dry skin since birth.  This was recommended by his dermatologist by 4 months for his very dry skin on his face. His cheeks get so bad they would get chapped.  This is the only lotion that takes care of the chapped skin, without irritating it &amp; keeps it from coming back as long as we use it daily. This lotion has become harder to find and big-box stores &amp; pharmacies... They only carry they regular version.  For sensitive, dry skin this version is the only version that works.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist had given me a sample of this for my psoriasis and it worked so well that I looked on Amazon and found it here!  The price is great!  I even got it for my mom and brother who also said it worked great for them.  It is an ointment but I just dab some of w/a paper towel so it is not too greasy.  Great stuff for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my lips nightly and sometimes under lipstick if I let it absorb...It is so smooth and makes for a lovely look.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me samples of this. I was happy to find it on Amazon. It is an ointment, so very greasy, but it does eventually absorb and it has no smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin as well as eczema on my hands. Many hand lotions actually made my hands worse instead of better. My dermatologist recommended this product and it works very well. I use it only at night  as it is rather thick and does not absorb quickly. During the day I use Vanicream.</li>
            <li> The only stuff that works for really bad eczema!</li>
            <li> Doctor recommendation for dry and peeling skin after a facial peel.</li>
            <li> I bought this smaller tube of the Vaniply ointment skin as a travel companion to the big pots of Vaniply lotion and ointment that I have at my house.  Before I began using these products, my face swelled and itched with any product that I used.  I could use no soap, and when I went running my face was beet red and swollen when I returned.  I began to use the words, \\&quot;before my face fell off\\&quot;.  I had never experienced any skin sensitivity prior to about a year ago, so it was pretty scary.  My dermatologist recommended this product, and though I was skeptical, bought it and the related Vaniply products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap was heaven, the lotion a must, and the ointment perfect for either cold or very hot days for running.  It is thick, perhaps a bit more like vasoline, but more breatheable.  Just a little goes a long way.  When I return from running I am not swollen up, my face feels soft, no itches, and I can rinse the ointment off, put the lotion on and am on my way. I neglected to say that the vaniply sunscreen (at least the 30 SPF) is fabulous on my face.  I have never been able to put any sunscreen on my face without horrible swelling, even the most sensitive.  This one though...amazing.  Get them All!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small tube can go in a carry-on and will last for a long time.  To top it off, this is the BEST value I have ever seen.  You can order through Amazon Prime or go to  a Medical Supply store, and the price is incredible.  I highly recommend Vaniply products for anyone with sensitive skin.  You won&#x27;t know how you went without it!</li>
            <li> I love Vaniply. It was recommended by my dermatologist to help with my dry skin in Colorado and it works wonders. It is not greasy and rubs in well, while leaving my skin in beautiful condition. If I could, I would bathe in it!</li>
            <li> My son that is 18 months had a constant red rash under his chin because of his teething.  The doctor recommended Vaniply and it worked overnight.  We usually use Aquafor but it didn&#x27;t help with the rash or chaffing.</li>
            <li> I have found I am allergic to many chemicals that are in most hand creams.  My dermatologist has recommended this product and it works well for me.  It goes on a little greasey, but that goes away as you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t had any problem. very good</li>
            <li> Excellent skin protectant against harsh chemicals, soap, and cold weather. Very healing to dry, chapped hands, and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my daughters ezcema.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Derm. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product. A little too greasy.</li>
            <li> Work for eczema great !!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, we&#x27;ve used Vanicream for years, but my daughter&#x27;s eczema outbreak on her hands in winter required something stronger. This doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin at all like she sometimes says petroleum jelly does. It&#x27;s wonderful with a thick consistency and no odor. Worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Our allergist recommended this ointment in lieu of Aquaphor. After many years using Aquaphor, I am so happy we switched. Vaniply is not as greasy and seems to soak into the skin better. 4 year old can even do it herself!</li>
            <li> Greasy, has a strange rubbery smell. I prefer CeraVe cream for my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> I live for this stuff... I am super sensitive and this is the only product I can use.</li>
            <li> Vaniply clearly knows nothing about their own product. I emailed them and asked if it had any petroleum or petroleum-derivatives in it as I have severe adult eczema on the majority of my body and so I have developed an allergy to petrochemicals. They told me no, so I bought it and used it all over my face. My face was getting red and itchy but I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be Vaniply, so I used it for weeks. I finally got scared enough to look it up and what do you know, microcrystalline wax is a petroleum derivative. Thank you for causing my very painful skin to be even worse. And thank you for not writing back to me when I told you of this horrible error you made.&lt;br /&gt;Since this has petroleum in it, you&#x27;d be better off using Vaseline anyway. Vaseline lasts longer and is a better better. It&#x27;s probably cheaper, too.</li>
            <li> This ointment is great for my daughter&#x27;s eczema! The lotion formulas burn her skin, but the ointment works well for her.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this ointment for some under eye irritation. Best thing ever!  Pay higher prices for name brand eye moisturizers but you won&#x27;t get better results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really greasy and does not like to absorb very quickly.  Bought this because my Dermatologist thought it would help my dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of Vaseline on my son that has eczema and is allergic to Lanolin.  When his skin is exceptionally dry, I will apply a thin coat of this on his arms and legs before bedtime instead of Vanicream lotion.  Very few products don&#x27;t cause my son to react, and I rely heavily on this entire line....body wash, shampoo, lotion and ointment.</li>
            <li> I recently found out I have an allergy to Lanolin, and my dermatologist recommended Vaniply. It&#x27;s working great and keeps my hands from cracking.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been taking Acutane and it has caused her lips to crack and bleed badly.  Normal chap sticks failed and even dermatologist suggested brands didn&#x27;t help much.  This product was a lifesaver - it didn&#x27;t totally solve the problem but it certainly went a long way to making her life bearable.</li>
            <li> I have periodic eczema on my hands.  Other ointments help with dryness but Vaniply seems to help more when the dryness has turned into cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li> My already sensitive skin and become even more sensitive recently.  My dermatologist highly recommended this line of products.  Love them and since switching to this line I don&#x27;t have the skin irritation that I did with other mainstream products. This is my new go to lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I tested this product for over a year. My dermatologist gave me several samples and I sparingly used the product and determined with all the other moisturizers we have that only VaniCream and VaniPly work the best with my dry and cracking skin problems. Professionally I work around a lot of paper and it dries my skin and eventually cracks if I don&#x27;t moisturize them. At home I do a lot of home projects with my wife and it dries my skin so I use both products to resolve the drying and cracking. My wife has a plethora of moisturizers and I&#x27;ve tried them all. None works as good for a length of time that these two products do.</li>
            <li> I was allergic to some unknown products and my skin around my chin looks like etzma,  Then my dermatologist gave me a sample of this ointment, it works immediately, like a miracke. So I ordered a vaniply lip ointment and body moisturizer cream here, right now my lips and skin are all back to normal. Love it.</li>
            <li> Vaniply products are the only ointment/ creams that helps my lips and skin. I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry skin on my hands and face and everything seem to make it worse. Now that I&#x27;ve been using vaniply my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin - actually, it&#x27;s DEHYDRATED skin according to my dermatologist. Winter makes it 100x worse, thanks to the low humidity and frigid temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I use non-soap cleansers (Albolene at night, water-only in the morning). At night, I use a thin layer of Eucerin&#x27;s Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme. It&#x27;s extremely rich, but very thick, hard to spread, and greasy. Perfect for nighttime, but not so much when facing the general public. It&#x27;s also the best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and one big jar is like a lifetime supply since you need such a tiny amount. I&#x27;d also tried Vaseline, but couldn&#x27;t get past the faint petroleum smell, and the texture was absolutely awful. Obviously the slug life is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I was using a thin layer of Aquaphor to seal in moisture. I liked the results, but no matter how thin a layer I applied, I still had more shine and greasiness than I would like. I then started using Elta MD Intense Moisturizer, which is basically just petrolatum &amp; paraffin. It melts into the skin, goes on smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable sheen. I love the way it looks and feels, but it just didn&#x27;t seem moisturizing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Vaniply. I already use Vanicream moisturizer as an all-over body moisturizer and was given a sample of Vaniply from my dermatologist. It&#x27;s an ointment, much like Aquaphor, but isn&#x27;t petroleum-based. The active ingredient is dimethicone (1%), which is a great occlusive for sealing in moisture (Gold Bond also contains dimethicone). The ointment is opaque, rather than clear like Aquaphor and glides on smoothly. Unlike Aquaphor or Vaseline, the Vaniply seems to absorb/dry quickly, leaving the skin smooth, supple and soft, with a matte appearance. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts, clogged pores or milia, even though my skin is so very sensitive. I like to apply the Vaniply over slightly damp skin, or over a thin layer of Vanicream if in need of extra moisture. It also works great on dry, chapped lips, but I prefer Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaniply is impossible to find in stores, so you&#x27;ll most likely need to order it online. A little goes a long way!isture.

            <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample and recommended this dry lips and dry skin patches. It helps and protects chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been through a quite a few creams for my 2 month old son that was diagnosed with infant eczema.  We used CeraVe first that made it worst, then Aveeno BABY, that made it worst and now Vaniply, we also use this along with vanicream lite which is more of a lotion then cream, and this has cleared up the worst of the eczema with in 4 days at this point.</li>
            <li> I used this on the advice of my dermatologist. She gave me a sample to use on chapped lips. It is like a less thick petroleum jelly (without the petroleum smell).It handles that raw feeling on your lips after brushing your teeth or eating a meal. I felt that other chapped lip products were only making the problem worse.This is just the right amount of protection. I wish it could be purchased in purse size containers.</li>
            <li> My son tends to have sensitive skin.  His allergist recommended we try Vaniply Ointments and lotions before we moved on to a stronger steroid cream.  I&#x27;m glad we tried this first.  It cleared up his rash quickly, doesn&#x27;t have any oder (unlike most kid products) and we were able to avoid using a steroid.  I have ordered extra tubes to keep in his diaper bag and at daycare.</li>
