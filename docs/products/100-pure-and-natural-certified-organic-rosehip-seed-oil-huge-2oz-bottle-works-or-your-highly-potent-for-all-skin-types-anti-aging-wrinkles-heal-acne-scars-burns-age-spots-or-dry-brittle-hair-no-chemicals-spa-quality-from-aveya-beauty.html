            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>You could pay a lot more but not get any better.</li>
            <li>Aveya&#x27;s Organic Rosehip Seed Oil is working for me in more ways than one.  </li>
            <li>but I will say the description should be updated to prominently tell customers that the bottle does not include a dropper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this one works so well without a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Other than the great quality of the oil, I like that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get good coverage or results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>I love that Aveya Beauty&#x27;s Organic Rosehip OIl keeps my skin moisturized, flawlessly smooth and youthful looking without overloading my pores with excess oil... which is a problem as I have always has patches of oily</li>
            <li>Originally I got it to help give my skin a softer, more youthful glow</li>
            <li>And the oil is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>It also decreases the appearance of pores, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>that I could use it daily and still get great moisturizing results for my hair, skin, and nails without getting breakouts as a result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable, effective, and</li>
            <li>I love, love, love what it does for my skin and nails, but most of the oils have such a distinctive &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; that I want to hold my nose while using them.</li>
            <li>I purchased it originally to see if it could help my age spots</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I want to mention that it this oil did NOT break me out, which is super rare for almost any product containing oil that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best moisturizer on the market to you treat the signs of wrinkles, fine lines, eczema, acne scars, stretch marks and many other skin related issues as it is 100% pure and natural</li>
            <li>but it actually brought with it a more toned and smooth finish as well.</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback, regardless I only recommend products that worked for me and that I think will work for my readers.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed how well and quickly it absorbed into my skin- even in the dryer</li>
            <li>a great product by Aveya Beauty that should definitely be given a second look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite qualities about rose hip seed oil is that it really reduces the appearance of small scars.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>keeping the oil natural and free of harmful chemicals and additives that oftentimes can irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It even retains it&#x27;s benefits after cleansing, keeping my skin soft, smooth and dewy.</li>
            <li>While your results may not be exactly like mine, I do recommend this product to improve skin, nail and hair appearance and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they are fading fast after using this product!  </li>
            <li>Now before I can use this, I have to order a bottle with a dropper, pay more shipping charges, and wait several days.</li>
            <li>I think it really does help hair to grow.</li>
            <li>It provides great moisturization, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or staining behind.</li>
            <li>I have been using Rosehip oils for years, my mom used it and many other family members used it for a variety of reason as it is your all purpose go to for all skin care needs</li>
            <li>This essential oil can be used full strength or can be added to lotions, creams, serums and hair products.</li>
            <li>I used it for all these uses and can say that this particular product works well without any other chemicals or strong scents.</li>
            <li>Since Rosehip oil is so expensive, I feel I got a great deal.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve also been using it in my hair (per the directions) and love it - no more dry/brittle flyways.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love everything about this (and the other) oil.</li>
            <li>It can reduce the appearance of stretch marks and acne scarring, reduce redness and other skin discoloration, improve sun spots, moisturize nails and cuticles, and a few drops can be added to shampoo and conditioners to help soften hair and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a few extra ounces for the price of 4 oz bottle.</li>

            <li> I bought this to aid in hairgrowth and simply added it to other natural oils I use in my hair.</li>
            <li> is packed with lots of naturally occurring active ingredients that work together to give your skin a total transformation.</li>
            <li> Have used Rosehip oil previously from an organic store and it was fine but not amazing.</li>
            <li> ..Seems to dry out shortly after use...</li>
            <li> I can use it on my face and hands without leaving smudges of oil on everything (though I do give it a few minutes to completely absorb before I apply makeup).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I was worried that I was paying too much for such a small bottle, but as it turns out a little of the oil goes a long way and in the 3 weeks that I have had the Rosehip Oil</li>
            <li> however, it is still the sellers responsibility to alert potential buyers when the image does not accurately reflect what they are selling.</li>
            <li> Of course it has other benefits.</li>
            <li> It has a very minimal scent.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it might do this as the oil is NOT clear, but does have a slight orange-reddish tint to it.</li>
            <li> I have tried another product from the same brand and they seem to put out high quality stuff because I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Rosehip oil for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Used for 3 weeks and Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my breakouts, marks, or my small wrinkles (I&#x27;m 25)</li>
            <li> but, thank goodness, it&#x27;s *not* overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have hardly made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> As with another of their oils I&#x27;m using, I have one complaint:</li>
            <li> but I did notice my forehead breaking out in small tiny bumps which never happens..... :(</li>
            <li> Mom purchased for my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> difficult using&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is misleading, and unfortunately I did not see the review that mentions this...</li>
            <li> very thin for rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I hate not having a dropper.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My favorite facial moisturizer.  Soothes my skin after a skin peel.</li>
            <li> Not so great ..Seems to dry out shortly after use...</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I buy one of skin care products, and my skin seems to like this one. It&#x27;s soothing for skin irritations</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a few extra ounces for the price of 4 oz bottle. I bought this to aid in hairgrowth and simply added it to other natural oils I use in my hair. I think it really does help hair to grow. It does a good job on my skin too. Since Rosehip oil is so expensive, I feel I got a great deal. So yes, buy it. The quality of the oil is nice too. Thank you.</li>

            <li> I have been using this Rosehip oil for a few weeks now and I have to say that it has done wonders for my skin. Originally I got it to help give my skin a softer, more youthful glow and it did that, but it actually brought with it a more toned and smooth finish as well.

            <li> I just received my oil and it has only been about 5 minutes and I can tell the big difference it has already made. this is like magic potion. my skin feels and looks great. great product.</li>
            <li> very thin for rosehip oil. in addition it smelled like fish oil. returned it the day after I received it.</li>
            <li> Mom purchased for my troubled skin. Smell isn&#x27;t too great but is tolerable. Have used Rosehip oil previously from an organic store and it was fine but not amazing. This oil didn&#x27;t help my skin whatsoever. Used for 3 weeks and Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my breakouts, marks, or my small wrinkles (I&#x27;m 25) Maybe a good mousturizer? My skin did not notice a difference in a good way but I did notice my forehead breaking out in small tiny bumps which never happens..... :(</li>
            <li> I use all over body. I no longer need lotion. I use on face and I have no acne, no blackheads, and my skin honestly looks radiant. I love this, this is a staple now</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome it really helps with the texture of your skin</li>
            <li> This feels good on my skin and seems to be working well for me.</li>
            <li> Very good oil but pic show dropper bottle .i got bottle don&#x27;t have a dropper&lt;br /&gt;Very difficult using&lt;br /&gt;I wish Next Oder this oil comes a dropper bottle</li>
            <li> as good as any. I like rose hip oil. I hate not having a dropper. It can all be spilled in seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what it says it is. You could pay a lot more but not get any better.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using it because it is easy to use and it works fairly well.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil. This oil comes in an amber glass bottle with no eye dropper. It is made in the USA. It is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: The wonderful thing about rose hip seed oil is that is a pure refined oil, with no added chemicals, preservatives, fragrances or color. This rose hip seed oil blends across the skin easily. It has a very minimal scent. On application it immediately starts softening and smoothing my skin. It also decreases the appearance of pores, fine lines and wrinkles. One of my favorite qualities about rose hip seed oil is that it really reduces the appearance of small scars. It seems to soften the scarred skin and reduce the redness. Of course it has other benefits. It can reduce the appearance of stretch marks and acne scarring, reduce redness and other skin discoloration, improve sun spots, moisturize nails and cuticles, and a few drops can be added to shampoo and conditioners to help soften hair and make it more manageable. This essential oil can be used full strength or can be added to lotions, creams, serums and hair products. I used it for all these uses and can say that this particular product works well without any other chemicals or strong scents. It even retains it&#x27;s benefits after cleansing, keeping my skin soft, smooth and dewy. While your results may not be exactly like mine, I do recommend this product to improve skin, nail and hair appearance and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback, regardless I only recommend products that worked for me and that I think will work for my readers.</li>

I purchased it originally to see if it could help my age spots and they are fading fast after using this product!  Since then I&#x27;ve also been using it in my hair (per the directions) and love it - no more dry/brittle flyways.  So impressed!  Disclaimer: I obtained this item at a discount for my unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> I just received the oil, so I have no comment about its efficacy... but I will say the description should be updated to prominently tell customers that the bottle does not include a dropper. This is misleading, and unfortunately I did not see the review that mentions this... however, it is still the sellers responsibility to alert potential buyers when the image does not accurately reflect what they are selling. Now before I can use this, I have to order a bottle with a dropper, pay more shipping charges, and wait several days. I could have bought everything at once instead of being inconvenienced.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of this Rose Hip Oil from Aveya Beauty is definitely a great organic option to some of the more costly and chemical-laden alternatives that are out on the market today! It provides great moisturization, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or staining behind. I was a little worried that it might do this as the oil is NOT clear, but does have a slight orange-reddish tint to it. Also, I noticed how well and quickly it absorbed into my skin- even in the dryer areas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I want to mention that it this oil did NOT break me out, which is super rare for almost any product containing oil that I&#x27;ve used. I was really impressed by this fact alone- that I could use it daily and still get great moisturizing results for my hair, skin, and nails without getting breakouts as a result. It&#x27;s very affordable, effective, and a great product by Aveya Beauty that should definitely be given a second look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive this product in exchange for an awesome, honest product review!</li>
            <li> I have a love-hate relationship with rosehip seed oil. I love, love, love what it does for my skin and nails, but most of the oils have such a distinctive &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; that I want to hold my nose while using them. I always worry that if they don&#x27;t stink, they don&#x27;t work as well. I am finally learning to rely on the results and not the smell. I&#x27;m so glad that this one works so well without a strong odor.The oil does have the rosehip seed odor but, thank goodness, it&#x27;s *not* overwhelming. And the oil is pretty amazing. I use a LOT of oils in my hair and skincare routine. This one isn&#x27;t sticky or too greasy. I can use it on my face and hands without leaving smudges of oil on everything (though I do give it a few minutes to completely absorb before I apply makeup). I have tried another product from the same brand and they seem to put out high quality stuff because I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. As with another of their oils I&#x27;m using, I have one complaint: the print on the back labels is SOOO tiny! Other than that, I love everything about this (and the other) oil. Other than the great quality of the oil, I like that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get good coverage or results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
