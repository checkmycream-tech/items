    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Still a great product!</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with these blades.</li>
            <li>I have used these replacements for over a year now and find them to be awesome.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>best price I have found them..</li>
            <li>great stuff and great price!!</li>
            <li>The refills arrived today, they are in perfect shape, smell good</li>
            <li>GREAT for shaving</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great deal with the price online</li>
            <li>So... kudos for the great idea.</li>
            <li>These are a great price and a great find..</li>
            <li>The Intuition shaver is excellent, and the price for these cartridges was much better than what I found in stores.</li>
            <li>It is great to find it for a great price on Amazon because it does seem like disposable razors can be kind of a rip off.</li>
            <li>They are the best blades for a good clean shave with no irritation!</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon (with free over 25.00 shipping) makes it a no brainer to purchase and get a great rpice too!</li>
            <li>I picked the Intuition because I really liked the idea of having the soap and shaver in</li>
            <li>Like most women, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every kind of razor.</li>
            <li>I also like that it glides along the leg very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Wish I bought more at this price.</li>
            <li>so i am writing more and more.</li>
            <li>i hope this helps your purchase :-)</li>
            <li>This is an excellent deal and I  definitely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>I love Schick Intuition shavers.</li>
            <li>I will keep purchasing as I run out. :)</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product, it&#x27;s her favorite</li>
            <li>I just Love this product.</li>
            <li>love these razors..</li>
            <li>If they made the soap insert so you could flip it over and use the other side, it&#x27;d be most awesome and more than worth the $$$!</li>
            <li>For those of you who haven&#x27;t used these before, they are great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to shave your legs with these.  </li>
            <li>I received these refills very quickly.  </li>
            <li>main \\&quot;pro\\&quot; of this razor is that, in my opinion, it gives a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>I love them for vacation, as it cuts down on what i have to bring (no pun intended) but at home i have no room for spray cans in my shower, so this is ideal.  </li>
            <li>I love these razor heads, and it was a good deal, so thanks so much!  </li>
            <li>The packaging was fantastic as each refill comes in a separate case.</li>
            <li>will not try to be cheap about razors again would rather throw them out.</li>
            <li>And this price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is a shame really, because I love the idea, but even dollar store razors are better quality.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on prior reviews, stating that these were a good item.  </li>
            <li>I keep getting mild razor burn when I use the blades from this order.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell, not too perfume-y, really gives you that fresh out of the shower feeling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember exactly what the 3 blade looked like, but these look like cheap blades inserted in the lather bar, rather than what I&#x27;m used to with the 4 blade.  </li>
            <li>It is so quick and easy to use, and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams.</li>
            <li>These are REALLY pricy for a horrifically flimsy, cheap razor.</li>
            <li>They may be pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>the smell is off scent and the blades don&#x27;t seem to be seated right.  </li>
            <li>I would have to agree with another reviewer who said that something just isn&#x27;t quite right with these blades.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look right and don&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s not the most economical shaving system out there, but buying the refills through Amazon is definitely the cheapest way to go.</li>
            <li>I usually use the Pomegranate Cartridges from Intuition, but the Cucumber Cartridges are also very good and soft to my skin.</li>
            <li>I think I will be using Amazon more for products used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find them at my local store any more, so I had to order them on line.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>but this razor gets it all first</li>
            <li>They are soft and smooth on your skin and don&#x27;t nick or cut the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love them, and I can&#x27;t find them in the store, in larger packs!</li>
            <li>i purchased the razor on clearence after xmas and loved it only problem is refills r so expensive til i found these ones, love them!</li>
            <li>If I use the razor on my bikini or underarms than of course it will dull and won&#x27;t really be good for another use.</li>
            <li>(what genius is responsible for that bit of designing??).</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just more careful</li>
            <li>and I know that they are 4 blades and the real thing.</li>
            <li>You really should try this item, as it has cucumber lotion and blades all in one.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need shaving cream</li>
            <li>so they will last longer, but by far the cheapest prices are on amazon as well :)</li>
            <li>Product was received in a timely basis although not as pictured - in one box - but rather in two 3-count boxes, which is no big deal since the full 6 cartridges were included.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended coz</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years and have never had this type of problem with any of my other refill purchases (primarily from retail stores).</li>
            <li>my old venus (i&#x27;m a yeti, copious body hair), nor do i have issues with the soap running out fast as i keep it out of direct line of fire from my shower nozzle when not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only product my daughter uses and store prices can make you poor in no time - this is a great price.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, even so, this does not irritate it at all (except for when I get a nick).</li>
            <li>find that the average refill lasts in good condition (with soap on the sharp side of the blades) for maybe 6 uses; after that, the only soap is left on the dull side of the blades, where it doesn&#x27;t do any good</li>
            <li>The moisturizers really work and they don&#x27;t leave my skin red and tingly afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the razor itself has some good points, the refills are too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>Recently, I went to purchase it at Duane Reade (where would normally pick up my refills) and was surprised to find that they no longer carried this \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; but--only some other new types and at a ridiculously high price.  </li>
            <li>However, I hardly get 5 minutes for a shower most days and this is the only way I can get a shave.</li>
            <li>Way overpriced, if you ask me, especially since they don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap completely surrounds the blades, but since I shave only in one direction (using the sharp side of the blades, as I believe most people do), the soap on that side wears down much faster that the soap on the other side.</li>
            <li>There are many other Intuition blades from other sellers that have received less than stellar reviews, such as not being the correct product, so I decided to purchase this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had one soap bar pop off the razor completely after only a couple of uses, and there was no way to reattach it -</li>
            <li>I have to disagree and say these last far longer than 3-5 shaves.</li>
            <li>I have mine hanging on the wall of my shower far away from where water can disintegrate them faster than necessary.</li>
            <li>Look closely at the display picture and you will notice that these are the old cartridges that only have 3 blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a much faster and cleaner shave as you don&#x27;t have to fuss with other products.    </li>
            <li>The soap wears down very quickly and unevenly.</li>
            <li>However, they barely last a few shaves and they become dull very quickly (way faster than the soap runs out) and then look out for nicks!</li>
            <li>Also, since they get dull quick you have to go back over the same place multiple times.</li>

            <li> Also, since they get dull quick you have to go back over the same place multiple times.</li>
            <li> However, they will not give as a close a shave, in my experience, as a regular flat blade razor.</li>
            <li> They seem to work ok, but I was just disappointed in receiving something that seems to be a knock-off, or old product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve nicked myself occasionally at the ankle and knee, though - go carefully in those spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about 6 years now, probably as long as they have been out.</li>
            <li> In fact, having soap on the dull side of the blade is pretty useless unless you want to wipe your leg with the soap first and then shave, which defeats the purpose of having a \\&quot;single step\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I received this item and the blades of the razors were defective (extremely dull, although looked new).  </li>
            <li> also do not like how the soap wears down on one side only.  </li>
            <li> , only half of which are as they should be.</li>
            <li> I have a lot less irritation with these than any other razor, especially when it comes to the bikini area, presumably because of the moisture/shaving cream bar.</li>
            <li> These blades are rough and cut your legs and underarms because the blades are not like my intuition blades i buy at wal mart and the navy exchange.  </li>
            <li> Think carefully before investing in this system.</li>
            <li> and they said that I had to contact the manufacturer because they were not responsible for the quality of the products they sell.</li>
            <li> my other razors have 4 blades, these have 3.</li>
            <li> i could only get rid of the fine hairs on my thighs with shaving cream which was so annoying</li>
            <li> and they are very harsh feeling, my legs burn after, and i nicked myself several times each time i used them.</li>
            <li> agreed something is not right with these blades.</li>
            <li> After years of cutting my legs with dollar-store razors, I finally decided to treat myself to a decent razor.</li>
            <li> a mans head cuts the cuts way down</li>
            <li> It makes shaving my legs faster and less messy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the Intuition razor for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little.</li>
            <li> I usually use the razor anyway</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and one razor lasts at least 2-3 weeks for me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be a regular customer.  </li>

            <li> I would never purchase them again because they must be irregular blades. These blades are rough and cut your legs and underarms because the blades are not like my intuition blades i buy at wal mart and the navy exchange.  DO NOT BUY THESE FROM THIS SITE BECAUSE THEY DON&#x27;T TELL YOU THEY ARE IRREGULAR OR REJECTS!</li>
            <li> The Intuition shaver is excellent, and the price for these cartridges was much better than what I found in stores. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These refill cartridges are just off... the smell is off scent and the blades don&#x27;t seem to be seated right.  I keep getting mild razor burn when I use the blades from this order.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years and have never had this type of problem with any of my other refill purchases (primarily from retail stores). If I didn&#x27;t throw away the box already I would definitely return them.</li>
            <li> After years of cutting my legs with dollar-store razors, I finally decided to treat myself to a decent razor. I picked the Intuition because I really liked the idea of having the soap and shaver in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main \\&quot;pro\\&quot; of this razor is that, in my opinion, it gives a good, close shave. I also like that it glides along the leg very smoothly. I&#x27;ve nicked myself occasionally at the ankle and knee, though - go carefully in those spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the cons. The soap wears down very quickly and unevenly. The soap completely surrounds the blades, but since I shave only in one direction (using the sharp side of the blades, as I believe most people do), the soap on that side wears down much faster that the soap on the other side. In fact, having soap on the dull side of the blade is pretty useless unless you want to wipe your leg with the soap first and then shave, which defeats the purpose of having a \\&quot;single step\\&quot; product. I&#x27;ve even had one soap bar pop off the razor completely after only a couple of uses, and there was no way to reattach it - there went one very expensive refill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, the refills are EXPENSIVE! Way overpriced, if you ask me, especially since they don&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the average refill lasts in good condition (with soap on the sharp side of the blades) for maybe 6 uses; after that, the only soap is left on the dull side of the blades, where it doesn&#x27;t do any good (what genius is responsible for that bit of designing??). I usually use the razor anyway until all the soap is gone - maybe a dozen shaves total, only half of which are as they should be. Poor value for the money there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the razor itself has some good points, the refills are too expensive for what you get. Think carefully before investing in this system.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about 6 years now, probably as long as they have been out. They may be pricey but well worth it. I used to use disposables and nicked/cut my legs almost every time. I switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little. It is so quick and easy to use, and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams. They do only last for 3-5 shaves, but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream, it&#x27;s probably not that much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree and say these last far longer than 3-5 shaves. I have mine hanging on the wall of my shower far away from where water can disintegrate them faster than necessary. I shave everyday and one razor lasts at least 2-3 weeks for me. It&#x27;s also a much faster and cleaner shave as you don&#x27;t have to fuss with other products.    Maybe I&#x27;m just more careful so they will last longer, but by far the cheapest prices are on amazon as well :)</li>
            <li> I usually use the Pomegranate Cartridges from Intuition, but the Cucumber Cartridges are also very good and soft to my skin.</li>
            <li> It me and 2 daughters and we go through them like water.  I thought a case would last but no way.  Wish I bought more at this price.</li>
            <li> great stuff and great price!! i have to write 15 words so i am writing more and more. i hope this helps your purchase :-)</li>
            <li> The soap fell off the blades after a couple of uses.  I am thinking of switching systems because of what seems like poor quality.</li>
            <li> The refills arrived today, they are in perfect shape, smell good and they are cheaper than buying them in the store.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these razors and 1 6-cartridge package costs $18 (at Wal-Mart)!!! Getting each for only $12 saved us a lot of money. I think I will be using Amazon more for products used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years.  Recently, I went to purchase it at Duane Reade (where would normally pick up my refills) and was surprised to find that they no longer carried this \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; but--only some other new types and at a ridiculously high price.  I logged onto to amazon and here it was--I was so excited.  Needless to say, I will be a regular customer.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> We use these razors in the shower.  Its so easy to shave your legs with these.  I paid 9 dollars for 3 razors in store.  Amazons price cant be beat!</li>
            <li> I received this item and the blades of the razors were defective (extremely dull, although looked new).  I have used the brand of razor blades for over a year and have never had a bad batch like this one.  I contacted the seller and they said that I had to contact the manufacturer because they were not responsible for the quality of the products they sell. Very poor customer service.  I am now left with 6 worthless razor blades and out the money I spent on them.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the Intuition razor for a few years now.  I like the built in skin conditioner.  I really hated lathering with shaving cream or gel before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not the most economical shaving system out there, but buying the refills through Amazon is definitely the cheapest way to go.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find them at my local store any more, so I had to order them on line.</li>
            <li> I received these refills very quickly.  Item was exactly as described.  This is an excellent deal and I  definitely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are pricey, even on Amazon, but they work well and when you consider that you don&#x27;t have to buy gel/cream it kinda takes the sting out.  I love them for vacation, as it cuts down on what i have to bring (no pun intended) but at home i have no room for spray cans in my shower, so this is ideal.  I have not noticed they dull any faster than say my old venus (i&#x27;m a yeti, copious body hair), nor do i have issues with the soap running out fast as i keep it out of direct line of fire from my shower nozzle when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do not like how the soap wears down on one side only.  If they made the soap insert so you could flip it over and use the other side, it&#x27;d be most awesome and more than worth the $$$! Schick, are you listening??!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use any other razors on the market without getting razor burn, but these cartridges have gotten so expensive in the stores around me! I saved almost 50% by buying these online instead. For those of you who haven&#x27;t used these before, they are great if you have sensitive skin. However, they will not give as a close a shave, in my experience, as a regular flat blade razor. Still a great product!</li>
            <li> I love Schick Intuition shavers. The moisturizers really work and they don&#x27;t leave my skin red and tingly afterwards. I also love the smell, not too perfume-y, really gives you that fresh out of the shower feeling. The packaging was fantastic as each refill comes in a separate case. Great buy!</li>
            <li> agreed something is not right with these blades. i used them twice and they are very harsh feeling, my legs burn after, and i nicked myself several times each time i used them. my other razors have 4 blades, these have 3. will not try to be cheap about razors again would rather throw them out.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! Look closely at the display picture and you will notice that these are the old cartridges that only have 3 blades. If you are looking for 4 blades, don&#x27;t buy these! They aren&#x27;t that bad and I will use the rest, but I will not buy them again.</li>
            <li> i purchased the razor on clearence after xmas and loved it only problem is refills r so expensive til i found these ones, love them! i could only get rid of the fine hairs on my thighs with shaving cream which was so annoying but this razor gets it all first try def recommend and i will be buying again</li>
            <li> My wife is a fan of this product and won&#x27;t use anything else.  The price on Amazon (with free over 25.00 shipping) makes it a no brainer to purchase and get a great rpice too!</li>
            <li> shave life sucks 3-5 uses.  GREAT for shaving a mans head cuts the cuts way down</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with another reviewer who said that something just isn&#x27;t quite right with these blades.  They don&#x27;t look right and don&#x27;t smell right.  I purchased this item based on prior reviews, stating that these were a good item.  There are many other Intuition blades from other sellers that have received less than stellar reviews, such as not being the correct product, so I decided to purchase this one.  I haven&#x27;t used the 3 blade refills since they came out with the 4 blade, so I don&#x27;t remember exactly what the 3 blade looked like, but these look like cheap blades inserted in the lather bar, rather than what I&#x27;m used to with the 4 blade.  They seem to work ok, but I was just disappointed in receiving something that seems to be a knock-off, or old product.  I will be going back to purchasing these from Sam&#x27;s Club, which sells 12 for $28...and I know that they are 4 blades and the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these blades. They are the best blades for a good clean shave with no irritation! And this price is fantastic. I will keep purchasing as I run out. :)</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product, it&#x27;s her favorite and she loves it! Highly recommended coz it&#x27;s a great deal with the price online</li>
            <li> I have used these replacements for over a year now and find them to be awesome.  They are soft and smooth on your skin and don&#x27;t nick or cut the skin.  I would recommend these to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I just Love this product. Works great! You really should try this item, as it has cucumber lotion and blades all in one.</li>
            <li> The Intuition razor has made me change my shaving ways. It makes shaving my legs faster and less messy. Plus, purchasing the refills on Amazon is usually 25-40% cheaper then purchasing at a store.</li>
            <li> Product was received in a timely basis although not as pictured - in one box - but rather in two 3-count boxes, which is no big deal since the full 6 cartridges were included. This is the only product my daughter uses and store prices can make you poor in no time - this is a great price. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love these razor heads, and it was a good deal, so thanks so much!  I love them, and I can&#x27;t find them in the store, in larger packs!</li>
            <li> These are REALLY pricy for a horrifically flimsy, cheap razor. However, I hardly get 5 minutes for a shower most days and this is the only way I can get a shave. So... kudos for the great idea. However, they barely last a few shaves and they become dull very quickly (way faster than the soap runs out) and then look out for nicks! Also, since they get dull quick you have to go back over the same place multiple times. It is a shame really, because I love the idea, but even dollar store razors are better quality. I have very sensitive skin, even so, this does not irritate it at all (except for when I get a nick). If you could combine the idea with the razor from Venus system it would be a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> These are a great price and a great find..i order them all the time from here..love these razors..best price I have found them..</li>
            <li> Like most women, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every kind of razor. I always go back to the Schick Intuition. It is great to find it for a great price on Amazon because it does seem like disposable razors can be kind of a rip off. You really don&#x27;t need shaving cream so it&#x27;s quick and easy. Each cartridge could last 2-3 times shaving my legs, if I&#x27;m keeping up with them. If I use the razor on my bikini or underarms than of course it will dull and won&#x27;t really be good for another use. I have a lot less irritation with these than any other razor, especially when it comes to the bikini area, presumably because of the moisture/shaving cream bar. A++</li>
