            <li> It&#x27;s very, very goopy and because of that can be a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> and well, I could buy jello at the store that can be broken down more than this stuff</li>
            <li> I have had a real chemical peel in the past.</li>
            <li> That aside, leave it on your face long enough to completely dry and peel off.  </li>
            <li> well can&#x27;t use it because it is jello complete jello, not sure how to use this jello</li>
            <li> Place a thin layer on your face, not too much, and it&#x27;ll dry within 20 minutes or so and the just peel.  </li>
            <li> like someone has cooked the contents in the microwave and added some other mess...</li>
            <li> Not too much mess and no fuss.  </li>
            <li> Dried up and consistency was putty.</li>
            <li> Product was dried out into rubber.</li>
            <li> Although the product is thick and sticky, so the applicator is rather useless because of this, I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> Apply a thin layer and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> but this is not the Elizabeth Arden Peel &amp; Reveal that I usually buy from Sephora...</li>
            <li> The only downside is that silly brush that comes with it...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the one I received the seller called RH Downes (thefuzzylobster) must have sat around for ages, because it was very dried out.  </li>
            <li> Poor smell and quality</li>
            <li> , it basically rubber in a bottle, worst purchase I have very bought.</li>
            <li> Stuff was like silly putty</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> Unable to use.</li>
            <li> Awful;; if I could give it no stars I would.</li>

            <li> Awful;; if I could give it no stars I would. Do not purchase this. You are just throwing your money away. Stuff was like silly putty</li>
            <li> Used once.  Didn&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  Perhaps I will with regular use.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and it is a fantastic but this is not the Elizabeth Arden Peel &amp; Reveal that I usually buy from Sephora...like someone has cooked the contents in the microwave and added some other mess...my face is burning and I should really sue this company!    Best to buy beauty products from legitimate stores like Sephora and make sure you buy one that is fresh off the shelf!</li>
            <li> I have had a real chemical peel in the past. This is not as aggressive, but using twice a week my skin feels great  like after having the real chemical peel. I have sensitive skin and this did not break me out.   It removes the dead skin cells and makes your skin shiny and smooth. My skin glows for days after using.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I actually thought this was a different kind of peel product but I do like it.  It&#x27;s very, very goopy and because of that can be a bit messy.  That aside, leave it on your face long enough to completely dry and peel off.  Not too much mess and no fuss.  Place a thin layer on your face, not too much, and it&#x27;ll dry within 20 minutes or so and the just peel.  It leaves your skin soft and very cleansed.  I&#x27;m using this about once a week.</li>
            <li> My wife use this one for 2 years ,before I buy it at some shop in downtown ,here have the good price .I like it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week. This is a great mask, and gives similar results to a chemical peel after several uses. The only downside is that silly brush that comes with it... It sure looks cute, but it&#x27;s much easier to apply the goo with your fingers! haha</li>
            <li> Apply a thin layer and wait for it to dry. Then you will actually peel the mask off. Rinse clean and smile in the mirror. Twice a week is great. I&#x27;m 28 and have very oily skin as well as acne problems. This product is great and will always be in stock at my house!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it makes my skin look years younger every time I use it.  Unfortunately, the one I received the seller called RH Downes (thefuzzylobster) must have sat around for ages, because it was very dried out.  I can still recommend the product, just not this seller.</li>
            <li> Dried up and consistency was putty. Not usable.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, a perfect alternative to chemical peels in professional parlours . It gives the same effect without those huge expenses. No side effects. easy to use . Loving it , thanks :)</li>
            <li> Fake. Poor smell and quality</li>
            <li> Have used over 20 years</li>
            <li> Product was dried out into rubber. Unable to use.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  This is my second jar of this terrific peel.  It really leaves your skin in a much better condition than&lt;br /&gt;before using it!  I love it!</li>
            <li> A mild peel that brings results.</li>
            <li> I did not like, and I couldn&#x27;t use it so I had to through it away. But The seller offer a coupon.  So I don&#x27;t feel like I lost my money:)</li>
            <li> Expired , not spreadable</li>
            <li> I am of middle-age with healthy skin.  I use this product 1-2 times each week and it keeps my complexion clean and smooth, free of blackheads.  I would recommend an exfoliating cleanser also as this product won&#x27;t do much for that purpose.  Although the product is thick and sticky, so the applicator is rather useless because of this, I recommend it highly.  Of the facial peels I&#x27;ve used this product is my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I bought this product it came in, was happy to try and use it... well can&#x27;t use it because it is jello complete jello, not sure how to use this jello thing.because the bush can&#x27;t even grab any of it, to test out how much of a jello this thing is I just a spoon and well, I could buy jello at the store that can be broken down more than this stuff, it basically rubber in a bottle, worst purchase I have very bought.</li>
            <li> Did not like and would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I like using this peel and feel results of softer, tighter skin.  It is gentle, yet effective.  Would recommed it.</li>
