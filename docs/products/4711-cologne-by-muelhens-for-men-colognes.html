            <li>He really liked the gift.</li>
            <li>I use it in warm weather - spring through fall.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it&#x27;s one-dimensional and short-lived.</li>
            <li>Hermes also makes a really nice green-orange-zest fragrance, Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte.</li>

            <li>I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity.</li>
            <li>I find it suitable for refilling a 300ml bottle with a syringe without a needle.</li>
            <li>so be sure you&#x27;re having it delivered somewhere that can receive it and that you or your recipient really wants this awesome huge bottle!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great after shaving on hot summer days and a nice change-of-pace throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing, clean scent.</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t mind it, unlike most of his cologne).</li>
            <li>I used it mostly in the eve  </li>
            <li>I am well pleased with the product</li>
            <li>Been using it for 40 plus years and still love the smell as after-shave..</li>
            <li>that is if you love it.  </li>
            <li>I love 4711 and have splashed it on myself most of my life</li>
            <li>Read the story of this famous cologne...  </li>
            <li>but I probably will not order it again as I found Ultimo better serves my needs.</li>
            <li>What I mostly smell is alcohol and nothing otherwise.</li>
            <li>I love 4711.  </li>
            <li>I have been enjoying this cologne for years and bought this as a gift for my son who likes to use my bottle when he visits us.</li>
            <li>I have been a user of 4711 for many years.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic Value!</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Love the size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon has the best price on the Net that also includes shipping&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>aways search the net to see who has the best price and no one beats Amazone.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>most people men or woman like.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing after a shave and the fragrance does not linger.</li>
            <li>The best scent in the entire world.</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing scent and am happy that you delivered it so fast.</li>
            <li>I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne over 50 years and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am glad I can still get it in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Certainly a better price than Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li>My husband love 4711, he&#x27;s trying for years;the fragrance keep for hours</li>
            <li>If you love 4711, buy this.</li>
            <li>My wife love this stuff after a bath.</li>
            <li>Great quality and fast service.  </li>
            <li>I like it as it feels refreshing without being intrusive.</li>
            <li>I love to put it on my son after his bath.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>My really favorite smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>4711 is a totally classic cologne and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>The price was very good but the cologne scent is barely there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for every day splash, when you don&#x27;t necessarily want to smell alluring, just good and clean.</li>
            <li>I have used 4711 cologne for over 40 years and love it as it has a refreshing and light aroma.</li>
            <li>More importantly, my wife can tolerate me with this on as it&#x27;s milder than most.</li>
            <li>Nothing very special doing here.</li>
            <li>Been using 4711 for many years and love the unique aroma.</li>
            <li>So I was able to fill that up from the huge bottle.  </li>
            <li>another favorite fragrance &#x3D; light citrus</li>
            <li>You get a lot for the price and free shipping makes it even better.</li>
            <li>It is a very light and unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>The orange blossom scent is very pleasant without being intrusive, and it lasts very long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but just not quite up to the original</li>
            <li>The scent is light but noticeable - I get a lot compliments on how good I smell, even from strangers - and is an unusual combination of citrus and wood and something else I can&#x27;t quite define.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend  this cologne for anyone who likes to smell good</li>
            <li>4711 has a nice, clean, soapy fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviewers here have commented that the fragance fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Good price and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>When we got it it was huge, of course you can imagine my brother&#x27;s face when he saw it.</li>
            <li>Did I mention HUGE bottle???</li>
            <li>It comes in a huge 27 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a huge container of 4711.</li>
            <li>And, I get the pleasure of wearing something my great grandmother wore back in the 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>We love the fresh, citrusy sent, and the fact that it works well for both men and women.</li>
            <li>I have used 4711 Cologne for many, many years, and have always loved  its Fresh Citris Scent, especially splashing it on after a shower...</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean, light scent with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>A classic cologne that every gentleman should own.</li>
            <li>Citrusy, refreshing and a quick fix on hot Summer days!</li>
            <li>My husband has worn this cologne for more than the almost 36 years we&#x27;ve been married.  </li>
            <li>It was made to resemble the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as an aftershave, maybe an after-shower splash or, as I use it, just a quick refresh when you&#x27;re around the house.</li>
            <li>It has a unique smell that reminds me of the shore in summer.</li>
            <li>would describe it as the original unisex cologne, from before the days of CK1.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve run the course from Old Spice to latest offerings available (too many to mention) and I&#x27;ve always returned to this product.</li>
            <li>Great cologne i have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to spray on my hands when I&#x27;m not near soap and water.</li>
            <li>the smell is so clean</li>
            <li>The large  27 ounces bottle allowes for many refils.  </li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, citrusy and the 27 Oz bottle is a huge value.</li>
            <li>Very good scent for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this available!</li>
            <li>cool container.</li>
            <li>A true unisex cologne.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet for men nor too musky for women.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a loud fragrance which is nice</li>
            <li>What was good enough for Napoleon and Goethe is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Cool, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Not as good as used to be years ago, does no last long, still good fragrance.</li>
            <li>For such a large bottle, the price was great, and the package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the clean fresh smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Always fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was as promised.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I didn&#x27;t really have a clear idea what I was expecting, but I have been searching for a lemony fragrance for the summer.  </li>
            <li>( tremendous cost saving. )</li>
            <li>It has a very refreshing clean lemony scent to it, not masculine at all.</li>
            <li>gives body a fresh but yet mild smell.  </li>
            <li>Lovely old world - crisp, clean and cool.  </li>
            <li>This was introduced to me back in the 70&#x27;s and has been one of my favorite scents of all time!</li>
            <li>This is the first purchase of the 27 ounce size, so it was bigger in my hand than my stand-by 13.5 ounce size, but I quickly got used to it and love that scent!</li>
            <li>Nice to put on, evaporates, and then is only smelled if 1)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles with success from here.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with some Bath and Body works cologne in a perfume bottle, and now it smells rather nice from being blended.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice but short lived fragrance</li>
            <li>as it was a gift I suppose it was good because I wan never told the contrary, any way this english lotion has allways been good.</li>
            <li>An old favorite that I returned to after Roget and Gallet retired the scent that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Smells like a fresh soap.</li>
            <li>Like so many old time users, I must agree, this is not the formula used in the &#x27;60s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rare frangrance that even people who don&#x27;g like cologne think just smells fresh like fresh scrubbed from a shower.</li>
            <li>This particular item is a huge portion in the traditional bottle and looks amazing on the counter enticing use as an après shower splash on.  </li>
            <li>Price was right, product arrived before promised date.</li>
            <li>Very large size for the price and always arrives on time in one piece.</li>
            <li>thanks to the one who told me you had it....and thanks to you for making it so easy to get..</li>
            <li>It was always a little citrusy, but after it goes on it was pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The price charged was exceptional compared to other sources.</li>
            <li>The original eau de cologne retains that classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many I&#x27;m missing</li>
            <li>Pouring half a bottle over my head might make it stick around for a full hour, but I question the practicality of that kind of application...</li>
            <li>I very much regret having bought three bottles of this.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It smells very natural, and very fresh.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy it to my husband and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It is a refreshing scent especially in Florida&#x27;s hot summers.</li>
            <li>Like a slice of lemon in a tall glass of water, this is a refreshing splash following a shower and shave.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product many times before from different sources.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have used 4711 for years, more than ten in fact, and the product I received by clicking on this product link was NOT 4711.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>First time I bought it (Amazon)</li>
            <li>A real classic.  </li>
            <li>A real classic.</li>
            <li>It is a bracing way to finish your shave with most of the scent only for</li>
            <li>4711, the original eau de cologne, has won more prices than any other eau in history.</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle 50 years ago as a gift....</li>
            <li>THis is a good all round body splash</li>
            <li>It smells clean, somewhat citrusy, very old world.  </li>
            <li>Clearly this is not an original product.</li>
            <li>scent is clean, refreshing, and not very strong.</li>
            <li>good enough for the men of the past, good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Many other manufacturers of classic men&#x27;s colognes have either gone out of business or sold out to others who don&#x27;t maintain the original quality and scents.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got same size same brand same battle at Loehmans for 14.55$ and it is very good price</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase 4711 after reading some positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as described, thanks!</li>
            <li>after a hot shower apply Cologne and you are ready and</li>
            <li>4711 since I was a teenager some fifty years ago and have always enjoyed its refreshing, subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I want on my face after shaving that gives my day a feeling of being fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>is top quality in classic blue and gold bottle.</li>
            <li>but I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with it for its high quality and nostalgic value.</li>
            <li>Since I have never ordered online before this was a totally new and exciting exercise..........</li>
            <li>and we cannot find it easily anywhere else locally.</li>
            <li>It is not at all as strong as American colognes, and has hints of citrus, lemon.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle.</li>
            <li>My cologne collection has grown embarrassingly large.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle lasts me 6-8 months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it up and enjoy it forthe limited periods in which it can be enjoyed, but have found that no quantity makes it last.</li>
            <li>this is a huge bottle and should last me for years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The title says it&#x27;s for men, but I am a woman and really like it.</li>
            <li>someone is very close to you, or 2) if you sweat.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It was a gift to my brother so when we ordered we didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size as much as the price.  </li>
            <li>I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>the scent comes to life again and  it will earn you very favorable comments.</li>
            <li>We have never quite figured out if this is for women or men, however my husbands uncle thought it very</li>
            <li>advice to anyone thinking of buying this product, which is the bulk size, to save money on something you enjoy would be to find a retail store where you can smell the genuine article and be prepared to send this version back if you are shipped the same version of the product that I received.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfactory transaction.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t stand up as a legitimate fragrance.</li>
            <li>size to ship within a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li>and then I test others just to see what&#x27;s out there, but no one even comes close to 4711&#x27;s fresh and natural scent . . .</li>
            <li>This bottle of German 4711 came well packaged which is important because of the glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother</li>
            <li>THE ITEMS CAME FAST.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this cologne for a friend who absolutely believes in it.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very well packed and in record</li>
            <li>Vintage and really modern too..</li>
            <li>Very unisex frangrance too, for men, women AND children</li>
            <li>of course the cost is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Also, it reminds me of my late, beloved Oma.</li>
            <li>I did not check how big that many ounces would be, and I was definitely surprised.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, 4711 is the most subtly fragranced  aftershave available.  </li>
            <li>It smells a lot better than other things I work on when I have a day of chores, like grime from under the car&#x27;s engine, or changing diapers -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for any man who wants something unique and different.</li>
            <li>For a more complex, bold orange blended with cedar, see Terre de Hermes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a current customer of the same product for many years, so I know very well</li>
            <li>My wife and I first found it in Europe nearly 60 years ago and are never without it.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle, old school German cologne, lemony scent.</li>
            <li>He used to be able to purchase it at local department stores but has recently been having issues finding it.  </li>
            <li>Classic scent.  </li>
            <li>and I love it, but this last bottle had almost no aroma left... since you can not return flammables through the mail I got stuck with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic and goes well with my skin chemistry.  </li>
            <li>It brings back many memories of various visits to Germany.</li>
            <li>My father introduced this to me a long time ago (he&#x27;s worn it for decades) and when it came time for me to start acting like an adult, I purchased my own bottle.  </li>
            <li>The scent should be deep and rich like neroli with a hint of citrus and what I received, while it might be enjoyable to many, was sharp like gardenia and other white flowers.  </li>
            <li>I wore this all through high school and college too..</li>
            <li>A little on the musky side so would probably recommend more for boys</li>
            <li>It is good for our tropical climate, where a little cologne can go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a dry and extremely clean smell</li>
            <li>An old product used by John F. Kennedy and myself for years after shaving every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly for all men!</li>
            <li>It is fresh, refined, with essential oils of lemon, orange, bergamot, lavender and neroli - and to my highly sensitive nose, they are \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; and not synthetic counterfacts.</li>
            <li>I noticed the ingredients are not the same either, but after it goes on it is much similar to the old scent, which was better.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the time when I used to live in München, Germany.</li>
            <li>Forget trendy products that will be forgotten in a few years and will only make you nauseous, this one has lasted 220 years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this legend cologne Its been around since I was very young</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last all day but that lets you put it on as often as you want during a hot day.  </li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s a pretty standard orange peel zest.</li>
            <li>Light classic fragrance that can be worn by either sex year round.  </li>
            <li>I like clean scents that don&#x27;t choke other people.  </li>
            <li>Plus, since it is such an old formula, I am guessing it contains no nasty chemicals like other perfumes</li>
            <li>I put it into a small spray bottle and use it to cool off when I am having a hot flash.  </li>
            <li>4711 eau de cologne- Or if it is it has been diluted.&lt;br /&gt;Still usable, but it requires more to get to the same scent level and scent does not last as long.</li>
            <li>You will feel clean and refreshed after splashing this cologne on but you will have to re-apply the cologne throughout the day because the fragrance does not last very long.</li>
            <li>It is nice to get much product for the price, but it can be difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li>Been using the Cologne since the early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>I have been using 4711 Cologne since my teens (I am now 80 years old).</li>
            <li>I also like to display the bottle on my counter, since I like the old look of it.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t smell of perfume the whole day, but I find that if you are involved in physical activity (including one involving ladies)</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; sort of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Ferrari, Franck Olivier, Succes de Paris, Kenzo and Issey Miyake just like I do for Montale, Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier, Creed and L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know this is a old cologne</li>
            <li>I have had compliments from all ages from my daughter whos 7, thru my teenaged niece, to my 70 year old mom.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I wanted and it didn&#x27;t take long to receive it...........</li>
            <li>It is priced MUCH lower than ther sellers of the smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li>a surprising number  failed me.</li>
            <li>For a more mellow and sublime, but more expensive accord, look for fragrances that feature neroli instead of mandarin / other orange fragrances.</li>
            <li>This is indeed 4711, not some cheap knock off or some strange scent brewed up in someone&#x27;s dingy garage and falsely marketed as genuine.</li>
            <li>Though this cologne is not strong and long lasting, it&#x27;s light airy scent becomes familiar and personal.  </li>
            <li>I like its fresh, long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Decent enough I suppose.</li>
            <li>The only one that is not \\&quot;headache in a bottle\\&quot; is classic 4711.</li>
            <li>The price is right  comparing to  any other quality Colognes.  </li>
            <li>The size of the bottle was BIG, but the price per ounce was so much lower, and can refill smaller one from that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a major bargain...</li>
            <li>The issue with this bottle size is that it would be for drenching oneself in cologne and isn&#x27;t the right size for splashing on, which I typically do with a handkerchief.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what a few other reviewers are complaining about.</li>
            <li>Apparently, some here do.  </li>
            <li>Identical to product normally found only in much smaller sizes.</li>
            <li>I should mention that the price is very affordable compares to other eau de colognes on the market.</li>
            <li>My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27; - approaching 500, though I haven&#x27;t counted in some time.</li>
            <li>The reason is that the opening is very large compared to the 300ml/10oz bottle which is a small hole.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn only 4711 since I was 15 years old and am aware of its limitations: the aroma does not linger, it&#x27;s extremely subtle and after 10 minutes, the only person smelling it will be you.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great after shaving on hot summer days and a nice change-of-pace throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> Very refreshing, clean scent.</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t mind it, unlike most of his cologne).</li>
            <li> I used it mostly in the eve  </li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Been using it for 40 plus years and still love the smell as after-shave..</li>

            <li> I love 4711 and have splashed it on myself most of my life</li>
            <li> Read the story of this famous cologne...  </li>
            <li> but I probably will not order it again as I found Ultimo better serves my needs.</li>
            <li> What I mostly smell is alcohol and nothing otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love 4711.  </li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this cologne for years and bought this as a gift for my son who likes to use my bottle when he visits us.</li>

            <li> It is refreshing after a shave and the fragrance does not linger.</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> 4711 is a totally classic cologne and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> The price was very good but the cologne scent is barely there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for every day splash, when you don&#x27;t necessarily want to smell alluring, just good and clean.</li>
            <li> I have used 4711 cologne for over 40 years and love it as it has a refreshing and light aroma.</li>
            <li> More importantly, my wife can tolerate me with this on as it&#x27;s milder than most.</li>
            <li> Nothing very special doing here.</li>
            <li> Been using 4711 for many years and love the unique aroma.</li>
            <li> So I was able to fill that up from the huge bottle.  </li>
            <li> another favorite fragrance &#x3D; light citrus</li>
            <li> You get a lot for the price and free shipping makes it even better.</li>
            <li> It is a very light and unique fragrance.</li>
            <li> The orange blossom scent is very pleasant without being intrusive, and it lasts very long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but just not quite up to the original</li>
            <li> The scent is light but noticeable - I get a lot compliments on how good I smell, even from strangers - and is an unusual combination of citrus and wood and something else I can&#x27;t quite define.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend  this cologne for anyone who likes to smell good</li>
            <li> 4711 has a nice, clean, soapy fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviewers here have commented that the fragance fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Good price and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> When we got it it was huge, of course you can imagine my brother&#x27;s face when he saw it.</li>
            <li> Did I mention HUGE bottle???</li>
            <li> It comes in a huge 27 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a huge container of 4711.</li>
            <li> And, I get the pleasure of wearing something my great grandmother wore back in the 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> We love the fresh, citrusy sent, and the fact that it works well for both men and women.</li>
            <li> I have used 4711 Cologne for many, many years, and have always loved  its Fresh Citris Scent, especially splashing it on after a shower...</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> Very fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean, light scent with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> A classic cologne that every gentleman should own.</li>
            <li> Citrusy, refreshing and a quick fix on hot Summer days!</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this cologne for more than the almost 36 years we&#x27;ve been married.  </li>
            <li> It was made to resemble the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine as an aftershave, maybe an after-shower splash or, as I use it, just a quick refresh when you&#x27;re around the house.</li>
            <li> It has a unique smell that reminds me of the shore in summer.</li>
            <li> would describe it as the original unisex cologne, from before the days of CK1.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve run the course from Old Spice to latest offerings available (too many to mention) and I&#x27;ve always returned to this product.</li>
            <li> Great cologne i have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to spray on my hands when I&#x27;m not near soap and water.</li>
            <li> the smell is so clean</li>
            <li> The large  27 ounces bottle allowes for many refils.  </li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, citrusy and the 27 Oz bottle is a huge value.</li>
            <li> Very good scent for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this available!</li>
            <li> cool container.</li>
            <li> A true unisex cologne.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet for men nor too musky for women.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a loud fragrance which is nice</li>
            <li> What was good enough for Napoleon and Goethe is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Cool, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Not as good as used to be years ago, does no last long, still good fragrance.</li>
            <li> For such a large bottle, the price was great, and the package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the clean fresh smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Always fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was as promised.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I didn&#x27;t really have a clear idea what I was expecting, but I have been searching for a lemony fragrance for the summer.  </li>
            <li> ( tremendous cost saving. )</li>
            <li> It has a very refreshing clean lemony scent to it, not masculine at all.</li>
            <li> gives body a fresh but yet mild smell.  </li>
            <li> Lovely old world - crisp, clean and cool.  </li>
            <li> This was introduced to me back in the 70&#x27;s and has been one of my favorite scents of all time!</li>
            <li> This is the first purchase of the 27 ounce size, so it was bigger in my hand than my stand-by 13.5 ounce size, but I quickly got used to it and love that scent!</li>
            <li> Nice to put on, evaporates, and then is only smelled if 1)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles with success from here.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with some Bath and Body works cologne in a perfume bottle, and now it smells rather nice from being blended.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice but short lived fragrance</li>
            <li> as it was a gift I suppose it was good because I wan never told the contrary, any way this english lotion has allways been good.</li>
            <li> An old favorite that I returned to after Roget and Gallet retired the scent that I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a fresh soap.</li>
            <li> Like so many old time users, I must agree, this is not the formula used in the &#x27;60s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rare frangrance that even people who don&#x27;g like cologne think just smells fresh like fresh scrubbed from a shower.</li>
            <li> This particular item is a huge portion in the traditional bottle and looks amazing on the counter enticing use as an après shower splash on.  </li>
            <li> Price was right, product arrived before promised date.</li>
            <li> Very large size for the price and always arrives on time in one piece.</li>
            <li> thanks to the one who told me you had it....and thanks to you for making it so easy to get..</li>
            <li> It was always a little citrusy, but after it goes on it was pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The price charged was exceptional compared to other sources.</li>
            <li> The original eau de cologne retains that classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many I&#x27;m missing</li>
            <li> Pouring half a bottle over my head might make it stick around for a full hour, but I question the practicality of that kind of application...</li>
            <li> I very much regret having bought three bottles of this.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It smells very natural, and very fresh.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy it to my husband and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It is a refreshing scent especially in Florida&#x27;s hot summers.</li>
            <li> Like a slice of lemon in a tall glass of water, this is a refreshing splash following a shower and shave.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this product many times before from different sources.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have used 4711 for years, more than ten in fact, and the product I received by clicking on this product link was NOT 4711.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First time I bought it (Amazon)</li>
            <li> A real classic.  </li>
            <li> A real classic.</li>
            <li> It is a bracing way to finish your shave with most of the scent only for</li>
            <li> 4711, the original eau de cologne, has won more prices than any other eau in history.</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle 50 years ago as a gift....</li>
            <li> THis is a good all round body splash</li>
            <li> It smells clean, somewhat citrusy, very old world.  </li>
            <li> Clearly this is not an original product.</li>
            <li> scent is clean, refreshing, and not very strong.</li>
            <li> good enough for the men of the past, good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Many other manufacturers of classic men&#x27;s colognes have either gone out of business or sold out to others who don&#x27;t maintain the original quality and scents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got same size same brand same battle at Loehmans for 14.55$ and it is very good price</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase 4711 after reading some positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> after a hot shower apply Cologne and you are ready and</li>
            <li> 4711 since I was a teenager some fifty years ago and have always enjoyed its refreshing, subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I want on my face after shaving that gives my day a feeling of being fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> is top quality in classic blue and gold bottle.</li>
            <li> but I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with it for its high quality and nostalgic value.</li>
            <li> Since I have never ordered online before this was a totally new and exciting exercise..........</li>
            <li> and we cannot find it easily anywhere else locally.</li>
            <li> It is not at all as strong as American colognes, and has hints of citrus, lemon.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle.</li>
            <li> My cologne collection has grown embarrassingly large.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle lasts me 6-8 months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it up and enjoy it forthe limited periods in which it can be enjoyed, but have found that no quantity makes it last.</li>
            <li> this is a huge bottle and should last me for years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The title says it&#x27;s for men, but I am a woman and really like it.</li>
            <li> someone is very close to you, or 2) if you sweat.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my brother so when we ordered we didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size as much as the price.  </li>
            <li> I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> the scent comes to life again and  it will earn you very favorable comments.</li>
            <li> We have never quite figured out if this is for women or men, however my husbands uncle thought it very</li>
            <li> advice to anyone thinking of buying this product, which is the bulk size, to save money on something you enjoy would be to find a retail store where you can smell the genuine article and be prepared to send this version back if you are shipped the same version of the product that I received.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfactory transaction.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t stand up as a legitimate fragrance.</li>
            <li> size to ship within a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> and then I test others just to see what&#x27;s out there, but no one even comes close to 4711&#x27;s fresh and natural scent . . .</li>
            <li> This bottle of German 4711 came well packaged which is important because of the glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother</li>
            <li> THE ITEMS CAME FAST.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for a friend who absolutely believes in it.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very well packed and in record</li>
            <li> Vintage and really modern too..</li>
            <li> Very unisex frangrance too, for men, women AND children</li>
            <li> of course the cost is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Also, it reminds me of my late, beloved Oma.</li>
            <li> I did not check how big that many ounces would be, and I was definitely surprised.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, 4711 is the most subtly fragranced  aftershave available.  </li>
            <li> It smells a lot better than other things I work on when I have a day of chores, like grime from under the car&#x27;s engine, or changing diapers -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for any man who wants something unique and different.</li>
            <li> For a more complex, bold orange blended with cedar, see Terre de Hermes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a current customer of the same product for many years, so I know very well</li>
            <li> My wife and I first found it in Europe nearly 60 years ago and are never without it.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle, old school German cologne, lemony scent.</li>
            <li> He used to be able to purchase it at local department stores but has recently been having issues finding it.  </li>
            <li> Classic scent.  </li>
            <li> and I love it, but this last bottle had almost no aroma left... since you can not return flammables through the mail I got stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic and goes well with my skin chemistry.  </li>
            <li> It brings back many memories of various visits to Germany.</li>
            <li> My father introduced this to me a long time ago (he&#x27;s worn it for decades) and when it came time for me to start acting like an adult, I purchased my own bottle.  </li>
            <li> The scent should be deep and rich like neroli with a hint of citrus and what I received, while it might be enjoyable to many, was sharp like gardenia and other white flowers.  </li>
            <li> I wore this all through high school and college too..</li>
            <li> A little on the musky side so would probably recommend more for boys</li>
            <li> It is good for our tropical climate, where a little cologne can go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a dry and extremely clean smell</li>
            <li> An old product used by John F. Kennedy and myself for years after shaving every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly for all men!</li>
            <li> It is fresh, refined, with essential oils of lemon, orange, bergamot, lavender and neroli - and to my highly sensitive nose, they are \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; and not synthetic counterfacts.</li>
            <li> I noticed the ingredients are not the same either, but after it goes on it is much similar to the old scent, which was better.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of the time when I used to live in München, Germany.</li>
            <li> Forget trendy products that will be forgotten in a few years and will only make you nauseous, this one has lasted 220 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this legend cologne Its been around since I was very young</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day but that lets you put it on as often as you want during a hot day.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a pretty standard orange peel zest.</li>
            <li> Light classic fragrance that can be worn by either sex year round.  </li>
            <li> I like clean scents that don&#x27;t choke other people.  </li>
            <li> Plus, since it is such an old formula, I am guessing it contains no nasty chemicals like other perfumes</li>
            <li> I put it into a small spray bottle and use it to cool off when I am having a hot flash.  </li>
            <li> 4711 eau de cologne- Or if it is it has been diluted.&lt;br /&gt;Still usable, but it requires more to get to the same scent level and scent does not last as long.</li>
            <li> You will feel clean and refreshed after splashing this cologne on but you will have to re-apply the cologne throughout the day because the fragrance does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It is nice to get much product for the price, but it can be difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Been using the Cologne since the early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> I have been using 4711 Cologne since my teens (I am now 80 years old).</li>
            <li> I also like to display the bottle on my counter, since I like the old look of it.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t smell of perfume the whole day, but I find that if you are involved in physical activity (including one involving ladies)</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; sort of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Ferrari, Franck Olivier, Succes de Paris, Kenzo and Issey Miyake just like I do for Montale, Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier, Creed and L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know this is a old cologne</li>
            <li> I have had compliments from all ages from my daughter whos 7, thru my teenaged niece, to my 70 year old mom.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I wanted and it didn&#x27;t take long to receive it...........</li>
            <li> It is priced MUCH lower than ther sellers of the smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li> a surprising number  failed me.</li>
            <li> For a more mellow and sublime, but more expensive accord, look for fragrances that feature neroli instead of mandarin / other orange fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is indeed 4711, not some cheap knock off or some strange scent brewed up in someone&#x27;s dingy garage and falsely marketed as genuine.</li>
            <li> Though this cologne is not strong and long lasting, it&#x27;s light airy scent becomes familiar and personal.  </li>
            <li> I like its fresh, long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Decent enough I suppose.</li>
            <li> The only one that is not \\&quot;headache in a bottle\\&quot; is classic 4711.</li>
            <li> The price is right  comparing to  any other quality Colognes.  </li>
            <li> The size of the bottle was BIG, but the price per ounce was so much lower, and can refill smaller one from that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a major bargain...</li>
            <li> The issue with this bottle size is that it would be for drenching oneself in cologne and isn&#x27;t the right size for splashing on, which I typically do with a handkerchief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what a few other reviewers are complaining about.</li>
            <li> Apparently, some here do.  </li>
            <li> Identical to product normally found only in much smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> I should mention that the price is very affordable compares to other eau de colognes on the market.</li>
            <li> My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27; - approaching 500, though I haven&#x27;t counted in some time.</li>
            <li> The reason is that the opening is very large compared to the 300ml/10oz bottle which is a small hole.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn only 4711 since I was 15 years old and am aware of its limitations: the aroma does not linger, it&#x27;s extremely subtle and after 10 minutes, the only person smelling it will be you.</li>
            <li> you enjoy a very subtle fragrance ...</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t usually spend much time with my citrus fragrances...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long lasting fragrance, 4711 is not for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unisex, though my German friends tell me no man would be caught dead wearing it and only old ladies wear it nowadays in Germany.</li>
            <li> If anything could be improved is that the smell does not last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last terribly long though.</li>
            <li> It has been my father&#x27;s signature cologne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this eau de cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packrat that I am, I still had my empty spray bottle of 4711 lying around.  </li>
            <li> It has that sort of slightly bitter citrus rind, not cloying-sweet.</li>

            <li> the 27oz bottle is the big bottle, despite the picture of the small bottle online.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that for any reason other than levity.</li>

            <li> Well, I couldn&#x27;t care less, it works for me.</li>
            <li> I am only sorry I waited so long.  </li>
            <li> let&#x27;s get down to business!</li>
            <li> wrote a  review few months ago still stan by it  </li>
            <li> SHE WAS BORN IN THE NETHERLANDS, AND USES THIS EVERYDAY.  </li>
            <li> You were one of the few places that had the 27oz.</li>
            <li> I grew up with my grandmother and mother using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not strong</li>
            <li> This has been my scent for the past thirty years</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m saving a small fortune.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like it anymore.</li>
            <li> Not real happy with the price though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years,  hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I like it, but will not replace it when it&#x27;s empty, and because of the extremely weak formulation and poor longevity, do not recommend it to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne splash for at least 40 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v always like the subtle citron fragrance.  </li>
            <li> the content seems not OK, and smells weird.</li>
            <li> After being addicted to Aqua Di Gio for almost a decade (I don&#x27;t remember why or how I found 4711)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a false product.  </li>
            <li> silly.  </li>
            <li> so... this unfortunately comes with \\&quot;not recommended\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a longer-lasting but also simplistic orange-citrus, see L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo 2.</li>
            <li> You wont go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that crazy about this cologne.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to over indulge on its delights</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I HATE it ...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived ahead of time. Been using the Cologne since the early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my 4711 cologne and the included history of it&#x27;s production.  The price charged was exceptional compared to other sources.</li>
            <li> A great smelling aftershave that can be used by men or women.  It smells clean, somewhat citrusy, very old world.  Use it where you would use rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> The title says it&#x27;s for men, but I am a woman and really like it. It has a very refreshing clean lemony scent to it, not masculine at all. It&#x27;s great for every day splash, when you don&#x27;t necessarily want to smell alluring, just good and clean. I should mention that the price is very affordable compares to other eau de colognes on the market. GREAT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My Dad has used this product for several years.  He used to be able to purchase it at local department stores but has recently been having issues finding it.  I purchased it for him from Amazon and he is ecstatic!  It came quickly and was as promised.  I think he was amazed by the size of the bottle!  Thanks for making this available!</li>
            <li> as great as always thru all the years we bought it</li>
            <li> Used it back in the 60&#x27;s when I was stationed in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Just as great as I remember it,  use when I get dressed&lt;br /&gt;up.  Makes you feel good!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this cologne for nearly a half century. He loves it (and I don&#x27;t mind it, unlike most of his cologne). This is a huge bottle of 4711 at an incredible price.</li>
            <li> Very good scent for everyday use. Affordable as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this legend cologne Its been around since I was very young and I&#x27;m now 68 years  The fragrance is exceptional  well balance  gives body a fresh but yet mild smell.  I used it mostly in the eve  and when I goes places people always what to know what cologne I&#x27;m wearing..  I will highly recommend  this cologne for anyone who likes to smell good</li>
            <li> Nice to put on, evaporates, and then is only smelled if 1) someone is very close to you, or 2) if you sweat. Perfect.  And, I get the pleasure of wearing something my great grandmother wore back in the 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was an exceptional buy from this seller. I am well pleased with the product and it&#x27;s volume, plus the money saved on this purchase. Thank you all .</li>
            <li> I have been using 4711 for 40 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, finally orered from Amazon. Price was right, product arrived before promised date. I am happy.</li>
            <li> I have used 4711 cologne for over 40 years and love it as it has a refreshing and light aroma.</li>
            <li> My father used this cologne when I was in Europe, and I was amazed to find it here in the U.S. I decided to buy it to my husband and he absolutely loves it! The orange blossom scent is very pleasant without being intrusive, and it lasts very long.  This product is timeless without being old-fashioned.</li>
            <li> Not as good as used to be years ago, does no last long, still good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Good price and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> holy cow. I like the history of this brand, that is why i purchased it. I wanted to smell it... good enough for the men of the past, good enough for me. its a good scent. The shipping was fast. however i did not think that the big one... was THAT BIG. wow... good price though. cool container.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described, thanks!</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my brother so when we ordered we didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size as much as the price.  When we got it it was huge, of course you can imagine my brother&#x27;s face when he saw it.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase 4711 after reading some positive reviews. Since this cologne came out in 1792, my guess is that Thomas Jefferson may have worn this cologne at one point. 4711 has a nice, clean, soapy fresh smell. It is definitely not overpowering. 4711 is probably best used as an after shave type fragrance in the spring or the summer. The 27 ounce bottle it comes in looks like a liquor bottle. You will feel clean and refreshed after splashing this cologne on but you will have to re-apply the cologne throughout the day because the fragrance does not last very long. It is a very light and unique fragrance. If you are looking for a long lasting fragrance, 4711 is not for you. The only reason 4711 gets 3 out of 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v always like the subtle citron fragrance.  I think I just bought a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Muelhens No. 4711 since I was a teenager some fifty years ago and have always enjoyed its refreshing, subtle fragrance.  It&#x27;s great after shaving on hot summer days and a nice change-of-pace throughout the year.  Many other manufacturers of classic men&#x27;s colognes have either gone out of business or sold out to others who don&#x27;t maintain the original quality and scents.  That hasn&#x27;t happened with No. 4711 and I pray that it never does!  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> the 27oz bottle is the big bottle, despite the picture of the small bottle online.  I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles with success from here.</li>
            <li> The issue with this bottle size is that it would be for drenching oneself in cologne and isn&#x27;t the right size for splashing on, which I typically do with a handkerchief. The reason is that the opening is very large compared to the 300ml/10oz bottle which is a small hole. I find it suitable for refilling a 300ml bottle with a syringe without a needle.</li>
            <li> The best deal in the world!</li>
            <li> the content seems not OK, and smells weird. I was very disapointed. I&#x27;m a current customer of the same product for many years, so I know very well that&#x27;s a false product.  [[ASIN:B001CT09LS 4711 By Muelhens For Men. Eau De Cologne Splash 27 Oz.]]</li>
            <li> Best bargain ! This has been my scent for the past thirty years and so happy I found it !</li>
            <li> Been using it for 40 plus years and still love the smell as after-shave..So does the wife</li>
            <li> Classic scent.  Just smelling it puts me in a good mood. Love it! Wish scent would stick around longer.</li>
            <li> excellent price for the full size bottle, really nice scent for warm days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years,  hard to find in retail stores. I found the e-mail address&lt;br /&gt;on the box . Great ,product, many ladies love the scent, as do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LTN</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this cologne for more than the almost 36 years we&#x27;ve been married.  It was always a little citrusy, but after it goes on it was pleasant.  Now the scent is so overpowering when it goes on it almost chokes me.  I noticed the ingredients are not the same either, but after it goes on it is much similar to the old scent, which was better.  You don&#x27;t smell it unless you&#x27;re close to that person, and it isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> excelent product for a good price...</li>
            <li> To be fair, I didn&#x27;t really have a clear idea what I was expecting, but I have been searching for a lemony fragrance for the summer.  This pulled up in a search and I was intrigued enough to try it.  I know....silly.  I can say this, oz per oz it&#x27;s a major bargain...that is if you love it.  Apparently, some here do.  I won&#x27;t say I HATE it ...I&#x27;m just ... eh.  I mixed it with some Bath and Body works cologne in a perfume bottle, and now it smells rather nice from being blended.  Maybe the fragrance on it&#x27;s own will eventually grow on me.      Did I mention HUGE bottle???</li>
            <li> Purchasing this fine product on line results in great savings. Quality is excellent! The product always is shipped promptly in it&#x27;s origional packaging.</li>
            <li> the smell is so clean</li>
            <li> I have been using 4711 Cologne since my teens (I am now 80 years old). I missed it when I came to the States but when I found it on the internet as very good prices I was elated. Nothing compares to it in the fragrance world. It is a refreshing scent especially in Florida&#x27;s hot summers.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this cologne. It reminds me of the time when I used to live in München, Germany. Cool, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I love 4711 and have splashed it on myself most of my life</li>
            <li> Great product!! Great price!!</li>
            <li> wrote a  review few months ago still stan by it  I want another  my aunts are here  they know it  great product since my child hoodmy golf buddies love to spritz with 4711 hooray cliff</li>
            <li> I use to get it from my father but we passed away I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I really like it</li>
            <li> This was introduced to me back in the 70&#x27;s and has been one of my favorite scents of all time! Like a slice of lemon in a tall glass of water, this is a refreshing splash following a shower and shave.  Though this cologne is not strong and long lasting, it&#x27;s light airy scent becomes familiar and personal.  These are my thoughts of 4711.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best value I have seen for 4711 is the 27 oz offered here at Amazon; a wonderful place to shop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4711 was John F.Kennedy&#x27;s favorite as well!  Read the story of this famous cologne...  [...]</li>
            <li> It has a nice but short lived fragrance but I probably will not order it again as I found Ultimo better serves my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got same size same brand same battle at Loehmans for 14.55$ and it is very good price and I dont know why is so expencive here!!!</li>
            <li> as it was a gift I suppose it was good because I wan never told the contrary, any way this english lotion has allways been good.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product many times before from different sources. Clearly this is not an original product. It was made to resemble the original. What I mostly smell is alcohol and nothing otherwise. I very much regret having bought three bottles of this.&lt;br /&gt;Will look for another supplier in the future.</li>
            <li> I get this for my German grandmother every year at Christmas.  She loves it.  THis is a good all round body splash</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!....so do I!</li>
            <li> I love 4711.  It is instant refreshment.  Plus, since it is such an old formula, I am guessing it contains no nasty chemicals like other perfumes may.  It smells very natural, and very fresh.  Also, it reminds me of my late, beloved Oma. The only caveat I have is that this bottle is so big.  I did not check how big that many ounces would be, and I was definitely surprised.  It is ginormous.  It is nice to get much product for the price, but it can be difficult to apply.  Packrat that I am, I still had my empty spray bottle of 4711 lying around.  So I was able to fill that up from the huge bottle.  But some did leak over the sides in the process.  (Maybe a funnel would help?)  I also like to display the bottle on my counter, since I like the old look of it.  But this bottle is to big to put on your counter, unless you are running a barber shop.  So, great contents but be prepared for a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviewers here have commented that the fragance fades quickly. I find that also to be the case. You won&#x27;t smell of perfume the whole day, but I find that if you are involved in physical activity (including one involving ladies) the scent comes to life again and  it will earn you very favorable comments.</li>
            <li> We have never quite figured out if this is for women or men, however my husbands uncle thought it very masculine!&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this cologne for years and bought this as a gift for my son who likes to use my bottle when he visits us. He really liked the gift. The size of the bottle was BIG, but the price per ounce was so much lower, and can refill smaller one from that.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of 4711 for many years.  a very refreshing scent  works for Men and Woman. The price is right  comparing to  any other quality Colognes.  The large  27 ounces bottle allowes for many refils.  ( tremendous cost saving. ) and last lets remember were the name Cologne came from ( City of Cologne in Germany were the 4711 is the street address of the Muellens company )</li>
            <li> Excellent to splash on liberally after shower without danger of perfumy aftereffects.  A very refreshing experience.</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; sort of fragrance.  I came upon it by accident a couple of years ago and have been using it ever since.  The scent is light but noticeable - I get a lot compliments on how good I smell, even from strangers - and is an unusual combination of citrus and wood and something else I can&#x27;t quite define.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Value! It comes in a huge 27 oz bottle. Very nicely presented I might add. The scent is a very pleasant citrus smell. I plan on purchasing more as gifts. A classic cologne that every gentleman should own.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have used 4711 for years, more than ten in fact, and the product I received by clicking on this product link was NOT 4711.  The scent should be deep and rich like neroli with a hint of citrus and what I received, while it might be enjoyable to many, was sharp like gardenia and other white flowers.  After hundreds of years of production, I seriously doubt that the company would suddenly change their formula so I can only surmise that either something went seriously wrong in transit (mishandling by overheating or the like) or that this was some knockoff cleverly inserted into the market chain.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to anyone thinking of buying this product, which is the bulk size, to save money on something you enjoy would be to find a retail store where you can smell the genuine article and be prepared to send this version back if you are shipped the same version of the product that I received.  For myself, I will not be buying this anywhere but a brick and mortar store in future and then only if they have a sample open so that I can ensure that I&#x27;m getting the 4711 that I have for years.</li>
            <li> Excelent everything acording to the order</li>
            <li> What&#x27; to say, great price and service</li>
            <li> I like the smell. Love the size. More importantly, my wife can tolerate me with this on as it&#x27;s milder than most.</li>
            <li> I first used this over 30 years ago and still the best smell and feel of and any Men&#x27;s Splash or aftershave, just makes your skin feel good and the price is more than fair for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price on the Net that also includes shipping&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged and recived in a vey short time.&lt;br /&gt;I aways search the net to see who has the best price and no one beats Amazone.&lt;br /&gt;Just feels cleaner and a great smell most people men or woman like.</li>
            <li> I love this. It is exactly what I was looking for. It is refreshing after a shave and the fragrance does not linger.</li>
            <li> My father introduced this to me a long time ago (he&#x27;s worn it for decades) and when it came time for me to start acting like an adult, I purchased my own bottle.  It&#x27;s a classic product at a very reasonable price.  I couldn&#x27;t say if this is the same version as what you get in Europe (there seem to be two schools of thought on that) but I can say that I&#x27;m very happy with it for its high quality and nostalgic value.</li>
            <li> for this price is steal. This European fragrance I saw back in Europe 50 years ago in Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungaria. Austria</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what a few other reviewers are complaining about. This is indeed 4711, not some cheap knock off or some strange scent brewed up in someone&#x27;s dingy garage and falsely marketed as genuine. The scent never varies, it&#x27;s always sheer perfection. I&#x27;ve worn only 4711 since I was 15 years old and am aware of its limitations: the aroma does not linger, it&#x27;s extremely subtle and after 10 minutes, the only person smelling it will be you. But that&#x27;s OK and is the heart and soul of 4711! It&#x27;s unisex, though my German friends tell me no man would be caught dead wearing it and only old ladies wear it nowadays in Germany. Well, I couldn&#x27;t care less, it works for me. The best scent in the entire world.</li>
            <li> I like clean scents that don&#x27;t choke other people.  This is one.  Lovely old world - crisp, clean and cool.  Doesn&#x27;t last all day but that lets you put it on as often as you want during a hot day.  I put in a spray bottle and spritz after a shower.  It says for men, but I think everyone would like this.</li>
            <li> Perfect perfume for any time or season, my grandmother has worn this perfume all her life and loves it. Also works well for men or woman. Great buy! Large bottle. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne splash for at least 40 years. It&#x27;s a great light, citrus fragrance for men and women too. I use it in warm weather - spring through fall.</li>
            <li> I first started using 4711 when I was in S.E. Asia in the late 1960&#x27;s buying my first bottle at the base PX. I like the clean fresh smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The product is of excellent quality and the seller sent the product promptly. It was delivered before the scheduled delivery date and I was very pleased with this. I would definitely recomment this product and the seller as well.</li>
            <li> this is a huge bottle and should last me for years.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is an original/genuine 4711 eau de cologne- Or if it is it has been diluted.&lt;br /&gt;Still usable, but it requires more to get to the same scent level and scent does not last as long.</li>
            <li> MY MOM LOVES THIS STUFF!  SHE WAS BORN IN THE NETHERLANDS, AND USES THIS EVERYDAY.  IT REMINDS HER OF HOME.</li>
            <li> This smells ok on my boyfriend! Nothing to rave about, but he likes it! I&#x27;m not that crazy about this cologne.</li>
            <li> A true unisex cologne. Not too sweet for men nor too musky for women. It has a clean, light scent with a hint of citrus. One sniff and you&#x27;re hooked for life. My wife and I first found it in Europe nearly 60 years ago and are never without it.</li>
            <li> Product was well packaged.  Service was very good, shipping was prompt.  Very satisfactory transaction.</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing scent and am happy that you delivered it so fast. Thank you</li>
            <li> A lifetime supply for my wife. Identical to product normally found only in much smaller sizes. A great deal and shipped quickly. A++</li>
            <li> Bottle bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> I have been using this EAU De Cologne for 30 years and I love it, but this last bottle had almost no aroma left... since you can not return flammables through the mail I got stuck with it.  I will not recommend purchasing something that you can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> My cologne collection has grown embarrassingly large. This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> A brief blurb to place my fragrance sensibilities: I&#x27;m a middle-aged professional man, father, who enjoys a nice wardrobe, including fragrances. My collection is considerable, numbering in &#x27;several hundreds&#x27; - approaching 500, though I haven&#x27;t counted in some time. I enjoy anything that is well put together, smells pleasant, and has acceptable longevity. I despise cloying fragrances, especially artificial ones, cheap, synthetic \\&quot;woods and spices\\&quot; types (astringent old-man smells), and many \\&quot;red\\&quot; fragrances for lack of a better term, based on cinnamon, cardamom, amber. Things often called \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; or \\&quot;Night\\&quot;. I love aquas, chypres, florals, fougeres, oudhs, attars, orientals. Good ones anyway. And I&#x27;m not snobby about it; some of my top-25 are designer fragrances in the &lt;$50 range. I&#x27;ve got a soft spot for Ferrari, Franck Olivier, Succes de Paris, Kenzo and Issey Miyake just like I do for Montale, Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier, Creed and L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s get down to business! I bought a BIG bottle of this because the price per volume made it prohibitive to buy anything smaller, simple as that. But the fragrance itself? Well, it&#x27;s a pretty standard orange peel zest. It has that sort of slightly bitter citrus rind, not cloying-sweet. But as a fragrance? Nothing very special doing here. Unfortunately, the sillage is pretty limited after about 5 minutes and the basenote is imperceptible after 30 even with a generous application on fabric. It really doesn&#x27;t stand up as a legitimate fragrance. It&#x27;s fine as an aftershave, maybe an after-shower splash or, as I use it, just a quick refresh when you&#x27;re around the house. It smells a lot better than other things I work on when I have a day of chores, like grime from under the car&#x27;s engine, or changing diapers - I&#x27;m not saying that for any reason other than levity. It smells nice, but it&#x27;s one-dimensional and short-lived. I think calling this \\&quot;EDC\\&quot; is probably a bit generous. I&#x27;ll use it up and enjoy it forthe limited periods in which it can be enjoyed, but have found that no quantity makes it last. Pouring half a bottle over my head might make it stick around for a full hour, but I question the practicality of that kind of application... so... this unfortunately comes with \\&quot;not recommended\\&quot;. I like it, but will not replace it when it&#x27;s empty, and because of the extremely weak formulation and poor longevity, do not recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a longer-lasting but also simplistic orange-citrus, see L&#x27;Eau Par Kenzo 2. For a more complex, bold orange blended with cedar, see Terre de Hermes. Hermes also makes a really nice green-orange-zest fragrance, Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte. For a more mellow and sublime, but more expensive accord, look for fragrances that feature neroli instead of mandarin / other orange fragrances. I&#x27;m sure there are many I&#x27;m missing but I don&#x27;t usually spend much time with my citrus fragrances...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy sniffing!</li>
            <li> great price for a wonderful cologne...really smells great!</li>
            <li> I know this is a old cologne but it is definetley wearable. It has a unique smell that reminds me of the shore in summer. You wont go wrong with this. I have had compliments from all ages from my daughter whos 7, thru my teenaged niece, to my 70 year old mom.</li>
            <li> 4711 is a totally classic cologne and this is a great price. Just know that there is a policy that you can&#x27;t return liquids to Amazon so be sure you&#x27;re having it delivered somewhere that can receive it and that you or your recipient really wants this awesome huge bottle!</li>
            <li> Very large size for the price and always arrives on time in one piece.</li>
            <li> The original eau de cologne retains that classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Just like home!  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne over 50 years and I still love it.</li>
            <li> Citrusy, refreshing and a quick fix on hot Summer days!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for years and local department stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I was happy to see that Amazon had it and was delivered right to my door!</li>
            <li> The scent of 4711 reminds me of my childhood. It has been my father&#x27;s signature cologne for as long as I can remember. I was thrilled to find the &amp;#34;economy size&amp;#34; bottle to give him as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is clean, refreshing, and not very strong. It is good for our tropical climate, where a little cologne can go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe it as the original unisex cologne, from before the days of CK1.</li>
            <li> After being addicted to Aqua Di Gio for almost a decade (I don&#x27;t remember why or how I found 4711) I love this stuff. First time I bought it (Amazon) I thought I was getting a good deal, but this is even better! And I&#x27;m saving a small fortune. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this eau de cologne for a long time. I like its fresh, long lasting scent. I am glad I can still get it in the U.S.A. And, by the way, it is not only for men!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  It&#x27;s a classic and goes well with my skin chemistry.  Over the years I&#x27;ve used many excellent brands of what can be considered after shave products.  Some of them worked well and a surprising number  failed me. They&#x27;ve run the course from Old Spice to latest offerings available (too many to mention) and I&#x27;ve always returned to this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first purchase of the 27 ounce size, so it was bigger in my hand than my stand-by 13.5 ounce size, but I quickly got used to it and love that scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4711 for at least ten years. This bottle did not smell exactly the same as the usual bought in a store. It&#x27;s OK, but just not quite up to the original</li>
            <li> I use this cologne as an after-bath splash. It has a dry and extremely clean smell and I like the way it feels on my body. If anything could be improved is that the smell does not last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> I wanted to try 4711 for years, and finally did.  I am only sorry I waited so long.  This original cologne is beautiful.  It is not at all as strong as American colognes, and has hints of citrus, lemon.  I highly recommend it for any man who wants something unique and different.</li>
            <li> I accidently ordered a larger size. Wanted to return or exchange for two smaller bottles. Was told cannot return product. Cannot return items just say alcohol and not perfume. You don&#x27;t tend to associate perfumes to alcohol. When placing order a message should atleast pop up saying this product cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> Great scent reportedly ised by President Lincoln. Habe used it all my life.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for years and never been dissppointed. Good value for money. A real classic.  A real classic.</li>
            <li> An old favorite that I returned to after Roget and Gallet retired the scent that I had been using.  4711 has proven to be a good substitute for me.</li>
            <li> You were one of the few places that had the 27oz. size to ship within a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle, old school German cologne, lemony scent. Doesn&#x27;t last terribly long though. Decent enough I suppose. Certainly a better price than Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been a part of our family for decades. We love the fresh, citrusy sent, and the fact that it works well for both men and women. For such a large bottle, the price was great, and the package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> another favorite fragrance &#x3D; light citrus</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for decades.  Don&#x27;t know why it says for men!  Very refreshing, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt. ...satified!</li>
            <li> Aromatherapy spray . Relaxing but not a scent to wear .Use for room scent. Mix with water in spray bottle.</li>
            <li> 4711 is the only cologne I wear.  Every now and then I test others just to see what&#x27;s out there, but no one even comes close to 4711&#x27;s fresh and natural scent . . .</li>
            <li> it is great but the bottle is toooooooo huge!</li>
            <li> My husband love 4711, he&#x27;s trying for years;the fragrance keep for hours</li>
            <li> Love the stuff and the size was great as was the price.  Came well packaged.</li>
            <li> This bottle of German 4711 came well packaged which is important because of the glass bottle.  It brings back many memories of various visits to Germany.</li>
            <li> Have used for 20 plus years.</li>
            <li> didnt fill my expectations</li>
            <li> Stuff my dad used to use. Not strong but I use as aftershave</li>
            <li> Probably the best.  Cologne to the Kings of France.</li>
            <li> Great cologne i have used it for a long time. Smells like a fresh soap.Not real happy with the price though.</li>
            <li> Been using 4711 for many years and love the unique aroma. I have visited the factory in Cologne,Germany and very impressive.</li>
            <li> Since I have never ordered online before this was a totally new and exciting exercise..........it was exactly what I wanted and it didn&#x27;t take long to receive it...........thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother Gabriel Monarch, O.H.</li>
            <li> Like so many old time users, I must agree, this is not the formula used in the &#x27;60s. Watered down, I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a huge container of 4711. You get a lot for the price and free shipping makes it even better. If you love 4711, buy this.</li>
            <li> Light classic fragrance that can be worn by either sex year round.  This particular item is a huge portion in the traditional bottle and looks amazing on the counter enticing use as an après shower splash on.  Very difficult to over indulge on its delights</li>
            <li> I carry 4711 with me in small atomizers to spritz on when feeling hot and sticky, or whenever I need a pick-me-up. It&#x27;s great to spray on my hands when I&#x27;m not near soap and water. For my face, I spray it on my hands and pat to set my make up. I&#x27;ve been stopped in stores or on the street as people want to know the name of the scent.</li>
            <li> THE ITEMS CAME FAST.  My wife love this stuff after a bath. Great quality and fast service.  Its all about the customer service.</li>
            <li> My dad has been using this for his aftershave for 50 years. He cuts it with witchhazle. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere on the shelf anymore so I was happy to get it online</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for a friend who absolutely believes in it.  He&#x27;s been using this fragrance for decades and simply loves it.  I was also very pleased with the timing of delivery.</li>
            <li> If you know 4711 I don&#x27;t need to explain further.  If you don&#x27;t, 4711 is the most subtly fragranced  aftershave available.  No worrues about people &amp;#34;smelling you coming&amp;#34;.  It is a bracing way to finish your shave with most of the scent only for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle lasts me 6-8 months.  It is priced MUCH lower than ther sellers of the smaller bottle.  It arrived very well packed and in record time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy a very subtle fragrance ...Go for it....You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the 27 oz bottle of 4711 for years. It&#x27;s a rare frangrance that even people who don&#x27;g like cologne think just smells fresh like fresh scrubbed from a shower. I like it as it feels refreshing without being intrusive. The big bottle means I don&#x27;t have to keep buying it all the time. The bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt and the product and packaging perfect.</li>
            <li> Very fresh smelling.  I love to put it on my son after his bath.  A little on the musky side so would probably recommend more for boys but, girls can get away with it also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. My husband loves this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t have a loud fragrance which is nice and he can wear it to work all the time. It came very quickly and that was wonderful. PS his mom uses it too.</li>
            <li> The price was very good but the cologne scent is barely there. I have purchased 4711 for my husband for 20 years and I do know what 4711 smells like and this is not it</li>
            <li> My husband loves this..I wore this all through high school and college too..awesome uni-sex fragrance..Vintage and really modern too..one of the best ever</li>
            <li> Try this as a daily refresher and you will be hooked&lt;br /&gt;I have used 4711 for more years than I care to count!</li>
            <li> 4711, the original eau de cologne, has won more prices than any other eau in history. It is the one I like best.</li>
            <li> An old product used by John F. Kennedy and myself for years after shaving every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it highly for all men!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years as an after shower splash.  Smells great and just makes you feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Not just for men either.</li>
            <li> The only thing I want on my face after shaving that gives my day a feeling of being fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I grew up with my grandmother and mother using it everyday.  It has a refreshing scent.  But the best thing about it is the cooling effect it has.  I put it into a small spray bottle and use it to cool off when I am having a hot flash.  Or even on those hot sticky days it cools you off and the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best scent in the world. Will order again and again.</li>
            <li> My husband has use 4711 for 40 years and I knew this was a great gift for him, Thank You for having it</li>
            <li> Great scent, have used 4711 for over thirty years since I discovered it while living in Madrid.  Clean, fresh, citrusy and the 27 Oz bottle is a huge value.</li>
            <li> My really favorite smell. I love it. Buying online cheaper than in stores. And it is a headache to find it there.</li>
            <li> My 85 y/o mom uses it and it only and we cannot find it easily anywhere else locally. This saved time and money and am grateful for the service!</li>
            <li> imo, the only cologne a man should wear, on a regular basis, as I have for over 40 years.  Always fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Scent of my youth...I love it</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful, natural, zingy citrus scent. I have been allergic to practically all perfume for years, even those used in fabric softener and household cleaners. The only one that is not \\&quot;headache in a bottle\\&quot; is classic 4711. It is fresh, refined, with essential oils of lemon, orange, bergamot, lavender and neroli - and to my highly sensitive nose, they are \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; and not synthetic counterfacts. Forget trendy products that will be forgotten in a few years and will only make you nauseous, this one has lasted 220 years. What was good enough for Napoleon and Goethe is good enough for me. Very unisex frangrance too, for men, women AND children (my grandmother dabbed me with it since I was an infant..)</li>
            <li> reminds my of my childhood. the same product that the neighborhood barber used. Wonderful aftershave. Invigorating for a great start of the day</li>
            <li> great clean fragrance</li>
            <li> after a hot shower apply Cologne and you are ready and energised!&lt;br /&gt;product is top quality in classic blue and gold bottle.</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle 50 years ago as a gift....I still get compliments.....but it got harder to find...thanks to the one who told me you had it....and thanks to you for making it so easy to get..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to smell like I remember, I think they are adding a &amp;#34;frangrance&amp;#34; which could be anything. Not sure I like it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used 4711 Cologne for many, many years, and have always loved  its Fresh Citris Scent, especially splashing it on after a shower... of course the cost is very affordable.  The Name &amp;#34;4711&amp;#34; is the Address of the Company in Koln, Germany.  The English Pronunciation for Koln is &amp;#34;Cologne&amp;#34; thus we have the word for scents.  4711 has been produced and sold since 1772 and is either the Oldest or One of the Oldest Scents Ever Sold...  Enjoy</li>
