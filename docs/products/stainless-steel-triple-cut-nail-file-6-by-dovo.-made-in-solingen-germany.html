    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best you will ever find</li>
            <li>This file is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Best nail file I have ever used</li>
            <li>and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>This file is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>so this one is ideal.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the job it does on my nails.</li>
            <li>This file will take nail, skin and all lol</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>It is good quality and that&#x27;s what I paid for.  </li>
            <li>Good for rapid shaping or an alternative to clipping nails.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to find a full-strengh steel fingernail file.</li>
            <li>Good product,arrived on time</li>
            <li>And it does a really good job filing my nails.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, so it looks like they manufacture it with great care, and I&#x27;m sure they do.</li>
            <li>This file is a bit scratchy, but does a very good job on filing my nails quickly.  </li>
            <li>Package for a more effective nail file.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;re just looking for a very fine finishing file...</li>
            <li>: Ok, I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, because it really is good of those available (both on Amazon and in shops)</li>
            <li>More than a Nail File...</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I find filing works better than clipping my nails</li>
            <li>Easy to handle size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again, seems strong and durable.</li>
            <li>This is the closest that I can find to my good old favorite, and I&#x27;d still buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good file.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>could not get a smooth edge.</li>
            <li>I had to smooth them with a cheap file.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s replacing a Kent Comb and File kit which is no longer available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a nail file, but the surface is too smooth</li>
            <li>The stainless steel has a very nice finish and the triple-cut is very uniform.</li>
            <li>Stay with this file, first 3 times felt rough, now perfect</li>
            <li>Filing area is about 4&amp;#34;, full length not quite 6&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The width is good overall.</li>
            <li>File is of very good quality and good cutting edges.  </li>
            <li>This has such great reviews and I need good files because my daughters are violinists, so the expense would be worth it, but so rough!</li>
            <li>More like it was a high school metal shop project.</li>
            <li>I have very brittle nails that are prone to breaking easily</li>
            <li>The thickness of the file is very good, and substantial - but a bit too thick for me when cleaning under my fingernails with the pointy tip.</li>
            <li>Might be useful for wood working.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than the coated &#x27;smoothers&#x27; usually sold as nail files.</li>
            <li>I have fine nails and this thing can saw them right off if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>This baby should last many years.  </li>
            <li>Found it too coarse to easily use.  </li>
            <li>The file is a little more expenive compared to others but worth the difference.</li>
            <li>one seems to require too much pressure to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li>The files are of very well made and perform as promised.</li>
            <li>This file is for acrylic nails, not your real nails.</li>
            <li>I expected a high cost German engineered product to be of superior quality.</li>
            <li>It is stainless steel throughout and manufactured with high standards.</li>
            <li>I had a Diamond Deb from the 50&#x27;s that I lost and thought I would never find another decent file until I got this one.</li>
            <li>I was tired of using up emery boards &amp; this is a good size to keep track of but tuck out of the way.</li>
            <li>They also make a diversified  list of other fine quality products including nail care products.  </li>
            <li>I have to use it very softly and smooth the edges carefully to avoid sharp-feeling nails.</li>
            <li>Even with all the use it got it was, believe it or not, still in an almost like new condition even after all these years.  </li>
            <li>The new Kent was the file which also bent within days.</li>
            <li>A fine quality nail file,, triple cross-cut and slightly finer than the Malteser one.</li>
            <li>(Think I paid the equivalent of about $3.00 U.S. for the old file).  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you have really soft nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but I still like my (mumble, mumble) years old Revlon metal file that&#x27;s not made anymore.</li>
            <li>This is an extremely well designed, useful, and functional accessory product for my finger nail and toe nail care and maintenace.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that one side is less abrasive than the other, though still quite rough.</li>
            <li>I like other alternatives better - bought a few nail files at same time to figure out which one I like best.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is very well made, sturdy, sharp where necessary.</li>
            <li>However, if this one lasts as long as the old one, it is an inexpensive price all things considered.</li>
            <li>The size will make it hard to lose (I already lost a shorter file which also quickly bent, this one feels like you&#x27;d have to work at bending it).</li>

            <li> /&gt;UK buyers - you will be charged VAT plus an £8 flat handling fee for orders over  £15.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my nails and it left them jagged and rough....</li>
            <li> However, after all of that, it takes forever to actually file your nail down.</li>
            <li> Typical German quality.  </li>
            <li> Having spent cumulatively over fifteen years stationed in Germany, I know well the quality and precision of products made in Solingen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very portable</li>
            <li> /&gt;You would have to spend hours using this to file tour nail down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to taper the thickness down a bit myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing a nail file I first bought during a base sponsored bus tour to Solingen back in 1982.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little longer but works well.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this nail file to file my little guys nails</li>
            <li> Minimal abrasiveness not effective on nails.</li>
            <li> would be to thin the last 1/4&amp;#34; or 5mm on the pointy end.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears the old file has been inadvertently misplaced or grew legs and walked.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but should last a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handling fee adds a lot for small orders.</li>
            <li> I must say I was a bit shocked at the replacement cost for a new Solingen file</li>
            <li> My nails are very hard, and I despise emery boards.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, so I will try again.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately i ordered the wrong file.</li>
            <li> Unless you do something stupid with it (try to unscrew something, jimmy a door, etc.)</li>
            <li> I hate files with plastic handles</li>

    <ol>
            <li> More than a Nail File...German Craftsmanship at it&#x27;s Finest!!!</li>
            <li> Best you will ever find</li>
            <li> This has such great reviews and I need good files because my daughters are violinists, so the expense would be worth it, but so rough! I tried it on my nails and it left them jagged and rough.... could not get a smooth edge. I had to smooth them with a cheap file. It was expensive, so I will try again.</li>
            <li> Buy the Trim nail file and save the difference in price.</li>
            <li> This file is awesome!  Having spent cumulatively over fifteen years stationed in Germany, I know well the quality and precision of products made in Solingen.  Some of the finest knives in the world come from Solingen.  They also make a diversified  list of other fine quality products including nail care products.  I&#x27;m replacing a nail file I first bought during a base sponsored bus tour to Solingen back in 1982.  I have very brittle nails that are prone to breaking easily so I use a file a lot.  Even with all the use it got it was, believe it or not, still in an almost like new condition even after all these years.  Unfortunately, it appears the old file has been inadvertently misplaced or grew legs and walked.  I must say I was a bit shocked at the replacement cost for a new Solingen file (Think I paid the equivalent of about $3.00 U.S. for the old file).  However, if this one lasts as long as the old one, it is an inexpensive price all things considered.</li>
            <li> I have fine nails and this thing can saw them right off if I&#x27;m not careful. The good thing is that one side is less abrasive than the other, though still quite rough. I have to use it very softly and smooth the edges carefully to avoid sharp-feeling nails.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a second one  to keep in my travel kit. Best nail file I have ever used</li>
            <li> I like other alternatives better - bought a few nail files at same time to figure out which one I like best.&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to require too much pressure to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;See this product: Pfeilring Sapphire Nail File, White, 13cm, .42-Ounce Package for a more effective nail file.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a nail file that I actually like. I had a Diamond Deb from the 50&#x27;s that I lost and thought I would never find another decent file until I got this one. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Well, unless I lose it. I was tired of using up emery boards &amp; this is a good size to keep track of but tuck out of the way. It seems solid enough but not clunky. Happy with the job it does on my nails.</li>
            <li> I hate files with plastic handles so this one is ideal.  My only problem is that, although I prefer metal files, this one is a bit harsher than I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy again, seems strong and durable. Not my favorite, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Stay with this file, first 3 times felt rough, now perfect</li>
            <li> File is of very good quality and good cutting edges.  Could be a little longer but works well.  Would recomend</li>
            <li> Ordered three of these. One for my husband, one for me and a spare. The files are of very well made and perform as promised. The file is a little more expenive compared to others but worth the difference. It is stainless steel throughout and manufactured with high standards.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely well designed, useful, and functional accessory product for my finger nail and toe nail care and maintenace.</li>
            <li> Solid, well made file.  Found it too coarse to easily use.  Might be useful for wood working.</li>
            <li> Ordered this nail file to file my little guys nails and unfortunately i ordered the wrong file. This file is for acrylic nails, not your real nails. This file will take nail, skin and all lol</li>
            <li> Filing area is about 4&amp;#34;, full length not quite 6&amp;#34;. I find filing works better than clipping my nails and this is perfect. The size will make it hard to lose (I already lost a shorter file which also quickly bent, this one feels like you&#x27;d have to work at bending it). It&#x27;s not very portable but since I&#x27;m only planning on using it at home that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s replacing a Kent Comb and File kit which is no longer available. I tried the one you can get now and the file was too short: filing took a lot of work and with this one fumbling to keep inside the toothed area&#x27;s a cinch so you&#x27;re done in seconds. The new Kent was the file which also bent within days. Unless you do something stupid with it (try to unscrew something, jimmy a door, etc.) or lose it it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This file is wonderful.  It is a file not an flimsy emery board.  It is good quality and that&#x27;s what I paid for.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good file.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a nail file, but the surface is too smooth it just won&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it&#x27;s almost like a nail buffer, not a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would have to spend hours using this to file tour nail down.</li>
            <li> A fine quality nail file,, triple cross-cut and slightly finer than the Malteser one. Good for rapid shaping or an alternative to clipping nails. Much more effective than the coated &#x27;smoothers&#x27; usually sold as nail files. Expensive, but should last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UK buyers - you will be charged VAT plus an £8 flat handling fee for orders over  £15. The handling fee adds a lot for small orders.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to find a full-strengh steel fingernail file. My nails are very hard, and I despise emery boards. This file gets the job done in a third of the time it takes those wimpy drugstore impersonations.</li>
            <li> Typical German quality.  This will last a lifetime if cared for properly - that is if you don&#x27;t lose it!</li>
            <li> Minimal abrasiveness not effective on nails. I expected a high cost German engineered product to be of superior quality. More like it was a high school metal shop project.</li>
            <li> Good product,arrived on time</li>
            <li> This file is a bit scratchy, but does a very good job on filing my nails quickly.  Tip is functional.</li>
            <li> Yeah, so it looks like they manufacture it with great care, and I&#x27;m sure they do. The stainless steel has a very nice finish and the triple-cut is very uniform. However, after all of that, it takes forever to actually file your nail down. Maybe if you have really soft nails or you&#x27;re just looking for a very fine finishing file... Not for me though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but I still like my (mumble, mumble) years old Revlon metal file that&#x27;s not made anymore. This is very well made, sturdy, sharp where necessary. Easy to handle size. The only thing that I&#x27;d change (and I may take it out to the shop and do this) would be to thin the last 1/4&amp;#34; or 5mm on the pointy end. The thickness of the file is very good, and substantial - but a bit too thick for me when cleaning under my fingernails with the pointy tip. I&#x27;m going to taper the thickness down a bit myself. The width is good overall. This is the closest that I can find to my good old favorite, and I&#x27;d still buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: Ok, I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, because it really is good of those available (both on Amazon and in shops)</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for:  a well-made nail file that won&#x27;t break after three months of service.  This baby should last many years.  And it does a really good job filing my nails.  Recommended without reservation.</li>
