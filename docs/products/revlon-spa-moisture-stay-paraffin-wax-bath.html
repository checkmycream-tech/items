            <li>I thought that was a great idea</li>
            <li>My hand feels great after a treatment - it would probably work wonders for those with arthritis as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to have in the winter, after you use it, the increased circulation keeps your hands and feet warm for hours.  </li>

            <li>Great at home treatment.</li>

            <li>The bonus of the 2 mitts and plastic bags make this a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>This unit is great to renew parched feet and hands.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the best, you don&#x27;t need to go to any beauty salon and pay a lot of money for the treatment.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift to me from my family and I will now be buying many for friends and family!!</li>
            <li>i love it!!</li>
            <li>The treatment was Very effective...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice but takes over 3  hours to melt the wax.  </li>
            <li>For this price it is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase!! :)</li>
            <li>warm hands AND feet!  </li>
            <li>Just love dipping my arthritic ands in it before bedtime, a wonderful gift from my son!</li>
            <li>the wait:) Buy this you will be glad you did!!!</li>
            <li>It also heats up very quickly (allow about three hours) and the heat setting is adjustable; another great improvement!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use!</li>
            <li>Does a great job at a fair price, wax has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>good thing is the product came with</li>
            <li>It feels good on your hands and feet, and it does make your skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>The paraffin wax helps a good bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>It felt soo good</li>
            <li>Good luck to anyone who buys this machine.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good idea but don&#x27;t like to wait for hours for it to heat.</li>
            <li>that was good.</li>
            <li>As a plus, I will say the paraffin felt good on the hands</li>
            <li>A good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>she loved it arrived in 2 days</li>
            <li>This is the highest rated paraffin machine under $50 and after reading the reviews it seems like a good and inexpensive test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>I had it for 3 days and loved it until I saw wax beneath it and on the edge of the counter...</li>
            <li>Not as good wax coating.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good and helps my Wrist flexibility.</li>
            <li>but it feels good.</li>
            <li>It smells so good.</li>
            <li>Good for home use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>We manage but an xlg length would be good, even for me.</li>
            <li>The shipping was onetime.the price was good.</li>
            <li>Of my goodness it feels so good</li>
            <li>I have used this with one of my friends who has arthritis and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li>Good price and good product.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a good amount of wax and bags and the mits.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  </li>
            <li>oh so good after the bath.</li>
            <li>paraffin it comes with is really good</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>In addition the good affects of the heat therapy I have also found using the paraffin bath is helpful in moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>i tried it once, packaged it up and will donate it to Good Will.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT still a good bargain</li>
            <li>Adding mineral oil helps the wax to peel away from your skin, wash with soap and water and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful product, I love this!!!!</li>
            <li>It is just wonderful and not being in constant pain is the best.</li>

            <li>I am very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase experience, delivery and product.</li>
            <li>A great value also :)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Huge waist of time and money!!</li>
            <li>My hands are already feeling better!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for myself, and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Three women are very happy now that we had a family hand spa Hot Parafin Wax day.  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely paraffin bath!</li>
            <li>I just love it smell!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Used with my favorite lotion, it gives me softness!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The paraffin bath was easy to use, paraffin that came with the bath melted easily, it was a wonderful experience.</li>
            <li>while this bath is great for dipping, it&#x27;s not so easy to use for painting the wax with a brush onto an area of the body, like a shoulder.</li>
            <li>Great product works just fine.</li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>The soothing heat is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it looks nice too sitting on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I also liked all the extras the plastic bags and mitts.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it and it made me feel good.</li>
            <li>The wax provided has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I have to kind of dip my heels then my toes.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>At the end of the three hours, the machine was not even warm.  </li>
            <li>otherwise this is just as nice as the spa ones.  </li>
            <li>So I would ask at a salon where you&#x27;ve had it done, what kind do they use and order that.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it stops heating on its own.   </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s warm, but it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>If you are looking mostly for moisturizing benefits from the parrafin, I recommend putting a good lotion on before you dip in the wax.  </li>
            <li>All items I have ordered from Amazon have been shipped very timely &amp; the products have been excellent.</li>
            <li>Good product, I love it.</li>
            <li>to let you know the kit comes with its own wax because it have lanoline in it, this stops the wax from burning the skin.</li>
            <li>Also, leave a nice fragrance in your skin.</li>
            <li>looked like it had been used and whoever repacked it did not so nice a repacking job.  </li>
            <li>this was the best bday gift ive ever gotten myself and i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Nice,  well-designed product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as a nice gift for some one.  </li>
            <li>When I bought it for myself it seemed kind of frivolous</li>
            <li>Quite nice.</li>
            <li>but it really does, I&#x27;m very happy that I got this!!</li>
            <li>It is spectacular.</li>
            <li>(The plastic safety tray at the bottom of the unit is also a nice added safety measure.)</li>
            <li>AND IT WARMS AND SOFTENS THE HANDS NICELY.</li>
            <li>Nice size.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the adjustable temperature settings.  </li>
            <li>Like the fact that you can keep it on warm.  </li>
            <li>: Nice looking, the heat control thermostat works.</li>
            <li>this hand paraffin bath warms your hands nicely.  </li>
            <li>Not as effective as paraffin in a salon.</li>
            <li>At PT they used to use heated towels to keep your hands warm after the wax bath.  </li>
            <li>Really nice if you have severe arthritis.</li>
            <li>My friend is still thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really my own need to plan to use it when the weather is changing/</li>
            <li>I put my hands in the warm wax and then the plastic gloves</li>
            <li>The product works great, everything you need was included in the original box.</li>
            <li>This product has been great no leaks but does take the full two hours to warm up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and after all my research I think this is the best home unit out there.</li>
            <li>I just love this product it is easy to use and feels great when you put it on sore hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of Revlon&#x27;s Paraffin Bath and very pleased with the purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The new one seems to work perfectly, my doctor recommended I get one for pain I have in my hands</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>: The paraffin that came with it has very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>but once it is melted, it is very easy.</li>
            <li>The wax felt good and the gloves fit my husband as did the bath.</li>
            <li>The hotter the wax is when you dip, the more heat the wax retains and the longer your hands/feet stay warm.</li>
            <li>not to mention more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>WOW did it feel great!</li>
            <li>early, works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Plus makes my hands so silky and smooth great product and easy to set up.</li>
            <li>Worked great right out of the box.</li>
            <li>You do have to plan ahead for using it, as it takes a good two hours for the wax to heat up, but it is well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>easy to manage temps, love the heat on my achy hands!</li>
            <li>No problem with it being too hot and the mits are a great addition to the kit</li>
            <li>Love it, heats up fast and makes your feet and hands feel oh, so good!</li>
            <li>It works just fine though!</li>
            <li>The feeling is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>would prefer unscented or a very light scent.</li>
            <li>It heated very quickly and I have it set to stay warm all the time, so I can use it after and exertion of my hands.</li>
            <li>but since this was my first time to use a warm wax machine, thought it was wise to do this.  </li>
            <li>So now I can enjoy from my home when I want and know that it is clean and safe!!</li>
            <li>This device does a great job at a very decent price.</li>
            <li>I love getting paraffin at the salon,</li>
            <li>When I read many reviews they seem to be talking about &amp;</li>
            <li>I liked it, but if someone can make on where the wax is not scented or lightly scented.</li>
            <li>I bought my Revlon Paraffin Bath several months ago and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>My hands feel better than ever now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s okay to leave it on the lowest setting all the time</li>
            <li>ok, more of a safety feature I suppose.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>Love that the liners and mits come included.  </li>
            <li>I am sure the $100</li>
            <li>After just 2 treatments with the hot wax (you dip hand in 5 times when wax is comfortably warm, make a fist, wrap in saran wrap for 15 minutes, remove wrap and wax and start bending your fingers)I can now move and bend both fingers with ease!</li>
            <li>, I think you can do your hands and feet twice, before you have to add more wax, because the level would be too low.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The combination of a nice body scrub and this product equals smooth heaven.  </li>
            <li>or my daughters, guess it was cheap insurance anyway!  </li>
            <li>Love how this paraffin dip helps my hands.</li>
            <li>I so wanted to like this parafin warmer, but it just isn&#x27;t a quality product, and I absolutely love Revlon products, and that&#x27;s why it saddens me to say it, but it misses the mark.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>I love it, it can just in time for my birthday.</li>
            <li>It sure makes my hands feel silky and helps ease the arthritis pain.</li>
            <li>I returned it and am looking to buy another brand to see if it will work better.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product so I can safe money going to the spa...</li>
            <li>Works as instructed and smells subtly lovely.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>This wax treatment helps me to get through my exercises with more movement.</li>
            <li>We tried it 2 more times-over</li>
            <li>My skin looks to much better and relive my pains in my hands  for my arthritis.</li>
            <li>Also, I love that it came with all the things you need to get started.</li>
            <li>they were soft and felt incredible.  </li>
            <li>she left it out for all of us to dip our hand and it does wonder for arthritis wonderful when i can</li>
            <li>love love love it</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>but I am so glad to have it now.  </li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t get more that two dips with out my hand touching the bottom of the vessel.  </li>
            <li>but it was able to do what i bought it for.  </li>
            <li>, glad I did.</li>
            <li>My wife was so pleased with hers, we order of one for a friend.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The product more than met my expectations,  Everything needed to get started is included with the paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li>There are some days when they ache and burn more than others.  </li>
            <li>I love it for my carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for therapeutic reasons more than cosmetic.  </li>
            <li>(Smooth!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>You MUST read the direction to be sure you don&#x27;t hurt yourself.  </li>
            <li>still it was ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if she would like it or not, so I took a gamble.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy yours!</li>
            <li>All in all we&#x27;re pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Brought one at BBand Beyond, but like this one much better.  </li>
            <li>Top fits better and heats well.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would handle more.</li>
            <li>I regret not purchasing a better brand/model.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>If they gave you more to start...</li>
            <li>So if you buy this..do so knowing you will need more wax, immediately.</li>
            <li>I imagine if you wanted to thoroughly coat them up to and including your wrist you&#x27;d need more wax.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS MOISTURE</li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews on Amazon and decided this may work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I know you are not suppose to leave these on for more than an hour or two before and after use</li>
            <li>Will try &amp; find a better one.</li>
            <li>, however most items these days do not allow that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I am very pleasantly satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have three or more lbs.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of using it.  </li>
            <li>The bath makes me take the time to get off my feet and take better care of myself.</li>
            <li>It seems to be much better constructed than the Homedics unit.</li>
            <li>use it as many times I want .</li>
            <li>It is every convenient to be able to do a paraffin hand and foot treatment at home...</li>
            <li>That is the one reason I don&#x27;t use it more than I do.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and the smoothness of your hands afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are very strait forward and the paraffin provided smells great</li>
            <li>Otherwise, love this product.</li>
            <li>Takes about 1 hour to 1-1/2 hours for the wax to melt completely, so be sure to plan ahead.  </li>
            <li>I use this almost every night, and my hands have never been in better shape at this point in the winter season.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say than the title.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>This is more of a 2 person job than anything else.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more to like?</li>
            <li>This takes more than a hour to heat and melt wax</li>
            <li>and she love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t I love this product?</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not that big of a selection and this one looked the best.</li>
            <li>The machine comes with a huge block of wax that you turn it on and warm it up to your desired temp.</li>
            <li>I love this paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li>I assumed a $40 dollar paraffin bath would do better than some cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>and it was much more bearable.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But I do love the soothing heat and the way it makes your hands look after use.  </li>
            <li>so I added more.</li>
            <li>I have been quite pleased with this paraffin bath.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a plastic cover that keeps you from touching the metal.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this  my hands feel better then ever before</li>
            <li>However if you preplanned and gave yourself enough time then this is the best!</li>
            <li>I wish it came with 2 more bars of wax to fill it more</li>
            <li>you are looking for a once-in-a-while experience, I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love it for arthritic thumb joint.  </li>
            <li>They are extras in many baths at 4 times the price.</li>
            <li>The wax that is included is kinda fragrant for my taste, but still pleasant, although I think adding another pound or two of was will give you a fuller tub, so your hand does not touch the metal hot bottom.</li>
            <li>She was very excited that it came with all the extras like disposable plastic gloves etc.</li>
            <li>and you will have beautiful, soft feet.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind scents it is fine, but for me that is a very important part of the product which should be part of the description.</li>
            <li>Unit works great but wish it were just a bit longer to fit whole foot inside with out rubbing was off heel.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution for dry weathered feet.  </li>
            <li>is exactly as described, does a good job and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Buy 2 or 3 pounds more wax though and canning wax works fine.</li>
            <li>The hardened wax peels off easily and has a mild, nice scent.</li>
            <li>My hands feel great when dipping,leaves hands  soft and oily so rub in oil.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>believe most wax treatments are comfortable at about 125F.</li>
            <li>and my feet are so soft and look great.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and as expected.</li>
            <li>Buy it, love it, enjoy it.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GOOD AND MELTS FAST THE PARAFFIN</li>
            <li>Enjoy the quick warm  up time.  </li>
            <li>Great product super fast delivery Thank you</li>
            <li>It fits better on the countertop and my hands fit just fine.</li>
            <li>To all future buyers GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, wax heats in about 1 1/2 hrs (as advertised).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy...</li>
            <li>It was also easy to use amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and melts the wax in the timely manner as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>it was very,very easy..</li>
            <li>and it did peel off easily.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>Easily 5</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but if you leave it plugged in and on warm it&#x27;s always ready when you need or want it :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This one was very quick.  </li>
            <li>mine was very quick, no problem.  </li>
            <li>The scent was too strong and I have allergies.</li>
            <li>A couple reviews mentioned how objectionally strongly the supplied wax smells.</li>
            <li>Again, because of the many positive reviews and low price, I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived as promised and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I liked the product very much but the instructions were unclear about what to do with the plastic grate</li>
            <li>I love it, makes my hands and feet feel so smooth and really gives you a spa feel in your own home.</li>
            <li>In this way I am able to reuse the paraffin - it is encased between the bags, which protect my hands from the full temperature.  </li>
            <li>I soften my hands in warm water first, then slather with Gold Bond Healing Hand Cream.</li>
            <li>in fact i turned my unit down to the \\&quot;keep warm\\&quot; temp and it was the perfect temp at the 2 hour mark.  </li>
            <li>It is also very good for dry and cracking skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>However, once melted it was fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to move from one area of the house to another.</li>
            <li>The temperature was fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, no problems</li>
            <li>This looks fine on a kitchen cabinet.</li>
            <li>The wax heats even more quickly than the instructions suggested, though I imagine that may vary.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my Revlon Moisturestay Quick Heat up Bath.</li>
            <li>If you lead an active lifestyle using your hands for gripping weights, or doing the pull up bar, this bath is perfect for adding the right amount of therapy for your hands after a tiring workout.  </li>
            <li>and if I attempt deeper submersion, I am touching a very hot bottom of the container.  </li>
            <li>the heat feels great on my hands and they feel super soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Working fine so far I gave it 4 stars for all the accessories it came with it plus the wax is good</li>
            <li>My cuticles were cracking and my hands stopped feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Now we don&#x27;t have to go to nail salon to enjoy that feeling of pampering again.</li>
            <li>And they fit well in the plastic bags provided.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>This unit is cheap.  </li>
            <li>Pull the opening of the bag over your wrist then twist and secure.  </li>
            <li>clean, nice-smelling, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy using this paraffin bath and appreciate the gloves that come with it.  </li>
            <li>wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax I&#x27;m using is now lightly scented, not too objectionable, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose it.</li>
            <li>I fee this huge sigh of relief to be ache free and know that it&#x27;s not a lost cause.  </li>
            <li>Hmm, doesn&#x27;t sound \\&quot;quick\\&quot; to me.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>This is realoy cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap looking but works.</li>
            <li>- (they just fit) but plan to.  </li>
            <li>I turned it on and the wax melted and it worked great, then I tried to use it again the next day but the wax wouldn&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li>This paraffin bath was securely packaged for shipping without using an excess of packing material.  </li>
            <li>I have had several hand surgeries and sometimes my hands just aren&#x27;t happy, so I use this for heat therapy.  </li>
            <li>Great personal pamper me gift</li>
            <li>You can probably get much cheaper wax and add your own oils if you like to save money.</li>
            <li>honestly this is such a nice splurge for anyone...male or&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It does take a while for the wax to melt and one needs to test the wax before dipping your entire hand in it, but it works very well and makes my arthritic hands feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>OK product, didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would for my hands but the machine itself works good, next i will try my feet.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to see if it would help with my husband&#x27;s arthritis (which it has), but I find myself using it more than he does!  </li>
            <li>That being said, it is very useful to help loosen and lower pain in hands.</li>
            <li>The paraffin stays very hot requiring very quick dips into it.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I wasn&#x27;t super happy about</li>
            <li>YEs, it takes a while to heat up the paraffin, but the wait is worth it!</li>
            <li>There was NOT a bad odor when it was melting or after it melt, although it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li>I heat my hand up with the hot wax and it helps me move my fingers a lot better.</li>
            <li>First let me say I love having this for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this as an exchange gift  but received one as a gift.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have the original box.</li>
            <li>They should just have something built in to prevent you from touching the hot bottom while its on.</li>
            <li>Make sure wax is not too hot.</li>
            <li>( I ordered more) there is a warmer switch to hot switch-</li>
            <li>and I found it to be not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>Sure it takes a while to heat up, but it&#x27;s not like you paid $200 or more for a professional wax dip.</li>
            <li>you would have to melt the wax to clean it out.</li>
            <li>Works great, use on my husband who has severely dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>However, it took 2 days of heating then melting to clean it up to return.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s Day gift or birthday gift for that someone special.</li>
            <li>In order to melt the wax quicker, I placed a folded towel in a large pot with lukewarm water and placed the 3lbs of wax on top of the towel over medium heat.  </li>
            <li>It feels like a really special treat when we get it out</li>
            <li>Also, a special benefit to the bath is the softness that comes after you peel the wax off your hands.</li>
            <li>Which is not practical, specially if you forget and wait too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also hard to adjust the heat,but for the price I feel I got a great buy!!</li>
            <li>but the return process was super easy and the replacement was shipped and delivered right away.</li>
            <li>However, knowing that, you can turn it on when you go out to work in the yard or when you get home from work and have it ready when you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked mine, which I bought locally, so much that I bought one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s day, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li>But now I can happily say it is much better than the old larger model.</li>
            <li>This melts the wax fast and gets it nice and hot for wax play.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for in home use, and much cheaper than going to a spa!</li>
            <li>I have hurt the joints in my hand and this really makes it feel better.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter, and this warmer has been turned on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; for three days straight 24/7, and the three pounds of parafin STILL hasn&#x27;t melted for me to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I turned this to full power and melted wax in under 2 hours .</li>
            <li>i use the cool setting when i keep the machine on for a couple days so that way when i want to use it</li>
            <li>Take care to unplug the unit and give it a moment to cool a bit before putting your hand into the wax.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would help that much</li>
            <li>feel like commenting on the melting time (slow) or the scent (NICE!!!</li>
            <li>I waited another 30 mins for it to cool</li>
            <li>it cool for a bit before using.</li>
            <li>I returned the Revlon bath and got a full refund.</li>
            <li>One good feature of the smaller Revlon unit is the variable thermostat to continuously control the warmth of the reservoir.</li>
            <li>works good, it only took one hour not two like it said</li>
            <li>Then cool the wax for 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li>A great gift for anyone who loves beautiful hands or suffers from arthritis.</li>
            <li>This product has worked great for me as the temperature settings are just right and the wax does not take long at all to melt.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The wax gets just the right temperature for me.  </li>
            <li>You have to be available at the right time to use it.  </li>
            <li>This hot wax bath is easy to use and is helpful in easing the pain in my arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li>The wax that comes with the unit is perfumed and seems pretty strong to me</li>
            <li>I am satisfied that the unit can stay hot enough to keep the wax melted and at a good hot temperature but the amount of wax shipped with the unit was inadequate.</li>
            <li>This machine works well and comes adequately equipped with all of the supplies needed to enjoy it right out of the box.</li>
            <li>once completely hot,, does a good job on covering my right hand , which has developed arthritis.</li>
            <li>Moisturestay Quick Heat Paraffin Bath]]</li>
            <li>I got my Revlon Quick Bath and heated it immediately with the 3 LBs.</li>
            <li>the included hand mitts are a super addition.</li>
            <li>I purchased this \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot; paraffin bath to try to help relieve some pain in my hand and wrist.  </li>
            <li>The brochure said the wax would melt in about 2 hours (quick?), but I gave up after 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to be kidding me about selling this unit as a \\&quot;Quick</li>
            <li>and I received this unit quickly</li>
            <li>My hands felt so nice and cozy with the liners and warm mits.  </li>
            <li>and then it hardened quickly when you unplud it.</li>
            <li>Revlon RVSP3501B1 Moisturestay Quick Heat Paraffin Bath</li>
            <li>The red light goes on and off spontaneously and it takes forever to melt the wax...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they would call it \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The mitts are adequate.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly.</li>
            <li>STAY QUICK HEAT PARAFFIN BATH.</li>
            <li>I Would recommend super product.</li>
            <li>melts quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommand to you :)</li>
            <li>I used it again next day and it was just fine!!</li>
            <li>It was a HUGE hit, one of the first things out of the box and immediately plugged in.  </li>
            <li>Almost all wax is gone from the very first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gets very hot, no matter the setting</li>
            <li>it is very hot because it can burn.</li>
            <li>You must use this at a very hot temperature in order to have usable wax.</li>
            <li>The device does not get the paraffin very hot.  </li>
            <li>Did not get warm like it should wax barely melted, Was</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the number of accessories this comes with as it allows me to test out the machine immediately after open box.  </li>
            <li>The wax gets very hot even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Warm\\&quot; setting is too hot to comfortably dip into.</li>
            <li>I have used this Revlon product several times since purchase and have been very pleased with results.</li>
            <li>It is very hot if you don&#x27;t follow them to the letter.</li>
            <li>(wax was very hot</li>
            <li>This paraffin bath is just the right thing to keep her skin soft and smooth and make her hands feel better.  </li>
            <li>Even on high it won&#x27;t burn you to use it and the heat actually feels great soaking into your hands.</li>
            <li>I just hope the new wax will be better quality.</li>
            <li>I love my new Revlon brand.</li>
            <li>I even waited a good 5 hr’s on the first day and 9 hr’s on the second day.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;d done my share of jam-making as a child, I melted the paraffin on the stove for the first time (do NOT do this unless you know what you are doing!</li>
            <li>It gets so hot it burns your hands!</li>
            <li>and it was very well recieved!!  </li>
            <li>It was almost unbearably hot!</li>
            <li>Fast shipper!!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the wax melts right away.  </li>
            <li>I now see why most people say how the old paraffin bath’s worked much better then these new cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>In general it was easy to set up and the directions were easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were very helpful and accurate.  </li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy your purchase as much as I did.  </li>
            <li>BUT well worth it when u know ahead of time</li>
            <li>it makes your hands/fingers/cuticles soft and hydrated better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used ever.  </li>
            <li>So far used it 10 times - love it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered different kind to try something else.</li>
            <li>This is more for a young child</li>
            <li>I wish I had spent a bit more money for a better piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I dipped in the warm wax five times and kept the liners and mits on for about ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>but the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li>Shape is nice; allows me to get my entire hand in for therapy.</li>
            <li>If it were local I would honestly return it for a refund.</li>
            <li>All in all, an inexpensive and not too useful product.</li>
            <li>Some of the downsides are inherent to melting wax--you have to plan about 2- 2 1/2 hours ahead when you want to use the paraffin bath, but it melts considerably faster than most of the home products on the market.  </li>
            <li>It will take awhile to heat up (2-3 hours), so completely spontaneous use is not really possible.</li>
            <li>Takes two hours to head the wax, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The only barrier preventing me from giving this unit a 5-star review is the amount of time it takes to warm up.</li>
            <li>Give yourself about an hour if it&#x27;s pretty full of wax.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it once the bags come off.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>It seems to take what feels like all day to heat up and melt the wax, but its totally worth it.</li>
            <li>BUT, WORTH THE WAIT.</li>
            <li>Will buy again and its useful.  </li>
            <li>It heats up in the time described and it does get hot, but you let it cool off,  as described in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun way to soften your hands at home.</li>
            <li>I could see someone who is healthy and just wants to do a spa treatment might really like this.</li>
            <li>I bought this paraffin bath because I used one at physical therapy to warm up my hand before exercises after hand surgery for a severed tendon.  </li>
            <li>maximum paraffin level mark on the bath would be useful</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin soft and also the joint pains just melt away.</li>
            <li>so it was a five star success.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying my new paraffin bath very much.</li>
            <li>I unplugged it and let it cool some more so that I could very quickly dip my hands several times and put them in the mitts, but it really provided no arthritis relief using it that way.  </li>
            <li>There are other companies out there who make Paraffin Bath&#x27;s but most take more than 6 hours to melt the wax.    </li>
            <li>Heats up pretty quick, i like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who is ready and willing to buy professional grade products if I can&#x27;t find a recreational type of sufficient quality.</li>
            <li>When you first place your hand in the bath it seems very hot.</li>
            <li>Also was surprised it takes so long to warm up, so I leave it plugged in most of the time.  </li>
            <li>however it takes a LONG time for the wax to melt, like more than an hour!</li>
            <li>Just time it right for when you know you&#x27;re going to use it, and stop complaining.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the price is right and it works.  </li>
            <li>it melted right away.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size for home use.</li>
            <li>so I just turned the dial all the way to the right where it says melt.</li>
            <li>I wish the warmer setting would keep it warm enough that it stayed melted but not to hot to be used.</li>
            <li>(it protects the body part from the heat source) &amp; stays there until you are ready to clean the machine (</li>
            <li>Basically it has two temperatures: \\&quot;scalding hot liquid wax\\&quot; or \\&quot;warm solid wax\\&quot;... Unusable either way.</li>
            <li>you just really need to plan ahead and be prepared for some clean up with wax pieces.  </li>
            <li>First use today and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It takes quite some time to warm enough to melt the wax then seems too hot</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry and very dry hands.</li>
            <li>The Revlon hand wax bath is perfect for dry, rough hands or feet.  </li>
            <li>I had owned a couple different brands previous to this, and I think this has the best construction, ease of use and customizable heat settings of any of them!</li>
            <li>although the wax slowly melts, once list applies easily and has good smell.</li>
            <li>It does take about 2 hours to heat first thing in the morning, however it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I take the lid off to cool (and turn on \\&quot;warm\\&quot;) and it&#x27;s ready in the suggested 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Takes a long while to warm up, like 3 hours, but it works well.  </li>
            <li>you need to allow about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the wax to melt and a good 30 minutes to turn the temp down</li>
            <li>This works well, except it needs a little more wax to cover up to the wrist, so I&#x27;ve ordered more wax.  </li>
            <li>I would recomend the unit however you will need to invest a little more money to get the better wax from another source.</li>
            <li>but my hands stay warm for a long time after using this (yay !)</li>
            <li>Price is right and delivery was fast!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to try anything to help with the pain, so I ordered one right away.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice now, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll still have to figure out how to keep the wax warm while its hardening but even if you use nothing at all and just dip and re-dip and wait to dry...</li>
            <li>The only light that came on ever was the power light</li>
            <li>So nice to have this during the winter for dry hands and feet</li>
            <li>In my experience with it the paraffin when completely full it takes about an hour to completely melt (that&#x27;s not bad at all).</li>
            <li>If you have the plastic protector (included part) in the bath, you should have nothing to worry about except a bit of tingling pain if you dip while the wax is too hot (fair warning: I have a high tolerance for pain, especially from heat, but I&#x27;m pretty sure my skin would burn at the same temperature as everyone else&#x27;s), but I haven&#x27;t even come close to burning myself.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;sessions are complete and need to use my parafin bath,I notice that the power, and the heat light comes on, the wax melted, but the light gages doesn&#x27;t comes on ,it just keeps the high hot temperature.</li>
            <li>It made hands very smooth, especially after i did it twice.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product but the length of time that it takes to melt the paraffin is a VERY LONG TIME!</li>
            <li>is also really good because I live in the desert and my hands get really dry.</li>
            <li>Well, the instructions say to add the wax to the machine, turn the heat on high and wait for 120 minutes and then to let the wax cool for an additional 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The wax was too hot to be comfortable even after melting and letting it cool on the low setting for 30 minutes (as stated on the directions).  </li>
            <li>So I put it in another room until I was able to send it back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the hot paraffin wax I used in occupational therapy.</li>
            <li>hot</li>
            <li>used for first time,wire plugged in got very hot,nearly melted,not worth payin return ship for refunds,junk</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Exfoliate first with some sugar and then use the paraffin &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>hot wax feels healing and soothing.</li>
            <li>So I have to stir it to prevent that from happening, or I just suck it up and dip my hands into the hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also able to put my size 8 feet into the mitts, that are supposed to be for the hands only.</li>
            <li>Again, if you size 10 and above... you won&#x27;t be able to do that, I don&#x27;t think.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>If OK, this will be my last post.  </li>
            <li>how soft and smooth her hands felt.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The product works well, and my hands and feet are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>paraffin is very flammable!).  </li>
            <li>[ASIN:B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream Facial Treatment, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>and I was really glad I had ordered the extra unscented wax.  </li>
            <li>Read directions twice, not really difficult</li>
            <li>Also it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first one I got was damaged; I do not know if it was from the manufacturer or from the postman.</li>
            <li>I purchased another brand from Wal-Mart, first.  </li>
            <li>the minimal directions.&lt;br /&gt;Using this for arthritis in hands, so , guidance would be nice in what setting to keep the wax at before dipping my hands in.  </li>
            <li>It seems like that would be too hot.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sooo soothing not to mention my hand feels soft and smooth after..</li>
            <li>the wax is pretty hot when you dip your hand in.</li>
            <li>i just turn it to hot.</li>
            <li>I tried it first with the wax that came with it and then added the extra lb I purchased thinking that might make it better</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>but then it was to hot to put your hand in.</li>
            <li>I garden and wash my hands a lot in hot water</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have now gotten the unscented wax and used the spa several time.</li>
            <li>I love it enough that I put my feet in it also ..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my hand in it because it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li>Overall I would love it.</li>
            <li>It is either hot or hot.</li>
            <li>I promise u can&#x27;t go wrong very happy</li>
            <li>This is my first paraffin bath</li>
            <li>First off, the unit took a couple hours to melt the 3 lbs.</li>
            <li>The first one came damaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But as I type this, my fingers don&#x27;t ache, for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li>but it performed exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>My niece helped him decide on this particular paraffin bath because it was \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The wax gets hot but not so hot that you&#x27;ll burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Dip them in the hot wax 10-15 times each and cover in baggies and mitts.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought extra!  </li>
            <li>I followed directions exactly and found wax to be too hot even after leaving it on lowest setting for 40 minutes</li>
            <li>This does exactly what you would expect this item to do..</li>
            <li>you wouldnt need to stick your had as close to the hot plate.</li>
            <li>The first time out it melts the wax in about 1 1/2-2 hours.</li>
            <li>u will see shiny hands ;)</li>
            <li>I read all the directions and did exactly what I read.</li>
            <li>I also think the warming temperature is a bit too hot</li>
            <li>When the wax is melted, it&#x27;s too hot to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too hot to use.</li>
            <li>I does take a long time to warm up but really like it.</li>
            <li>Works well, but not being able to leave it on low means it takes 1 1/2 hours before you can use it.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, not very convenient</li>
            <li>either way it&#x27;s not deep enough for the wax to cover the top of my foot, where I want the benefits of the oils the most.  </li>
            <li>it is too hot for your hands.  </li>
            <li>Not a deal breaker by any means, but something to be aware of when moving or storing.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it gets too hot for your hands</li>
            <li>I have used it several times but worry about touching the sides and getting burned.  </li>
            <li>The first heating took forever.</li>
            <li>Still really hot.</li>
            <li>So, basically I realized the first time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing I have to say is the smell of the wax is /very/ potent</li>
            <li>The problem, the wax is way TOO HOT, even in the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>There is NOT enough wax included with it so order more in the beginning.</li>
            <li>the highest setting is way too hot.</li>
            <li>The bath was easy to set up and true to its name was ready to use in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>Once it gets to the right temperature it is easy to use and the various heat settings are helpful.</li>
            <li>I just wish it were a little deeper and longer to fit my size 11 foot. : )</li>
            <li>The wax smells nice and it is just what I had expected!</li>
            <li>On high heat it&#x27;s too hot!</li>
            <li>I really like how soft and smooth this makes my hands.</li>
            <li>As an older nurse, I recall using them years ago, with success, with my patients ----it is my friend&#x27;s loss that she chooses not to use it --</li>
            <li>and I know when I would arrive at the salon many times they would tell me that the wax wasn&#x27;t turned on and it would take atleast 30 minutes, so I expected to wait and let it melt and It was sooooo worth</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I like it too because of its healing assistance - the natural oils in the paraffin are relatively long-lasting and seem to offer nice relief for chapping.  </li>
            <li>..this is a good little paraffin bath!</li>
            <li>It takes FOREVER for the wax to melt and then when it starts to cool off enough so it won&#x27;t burn your hands it begins to harden too quickly.</li>
            <li>Dipping them in the hot wax gives me much relief.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it won&#x27;t take me too long to go through them.</li>
            <li>How long do I have to be able to return it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s a good product for me.  </li>
            <li>I turn it down to warm when the wax is completely melted to cool off before dipping my hands.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to turn the unit to high before you go to bed at night, then lower the heat right when you wake.</li>
            <li>squares, put them in, and turned the temperature setting all the way to the right (high).</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t use it on high it starts to set up right away.</li>
            <li>it melted nice and evenly, and I turn the heat down to about the 4th notch to set for a bit before I stick my hands in.  </li>
            <li>After 2 days I turned the unit down to the keep warm setting &amp; paraffin began to harden up almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>same as the high price ones and does the somewhat better.</li>
            <li>The other thing I want to mention is the don&#x27;t burn yourself bottom piece I wish it had a way to esily  remove it  without re-dipping my hands into the wax and to be able to hang it on the side of the machine so that after you used it you could easily lift it up and attach it inside above the wax since if you don&#x27;t take it out until the wax is all hardened again and place it back on top then  </li>
            <li>It heats the wax thoroughly and has enough room for easy hand submerging.  </li>
            <li>Previous hand therapists had used paraffin baths as a routine part of hand therapy, and I had always liked it.  </li>
            <li>I even purchased extra wax so that I could dip it in easily and with it being my pinky</li>
            <li>The first day I used this it the red light wouldn&#x27;t  turn on.</li>
            <li>With a substantial amount of wax, to coat as much of the wrist as possible, it takes a full three hours to melt and the final temperature is about 140 degrees F, too hot for most.  </li>
            <li>I dip my hands five times to get a good thick layer that will stay hot</li>
            <li>It take a little planning to be able to use it consistently but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>You have to melt the wax on high and then turn it down to warm about an hour before use so that the wax is not too hot.</li>
            <li>Heating/cooling times matched the brochure that came in the box - 2 hours to melt wax completely, about 25 minutes to cool enough to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Might see if someone else in my family wants to try it, my hands are super sensitive to temperature and this just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>I also figured out how to open the HomeMedics heated bath and repaired the thermostat by sanding the burned electrical contacts with fine grit emery paper.</li>
            <li>A little too warm</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to follow the instructions to cut back on the heat at a certain point.</li>
            <li>If its too thin, cool off easy and doesnt come off easy.</li>
            <li>I wish I could dunk my whole body into it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered eucalyptus wax for it and was much happier than the no scent wax that comes with it.</li>
            <li>very soothing, helps to relax hand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The paraffin bath did more than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>I turn it on when I get up so by the time I get ready to primp, color shower</li>
            <li>It truly made the whole product oily.  </li>
            <li>because with the gloves you really cannot do anything around the house.</li>
            <li>It really does take 2 hours to melt the wax (as stated in the instructions), which requires pre-planning.</li>
            <li>It jus didn&#x27;t seem to soften my skin as much as the one at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>it really seems to help with arthritis.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants to soften their hands and skin.  </li>
            <li>Really like the parrafin bath.  </li>
            <li>But when you get used to that, the product really does soften your hands.</li>
            <li>This one work very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always review a product but others reviewing this product really helped to make my decision</li>
            <li>Also thanks to therapy for&lt;br /&gt;giving</li>
            <li>but you can use it daily and is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thanks VG</li>
            <li>I really like the item --</li>
            <li>the toughest thing about the whole set up was getting the freaking wax out of the plastic wrap and breaking it up.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to melt the wax, and after dipping your hands or feet in it, you have to sit still for awhile, something I don&#x27;t do very well, so for me it requires planning ahead - something else I don&#x27;t do very well.  </li>
            <li>As described - thanks.</li>
            <li>It really helped my tendonitis.</li>
            <li>It also  helped my mother-in-laws rheumatoid arthritis so much that we got her one for mother&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>they really needed&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>It holds in the heat really well.</li>
            <li>Also, I wear a woman&#x27;s side 11 shoe and this unit, when filled according to directions, is too short for my feet.</li>
            <li>I buy canning wax, soooo much cheaper</li>
            <li>CLEANS UP FAST.</li>
            <li>The feeling I get after I give my hands a bath in the paraffin is absolute heaven.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Have not tried this product yet, but it really did not tell you what came with the paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to plan my whole day around using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the moisturizer gets a chance to really soak in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain to setup, but works really well to moisturize hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will help my arthritis much</li>
            <li>,i recommend to everyone who need this,but really need 6 lbs of wax to cover hand and wrist.</li>
            <li>I really like the ease of use</li>
            <li>but because I never know when i am going to use it, it stays on and ready to use at all times.</li>
            <li>This unit melts the wax in about 60 - 90 minutes and is very reliable.</li>
            <li>The red light went on</li>
            <li>start with a low temp and increase as you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask questions, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and does all that it says.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for the arthritis in my hands, and it really relieves the pain and swelling.</li>
            <li>I seldom take arthritis  meds because they bother me and don&#x27;t give that much relief.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Really helped my hands</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to use in about an hour or so.</li>
            <li>i have carporal tunnel and this really helps with the pain.</li>
            <li>The paraffin bath is very soothing.</li>
            <li>But, if you have RA or Raynaud&#x27;s or anything like that - I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After I was released to home therapy, I would use it and it really helped with the stiffness and pain.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always ready for a dip.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the red heater light was off.</li>
            <li>The red light which is the highest heat setting won&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This machines melts the wax fast, and does everything it promises.</li>
            <li>i really like the paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes I don&#x27;t realize I would really need the relief it provides</li>
            <li>a front is coming in and what activities I&#x27;m going to be doing really using my hands.</li>
            <li>and it is ready.  </li>
            <li>The temperature control actually works to cool the wax if the maximum temperature is too hot.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a more expensive bath without testing out the effective of this treatment method.  </li>
            <li>excellent, quality, quick delivery, not expensive, takes 90 minutes to completely melt the paraffin, soothing and moisturizing, gives relief to painful hands, i add a bit more paraffin so that it easily reaches above wrists, a bit messy</li>
            <li>So I recommend ordering more wax so you can dip past your wrist and be able to use this machine daily.  </li>
            <li>I found other, used Homedics brand baths for sale that cost more than this one did.</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to perfume scented products and will not be able to use it due to that fact.  </li>
            <li>First things first: this wax bath works exactly as advertised - it takes roughly two hours to melt the wax completely, which is fast compared to many other models, and it&#x27;s probably a good idea to turn down the heat some and wait before dipping once the wax melts.</li>
            <li>I was very happy when it arrived that my pain might finally be  eased only to find that the wax was very heavily scented rain scent,</li>
            <li>Keeps the remaining wax clean, and serves the same purpose.</li>
            <li>I really liked this one because it was small and portable and the paraffin melts fast.</li>
            <li>Once melted, and your hand is dipped, it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long, even after several dippings and with the glove, 2)</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin its REALLY nice as it helps block IN the&lt;br /&gt;moisture, leaving such a silky feeling.  </li>
            <li>so I just let the leftover wax cool and reuse it the next time.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would have done differently would have been to buy more paraffin up front as it goes fast.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and don&#x27;t even like showers that are too hot, but the wax was comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about smelly things in general.  </li>
            <li>It is still tolerable on the higher heat but may bother sensitive hands.</li>
            <li>Then I had to wait another hour or so for the wax to cool enough to \\&quot;safely\\</li>
            <li>Letting it cool longer left the wax was too solidified to dip.</li>
            <li>(It takes 1 1/2-2 hours to melt the wax &amp; then 1/2 hour to cool it to proper &amp;#34;dipping&amp;#34; temperature).  </li>
            <li>Thus far, it is too hot to use</li>
            <li>It takes two hours to melt wax and an almost equal amount of time for it to cool before it can be cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I did return this product in full and ordered a different bath.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even break up the wax, I just let it cool in the machine and then just turn the machine back on when I need it again.  </li>
            <li>..some people may like to let it cool further) and dipped both of my hands 5 times.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this product, it helps me that much.</li>
            <li>The more wax you use the less of a problem this becomes.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older unit</li>
            <li>After recent hand surgery, deep into hand therapy, I purchased this paraffin bath to provide some pain relief (ok&#x27;d by my surgeon and OTR).  </li>
            <li>Also the wax that comes with it is not enough to fill it, so I used one more extra.  </li>
            <li>The only draw back is that it takes an hour or more to melt</li>
            <li>When finished with one hand, there&#x27;s barely enough wax left to soak another hand, and this is mostly because</li>
            <li>This is an oily wax and my skin feels soft and moisturized) or the heating unit (plastic, but doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as it could be, and it&#x27;s substantial enough)  </li>
            <li>Glad that I only purchased extra paraffin and not the gloves, etc.</li>
            <li>I went back 30 more minutes later</li>
            <li>This replaced and older version.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t long enough to be able to submerse his whole size 11 foot.  </li>
            <li>Since everyone has different sensitivity to temperature (the hottest setting is very hot</li>
            <li>Big enough to easily dip a large hand so it does take up a lot of counterspace.</li>
            <li>At the highest heat (knob turned to far right), the wax completely melted in 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and for the price</li>
            <li>I highly recommend lavender scented wax beads as they seem to melt quicker.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Temperature had to stay on high setting to keep wax melted</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After leaving it on high heat for 8 hours, there was still unmelted paraffin in the unit.</li>
            <li>Instead, two plus hours before intended use, need to plug it in, and turn it to high.</li>
            <li>so I opened the package and poured that into the paraffin bath, set to high heat.  </li>
            <li>and/or didn&#x27;t have it turned to high for the melting process.</li>
            <li>With the heat still turned to high</li>
            <li>I also leave it on high all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Con: I have to leave it on high all the time.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this paraffin bath.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance and I cannot use it just like that.</li>
            <li>Melt it on high, turn it</li>
            <li>High temp is about 127 degrees.  </li>
            <li>I cut each block into 8 pieces, set all 3 lbs of wax on high and in just over 90 minutes it was all melted.</li>
            <li>After doing a little more research, I learned you cannot go \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; on these paraffin baths.</li>
            <li>I plan on saving up a little bit more money for the ThermaBath brand because it has a built in heat sensor to control the temperature</li>
            <li>I love this little toy.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly (faster than other brands) but does get too hot</li>
            <li>I will say that once the wax has melted you really need to turn it down before you put your feet and hands in, it is VERY hot!</li>
            <li>The green light stayed on which was supposed to indicate the unit was \\&quot;on\\&quot;, but the red light (which is supposed to indicate it&#x27;s heating) kept going off.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product about 6 times now and so far I don&#x27;t have any real complaints.  </li>
            <li>this product was recommended by my hand doctor and this really helps my arthritis with this soft paraffin wax.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how much you must endure and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>It keeps them soft and really helps reduce my arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li>feet are very burn sensitive.</li>
            <li>Also you&#x27;d be surprised at how much of a difference the room temperature makes at using this wax</li>
            <li>I love this and have used it a few times.</li>
            <li>I have only used this a few times, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I really like this machine however the warm up time the first time is way over an hour and the subsequent times it takes at least an hour to melt it all</li>
            <li>overall good product though a bit small.</li>
            <li>I got tired of paying a good chuck of change to have my feet done at the spa</li>
            <li>The mitts are nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>Takes 3 hours to melt the wax, then the wax is too hot to use, have to cool down.</li>
            <li>Then you have to let it cool down some as it will be too hot to stick your hand into.  </li>
            <li>: My husband told me that the unit apparently has a short which causes the heater to stop working as evidenced by the red light going off almost right away.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I would recommend if you are willing to spend extra money for more, less greasy wax, before use.</li>
            <li>My skin was slightly softer but I suspect I could get the same results by putting a moisture cream on my hands, putting plastic baggies on them, then dipping in warm water for 10 min.    </li>
            <li>bought this specifically to treat stiff joints in winter, but also love that it helps soften my chapped, over-washed hands.</li>
            <li>I had a table saw injury on my right hand last summer.</li>
            <li>I have had 2 other paraffin bath’s in my past and they all worked great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot to add that other reviewers hadn&#x27;t covered, but I did want to stress that I don&#x27;t think the length of time required to melt the wax is a huge deterrent.</li>
            <li>associated with it that makes it not very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Shame on Revlon for selling a product that doesn&#x27;t live up the</li>
            <li>the new unit performs well, I&#x27;ll retract some of the things I&#x27;ve said, but I think my chance&#x27;s are not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>we got the new unit today.</li>
            <li>It worked for almost a year and then had to be replaced because the lights didn&#x27;t stay on, but the company sent me a brand new one (including the wax) when I called within the year warranty.</li>
            <li>Is it because we live at 6,000&#x27;?</li>
            <li>Ended up ordering new paraffin and am happier.</li>
            <li>the wait time for a new melting is not objectionable.</li>
            <li>It works well now, but it was a hassle for 3 days trying to figure out the issue and fix it, when it was supposed to be brand new.</li>
            <li>READY TO USE FAST ENOUGH.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not a problem to keep warm for a few hours to use later in the day.  </li>
            <li>You will need to invest in more wax pretty quickly but definitely helping my very dry hands during this harsh winter.</li>
            <li>Dry skin and cracks are quickly healed and hands / feet feel so very soft.</li>
            <li>the skin is very soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>For a person who is very sensitive to smells (migraines, asthma)</li>
            <li>In certain times of the year my hands get very dry and despite using lotion constantly they do not seem to get enough moisture to make them feel or look healthy.</li>
            <li>Its hot enough to use immediately if you can dip your finger and it feels tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how hot you like the wax, it is possible to use it after 1.5 hours.    </li>
            <li>I thought the temperature was too hot at Revlon&#x27;s setting of 125 degrees, but I checked online, and this is standard for paraffin baths.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands feel soft and helps to take the knuckle pain away!</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter couldn&#x27;t dip her hands at all, it was just too hot.</li>
            <li>But boy were my hands and feet soft!</li>
            <li>and they were SO soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>and my hands are so soft as are my cuticles!</li>
            <li>The first one did not work properly, I phoned Amazon, they sent me a return postage label, and sent me another Paraffin Bath.  </li>
            <li>A previous device from HomeMedics worked fine until i wore it out.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect is the temperature, feel a bit too hot to my hands.</li>
            <li>Future uses will be with unit on cardboard on the floor to protect against splashing, and maybe another 1/2 pound of wax to get it deep enough for the top of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a professional quality  Parafin bath!</li>
            <li>Then when it was finally all melted I stuck the tip of my finger in and realized it was scalding hot.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as low as it would go.</li>
            <li>That might have something to do with the fact that the heat source is exclusively from the bottom (which I can&#x27;t seriously imagine being the issue), or that might have to do with the fact that I am yet to figure out how to cover the wax on any non-limb so that it retains the heat better (which I suspect is the real issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The important piece is to melt the wax and then turn the temp down for 1/2 hr before immersing your hands or feet in the wax.</li>
            <li>then you have to turn down the heat before you use it and wait for a comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li>It has to be on high heat to melt then you have to turn it down and let the wax cool before you can use it.</li>
            <li>I actually have to leave it for several hours to get the full melt.</li>
            <li>Arrived fine, box a little ripped up but not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li>and this is a wonderful winter afternoon relaxation treat, and much less expensive than going to the nail salon or spa.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I fractured two bones in the top of my hand and after surgery my fingers were very stiff and sore.</li>
            <li>it takes a couple of hours for the paraffin wax to warm up -- but as long as you give yourself time and make sure to use it at least a few times a week -- - it does seem to help my hands</li>
            <li>NO mess with  this one!   </li>
            <li>if I have to wait for the right temperature FOR ME, a film is already forming on the top (i.e. the wax is starting to solidify a bit), which is not good, because then you have pieces hanging from your hands/feet.</li>
            <li>I do not have big hands or big feet, but neither could fit into this small unit comfortably and completely cover my hand or foot.</li>
            <li>It is really hot at first but as instructed, I left it cooler for a little more than a half hour</li>
            <li>It is also large enough to dip my feet in.</li>
            <li>I do not have overly large hands, only 7 inches from heel of palm to fingertips.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to dip each foot in.  </li>
            <li>But as my whole house filled with an intense perfume I was forced to get the wax unit out of my house!</li>
            <li>It actually heated a little faster than most.</li>
            <li>My elbows tend to get quite rough, but even days later they feel as smooth as silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Experiment is a success and I will continue to use this machine until it no longer works before considering the more expensive Therabath product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, but if you have the money, get the professional</li>
            <li>This product was a complete bust.  </li>
            <li>I broke up the parffin and it melted COMPLETELY in about 90 minutes....</li>
            <li>makes my hands sooo soft</li>
            <li>I decided to do something preventive, but so far no leaks with&lt;br /&gt;mine</li>
            <li>My hands are considerably softer after use.</li>
            <li>Helps relieve the pain of surgery in both hands and as a bonus makes them as soft as a baby&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>Bowel for the paraffin is not very deep, does not cover much of the foot, even with 3 lbs of paraffin.  </li>
            <li>her is professional and this one works just as well.</li>
            <li>My hands were soft after and soothed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any man who has a wife that likes trying to get her skin soft here</li>
            <li>I was hesitant since so many people complained about the unit not heating and melting the paraffin for hours, but it took 2 hrs like it</li>
            <li>so one can dip the hands without getting too near the element.</li>
            <li>The mineral oil leaves the hands soft and supple and it assists with removing the wax after a treatment.</li>
            <li>(she had it early too), so I bought</li>
            <li>I have used it 3x&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li>w/the machine are placed directly into the container (no liners of any sort).  </li>
            <li>So far, I added 3lbs of Gulf Wax to the bath, in addition to the 3lbs of scented wax that comes with it and can dip my hand deeper to have my wrists in too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I put the lid on and every two hours I would go back into the bathroom and check to see if it was ready.  </li>
            <li>So far used it 3 times</li>
            <li>The drawback is that it actually takes hours (at laest 3 sometimes 4 for the wax to melt depending on how much is in the container.</li>
            <li>also it keeps you hands soft.</li>
            <li>It took about 100 minutes until the wax to be melted completely.</li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon.</li>
            <li>Because of my conditions my skin is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li>The green power light was still on.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands soft and takes the pain away</li>
            <li>Was a present for my Mom, she says she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Just a few concerns - don&#x27;t like the smell of the wax and was glad I had ordered extra Gigi Vanilla wax.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend who said it was really good, but not completely perfect.  </li>
            <li>I received my paraffin bath yesterday and was very excited about pampering myself after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li>And after I turn the dial down so it can cool off a bit,</li>
            <li>It takes 2+ hours for the wax to melt then maybe 1 hour for it to safely cool down to use.</li>
            <li>Cool down about an hour.</li>
            <li>I mean it just fits, if your door is bigger than that you might have to scrunch your toes and do some fancy bending to get the whole thing in, but other than that this little guy is just awesome.</li>
            <li>I was right in middle, but it gets hotter now and I am only two clicks from lowest setting.</li>
            <li>And because I like things really hot, I did not find the high setting to be extreme.  </li>
            <li>The paraffin supplied was enough for one filling, and the internal design did not seem to allow all of the paraffin to melt - there would be areas on the top that did not fully melt down.</li>
            <li>Also too messy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is a bit small but it works fine.</li>
            <li>Actually, longer, because several times it has been too hot.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I thought it should, and after the initial wax melting, it only takes about 2 hrs to remelt the wax.  </li>
            <li>half an hour later I can use it and enjoy a relaxing moment.</li>
            <li>Also, after reading some of the reviews about how long it takes to heat up the wax I decided to heat it fast on the stove, then transferred it into the bath.</li>
            <li>I find soaking my hands in the morning is the most beneficial, as they tend to be most stiff and painful first thing when I wake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works to soften dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li>The paraffin contains oils and once the paraffin is removed, you rub the oils into your hands and it really helps the dry skin.  </li>
            <li>if you use it on a regular daily basis, or else have the maid get it ready for you.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it takes a pretty long time to heat up the wax.</li>
            <li>I got a few quick dips in but because my hand was in a fist, the wax started cracking off before I could shove my hand into the plastic liner.</li>
            <li>You do need to plan a heads bit as it takes 2hrs to heat up and 20-30min to cool down enough to not scald you when you dip your hands.</li>
            <li>And shame on Amazon for carrying a product that has major</li>
            <li>Thete&#x27;s no other way to say it.  </li>
            <li>Reusing the same wax with a little mineral oil, the original wax blocks have lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li>For me, the wax melts after about an hour and a half and then is cool enough to use after about 2.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical because of other reviews but this is great.</li>
            <li>It is slow to melt, but once you learn to plan ahead it is fine.</li>
            <li>During the winter months, my hands get very dry and very sore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for my experience: How long it takes for the wax to melt obviously corresponds to how much wax you place in the tub.</li>
            <li>I could BARELY read them.  </li>
            <li>My mother is 86 years old and has problems with her hands including recent surgery.  </li>
            <li>Big enough to get my whole hand with fingers open and up to my wrist.  </li>
            <li>Trying to get the 2nd hand in the liner meant completely cracking the wax on the 1st hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li>I moved the control to the far left, lowest&lt;br /&gt;setting and waited.  </li>
            <li>We have no regrets about buying this unit one month after purchase.  </li>
            <li>Only couple times, it will make your skin soft and shiny looking ( i would say it depends your skin condition tho)</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife from Amazon, arrived early with the solid paraffin pieces.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I could barely get the plastic sleeves on, let alone trying to get the mitts on as well.</li>
            <li>When I got this, I would say it worked as expected and really helped my arthritis and my skin.  </li>
            <li>my entire adult  life,  </li>
            <li>So, this little machine is my saving grace right now.</li>
            <li>The hottest temp, while hot, did not burn my skin, but you can dial it down to a lower temp before use.</li>
            <li>Filling it for the first time, I accidentally put a small amount of one package of the supplied wax, before I was overwhelmed with the scent and filled it with the plain</li>
            <li>But right now, I&#x27;m hoping that Amazon will let me return this unit because it&#x27;s simply not useful enough.</li>
            <li>The paraffin feels great on the sick and softens it well.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and bought this Paraffin bath but am very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>It takes a very long to melt the wax and it is very hot, despite my turning it way down.</li>
            <li>Although it has not seemed to have much effect on the cracks, my hands are softer and doing this late at night before going to bed is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>She had the same item since the early 1980&#x27;s and it finally gave out so</li>
            <li>If and when I get the money, I will splurge on the more expensive unit that Amazon offers.</li>
            <li>When I turn it down the wax solidifies and it is still too hot to use underneath the solid layer.</li>
            <li>paraffin melts fairly quickly especially after the first melt down so</li>
            <li>It takes a little while to melt all the wax the first time and after letting the wax hardened, about 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>My first attention made my little finger feel</li>
            <li>My other issue was that if it had worked, the amount of wax provided with the appliance was barely enough to cover my large hands.</li>
            <li>Early arthritis runs in my family, but words can&#x27;t really express how devastated I was to find my fingers stiff and aching at 35.  </li>
            <li>The process is  a little messy, the  next time should be better.</li>
            <li>A little hard to get heated up and then adjusted to the right temperature, but so worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Apparently there was some cable that was not doing proper contact</li>
            <li>It is now too late to return for full refund</li>
            <li>The heater is slow to respond when turning on to full heat.. takes over 2 hours to heat up once it cools off .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>A few dips in some hot paraffin has really helped cut down on the pain.</li>
            <li>heats up fast, so it can be used in less time</li>
            <li>and then I wrap her feet in soft towels to hold the heat for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>: I have talked to people who complained that the wax their unit evaporated quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit tricky to put your second hand in the mitt once you&#x27;re already wearing one on your first, but even without someone around to help it&#x27;s definitely feasible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unscented wax that I ordered comes in tiny little balls, easier to melt than a large chunk that came with the machine.  </li>
            <li>THe unit is large, but it&#x27;s narrow shape allows me to tuck it into the cabinet under my sink.  </li>
            <li>If you move the unit slightly, the red light goes back on but goes off a few minutes later.</li>
            <li>Takes about an hour to melt the wax at the high temp, but I think that is about average.</li>
            <li>although my large feet did not fit as well, however smaller feet would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried moving around a little and ended up splashing wax over the side, which will be a bit of a mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li>The wax smells bad but it is otherwise a good product.</li>

            <li> The paraffin wax helps a good bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> It felt soo good</li>
            <li> Good luck to anyone who buys this machine.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good idea but don&#x27;t like to wait for hours for it to heat.</li>
            <li> that was good.</li>
            <li> As a plus, I will say the paraffin felt good on the hands</li>
            <li> A good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> she loved it arrived in 2 days</li>
            <li> This is the highest rated paraffin machine under $50 and after reading the reviews it seems like a good and inexpensive test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> I had it for 3 days and loved it until I saw wax beneath it and on the edge of the counter...</li>
            <li> Not as good wax coating.  </li>
            <li> It feels so good and helps my Wrist flexibility.</li>
            <li> but it feels good.</li>
            <li> It smells so good.</li>
            <li> Good for home use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> We manage but an xlg length would be good, even for me.</li>
            <li> The shipping was onetime.the price was good.</li>
            <li> Of my goodness it feels so good</li>
            <li> I have used this with one of my friends who has arthritis and she loved it as well.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a good amount of wax and bags and the mits.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  </li>
            <li> oh so good after the bath.</li>
            <li> paraffin it comes with is really good</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> In addition the good affects of the heat therapy I have also found using the paraffin bath is helpful in moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> i tried it once, packaged it up and will donate it to Good Will.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT still a good bargain</li>
            <li> Adding mineral oil helps the wax to peel away from your skin, wash with soap and water and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product, I love this!!!!</li>
            <li> It is just wonderful and not being in constant pain is the best.</li>
            <li> very good product I recommend to everyone, very good and affordable price, high quality, never regret,good,good,good,good</li>
            <li> I am very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase experience, delivery and product.</li>
            <li> A great value also :)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Huge waist of time and money!!</li>
            <li> My hands are already feeling better!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Three women are very happy now that we had a family hand spa Hot Parafin Wax day.  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely paraffin bath!</li>
            <li> I just love it smell!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Used with my favorite lotion, it gives me softness!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The paraffin bath was easy to use, paraffin that came with the bath melted easily, it was a wonderful experience.</li>
            <li> while this bath is great for dipping, it&#x27;s not so easy to use for painting the wax with a brush onto an area of the body, like a shoulder.</li>
            <li> Great product works just fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> The soothing heat is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it looks nice too sitting on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I also liked all the extras the plastic bags and mitts.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it and it made me feel good.</li>
            <li> The wax provided has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> I have to kind of dip my heels then my toes.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> At the end of the three hours, the machine was not even warm.  </li>
            <li> otherwise this is just as nice as the spa ones.  </li>
            <li> So I would ask at a salon where you&#x27;ve had it done, what kind do they use and order that.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it stops heating on its own.   </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s warm, but it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> If you are looking mostly for moisturizing benefits from the parrafin, I recommend putting a good lotion on before you dip in the wax.  </li>
            <li> All items I have ordered from Amazon have been shipped very timely &amp; the products have been excellent.</li>
            <li> Good product, I love it.</li>
            <li> to let you know the kit comes with its own wax because it have lanoline in it, this stops the wax from burning the skin.</li>
            <li> Also, leave a nice fragrance in your skin.</li>
            <li> looked like it had been used and whoever repacked it did not so nice a repacking job.  </li>
            <li> this was the best bday gift ive ever gotten myself and i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice,  well-designed product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this as a nice gift for some one.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it for myself it seemed kind of frivolous</li>
            <li> Quite nice.</li>
            <li> but it really does, I&#x27;m very happy that I got this!!</li>
            <li> It is spectacular.</li>
            <li> (The plastic safety tray at the bottom of the unit is also a nice added safety measure.)</li>
            <li> AND IT WARMS AND SOFTENS THE HANDS NICELY.</li>
            <li> Nice size.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the adjustable temperature settings.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact that you can keep it on warm.  </li>
            <li> : Nice looking, the heat control thermostat works.</li>
            <li> this hand paraffin bath warms your hands nicely.  </li>
            <li> Not as effective as paraffin in a salon.</li>
            <li> At PT they used to use heated towels to keep your hands warm after the wax bath.  </li>
            <li> Really nice if you have severe arthritis.</li>
            <li> My friend is still thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really my own need to plan to use it when the weather is changing/</li>
            <li> I put my hands in the warm wax and then the plastic gloves</li>
            <li> The product works great, everything you need was included in the original box.</li>
            <li> This product has been great no leaks but does take the full two hours to warm up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and after all my research I think this is the best home unit out there.</li>
            <li> I just love this product it is easy to use and feels great when you put it on sore hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of Revlon&#x27;s Paraffin Bath and very pleased with the purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The new one seems to work perfectly, my doctor recommended I get one for pain I have in my hands</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> : The paraffin that came with it has very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> but once it is melted, it is very easy.</li>
            <li> The wax felt good and the gloves fit my husband as did the bath.</li>
            <li> The hotter the wax is when you dip, the more heat the wax retains and the longer your hands/feet stay warm.</li>
            <li> not to mention more cost effective.  </li>
            <li> WOW did it feel great!</li>
            <li> early, works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Plus makes my hands so silky and smooth great product and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Worked great right out of the box.</li>
            <li> You do have to plan ahead for using it, as it takes a good two hours for the wax to heat up, but it is well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> easy to manage temps, love the heat on my achy hands!</li>
            <li> No problem with it being too hot and the mits are a great addition to the kit</li>
            <li> Love it, heats up fast and makes your feet and hands feel oh, so good!</li>
            <li> It works just fine though!</li>
            <li> The feeling is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> would prefer unscented or a very light scent.</li>
            <li> It heated very quickly and I have it set to stay warm all the time, so I can use it after and exertion of my hands.</li>
            <li> but since this was my first time to use a warm wax machine, thought it was wise to do this.  </li>
            <li> So now I can enjoy from my home when I want and know that it is clean and safe!!</li>
            <li> This device does a great job at a very decent price.</li>
            <li> I love getting paraffin at the salon,</li>
            <li> When I read many reviews they seem to be talking about &amp;</li>
            <li> I liked it, but if someone can make on where the wax is not scented or lightly scented.</li>
            <li> I bought my Revlon Paraffin Bath several months ago and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> My hands feel better than ever now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s okay to leave it on the lowest setting all the time</li>
            <li> ok, more of a safety feature I suppose.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> Love that the liners and mits come included.  </li>
            <li> I am sure the $100</li>
            <li> After just 2 treatments with the hot wax (you dip hand in 5 times when wax is comfortably warm, make a fist, wrap in saran wrap for 15 minutes, remove wrap and wax and start bending your fingers)I can now move and bend both fingers with ease!</li>
            <li> , I think you can do your hands and feet twice, before you have to add more wax, because the level would be too low.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The combination of a nice body scrub and this product equals smooth heaven.  </li>
            <li> or my daughters, guess it was cheap insurance anyway!  </li>
            <li> Love how this paraffin dip helps my hands.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this parafin warmer, but it just isn&#x27;t a quality product, and I absolutely love Revlon products, and that&#x27;s why it saddens me to say it, but it misses the mark.  </li>
            <li> satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I love it, it can just in time for my birthday.</li>
            <li> It sure makes my hands feel silky and helps ease the arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> I returned it and am looking to buy another brand to see if it will work better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product so I can safe money going to the spa...</li>
            <li> Works as instructed and smells subtly lovely.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> This wax treatment helps me to get through my exercises with more movement.</li>
            <li> We tried it 2 more times-over</li>
            <li> My skin looks to much better and relive my pains in my hands  for my arthritis.</li>
            <li> Also, I love that it came with all the things you need to get started.</li>
            <li> they were soft and felt incredible.  </li>
            <li> she left it out for all of us to dip our hand and it does wonder for arthritis wonderful when i can</li>
            <li> love love love it</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Why pay more?</li>
            <li> but I am so glad to have it now.  </li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t get more that two dips with out my hand touching the bottom of the vessel.  </li>
            <li> but it was able to do what i bought it for.  </li>
            <li> , glad I did.</li>
            <li> My wife was so pleased with hers, we order of one for a friend.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The product more than met my expectations,  Everything needed to get started is included with the paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> There are some days when they ache and burn more than others.  </li>
            <li> I love it for my carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for therapeutic reasons more than cosmetic.  </li>
            <li> (Smooth!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> You MUST read the direction to be sure you don&#x27;t hurt yourself.  </li>
            <li> still it was ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if she would like it or not, so I took a gamble.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy yours!</li>
            <li> All in all we&#x27;re pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Brought one at BBand Beyond, but like this one much better.  </li>
            <li> Top fits better and heats well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would handle more.</li>
            <li> I regret not purchasing a better brand/model.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> If they gave you more to start...</li>
            <li> So if you buy this..do so knowing you will need more wax, immediately.</li>
            <li> I imagine if you wanted to thoroughly coat them up to and including your wrist you&#x27;d need more wax.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MOISTURE</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews on Amazon and decided this may work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I know you are not suppose to leave these on for more than an hour or two before and after use</li>
            <li> Will try &amp; find a better one.</li>
            <li> , however most items these days do not allow that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I am very pleasantly satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have three or more lbs.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of using it.  </li>
            <li> The bath makes me take the time to get off my feet and take better care of myself.</li>
            <li> It seems to be much better constructed than the Homedics unit.</li>
            <li> use it as many times I want .</li>
            <li> It is every convenient to be able to do a paraffin hand and foot treatment at home...</li>
            <li> That is the one reason I don&#x27;t use it more than I do.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and the smoothness of your hands afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are very strait forward and the paraffin provided smells great</li>
            <li> Otherwise, love this product.</li>
            <li> Takes about 1 hour to 1-1/2 hours for the wax to melt completely, so be sure to plan ahead.  </li>
            <li> I use this almost every night, and my hands have never been in better shape at this point in the winter season.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say than the title.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This is more of a 2 person job than anything else.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more to like?</li>
            <li> This takes more than a hour to heat and melt wax</li>
            <li> and she love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t I love this product?</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not that big of a selection and this one looked the best.</li>
            <li> The machine comes with a huge block of wax that you turn it on and warm it up to your desired temp.</li>
            <li> I love this paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> I assumed a $40 dollar paraffin bath would do better than some cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> and it was much more bearable.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But I do love the soothing heat and the way it makes your hands look after use.  </li>
            <li> so I added more.</li>
            <li> I have been quite pleased with this paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> and it comes with a plastic cover that keeps you from touching the metal.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this  my hands feel better then ever before</li>
            <li> However if you preplanned and gave yourself enough time then this is the best!</li>
            <li> I wish it came with 2 more bars of wax to fill it more</li>
            <li> you are looking for a once-in-a-while experience, I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love it for arthritic thumb joint.  </li>
            <li> They are extras in many baths at 4 times the price.</li>
            <li> The wax that is included is kinda fragrant for my taste, but still pleasant, although I think adding another pound or two of was will give you a fuller tub, so your hand does not touch the metal hot bottom.</li>
            <li> She was very excited that it came with all the extras like disposable plastic gloves etc.</li>
            <li> and you will have beautiful, soft feet.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind scents it is fine, but for me that is a very important part of the product which should be part of the description.</li>
            <li> Unit works great but wish it were just a bit longer to fit whole foot inside with out rubbing was off heel.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution for dry weathered feet.  </li>
            <li> is exactly as described, does a good job and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Buy 2 or 3 pounds more wax though and canning wax works fine.</li>
            <li> The hardened wax peels off easily and has a mild, nice scent.</li>
            <li> My hands feel great when dipping,leaves hands  soft and oily so rub in oil.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> believe most wax treatments are comfortable at about 125F.</li>
            <li> and my feet are so soft and look great.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and as expected.</li>
            <li> Buy it, love it, enjoy it.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GOOD AND MELTS FAST THE PARAFFIN</li>
            <li> Enjoy the quick warm  up time.  </li>
            <li> Great product super fast delivery Thank you</li>
            <li> It fits better on the countertop and my hands fit just fine.</li>
            <li> To all future buyers GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, wax heats in about 1 1/2 hrs (as advertised).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy...</li>
            <li> It was also easy to use amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and melts the wax in the timely manner as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> it was very,very easy..</li>
            <li> and it did peel off easily.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> Easily 5</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but if you leave it plugged in and on warm it&#x27;s always ready when you need or want it :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This one was very quick.  </li>
            <li> mine was very quick, no problem.  </li>
            <li> The scent was too strong and I have allergies.</li>
            <li> A couple reviews mentioned how objectionally strongly the supplied wax smells.</li>
            <li> Again, because of the many positive reviews and low price, I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived as promised and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much but the instructions were unclear about what to do with the plastic grate</li>
            <li> I love it, makes my hands and feet feel so smooth and really gives you a spa feel in your own home.</li>
            <li> In this way I am able to reuse the paraffin - it is encased between the bags, which protect my hands from the full temperature.  </li>
            <li> I soften my hands in warm water first, then slather with Gold Bond Healing Hand Cream.</li>
            <li> in fact i turned my unit down to the \\&quot;keep warm\\&quot; temp and it was the perfect temp at the 2 hour mark.  </li>
            <li> It is also very good for dry and cracking skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> However, once melted it was fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to move from one area of the house to another.</li>
            <li> The temperature was fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Works fine, no problems</li>
            <li> This looks fine on a kitchen cabinet.</li>
            <li> The wax heats even more quickly than the instructions suggested, though I imagine that may vary.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Revlon Moisturestay Quick Heat up Bath.</li>
            <li> If you lead an active lifestyle using your hands for gripping weights, or doing the pull up bar, this bath is perfect for adding the right amount of therapy for your hands after a tiring workout.  </li>
            <li> and if I attempt deeper submersion, I am touching a very hot bottom of the container.  </li>
            <li> the heat feels great on my hands and they feel super soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Working fine so far I gave it 4 stars for all the accessories it came with it plus the wax is good</li>
            <li> My cuticles were cracking and my hands stopped feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Now we don&#x27;t have to go to nail salon to enjoy that feeling of pampering again.</li>
            <li> And they fit well in the plastic bags provided.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> This unit is cheap.  </li>
            <li> Pull the opening of the bag over your wrist then twist and secure.  </li>
            <li> clean, nice-smelling, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this paraffin bath and appreciate the gloves that come with it.  </li>
            <li> wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax I&#x27;m using is now lightly scented, not too objectionable, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose it.</li>
            <li> I fee this huge sigh of relief to be ache free and know that it&#x27;s not a lost cause.  </li>
            <li> Hmm, doesn&#x27;t sound \\&quot;quick\\&quot; to me.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.  </li>
            <li> This is realoy cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap looking but works.</li>
            <li> - (they just fit) but plan to.  </li>
            <li> I turned it on and the wax melted and it worked great, then I tried to use it again the next day but the wax wouldn&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li> This paraffin bath was securely packaged for shipping without using an excess of packing material.  </li>
            <li> I have had several hand surgeries and sometimes my hands just aren&#x27;t happy, so I use this for heat therapy.  </li>
            <li> Great personal pamper me gift</li>
            <li> You can probably get much cheaper wax and add your own oils if you like to save money.</li>
            <li> honestly this is such a nice splurge for anyone...male or&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It does take a while for the wax to melt and one needs to test the wax before dipping your entire hand in it, but it works very well and makes my arthritic hands feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> OK product, didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would for my hands but the machine itself works good, next i will try my feet.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to see if it would help with my husband&#x27;s arthritis (which it has), but I find myself using it more than he does!  </li>
            <li> That being said, it is very useful to help loosen and lower pain in hands.</li>
            <li> The paraffin stays very hot requiring very quick dips into it.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wasn&#x27;t super happy about</li>
            <li> YEs, it takes a while to heat up the paraffin, but the wait is worth it!</li>
            <li> There was NOT a bad odor when it was melting or after it melt, although it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li> I heat my hand up with the hot wax and it helps me move my fingers a lot better.</li>
            <li> First let me say I love having this for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as an exchange gift  but received one as a gift.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have the original box.</li>
            <li> They should just have something built in to prevent you from touching the hot bottom while its on.</li>
            <li> Make sure wax is not too hot.</li>
            <li> ( I ordered more) there is a warmer switch to hot switch-</li>
            <li> and I found it to be not user friendly.  </li>
            <li> Sure it takes a while to heat up, but it&#x27;s not like you paid $200 or more for a professional wax dip.</li>
            <li> you would have to melt the wax to clean it out.</li>
            <li> Works great, use on my husband who has severely dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> However, it took 2 days of heating then melting to clean it up to return.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s Day gift or birthday gift for that someone special.</li>
            <li> In order to melt the wax quicker, I placed a folded towel in a large pot with lukewarm water and placed the 3lbs of wax on top of the towel over medium heat.  </li>
            <li> It feels like a really special treat when we get it out</li>
            <li> Also, a special benefit to the bath is the softness that comes after you peel the wax off your hands.</li>
            <li> Which is not practical, specially if you forget and wait too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also hard to adjust the heat,but for the price I feel I got a great buy!!</li>
            <li> but the return process was super easy and the replacement was shipped and delivered right away.</li>
            <li> However, knowing that, you can turn it on when you go out to work in the yard or when you get home from work and have it ready when you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked mine, which I bought locally, so much that I bought one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s day, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> But now I can happily say it is much better than the old larger model.</li>
            <li> This melts the wax fast and gets it nice and hot for wax play.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for in home use, and much cheaper than going to a spa!</li>
            <li> I have hurt the joints in my hand and this really makes it feel better.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, and this warmer has been turned on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; for three days straight 24/7, and the three pounds of parafin STILL hasn&#x27;t melted for me to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I turned this to full power and melted wax in under 2 hours .</li>
            <li> i use the cool setting when i keep the machine on for a couple days so that way when i want to use it</li>
            <li> Take care to unplug the unit and give it a moment to cool a bit before putting your hand into the wax.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would help that much</li>
            <li> feel like commenting on the melting time (slow) or the scent (NICE!!!</li>
            <li> I waited another 30 mins for it to cool</li>
            <li> it cool for a bit before using.</li>
            <li> I returned the Revlon bath and got a full refund.</li>
            <li> One good feature of the smaller Revlon unit is the variable thermostat to continuously control the warmth of the reservoir.</li>
            <li> works good, it only took one hour not two like it said</li>
            <li> Then cool the wax for 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li> A great gift for anyone who loves beautiful hands or suffers from arthritis.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great for me as the temperature settings are just right and the wax does not take long at all to melt.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The wax gets just the right temperature for me.  </li>
            <li> You have to be available at the right time to use it.  </li>
            <li> This hot wax bath is easy to use and is helpful in easing the pain in my arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li> The wax that comes with the unit is perfumed and seems pretty strong to me</li>
            <li> I am satisfied that the unit can stay hot enough to keep the wax melted and at a good hot temperature but the amount of wax shipped with the unit was inadequate.</li>
            <li> This machine works well and comes adequately equipped with all of the supplies needed to enjoy it right out of the box.</li>
            <li> once completely hot,, does a good job on covering my right hand , which has developed arthritis.</li>
            <li> Moisturestay Quick Heat Paraffin Bath]]</li>
            <li> I got my Revlon Quick Bath and heated it immediately with the 3 LBs.</li>
            <li> the included hand mitts are a super addition.</li>
            <li> I purchased this \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot; paraffin bath to try to help relieve some pain in my hand and wrist.  </li>
            <li> The brochure said the wax would melt in about 2 hours (quick?), but I gave up after 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to be kidding me about selling this unit as a \\&quot;Quick</li>
            <li> and I received this unit quickly</li>
            <li> My hands felt so nice and cozy with the liners and warm mits.  </li>
            <li> and then it hardened quickly when you unplud it.</li>
            <li> Revlon RVSP3501B1 Moisturestay Quick Heat Paraffin Bath</li>
            <li> The red light goes on and off spontaneously and it takes forever to melt the wax...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they would call it \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The mitts are adequate.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly.</li>
            <li> STAY QUICK HEAT PARAFFIN BATH.</li>
            <li> I Would recommend super product.</li>
            <li> melts quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommand to you :)</li>
            <li> I used it again next day and it was just fine!!</li>
            <li> It was a HUGE hit, one of the first things out of the box and immediately plugged in.  </li>
            <li> Almost all wax is gone from the very first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, no matter the setting</li>
            <li> it is very hot because it can burn.</li>
            <li> You must use this at a very hot temperature in order to have usable wax.</li>
            <li> The device does not get the paraffin very hot.  </li>
            <li> Did not get warm like it should wax barely melted, Was</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the number of accessories this comes with as it allows me to test out the machine immediately after open box.  </li>
            <li> The wax gets very hot even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Warm\\&quot; setting is too hot to comfortably dip into.</li>
            <li> I have used this Revlon product several times since purchase and have been very pleased with results.</li>
            <li> It is very hot if you don&#x27;t follow them to the letter.</li>
            <li> (wax was very hot</li>
            <li> This paraffin bath is just the right thing to keep her skin soft and smooth and make her hands feel better.  </li>
            <li> Even on high it won&#x27;t burn you to use it and the heat actually feels great soaking into your hands.</li>
            <li> I just hope the new wax will be better quality.</li>
            <li> I love my new Revlon brand.</li>
            <li> I even waited a good 5 hr’s on the first day and 9 hr’s on the second day.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;d done my share of jam-making as a child, I melted the paraffin on the stove for the first time (do NOT do this unless you know what you are doing!</li>
            <li> It gets so hot it burns your hands!</li>
            <li> and it was very well recieved!!  </li>
            <li> It was almost unbearably hot!</li>
            <li> Fast shipper!!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the wax melts right away.  </li>
            <li> I now see why most people say how the old paraffin bath’s worked much better then these new cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> In general it was easy to set up and the directions were easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were very helpful and accurate.  </li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy your purchase as much as I did.  </li>
            <li> BUT well worth it when u know ahead of time</li>
            <li> it makes your hands/fingers/cuticles soft and hydrated better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used ever.  </li>
            <li> So far used it 10 times - love it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered different kind to try something else.</li>
            <li> This is more for a young child</li>
            <li> I wish I had spent a bit more money for a better piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I dipped in the warm wax five times and kept the liners and mits on for about ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> but the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li> Shape is nice; allows me to get my entire hand in for therapy.</li>
            <li> If it were local I would honestly return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> All in all, an inexpensive and not too useful product.</li>
            <li> Some of the downsides are inherent to melting wax--you have to plan about 2- 2 1/2 hours ahead when you want to use the paraffin bath, but it melts considerably faster than most of the home products on the market.  </li>
            <li> It will take awhile to heat up (2-3 hours), so completely spontaneous use is not really possible.</li>
            <li> Takes two hours to head the wax, but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The only barrier preventing me from giving this unit a 5-star review is the amount of time it takes to warm up.</li>
            <li> Give yourself about an hour if it&#x27;s pretty full of wax.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it once the bags come off.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> It seems to take what feels like all day to heat up and melt the wax, but its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> BUT, WORTH THE WAIT.</li>
            <li> Will buy again and its useful.  </li>
            <li> It heats up in the time described and it does get hot, but you let it cool off,  as described in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> This is a fun way to soften your hands at home.</li>
            <li> I could see someone who is healthy and just wants to do a spa treatment might really like this.</li>
            <li> I bought this paraffin bath because I used one at physical therapy to warm up my hand before exercises after hand surgery for a severed tendon.  </li>
            <li> maximum paraffin level mark on the bath would be useful</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin soft and also the joint pains just melt away.</li>
            <li> so it was a five star success.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new paraffin bath very much.</li>
            <li> I unplugged it and let it cool some more so that I could very quickly dip my hands several times and put them in the mitts, but it really provided no arthritis relief using it that way.  </li>
            <li> There are other companies out there who make Paraffin Bath&#x27;s but most take more than 6 hours to melt the wax.    </li>
            <li> Heats up pretty quick, i like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who is ready and willing to buy professional grade products if I can&#x27;t find a recreational type of sufficient quality.</li>
            <li> When you first place your hand in the bath it seems very hot.</li>
            <li> Also was surprised it takes so long to warm up, so I leave it plugged in most of the time.  </li>
            <li> however it takes a LONG time for the wax to melt, like more than an hour!</li>
            <li> Just time it right for when you know you&#x27;re going to use it, and stop complaining.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the price is right and it works.  </li>
            <li> it melted right away.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size for home use.</li>
            <li> so I just turned the dial all the way to the right where it says melt.</li>
            <li> I wish the warmer setting would keep it warm enough that it stayed melted but not to hot to be used.</li>
            <li> (it protects the body part from the heat source) &amp; stays there until you are ready to clean the machine (</li>
            <li> Basically it has two temperatures: \\&quot;scalding hot liquid wax\\&quot; or \\&quot;warm solid wax\\&quot;... Unusable either way.</li>
            <li> you just really need to plan ahead and be prepared for some clean up with wax pieces.  </li>
            <li> First use today and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> It takes quite some time to warm enough to melt the wax then seems too hot</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry and very dry hands.</li>
            <li> The Revlon hand wax bath is perfect for dry, rough hands or feet.  </li>
            <li> I had owned a couple different brands previous to this, and I think this has the best construction, ease of use and customizable heat settings of any of them!</li>
            <li> although the wax slowly melts, once list applies easily and has good smell.</li>
            <li> It does take about 2 hours to heat first thing in the morning, however it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I take the lid off to cool (and turn on \\&quot;warm\\&quot;) and it&#x27;s ready in the suggested 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> Takes a long while to warm up, like 3 hours, but it works well.  </li>
            <li> you need to allow about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the wax to melt and a good 30 minutes to turn the temp down</li>
            <li> This works well, except it needs a little more wax to cover up to the wrist, so I&#x27;ve ordered more wax.  </li>
            <li> I would recomend the unit however you will need to invest a little more money to get the better wax from another source.</li>
            <li> but my hands stay warm for a long time after using this (yay !)</li>
            <li> Price is right and delivery was fast!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to try anything to help with the pain, so I ordered one right away.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice now, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll still have to figure out how to keep the wax warm while its hardening but even if you use nothing at all and just dip and re-dip and wait to dry...</li>
            <li> The only light that came on ever was the power light</li>
            <li> So nice to have this during the winter for dry hands and feet</li>
            <li> In my experience with it the paraffin when completely full it takes about an hour to completely melt (that&#x27;s not bad at all).</li>
            <li> If you have the plastic protector (included part) in the bath, you should have nothing to worry about except a bit of tingling pain if you dip while the wax is too hot (fair warning: I have a high tolerance for pain, especially from heat, but I&#x27;m pretty sure my skin would burn at the same temperature as everyone else&#x27;s), but I haven&#x27;t even come close to burning myself.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;sessions are complete and need to use my parafin bath,I notice that the power, and the heat light comes on, the wax melted, but the light gages doesn&#x27;t comes on ,it just keeps the high hot temperature.</li>
            <li> It made hands very smooth, especially after i did it twice.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but the length of time that it takes to melt the paraffin is a VERY LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> is also really good because I live in the desert and my hands get really dry.</li>
            <li> Well, the instructions say to add the wax to the machine, turn the heat on high and wait for 120 minutes and then to let the wax cool for an additional 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The wax was too hot to be comfortable even after melting and letting it cool on the low setting for 30 minutes (as stated on the directions).  </li>
            <li> So I put it in another room until I was able to send it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the hot paraffin wax I used in occupational therapy.</li>
            <li> hot</li>
            <li> used for first time,wire plugged in got very hot,nearly melted,not worth payin return ship for refunds,junk</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Exfoliate first with some sugar and then use the paraffin &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> hot wax feels healing and soothing.</li>
            <li> So I have to stir it to prevent that from happening, or I just suck it up and dip my hands into the hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also able to put my size 8 feet into the mitts, that are supposed to be for the hands only.</li>
            <li> Again, if you size 10 and above... you won&#x27;t be able to do that, I don&#x27;t think.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> If OK, this will be my last post.  </li>
            <li> how soft and smooth her hands felt.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The product works well, and my hands and feet are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> paraffin is very flammable!).  </li>
            <li> [ASIN:B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream Facial Treatment, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> and I was really glad I had ordered the extra unscented wax.  </li>
            <li> Read directions twice, not really difficult</li>
            <li> Also it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first one I got was damaged; I do not know if it was from the manufacturer or from the postman.</li>
            <li> I purchased another brand from Wal-Mart, first.  </li>
            <li> the minimal directions.&lt;br /&gt;Using this for arthritis in hands, so , guidance would be nice in what setting to keep the wax at before dipping my hands in.  </li>
            <li> It seems like that would be too hot.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sooo soothing not to mention my hand feels soft and smooth after..</li>
            <li> the wax is pretty hot when you dip your hand in.</li>
            <li> i just turn it to hot.</li>
            <li> I tried it first with the wax that came with it and then added the extra lb I purchased thinking that might make it better</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> but then it was to hot to put your hand in.</li>
            <li> I garden and wash my hands a lot in hot water</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have now gotten the unscented wax and used the spa several time.</li>
            <li> I love it enough that I put my feet in it also ..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my hand in it because it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li> Overall I would love it.</li>
            <li> It is either hot or hot.</li>
            <li> I promise u can&#x27;t go wrong very happy</li>
            <li> This is my first paraffin bath</li>
            <li> First off, the unit took a couple hours to melt the 3 lbs.</li>
            <li> The first one came damaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But as I type this, my fingers don&#x27;t ache, for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li> but it performed exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> My niece helped him decide on this particular paraffin bath because it was \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The wax gets hot but not so hot that you&#x27;ll burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Dip them in the hot wax 10-15 times each and cover in baggies and mitts.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought extra!  </li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly and found wax to be too hot even after leaving it on lowest setting for 40 minutes</li>
            <li> This does exactly what you would expect this item to do..</li>
            <li> you wouldnt need to stick your had as close to the hot plate.</li>
            <li> The first time out it melts the wax in about 1 1/2-2 hours.</li>
            <li> u will see shiny hands ;)</li>
            <li> I read all the directions and did exactly what I read.</li>
            <li> I also think the warming temperature is a bit too hot</li>
            <li> When the wax is melted, it&#x27;s too hot to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too hot to use.</li>
            <li> I does take a long time to warm up but really like it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not being able to leave it on low means it takes 1 1/2 hours before you can use it.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, not very convenient</li>
            <li> either way it&#x27;s not deep enough for the wax to cover the top of my foot, where I want the benefits of the oils the most.  </li>
            <li> it is too hot for your hands.  </li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker by any means, but something to be aware of when moving or storing.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it gets too hot for your hands</li>
            <li> I have used it several times but worry about touching the sides and getting burned.  </li>
            <li> The first heating took forever.</li>
            <li> Still really hot.</li>
            <li> So, basically I realized the first time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have to say is the smell of the wax is /very/ potent</li>
            <li> The problem, the wax is way TOO HOT, even in the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> There is NOT enough wax included with it so order more in the beginning.</li>
            <li> the highest setting is way too hot.</li>
            <li> The bath was easy to set up and true to its name was ready to use in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> Once it gets to the right temperature it is easy to use and the various heat settings are helpful.</li>
            <li> I just wish it were a little deeper and longer to fit my size 11 foot. : )</li>
            <li> The wax smells nice and it is just what I had expected!</li>
            <li> On high heat it&#x27;s too hot!</li>
            <li> I really like how soft and smooth this makes my hands.</li>
            <li> As an older nurse, I recall using them years ago, with success, with my patients ----it is my friend&#x27;s loss that she chooses not to use it --</li>
            <li> and I know when I would arrive at the salon many times they would tell me that the wax wasn&#x27;t turned on and it would take atleast 30 minutes, so I expected to wait and let it melt and It was sooooo worth</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I like it too because of its healing assistance - the natural oils in the paraffin are relatively long-lasting and seem to offer nice relief for chapping.  </li>
            <li> ..this is a good little paraffin bath!</li>
            <li> It takes FOREVER for the wax to melt and then when it starts to cool off enough so it won&#x27;t burn your hands it begins to harden too quickly.</li>
            <li> Dipping them in the hot wax gives me much relief.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it won&#x27;t take me too long to go through them.</li>
            <li> How long do I have to be able to return it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s a good product for me.  </li>
            <li> I turn it down to warm when the wax is completely melted to cool off before dipping my hands.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to turn the unit to high before you go to bed at night, then lower the heat right when you wake.</li>
            <li> squares, put them in, and turned the temperature setting all the way to the right (high).</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t use it on high it starts to set up right away.</li>
            <li> it melted nice and evenly, and I turn the heat down to about the 4th notch to set for a bit before I stick my hands in.  </li>
            <li> After 2 days I turned the unit down to the keep warm setting &amp; paraffin began to harden up almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> same as the high price ones and does the somewhat better.</li>
            <li> The other thing I want to mention is the don&#x27;t burn yourself bottom piece I wish it had a way to esily  remove it  without re-dipping my hands into the wax and to be able to hang it on the side of the machine so that after you used it you could easily lift it up and attach it inside above the wax since if you don&#x27;t take it out until the wax is all hardened again and place it back on top then  </li>
            <li> It heats the wax thoroughly and has enough room for easy hand submerging.  </li>
            <li> Previous hand therapists had used paraffin baths as a routine part of hand therapy, and I had always liked it.  </li>
            <li> I even purchased extra wax so that I could dip it in easily and with it being my pinky</li>
            <li> The first day I used this it the red light wouldn&#x27;t  turn on.</li>
            <li> With a substantial amount of wax, to coat as much of the wrist as possible, it takes a full three hours to melt and the final temperature is about 140 degrees F, too hot for most.  </li>
            <li> I dip my hands five times to get a good thick layer that will stay hot</li>
            <li> It take a little planning to be able to use it consistently but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> You have to melt the wax on high and then turn it down to warm about an hour before use so that the wax is not too hot.</li>
            <li> Heating/cooling times matched the brochure that came in the box - 2 hours to melt wax completely, about 25 minutes to cool enough to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Might see if someone else in my family wants to try it, my hands are super sensitive to temperature and this just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> I also figured out how to open the HomeMedics heated bath and repaired the thermostat by sanding the burned electrical contacts with fine grit emery paper.</li>
            <li> A little too warm</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to follow the instructions to cut back on the heat at a certain point.</li>
            <li> If its too thin, cool off easy and doesnt come off easy.</li>
            <li> I wish I could dunk my whole body into it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered eucalyptus wax for it and was much happier than the no scent wax that comes with it.</li>
            <li> very soothing, helps to relax hand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The paraffin bath did more than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> I turn it on when I get up so by the time I get ready to primp, color shower</li>
            <li> It truly made the whole product oily.  </li>
            <li> because with the gloves you really cannot do anything around the house.</li>
            <li> It really does take 2 hours to melt the wax (as stated in the instructions), which requires pre-planning.</li>
            <li> It jus didn&#x27;t seem to soften my skin as much as the one at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> it really seems to help with arthritis.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who wants to soften their hands and skin.  </li>
            <li> Really like the parrafin bath.  </li>
            <li> But when you get used to that, the product really does soften your hands.</li>
            <li> This one work very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always review a product but others reviewing this product really helped to make my decision</li>
            <li> Also thanks to therapy for&lt;br /&gt;giving</li>
            <li> but you can use it daily and is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thanks VG</li>
            <li> I really like the item --</li>
            <li> the toughest thing about the whole set up was getting the freaking wax out of the plastic wrap and breaking it up.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to melt the wax, and after dipping your hands or feet in it, you have to sit still for awhile, something I don&#x27;t do very well, so for me it requires planning ahead - something else I don&#x27;t do very well.  </li>
            <li> As described - thanks.</li>
            <li> It really helped my tendonitis.</li>
            <li> It also  helped my mother-in-laws rheumatoid arthritis so much that we got her one for mother&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> they really needed&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> It holds in the heat really well.</li>
            <li> Also, I wear a woman&#x27;s side 11 shoe and this unit, when filled according to directions, is too short for my feet.</li>
            <li> I buy canning wax, soooo much cheaper</li>
            <li> CLEANS UP FAST.</li>
            <li> The feeling I get after I give my hands a bath in the paraffin is absolute heaven.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Have not tried this product yet, but it really did not tell you what came with the paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to plan my whole day around using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the moisturizer gets a chance to really soak in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to setup, but works really well to moisturize hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will help my arthritis much</li>
            <li> ,i recommend to everyone who need this,but really need 6 lbs of wax to cover hand and wrist.</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of use</li>
            <li> but because I never know when i am going to use it, it stays on and ready to use at all times.</li>
            <li> This unit melts the wax in about 60 - 90 minutes and is very reliable.</li>
            <li> The red light went on</li>
            <li> start with a low temp and increase as you feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Feel free to ask questions, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and does all that it says.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for the arthritis in my hands, and it really relieves the pain and swelling.</li>
            <li> I seldom take arthritis  meds because they bother me and don&#x27;t give that much relief.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Really helped my hands</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to use in about an hour or so.</li>
            <li> i have carporal tunnel and this really helps with the pain.</li>
            <li> The paraffin bath is very soothing.</li>
            <li> But, if you have RA or Raynaud&#x27;s or anything like that - I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After I was released to home therapy, I would use it and it really helped with the stiffness and pain.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always ready for a dip.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the red heater light was off.</li>
            <li> The red light which is the highest heat setting won&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This machines melts the wax fast, and does everything it promises.</li>
            <li> i really like the paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I don&#x27;t realize I would really need the relief it provides</li>
            <li> a front is coming in and what activities I&#x27;m going to be doing really using my hands.</li>
            <li> and it is ready.  </li>
            <li> The temperature control actually works to cool the wax if the maximum temperature is too hot.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a more expensive bath without testing out the effective of this treatment method.  </li>
            <li> excellent, quality, quick delivery, not expensive, takes 90 minutes to completely melt the paraffin, soothing and moisturizing, gives relief to painful hands, i add a bit more paraffin so that it easily reaches above wrists, a bit messy</li>
            <li> So I recommend ordering more wax so you can dip past your wrist and be able to use this machine daily.  </li>
            <li> I found other, used Homedics brand baths for sale that cost more than this one did.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to perfume scented products and will not be able to use it due to that fact.  </li>
            <li> First things first: this wax bath works exactly as advertised - it takes roughly two hours to melt the wax completely, which is fast compared to many other models, and it&#x27;s probably a good idea to turn down the heat some and wait before dipping once the wax melts.</li>
            <li> I was very happy when it arrived that my pain might finally be  eased only to find that the wax was very heavily scented rain scent,</li>
            <li> Keeps the remaining wax clean, and serves the same purpose.</li>
            <li> I really liked this one because it was small and portable and the paraffin melts fast.</li>
            <li> Once melted, and your hand is dipped, it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long, even after several dippings and with the glove, 2)</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin its REALLY nice as it helps block IN the&lt;br /&gt;moisture, leaving such a silky feeling.  </li>
            <li> so I just let the leftover wax cool and reuse it the next time.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would have done differently would have been to buy more paraffin up front as it goes fast.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and don&#x27;t even like showers that are too hot, but the wax was comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about smelly things in general.  </li>
            <li> It is still tolerable on the higher heat but may bother sensitive hands.</li>
            <li> Then I had to wait another hour or so for the wax to cool enough to \\&quot;safely\\</li>
            <li> Letting it cool longer left the wax was too solidified to dip.</li>
            <li> (It takes 1 1/2-2 hours to melt the wax &amp; then 1/2 hour to cool it to proper &amp;#34;dipping&amp;#34; temperature).  </li>
            <li> Thus far, it is too hot to use</li>
            <li> It takes two hours to melt wax and an almost equal amount of time for it to cool before it can be cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I did return this product in full and ordered a different bath.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even break up the wax, I just let it cool in the machine and then just turn the machine back on when I need it again.  </li>
            <li> ..some people may like to let it cool further) and dipped both of my hands 5 times.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this product, it helps me that much.</li>
            <li> The more wax you use the less of a problem this becomes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older unit</li>
            <li> After recent hand surgery, deep into hand therapy, I purchased this paraffin bath to provide some pain relief (ok&#x27;d by my surgeon and OTR).  </li>
            <li> Also the wax that comes with it is not enough to fill it, so I used one more extra.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it takes an hour or more to melt</li>
            <li> When finished with one hand, there&#x27;s barely enough wax left to soak another hand, and this is mostly because</li>
            <li> This is an oily wax and my skin feels soft and moisturized) or the heating unit (plastic, but doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as it could be, and it&#x27;s substantial enough)  </li>
            <li> Glad that I only purchased extra paraffin and not the gloves, etc.</li>
            <li> I went back 30 more minutes later</li>
            <li> This replaced and older version.  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t long enough to be able to submerse his whole size 11 foot.  </li>
            <li> Since everyone has different sensitivity to temperature (the hottest setting is very hot</li>
            <li> Big enough to easily dip a large hand so it does take up a lot of counterspace.</li>
            <li> At the highest heat (knob turned to far right), the wax completely melted in 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and for the price</li>
            <li> I highly recommend lavender scented wax beads as they seem to melt quicker.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Temperature had to stay on high setting to keep wax melted</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After leaving it on high heat for 8 hours, there was still unmelted paraffin in the unit.</li>
            <li> Instead, two plus hours before intended use, need to plug it in, and turn it to high.</li>
            <li> so I opened the package and poured that into the paraffin bath, set to high heat.  </li>
            <li> and/or didn&#x27;t have it turned to high for the melting process.</li>
            <li> With the heat still turned to high</li>
            <li> I also leave it on high all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Con: I have to leave it on high all the time.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance and I cannot use it just like that.</li>
            <li> Melt it on high, turn it</li>
            <li> High temp is about 127 degrees.  </li>
            <li> I cut each block into 8 pieces, set all 3 lbs of wax on high and in just over 90 minutes it was all melted.</li>
            <li> After doing a little more research, I learned you cannot go \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; on these paraffin baths.</li>
            <li> I plan on saving up a little bit more money for the ThermaBath brand because it has a built in heat sensor to control the temperature</li>
            <li> I love this little toy.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly (faster than other brands) but does get too hot</li>
            <li> I will say that once the wax has melted you really need to turn it down before you put your feet and hands in, it is VERY hot!</li>
            <li> The green light stayed on which was supposed to indicate the unit was \\&quot;on\\&quot;, but the red light (which is supposed to indicate it&#x27;s heating) kept going off.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product about 6 times now and so far I don&#x27;t have any real complaints.  </li>
            <li> this product was recommended by my hand doctor and this really helps my arthritis with this soft paraffin wax.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at how much you must endure and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It keeps them soft and really helps reduce my arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li> feet are very burn sensitive.</li>
            <li> Also you&#x27;d be surprised at how much of a difference the room temperature makes at using this wax</li>
            <li> I love this and have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I really like this machine however the warm up time the first time is way over an hour and the subsequent times it takes at least an hour to melt it all</li>
            <li> overall good product though a bit small.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying a good chuck of change to have my feet done at the spa</li>
            <li> The mitts are nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> Takes 3 hours to melt the wax, then the wax is too hot to use, have to cool down.</li>
            <li> Then you have to let it cool down some as it will be too hot to stick your hand into.  </li>
            <li> : My husband told me that the unit apparently has a short which causes the heater to stop working as evidenced by the red light going off almost right away.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I would recommend if you are willing to spend extra money for more, less greasy wax, before use.</li>
            <li> My skin was slightly softer but I suspect I could get the same results by putting a moisture cream on my hands, putting plastic baggies on them, then dipping in warm water for 10 min.    </li>
            <li> bought this specifically to treat stiff joints in winter, but also love that it helps soften my chapped, over-washed hands.</li>
            <li> I had a table saw injury on my right hand last summer.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other paraffin bath’s in my past and they all worked great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to add that other reviewers hadn&#x27;t covered, but I did want to stress that I don&#x27;t think the length of time required to melt the wax is a huge deterrent.</li>
            <li> associated with it that makes it not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Shame on Revlon for selling a product that doesn&#x27;t live up the</li>
            <li> the new unit performs well, I&#x27;ll retract some of the things I&#x27;ve said, but I think my chance&#x27;s are not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> we got the new unit today.</li>
            <li> It worked for almost a year and then had to be replaced because the lights didn&#x27;t stay on, but the company sent me a brand new one (including the wax) when I called within the year warranty.</li>
            <li> Is it because we live at 6,000&#x27;?</li>
            <li> Ended up ordering new paraffin and am happier.</li>
            <li> the wait time for a new melting is not objectionable.</li>
            <li> It works well now, but it was a hassle for 3 days trying to figure out the issue and fix it, when it was supposed to be brand new.</li>
            <li> READY TO USE FAST ENOUGH.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not a problem to keep warm for a few hours to use later in the day.  </li>
            <li> You will need to invest in more wax pretty quickly but definitely helping my very dry hands during this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> Dry skin and cracks are quickly healed and hands / feet feel so very soft.</li>
            <li> the skin is very soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> For a person who is very sensitive to smells (migraines, asthma)</li>
            <li> In certain times of the year my hands get very dry and despite using lotion constantly they do not seem to get enough moisture to make them feel or look healthy.</li>
            <li> Its hot enough to use immediately if you can dip your finger and it feels tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how hot you like the wax, it is possible to use it after 1.5 hours.    </li>
            <li> I thought the temperature was too hot at Revlon&#x27;s setting of 125 degrees, but I checked online, and this is standard for paraffin baths.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands feel soft and helps to take the knuckle pain away!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter couldn&#x27;t dip her hands at all, it was just too hot.</li>
            <li> But boy were my hands and feet soft!</li>
            <li> and they were SO soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> and my hands are so soft as are my cuticles!</li>
            <li> The first one did not work properly, I phoned Amazon, they sent me a return postage label, and sent me another Paraffin Bath.  </li>
            <li> A previous device from HomeMedics worked fine until i wore it out.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect is the temperature, feel a bit too hot to my hands.</li>
            <li> Future uses will be with unit on cardboard on the floor to protect against splashing, and maybe another 1/2 pound of wax to get it deep enough for the top of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a professional quality  Parafin bath!</li>
            <li> Then when it was finally all melted I stuck the tip of my finger in and realized it was scalding hot.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as low as it would go.</li>
            <li> That might have something to do with the fact that the heat source is exclusively from the bottom (which I can&#x27;t seriously imagine being the issue), or that might have to do with the fact that I am yet to figure out how to cover the wax on any non-limb so that it retains the heat better (which I suspect is the real issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The important piece is to melt the wax and then turn the temp down for 1/2 hr before immersing your hands or feet in the wax.</li>
            <li> then you have to turn down the heat before you use it and wait for a comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li> It has to be on high heat to melt then you have to turn it down and let the wax cool before you can use it.</li>
            <li> I actually have to leave it for several hours to get the full melt.</li>
            <li> Arrived fine, box a little ripped up but not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li> and this is a wonderful winter afternoon relaxation treat, and much less expensive than going to the nail salon or spa.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I fractured two bones in the top of my hand and after surgery my fingers were very stiff and sore.</li>
            <li> it takes a couple of hours for the paraffin wax to warm up -- but as long as you give yourself time and make sure to use it at least a few times a week -- - it does seem to help my hands</li>
            <li> NO mess with  this one!   </li>
            <li> if I have to wait for the right temperature FOR ME, a film is already forming on the top (i.e. the wax is starting to solidify a bit), which is not good, because then you have pieces hanging from your hands/feet.</li>
            <li> I do not have big hands or big feet, but neither could fit into this small unit comfortably and completely cover my hand or foot.</li>
            <li> It is really hot at first but as instructed, I left it cooler for a little more than a half hour</li>
            <li> It is also large enough to dip my feet in.</li>
            <li> I do not have overly large hands, only 7 inches from heel of palm to fingertips.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough to dip each foot in.  </li>
            <li> But as my whole house filled with an intense perfume I was forced to get the wax unit out of my house!</li>
            <li> It actually heated a little faster than most.</li>
            <li> My elbows tend to get quite rough, but even days later they feel as smooth as silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Experiment is a success and I will continue to use this machine until it no longer works before considering the more expensive Therabath product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, but if you have the money, get the professional</li>
            <li> This product was a complete bust.  </li>
            <li> I broke up the parffin and it melted COMPLETELY in about 90 minutes....</li>
            <li> makes my hands sooo soft</li>
            <li> I decided to do something preventive, but so far no leaks with&lt;br /&gt;mine</li>
            <li> My hands are considerably softer after use.</li>
            <li> Helps relieve the pain of surgery in both hands and as a bonus makes them as soft as a baby&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> Bowel for the paraffin is not very deep, does not cover much of the foot, even with 3 lbs of paraffin.  </li>
            <li> her is professional and this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> My hands were soft after and soothed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any man who has a wife that likes trying to get her skin soft here</li>
            <li> I was hesitant since so many people complained about the unit not heating and melting the paraffin for hours, but it took 2 hrs like it</li>
            <li> so one can dip the hands without getting too near the element.</li>
            <li> The mineral oil leaves the hands soft and supple and it assists with removing the wax after a treatment.</li>
            <li> (she had it early too), so I bought</li>
            <li> I have used it 3x&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li> w/the machine are placed directly into the container (no liners of any sort).  </li>
            <li> So far, I added 3lbs of Gulf Wax to the bath, in addition to the 3lbs of scented wax that comes with it and can dip my hand deeper to have my wrists in too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I put the lid on and every two hours I would go back into the bathroom and check to see if it was ready.  </li>
            <li> So far used it 3 times</li>
            <li> The drawback is that it actually takes hours (at laest 3 sometimes 4 for the wax to melt depending on how much is in the container.</li>
            <li> also it keeps you hands soft.</li>
            <li> It took about 100 minutes until the wax to be melted completely.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon.</li>
            <li> Because of my conditions my skin is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> The green power light was still on.</li>
            <li> Makes my hands soft and takes the pain away</li>
            <li> Was a present for my Mom, she says she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Just a few concerns - don&#x27;t like the smell of the wax and was glad I had ordered extra Gigi Vanilla wax.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who said it was really good, but not completely perfect.  </li>
            <li> I received my paraffin bath yesterday and was very excited about pampering myself after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li> And after I turn the dial down so it can cool off a bit,</li>
            <li> It takes 2+ hours for the wax to melt then maybe 1 hour for it to safely cool down to use.</li>
            <li> Cool down about an hour.</li>
            <li> I mean it just fits, if your door is bigger than that you might have to scrunch your toes and do some fancy bending to get the whole thing in, but other than that this little guy is just awesome.</li>
            <li> I was right in middle, but it gets hotter now and I am only two clicks from lowest setting.</li>
            <li> And because I like things really hot, I did not find the high setting to be extreme.  </li>
            <li> The paraffin supplied was enough for one filling, and the internal design did not seem to allow all of the paraffin to melt - there would be areas on the top that did not fully melt down.</li>
            <li> Also too messy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is a bit small but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Actually, longer, because several times it has been too hot.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I thought it should, and after the initial wax melting, it only takes about 2 hrs to remelt the wax.  </li>
            <li> half an hour later I can use it and enjoy a relaxing moment.</li>
            <li> Also, after reading some of the reviews about how long it takes to heat up the wax I decided to heat it fast on the stove, then transferred it into the bath.</li>
            <li> I find soaking my hands in the morning is the most beneficial, as they tend to be most stiff and painful first thing when I wake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works to soften dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> The paraffin contains oils and once the paraffin is removed, you rub the oils into your hands and it really helps the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> if you use it on a regular daily basis, or else have the maid get it ready for you.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it takes a pretty long time to heat up the wax.</li>
            <li> I got a few quick dips in but because my hand was in a fist, the wax started cracking off before I could shove my hand into the plastic liner.</li>
            <li> You do need to plan a heads bit as it takes 2hrs to heat up and 20-30min to cool down enough to not scald you when you dip your hands.</li>
            <li> And shame on Amazon for carrying a product that has major</li>
            <li> Thete&#x27;s no other way to say it.  </li>
            <li> Reusing the same wax with a little mineral oil, the original wax blocks have lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> For me, the wax melts after about an hour and a half and then is cool enough to use after about 2.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of other reviews but this is great.</li>
            <li> It is slow to melt, but once you learn to plan ahead it is fine.</li>
            <li> During the winter months, my hands get very dry and very sore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for my experience: How long it takes for the wax to melt obviously corresponds to how much wax you place in the tub.</li>
            <li> I could BARELY read them.  </li>
            <li> My mother is 86 years old and has problems with her hands including recent surgery.  </li>
            <li> Big enough to get my whole hand with fingers open and up to my wrist.  </li>
            <li> Trying to get the 2nd hand in the liner meant completely cracking the wax on the 1st hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li> I moved the control to the far left, lowest&lt;br /&gt;setting and waited.  </li>
            <li> We have no regrets about buying this unit one month after purchase.  </li>
            <li> Only couple times, it will make your skin soft and shiny looking ( i would say it depends your skin condition tho)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife from Amazon, arrived early with the solid paraffin pieces.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I could barely get the plastic sleeves on, let alone trying to get the mitts on as well.</li>
            <li> When I got this, I would say it worked as expected and really helped my arthritis and my skin.  </li>
            <li> my entire adult  life,  </li>
            <li> So, this little machine is my saving grace right now.</li>
            <li> The hottest temp, while hot, did not burn my skin, but you can dial it down to a lower temp before use.</li>
            <li> Filling it for the first time, I accidentally put a small amount of one package of the supplied wax, before I was overwhelmed with the scent and filled it with the plain</li>
            <li> But right now, I&#x27;m hoping that Amazon will let me return this unit because it&#x27;s simply not useful enough.</li>
            <li> The paraffin feels great on the sick and softens it well.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and bought this Paraffin bath but am very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> It takes a very long to melt the wax and it is very hot, despite my turning it way down.</li>
            <li> Although it has not seemed to have much effect on the cracks, my hands are softer and doing this late at night before going to bed is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> She had the same item since the early 1980&#x27;s and it finally gave out so</li>
            <li> If and when I get the money, I will splurge on the more expensive unit that Amazon offers.</li>
            <li> When I turn it down the wax solidifies and it is still too hot to use underneath the solid layer.</li>
            <li> paraffin melts fairly quickly especially after the first melt down so</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to melt all the wax the first time and after letting the wax hardened, about 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> My first attention made my little finger feel</li>
            <li> My other issue was that if it had worked, the amount of wax provided with the appliance was barely enough to cover my large hands.</li>
            <li> Early arthritis runs in my family, but words can&#x27;t really express how devastated I was to find my fingers stiff and aching at 35.  </li>
            <li> The process is  a little messy, the  next time should be better.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get heated up and then adjusted to the right temperature, but so worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Apparently there was some cable that was not doing proper contact</li>
            <li> It is now too late to return for full refund</li>
            <li> The heater is slow to respond when turning on to full heat.. takes over 2 hours to heat up once it cools off .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> A few dips in some hot paraffin has really helped cut down on the pain.</li>
            <li> heats up fast, so it can be used in less time</li>
            <li> and then I wrap her feet in soft towels to hold the heat for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> : I have talked to people who complained that the wax their unit evaporated quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit tricky to put your second hand in the mitt once you&#x27;re already wearing one on your first, but even without someone around to help it&#x27;s definitely feasible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unscented wax that I ordered comes in tiny little balls, easier to melt than a large chunk that came with the machine.  </li>
            <li> THe unit is large, but it&#x27;s narrow shape allows me to tuck it into the cabinet under my sink.  </li>
            <li> If you move the unit slightly, the red light goes back on but goes off a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> Takes about an hour to melt the wax at the high temp, but I think that is about average.</li>
            <li> although my large feet did not fit as well, however smaller feet would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried moving around a little and ended up splashing wax over the side, which will be a bit of a mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> The wax smells bad but it is otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Well worth the small investment!</li>
            <li> The only draw back is the vesicle is too small for large feet.</li>
            <li> Then I add a new block or bag of wax once the the leftover wax has almost melted down.  </li>
            <li> We have absolutely no complaints about this, other than it&#x27;s a bit too small to easily coat wrists along with hands, &amp; my gf&#x27;s wrists are a part of her problem.  </li>
            <li> My hands are not small, but average size</li>
            <li> Use frequently to soak hands to relieve&lt;br /&gt;soreness and stiffness in hands due to arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after heating the wax the first time, letting it harden, and then melting it again for the next treatment, too much wax ended up stuck to the sides and did not melt.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t get the reviewer who said the vessel was barely big enough to dip her small hands.</li>
            <li> The heat was  perfectly soothing to my cold, dry, tired feet.  </li>
            <li> takes way too long to melt the wax and the container is not deep enough to get</li>
            <li> I can barely get my hand in this bath,  I think the measurement is an outside measurement and the bath looses about 3 inches from the outside to the inside due to its design.  </li>
            <li> I can dip toes first, then heel; I can get the full length of my foot inside if I go far enough to put my foot on the base (not supposed to do that because that&#x27;s where the heating element is), but</li>
            <li> the wax melted quite quickly for me, the secret to that is to break it up into smaller pieces, they you don&#x27;t have to wait for hours ...</li>
            <li> i turned it to the lowest setting to let the wax cool down and after a while it actually hardened up to hard to use.</li>
            <li> would recommend breaking into small pieces rather than placing the bars whole..</li>
            <li> Purchased this wax bath unit for my wife to help relieve arthritis in her hands&lt;br /&gt;She complained that the wax was too hot...</li>
            <li> Even with the mitts on, the heat didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I fully expect it to last a long time, but even if I had to replace it every week, I would.</li>
            <li> Using this a few days in a row I&#x27;d be brand new.</li>
            <li> I had a Homedics brand and it did not last very long.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers written advanced arthritis and this offers some relief.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to deeply moisturize and soothe my dry, brittle hands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no need to spend $$ on a more expensive version.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning process doesn&#x27;t sound particularly difficult (I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to do this yet), but it does increase the cost of the unit when you factor in the replacement of the wax.  </li>
            <li> When dipping, it is hard to get the wax over the top of your hand because of how shallow the bath is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use than the deep  round ones that make a mess with wax dripping off.</li>
            <li> it has usually melted quite a bit on high.</li>
            <li> #34;how long it takes to heat</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to et on.</li>
            <li> BUT....MY GOSH, if was not for a microwave, I don&#x27;t know how long I would have to wait for the wax to melt....</li>
            <li> It is wayyy too long....</li>
            <li> take long to heat up</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the difficulty people commented on how long it took to melt the wax..</li>
            <li> Takes way to long to heat up.</li>
            <li> as I know in the long run of doing this self care, my hands will thank me for it.  </li>
            <li> (it took 3 minute to melt the wax) and then carefully poured the melted wax back into the unit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one of these.  </li>
            <li> the units talked abot hoe long</li>
            <li> Takes too long to heat up.  </li>
            <li> This product takes way too long to make use of.  </li>
            <li> If you turn it down to &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; it turns solid so if you use it often, say daily, you will end up doing what I do and leave it all the way up.</li>
            <li> I sent it back and will deal with my aching body parts in some other fashion.</li>
            <li> I will go ahead and buy some other brand locally.</li>
            <li> This takes a very long time to heat up and if you try to leave it on &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; the wax hardens and you have to wait another hour to use it again.  </li>
            <li> and my hands are always so dry and crack during the winter.</li>
            <li> My hands would get sore and dry.</li>
            <li> My hands are terribly dry in the winter, cracked and bleeding at times (and they hurt too).</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, because she has dry hands from washing them ALL the time.</li>
            <li> Before i use, i scrub my hands dry them but not to dry, leave moisture on your hands.(no water)</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my sore, dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to relieve my arthritis in my hands and my dry desert skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my dry hands.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of $50 (including shipping) and I can&#x27;t get anything back from it.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because the time it takes to warm up is a bit annoying when you don&#x27;t pre-plan.  </li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s description is missing a major component.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Order extra paraffin if the paraffin that sticks to the hand after each bath is discarded the reservoir is small and will need additional paraffin after three or so baths IF you have large or wide stiff hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i think with practice it will become less of a mess, but for now i keep a towel under the device to catch a few drips of hot wax</li>
            <li> Usually that type of action burns out an appliance, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Very complicated process to be able to use.&lt;br /&gt;Takes</li>
            <li> The first one I got was cracked and broken in front</li>
            <li> The lid should not be so loose and should be hinged.</li>
            <li> I also suffered for months with my nails splitting, filing them down just to have them grow back and split.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is just barely deep enough for me to immerse a hand (my hands are SMALL).</li>
            <li> I figured after the initial use (where you&#x27;re instructed to break up the blocks of wax before inserting), it would take longer, as it was in one solid chunk, but it heated in less than an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> The directions say to put the unit on &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; after the paraffin has melted, but this does not work because it begins to solidify only leaving a small pool of melted wax in the middle.</li>
            <li> It just seemed like so much trouble and the heat didn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> I make pottery and my hands get very dry.</li>
            <li> And I have very dry hands</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to help with very dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have not had the problems with long melting times like other reviewers have.  </li>
            <li> The bath is too small for large or wide stiff hands.</li>
            <li> I went a little crazy the first week and used it about every other day (but my hands really needed it).</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little bigger for my boyfriends feet.</li>
            <li> takes longer to melt all the wax the next time this is a little messy but otherwise not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I was worried because I knew some brands had a problem with leaking, but mine never has even after being boxed and moved roughly.  </li>
            <li> No extra wax needed for 1st few uses, just reuse leftover wax.</li>
            <li> Paraffin didn&#x27;t moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> The boyfriend has even used it a few times since he works outside.</li>
            <li> It does take approximately 2 hours to melt the wax to be ready for use.  </li>
            <li> The heat stays with you for a few minutes only but it does take the pain away for me.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to dip your hands in the waxwing</li>
            <li> Sometimes it will be plugged into a spot that is not readily reachable.</li>
            <li> they were actually white from using gasoline to get the stain and varnish off my hands and dried out.  </li>
            <li> This product took 4 hours to melt the was fully which means it was not ready for my spa party</li>
            <li> I use mine daily year round</li>
            <li> Just watch and be careful not to get burned.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to melt the wax which is to be expected, but I do like this bath.</li>
            <li> Relief and smoothness expected from soaking  was not as expected.</li>
            <li> But do be careful with \\&quot;burning\\&quot; yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, product seems to work exactly as expected, and I think will be no problem when I decide to treat my hands.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that mentioned that this product had leaks but in the time that I have had it I have had absolutely no problems with it.</li>
            <li> So to me, it was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Then a few days later I tried it once again</li>
            <li> then the mittens they provide and sit back and relax for a few minutes .</li>
            <li> As expected, it takes a while for the oil to heat.  </li>
            <li> I had a hand injury that left my ring and pinkie fingers stiff.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is difficult and I just couldn&#x27;t get temp right.  </li>
            <li> The wax took about an hour and a half to melt down fully, it went faster if you broke it into smaller chunks.</li>
            <li> At that point, the wax had started to solidify around the sides, leaving a very small pool of wax directly over the center of the bottom heating plate.</li>
            <li> Even though the wax was pretty cold from being outside</li>
            <li> With a little discipline and this paraffin bath, dry and rough skin will be gone.</li>
            <li> I had a different one a few years ago and it melted 4 or 5 lbs of paraffin in half the time it takes this one to melt it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to read Revlon&#x27;s instructions to dip your hand or foot into the wax warmer - not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Not appealing when you open the box.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Revlon Paraffin Bath based on the reviews of this model versus other brands.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while for the wax to melt, but other than that</li>
            <li> The wax melted faster than other posters said so</li>
            <li> I only cut a small hole in the bag when I had an immediately allergic reaction to the scent.</li>
            <li> Plus, I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend $150 for other models advertised here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> She only did it once herself, and said she is &#x27;too lazy&#x27; to bother doing it.  </li>
            <li> However, other than that, the product meets all of my needs.</li>
            <li> Due to their promptness, I decided to try another one.</li>
            <li> But I just included my thoughts on the other things regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it still never worked not even enough to melt one block that I cut up into small pieces.</li>
            <li> It just too small for Big Foot (Feet).</li>
            <li> This bath is for my hands due to arthritis and it works well</li>
            <li> Other reviews stated it took forever to melt the wax...</li>
            <li> I have no complaints other than</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t have been  hard to include the scent info in the listing, so I could have gotten unscented wax at the same time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say I had a hard time with was after the wax was on my hands.</li>
            <li> The only complaint we have is that the instructions say that it takes an hour to melt.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I didn&#x27;t get that much relief from it.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY COMPLAINT WOULD BE</li>
            <li> Heats up slowly, but only takes a couple of hours on medium.</li>
            <li> And deep your hands 3 time slowly.</li>
            <li> After the paraffin melts - it takes over two hours, then, it is necessary to turn down the heat, and wait for at least 35 minutes.</li>
            <li> Temperature control not very precise.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, there is a lot to consider when it comes to heating up and cooling down temperatures.</li>
            <li> Another 20 or 30 minutes brings it down to about 120 degrees where it begins to solidify.  </li>
            <li> and when I turn it down, it begins to solidify again even though the instructions say to turn it down.</li>
            <li> And it takes longer time to melt it down than it says.</li>
            <li> As for when to put your hand/foot in, the instructions advise waiting 25 minutes after turning down the heat before dipping.</li>
            <li> Mine was like some what 3hours to get all melt down.</li>
            <li> I like this Revlon product except that one the paraffin melts you must turn it down or</li>
            <li> So I turned the heat switch way way down.</li>
            <li> turn it down and wait.  </li>
            <li> The dial broke in less that 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even half melted.</li>
            <li> Not even half melted.</li>
            <li> I even think there are less lines on my hands.  </li>
            <li> My machine was a lot less cost</li>
            <li> It heats up in slightly under 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> , 3) the basin is way too shallow and doesn&#x27;t hold enough wax.</li>
            <li> (my job involves a lot of digital communication), and just completely depressing to feel old and like my body was falling apart and was never going to be \\&quot;whole\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 minutes of keeping my hand in the glove, I take off the wax and massage my hand to get the knots out...and it takes less time than without the parraffin therapy and hurts less too.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a slightly floral scent, not too girly, but there.</li>
            <li> Softer skin, reduced redness, less cracking</li>
            <li> But the less you have the faster it works.</li>
            <li> It may take less time to reheat, since the blocks are already melted).</li>
            <li> /&gt;To my way of thinking, 145 minutes is not quick.</li>
            <li> The wax has to heat for almost an hour and a half</li>
            <li> I read the instructions which explain to cut each pound of wax in half then in half again...</li>
            <li> The hot paraffin warms my painfully cold fingers.  </li>
            <li> I do need help getting the liners on because the wax can make a mess.  </li>
            <li> The average man feet will not fit in here.</li>
            <li> Only real complaint is that the cover does not snap securely closed.  </li>
            <li> I did buy a 1 pound box of paraffin wax at the grocery store and add it as the amount was a little skimpy.</li>
            <li> This little beauty works for me.</li>
            <li> it says in the little multi-language paper to take it off and add wax and turn on , wax should melt in about 2 hours?  </li>
            <li> The lid on this one fits snuggly and I have had little to no evaporation in the two months I have had it.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product after my old one finally gave up on me, I was afraid it would be too small.</li>
            <li> Keeps the little bit of arthritis away.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> to a little below medium with the lid off.  </li>
            <li> Wait a little while</li>
            <li> and you have to wait a bit till it gets a little cooler</li>
            <li> All-in-all, not very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and it is very comforting on really cold days.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting this unit to fully melt the paraffin, and then find I cannot fully submerge my hand into the wax.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months and</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and it has helped the stiffness in my hands.    </li>
            <li> If you add a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil, Spearmint Oil and Rosemary Oil</li>
            <li> This is a lot of trouble and seems even cheaper than it was.  </li>
            <li> Will use it for a few days and see how everything goes.  </li>
            <li> I have had this unit for a few weeks now and it</li>
            <li> ; otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> The listing made no reference to the wax being scented, let alone so heavily scent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> Diabetics should be especially careful.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few hours to heat up</li>
            <li> to get the process started it does take a few hours to get the wax to melt</li>
            <li> The wax that comes with this paraffin bath is heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I had carpel tunnel in both hands a few</li>
            <li> i use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste time while the wax melts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is with the people who have complained about the wax taking a long time to melt -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in recovery from a hand injury (severed nerve&#x3D; stiff finger)...</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Revlon Paraffin Bath for anyone who has stiff fingers or hand problems.</li>
            <li> I would rate it a 5 star with plain wax and still 2 as it comes.</li>
            <li> I also ordered plain wax.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the wax can be expensive.</li>
            <li> It really helps make them feel less painful.</li>
            <li> It burned me pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This little bad boy helps her sooo much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to get your hand into the vat and dipping it five times makes it more awkward.  </li>
            <li> The nail technician said I needed the paraffin once a week as my nails were extremely dry,brittle and weak.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> So if you are a size 10-11-12... not sure this unit is for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cut 4 lbs of wax into small pieces and It took about 2 hours to melt.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased a deep cookie sheet just a&lt;br /&gt;bit larger than the base of this...after reading a few reviews about&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I mashed it into small pieces with my hands.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased at all with this product.</li>
            <li> My hand is softer however I am not pleased with how it works.</li>
            <li> There is no way you could dip your foot as the opening is too small.</li>
            <li> The wax is difficult to break up to place in the unit especially for someone with arthritis.  </li>
            <li> and I add one small bottle of the fragrant oil</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the wax to have any foul odor - not sure why others have said that.</li>
            <li> The language of the Revlon product led me to belive it would accommodate a size 13 foot, but when i received it, it was too small.</li>
            <li> Small but does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact.  </li>
            <li> The 90 min - 2 hr melting time is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> very messy, wax did not stay ;liquid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist who suffers from occasional tendinitis and arthritis in my joints, so after doing a little research on the benefits of melted paraffin, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> Used this to replace an old &amp;#34;Therabath&amp;#34; wax unit which was heavy and ugly.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a very expensive one and the only difference is the size.</li>
            <li> This was very inconvenient and defeated the purpose of having this at home ready to use.</li>
            <li> In fact, the bottom was melted but the rest of the wax was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> It is hard to break the parafin</li>
            <li> and if you reduce the temperature, paraffin gets hard.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to melt the wax but that isn&#x27;t hard if you are doing stuff before hand.</li>
            <li> and I suspect thats the problem with all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Have this sitting on my counter in the utility room and try and use at least a couple times a week.  </li>
            <li> The unit was on for at least 4.5 hours, at which point it became too late</li>
            <li> at least 2 hours....</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I did not find this product therapeutic in the least</li>
            <li> The unit comes with three pounds of wax but needs to be at least six</li>
            <li> She still complained about the temperature as burning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s stopped working entirely, leaving the unit on for five to six hours  (power and heating lights lit) leaves the unit stone cold.</li>
            <li> Disappointing product, doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough heat to do the melting, returned to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but it is so slow to heat up</li>
            <li> I can use it everyday!!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this wax machine because I have terrible pain in my hands from scleroderma.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have arthritis, but do have a problem with really dry skin because my hands are always cold.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon Paraffin Bath because my hands are always cold and terribly dry.  </li>
            <li> but it is still to shallow to dip my hand unless it is sideways.</li>
            <li> The review record is not good for this unit, and Amazon will take note and review their policy as to carry this product on a go forward basis.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The instructions say to insert your hand - not a good idea as you will contaminate the wax.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it took too long to melt wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do this at least once a week just for that!</li>
            <li> but my girlfriend uses this at least 3 to 4 days a week!</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands in the winter and purchase this to see if it could help the painful cracks on my fingers.</li>
            <li> I am using it for a broken wrist</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it had been returned or if the manufacturer poorly planned this, but the oils from the paraffin bars leaked into the bag and ruined the directions.  </li>
            <li> The instructions stated that it would take approximately 120 minutes for the wax to melt.</li>
            <li> I think this dramatically decreased the melting time.</li>
            <li> The plastic bags for the hands are of poor quality though, the seam on the bottom comes apart and your hand will go all the way thru.</li>
            <li> Worse perhaps is the temperature.</li>
            <li> Instructions state this unit melts 3 pounds of paraffin in approximately 120 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This Revlon paraffin bath was a poor purchase.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the usual dryness that comes with the cold winter weather.  </li>
            <li> It was physically painful, occupationally problematic as my typing slowed down</li>

    <ol>
            <li> it works great for my daughter hands, she has gout.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this purchase.  I have arthritis in my hands and decided to go with a cheaper model. The wax was too hot to be comfortable even after melting and letting it cool on the low setting for 30 minutes (as stated on the directions).  I unplugged it and let it cool some more so that I could very quickly dip my hands several times and put them in the mitts, but it really provided no arthritis relief using it that way.  My other issue was that if it had worked, the amount of wax provided with the appliance was barely enough to cover my large hands.</li>
            <li> I use this bath to submerge my hand for treatment of arthritis in the thumb.  It is so soothing ... I wish I could dunk my whole body into it.  THe unit is large, but it&#x27;s narrow shape allows me to tuck it into the cabinet under my sink.  YEs, it takes a while to heat up the paraffin, but the wait is worth it!</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  I received the product promptly.  The paraffin bath was easy to use, paraffin that came with the bath melted easily, it was a wonderful experience. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an at home paraffin experience.</li>
            <li> Amazing...I ordered eucalyptus wax for it and was much happier than the no scent wax that comes with it. Takes hours to heat up BUT well worth it when u know ahead of time u are gonna do it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at a fair price, wax has a nice scent. A lot cheaper than my friend&#x27;s who introduced me to the process.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who has severe arthritis in her hands. She just loves it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> The dial broke in less that 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Have to put a toothpick under it to get it to heat wax</li>
            <li> I bought this because I work in a kitchen and my hands are always so dry and crack during the winter. This product is wonderful! After just a couple uses, it has paid for itself! I can use it everyday!!  My hands are already feeling better! I am very happy with my purchase!! :)</li>
            <li> this is one of the worst things that I have ever bought.  It took over 24 hours for all of the paraffin to melt.  I was highly disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I love getting paraffin at the salon, So now I can enjoy from my home when I want and know that it is clean and safe!! This was a gift to me from my family and I will now be buying many for friends and family!! Great gift try it! When I read many reviews they seem to be talking about &amp;#34;how long it takes to heat up&amp;#34; I did not have the problem at all! It takes a bit to heat any candle wax and I know when I would arrive at the salon many times they would tell me that the wax wasn&#x27;t turned on and it would take atleast 30 minutes, so I expected to wait and let it melt and It was sooooo worth the wait:) Buy this you will be glad you did!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it, but if someone can make on where the wax is not scented or lightly scented. The scent was too strong and I have allergies. It was in the box and I could still smell it. So I put it in another room until I was able to send it back.</li>
            <li> I bought my Revlon Paraffin Bath several months ago and it is wonderful.  I was worried because I knew some brands had a problem with leaking, but mine never has even after being boxed and moved roughly.  It heats the wax thoroughly and has enough room for easy hand submerging.  I am using it for a broken wrist and I can cover that area up my arm and hand.  I love it.[[ASIN:B003ZWEW1S Revlon RVSP3501B1 Moisturestay Quick Heat Paraffin Bath]]</li>
            <li> Excellent inexpensive Paraffin Bath! I have only used it twice now, but so far so good. Easy to use, wax heats in about 1 1/2 hrs (as advertised). Whoever said 6 hrs must&#x27;ve gotten a defective machine. I&#x27;m using this in recovery from a hand injury (severed nerve&#x3D; stiff finger)...very soothing, helps to relax hand. It&#x27;s just like the hot paraffin wax I used in occupational therapy. Highly recommend! No extra wax needed for 1st few uses, just reuse leftover wax.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great buy! I make pottery and my hands get very dry. My cuticles were cracking and my hands stopped feeling smooth. I was looking for something to deeply moisturize and soothe my dry, brittle hands. The paraffin bath did more than I ever expected. After working with the clay, I heat up the wax and dip. My hands feel better than ever now. Sure it takes a while to heat up, but it&#x27;s not like you paid $200 or more for a professional wax dip. Just time it right for when you know you&#x27;re going to use it, and stop complaining. It&#x27;s a great product for the price and the wax that comes with it smells great.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting this unit to fully melt the paraffin, and then find I cannot fully submerge my hand into the wax.  My hands are not small, but average size and if I attempt deeper submersion, I am touching a very hot bottom of the container.  I bought this to replace an older unit but I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I fractured two bones in the top of my hand and after surgery my fingers were very stiff and sore. Dipping them in the hot wax gives me much relief. This product has worked great for me as the temperature settings are just right and the wax does not take long at all to melt. Not only that but it looks nice too sitting on my bathroom counter. I highly recommend this product and for the price your getting a great deal. Even thinking of buying one for my brother who deals with arthritis.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t look luxury but no problem to use.&lt;br /&gt;The product same as described and no leaking.&lt;br /&gt;Plan required to use, the paraffin needs time to melt down.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is the product came with 3lb paraffin.&lt;br /&gt;Enough quantity for both hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I remember paying $18 for a paraffin at a salon.  And I have very dry hands and my cuticles are ragged.  This has virtually revolutionized my hands overnight.  I got my Revlon Quick Bath and heated it immediately with the 3 LBs. of wax included.  You have to turn the unit on its highest heat for the wax to melt quicker and I suspect thats the problem with all the negative reviews.  At the highest heat (knob turned to far right), the wax completely melted in 2 hours.  Its hot enough to use immediately if you can dip your finger and it feels tolerable.  I like it hot so I just submerged one hand at a time.  It is tricky to use the plastic liners and I&#x27;ll still have to figure out how to keep the wax warm while its hardening but even if you use nothing at all and just dip and re-dip and wait to dry...it makes your hands/fingers/cuticles soft and hydrated better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used ever.  For this price it is amazing!  I highly recommend it and after all my research I think this is the best home unit out there.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I previously owned a very expensive one and the only difference is the size. This one is perfect for my hands and feet. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s okay to leave it on the lowest setting all the time but I&#x27;ve had no problems doing so.  Also, after reading some of the reviews about how long it takes to heat up the wax I decided to heat it fast on the stove, then transferred it into the bath. Only takes about ten minutes doing it that way. I also liked all the extras the plastic bags and mitts.  If you&#x27;re looking for a paraffin bath, this is the one!!</li>
            <li> Working fine so far I gave it 4 stars for all the accessories it came with it plus the wax is good</li>
            <li> Paraffin didn&#x27;t moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> No on/off switch so it has to plugged in or unplugged. Thats ok, more of a safety feature I suppose. Heats up slowly, but only takes a couple of hours on medium. Has done wonders on my Nurse hands and I am thankful to have it since my hands and cuticles were splitting. I use it about 3 times a week. I turn it on when I get up so by the time I get ready to primp, color shower etc it has usually melted quite a bit on high. The boyfriend has even used it a few times since he works outside. Cant beat the luxury of having it for the price.</li>
            <li> Heats up pretty quick, i like it. you would have to melt the wax to clean it out. I enjoyed using it and it made me feel good.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product, I love this!!!!</li>
            <li> So far used it 10 times - love it.  You do have to plug it in 2 hours before you want to use it.  That being said, it is very useful to help loosen and lower pain in hands.</li>
            <li> I really love this.It feels good on your hands and feet, and it does make your skin feel softer. I have always had problems with my hands and feet cracking. The paraffin wax helps a good bit. The only down side is the wax can be expensive. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Warmed up in the 2 hrs like it said.  I do wish the description would have told you what is included with the bath.</li>
            <li> used for first time,wire plugged in got very hot,nearly melted,not worth payin return ship for refunds,junk</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and it works so well for my firend that I had to buy myself one. There are other companies out there who make Paraffin Bath&#x27;s but most take more than 6 hours to melt the wax.    I Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. The wax provided has a nice scent.  It takes a while to heat up but for the price it is excellent.  Works great for arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> You will have to buy extra paraffin for it, but otherwise we like it alot.  The only complaint we have is that the instructions say that it takes an hour to melt.  It actually takes 2-3 hours to melt.  But otherwise this is a great product .And the included hand mitts are a super addition.</li>
            <li> I wear size 11 to 11 1/2 women&#x27;s shoes.  It is impossible to put my foot in the wax without my toes scraping the end.  I have to kind of dip my heels then my toes.  It&#x27;s a pain in the rear, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all paraffin wax baths, you have to deal with melting time, etc.  I don&#x27;t mind the time issues with this product, it just comes with the territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside of the well is the plastic guard that sets atop of the heating element.  If you get a finger/toe past the guard, it&#x27;s scorching hot.  I think the holes should be a bit smaller to protect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price is right and it works.  I would recommend it, but if you have the money, get the professional kind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue I had with packaging is that the directions were enclosed in a plastic wrap, open at one end.  I don&#x27;t know if it had been returned or if the manufacturer poorly planned this, but the oils from the paraffin bars leaked into the bag and ruined the directions.  I could BARELY read them.  The packaging of the paraffin bars is atrocious.  Revlon should be ashamed of their half-hearted attempt to package the wax.  It truly made the whole product oily.  Not appealing when you open the box.</li>
            <li> With a little discipline and this paraffin bath, dry and rough skin will be gone. Use it twice a week and you will have beautiful, soft feet.  I have been using it for a few months and all my corns and problems are gone gone gone. Exfoliate first with some sugar and then use the paraffin &amp;#34;glove&amp;#34;.  15 minutes, twice a week, will make it, but I use it overnight.  Try it, it worths every penny.</li>
            <li> Will help my husband with his arthritis. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I use this paraffin bath on both of my hands. I have severe psoriatic arthritis and the heat of the wax with the plastic wrap and the lined mittens is an instant relief. It heated very quickly and I have it set to stay warm all the time, so I can use it after and exertion of my hands. It gives me instant relief. I did buy a 1 pound box of paraffin wax at the grocery store and add it as the amount was a little skimpy. I am very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete bust.  I was prepared for 2 hours to melt the wax but I had it plugged in for 4 hours and the wax still has not melted. Very disappointed. This thing is useless.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Revlon Paraffin Bath based on the reviews of this model versus other brands.  The reviews were very helpful and accurate.  I have read articles about arthritis in your hands and how by using the paraffin bath on a regular basis this would soothe the pain. I have been using this for a few weeks and it has helped the stiffness in my hands.    The Revlon Paraffin Bath is a great product and does not leak.  It does take approximately 2 hours to melt the wax to be ready for use.  Depending on how hot you like the wax, it is possible to use it after 1.5 hours.    Great price through Amazon and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This Revlon Paraffin Bath was just what I needed for relief for my fingers (I have Reynaud&#x27;s Syndrome).  The hot paraffin warms my painfully cold fingers.  An added benefit:  my hands are softer after a treatment.</li>
            <li> Have this sitting on my counter in the utility room and try and use at least a couple times a week.  I&#x27;m a nurse and therefore my hands get beat up!  After trying every lotion I could get my hands on, no pun intended, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Its not the perfect answer, but it does help.&lt;br /&gt;The hot wax feels healing and soothing.</li>
            <li> The Paraffin bath is perfect.....I broke up the parffin and it melted COMPLETELY in about 90 minutes....feel compelled to write a review because of all the ones I read that were not acurate.&lt;br /&gt;So...this is a great value....the bath included 3 lbs of paraffin,plastic liners and thermal mitts.....all for 34$.&lt;br /&gt;I had paid 34$ for one spa manicure with paraffin treatment.....so plus tip it was over 40$. The nail technician said I needed the paraffin once a week as my nails were extremely dry,brittle and weak. The treatment was Very effective...but with this machine I can do it myself....saving time and lots of money.....and there are NO problems with this product....it&#x27;s easy...just plan to do nothing with your hands for about 30minutes....because with the gloves you really cannot do anything around the house.</li>
            <li> This Revlon RVSP350181 Paraffin Bath is a great help with my sore hand. I have hurt the joints in my hand and this really makes it feel better. The heat stays with you for a few minutes only but it does take the pain away for me. When you first place your hand in the bath it seems very hot. If you continue to dip your hand, it seems to make the heat go deeper and warmer, not hotter. The feeling is very comfortable. I don&#x27;t work for Revlon, it is just my actual experience with this product. I like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot; paraffin bath to try to help relieve some pain in my hand and wrist.  The brochure said the wax would melt in about 2 hours (quick?), but I gave up after 3 hours.  At the end of the three hours, the machine was not even warm.  It appeared that it kept turning itself off.  The green light stayed on which was supposed to indicate the unit was \\&quot;on\\&quot;, but the red light (which is supposed to indicate it&#x27;s heating) kept going off.  What a disappointment.  I sent it back and will deal with my aching body parts in some other fashion.</li>
            <li> This works well, except it needs a little more wax to cover up to the wrist, so I&#x27;ve ordered more wax.  otherwise this is just as nice as the spa ones.  I went a little crazy the first week and used it about every other day (but my hands really needed it).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a machine that would help my winter weathered hands (I get them every year).  I have used this product about 6 times now and so far I don&#x27;t have any real complaints.  I only gave it 4 stars because the time it takes to warm up is a bit annoying when you don&#x27;t pre-plan.  I just decide which night I&#x27;m going to use it and turn it on when I get home...you need to allow about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the wax to melt and a good 30 minutes to turn the temp down so you don&#x27;t burn yourself.  I am the only one using this machine so I just let the leftover wax cool and reuse it the next time.  Then I add a new block or bag of wax once the the leftover wax has almost melted down.  I highly recommend lavender scented wax beads as they seem to melt quicker.  [[ASIN:B000FEKMQI Therabath Refill Paraffin Wax, Lavender, 6 lbs]]  Love that the liners and mits come included.  I do need help getting the liners on because the wax can make a mess.  Use a hand lotion before you dip, but don&#x27;t cake it on or the wax will fall off.  Still need to perfect my dipping technique.  Seems a bit chunky.  All in all, I recommend this machine.  I am sure the $100+ plus machines are divine, but I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on constantly as it was recommended.  This little beauty works for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Revlon Paraffin Bath for anyone who has stiff fingers or hand problems. It does take about 2 hours to heat first thing in the morning, however it is worth the wait. I had a hand injury that left my ring and pinkie fingers stiff. After just 2 treatments with the hot wax (you dip hand in 5 times when wax is comfortably warm, make a fist, wrap in saran wrap for 15 minutes, remove wrap and wax and start bending your fingers)I can now move and bend both fingers with ease! Thank you Revlon and thank you Amazon.com for everything!</li>
            <li> I just had to buy another one for my mom. Now we don&#x27;t have to go to nail salon to enjoy that feeling of pampering again.</li>
            <li> Never heard of hand-waxing until a friend told me about it. I don&#x27;t have arthritis, but do have a problem with really dry skin because my hands are always cold. I don&#x27;t have long-term results yet but my hands stay warm for a long time after using this (yay !) so it can only help !</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about it. It really does take 2 hours to melt the wax (as stated in the instructions), which requires pre-planning. And after I turn the dial down so it can cool off a bit, if I have to wait for the right temperature FOR ME, a film is already forming on the top (i.e. the wax is starting to solidify a bit), which is not good, because then you have pieces hanging from your hands/feet. So I have to stir it to prevent that from happening, or I just suck it up and dip my hands into the hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;I wear size 8 women&#x27;s shoes, and my foot fits perfectly. So if you are a size 10-11-12... not sure this unit is for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had paraffin bath done on my hands before at a salon, and definately the wax it came with is not the same quality. I ordered different kind to try something else. It jus didn&#x27;t seem to soften my skin as much as the one at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m also able to put my size 8 feet into the mitts, that are supposed to be for the hands only. And they fit well in the plastic bags provided. Again, if you size 10 and above... you won&#x27;t be able to do that, I don&#x27;t think.&lt;br /&gt;With the 3 lbs of wax that the unit came with, I think you can do your hands and feet twice, before you have to add more wax, because the level would be too low.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I can&#x27;t complain, I don&#x27;t regret my purchase. I just hope the new wax will be better quality. So I would ask at a salon where you&#x27;ve had it done, what kind do they use and order that.</li>
            <li> This is more for a young child</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has arthritis  in his hands.  He loves it.  It works as described.  The only thing I would have done differently would have been to buy more paraffin up front as it goes fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and wish I had gotten one for myself.  It is the perfect size for home use, but does take longer than 1 hour for the wax to heat. If you add a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil, Spearmint Oil and Rosemary Oil it really seems to help with arthritis.</li>
            <li> I read the comments before purchasing this product therefore I chose to purchase extra wax before it was delivered.  This is the perfect solution for dry weathered feet.  I cut 4 lbs of wax into small pieces and It took about 2 hours to melt.  The heat was  perfectly soothing to my cold, dry, tired feet.  I also pampered my hands, elbows and knees.  The combination of a nice body scrub and this product equals smooth heaven.  I hope you enjoy your purchase as much as I did.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> really love this product!!! makes my hands sooo soft and it is really great for those of us who have arthritis.  this product was recommended by my hand doctor and this really helps my arthritis with this soft paraffin wax.  would recommend this to anyone who wants to soften their hands and skin.  a must for every woman.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased....need I say more?&lt;br /&gt;Ok...I will...honestly this is such a nice splurge for anyone...male or&lt;br /&gt;female.  If you have dry skin its REALLY nice as it helps block IN the&lt;br /&gt;moisture, leaving such a silky feeling.  I bought my Daughter one also&lt;br /&gt;and she loves hers also.  I also purchased a deep cookie sheet just a&lt;br /&gt;bit larger than the base of this...after reading a few reviews about&lt;br /&gt;leaks I decided to do something preventive, but so far no leaks with&lt;br /&gt;mine or my daughters, guess it was cheap insurance anyway!  A nice&lt;br /&gt;Mother&#x27;s Day gift or birthday gift for that someone special.</li>
            <li> Very complicated process to be able to use.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a lot of your time to do the procedure. Also too messy to clean. Almost all wax is gone from the very first use.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love how this paraffin dip helps my hands.</li>
            <li> I do like the wax treatment for pain and skin care.  This is a lot of trouble and seems even cheaper than it was.  I wish I had spent a bit more money for a better piece of equipment.  I need to fiddle with the dial constantly  to keep it turned on. Otherwise it stops heating on its own.   The bowl is just barely deep enough for me to immerse a hand (my hands are SMALL).</li>
            <li> although the wax slowly melts, once list applies easily and has good smell. the skin is very soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> Purchased this unit for my wife. We are now into 7 1/2 hours into the initial melting of the wax.  Used the wax that came with the unit and it STILL IS NOT MELTED 100%, to the point of using the unit.  The wax has a tentancy to cake up along the sides of the unit,and you have to break it up so it can melt.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be kidding me about selling this unit as a \\&quot;Quick Heat\\&quot;.  It is now 11:30 PM and we are going to bed.  Will turn unit back on in the AM.  If it takes another 7 1/2 hour, this piece of junk is going back.  Shame on Revlon for selling a product that doesn&#x27;t live up the what they say.  And shame on Amazon for carrying a product that has major problems.&lt;br /&gt;Just take a look at all the reviews posted.  80% have to deal with heating issues.  Maybe the 20% that don&#x27;t have a heating issue, have a unit the cycles to max. often enough to melt the wax quicker.  Should not all the units have that same capabilit?&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s the following morning and now 6 hours into the wax melting process and it&#x27;s only 60% melted.  That&#x27;s enough for this unit. Got return authorization from Amazon (Thank You Amazon) and I requested another unit.  If the next unit acts the same, then it must the heating elements.  The review record is not good for this unit, and Amazon will take note and review their policy as to carry this product on a go forward basis.&lt;br /&gt;If the new unit performs well, I&#x27;ll retract some of the things I&#x27;ve said, but I think my chance&#x27;s are not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well we got the new unit today. Plugged it in and it took only 1 1/2 hours to melt the wax.  So anything I said about Amazon I take back, but I still have an open book as to the Revlon product.  Will use it for a few days and see how everything goes.  If OK, this will be my last post.  To all future buyers GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> I am astounded by reading all these raving reviews. I received my paraffin bath yesterday and was very excited about pampering myself after a hard day at work. The instructions stated that it would take approximately 120 minutes for the wax to melt. The unit was on for at least 4.5 hours, at which point it became too late and I simply had to turn it off and go to bed. It wasn&#x27;t even half melted. In fact, the bottom was melted but the rest of the wax was hard as a rock. Today I decided to give it another chance and it has been on for almost two hours and it is still NOT MELTED. Not even half melted. Back to Amazon it goes tomorrow. What a scam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update: My husband told me that the unit apparently has a short which causes the heater to stop working as evidenced by the red light going off almost right away. If you move the unit slightly, the red light goes back on but goes off a few minutes later. No wonder that the wax never melted. I am sending it back to Amazon and will never touch a Revlon product again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife when she was told it would help her with the pain in her hands.  It arrived on time and seems to do a great job.  The only issue with it is that it takes quite a bit longer than the \\&quot;advertised\\&quot; one hour to melt the three pounds of paraffin that come with it.  There was NOT a bad odor when it was melting or after it melt, although it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Works great, use on my husband who has severely dry cracked hands.  Plus makes my hands so silky and smooth great product and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> I have had this unit for a few weeks now and it I awesome!!! It works as directed. You do need to plan a heads bit as it takes 2hrs to heat up and 20-30min to cool down enough to not scald you when you dip your hands. For feet my only comment would be to mind your shoe size. I am a 7 1/2 and my foot fits! I mean it just fits, if your door is bigger than that you might have to scrunch your toes and do some fancy bending to get the whole thing in, but other than that this little guy is just awesome. Can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to et on.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it. She raved about how soft and smooth her hands felt. It works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it takes an hour or two to fully heat up so you have to plan ahead. Not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and bought this Paraffin bath but am very dissapointed.  I had a different one a few years ago and it melted 4 or 5 lbs of paraffin in half the time it takes this one to melt it.  It is also smaller that described.  I plan on packing it up tomorrow and returning it.</li>
            <li> Really like the parrafin bath.  It takes about an hour to warm up but it heats to a great temp!  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This unit is cheap.  Thete&#x27;s no other way to say it.  I so wanted to like this parafin warmer, but it just isn&#x27;t a quality product, and I absolutely love Revlon products, and that&#x27;s why it saddens me to say it, but it misses the mark.  I followed the instructions to the letter, and this warmer has been turned on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; for three days straight 24/7, and the three pounds of parafin STILL hasn&#x27;t melted for me to be able to use it.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  I&#x27;m giving two stars on this because it comes with the accessories and I received this unit quickly; otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, no matter the setting</li>
            <li> During the winter months, my hands get very dry and very sore. I dip them in paraffin 1 to 2 times a week and it makes all the difference. Be careful not to dip your hands in the waxwing it is very hot because it can burn.</li>
            <li> satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I love it, it can just in time for my birthday. It sure makes my hands feel silky and helps ease the arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> easy to manage temps, love the heat on my achy hands!</li>
            <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The wax heats even more quickly than the instructions suggested, though I imagine that may vary. I figured after the initial use (where you&#x27;re instructed to break up the blocks of wax before inserting), it would take longer, as it was in one solid chunk, but it heated in less than an hour and a half. I take the lid off to cool (and turn on \\&quot;warm\\&quot;) and it&#x27;s ready in the suggested 25 minutes. Yes, it&#x27;s warm, but it&#x27;s supposed to be. I have extremely sensitive skin and don&#x27;t even like showers that are too hot, but the wax was comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is the perfect size for me. I don&#x27;t use it on my feet, though there would be room (I&#x27;m a size US 8.5). My hands are considerably softer after use. I&#x27;ve even noticed a reduction in fine lines. My elbows tend to get quite rough, but even days later they feel as smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For the money this is a great product.  I have used it once a week since purchase.  The instructions say to insert your hand - not a good idea as you will contaminate the wax.  There are plastic bags and you will need to purchase a plastic spoon with a bit of a bowl to it.  Place the bag over you hand, insert the spoon into the wax warmer for a scoop of wax and pour it into the bag.  My spoon is deep enough for one scoop.  Pull the opening of the bag over your wrist then twist and secure.  Should you have any open skin on your hands/fingers it is possible to contaminate your wax then contaminate your hands or some one else&#x27;s the next time you use the wax.    I was surprised to read Revlon&#x27;s instructions to dip your hand or foot into the wax warmer - not a good idea.</li>
            <li> The directions said the paraffin would be melted in 2 hours, but after 7 hours, it still wasn&#x27;t melted.  I returned it and am looking to buy another brand to see if it will work better.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, there is a lot to consider when it comes to heating up and cooling down temperatures. But when you get used to that, the product really does soften your hands.</li>
            <li> excellent, quality, quick delivery, not expensive, takes 90 minutes to completely melt the paraffin, soothing and moisturizing, gives relief to painful hands, i add a bit more paraffin so that it easily reaches above wrists, a bit messy but i think with practice it will become less of a mess, but for now i keep a towel under the device to catch a few drips of hot wax</li>
            <li> My gosh....Paraffin treatment at the spa are expensive. I ordered this product so I can safe money going to the spa...The product works well, and my hands and feet are soft and smooth. BUT....MY GOSH, if was not for a microwave, I don&#x27;t know how long I would have to wait for the wax to melt....It is wayyy too long....Even when I mashed it into small pieces with my hands.</li>
            <li> Using for medicinal purposes. Helps relieve the pain of surgery in both hands and as a bonus makes them as soft as a baby&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> Sufficient. You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money. This one work very well.</li>
            <li> Works as instructed and smells subtly lovely.</li>
            <li> I think this product worked well for my wife&#x27;s arthritis. the only thing I would suggest, is an on/off switch. so a person would not have to unplug it. Sometimes it will be plugged into a spot that is not readily reachable.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.  If you are looking mostly for moisturizing benefits from the parrafin, I recommend putting a good lotion on before you dip in the wax.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> All items I have ordered from Amazon have been shipped very timely &amp; the products have been excellent. If it comes from Amazon I never hesitate.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, and I absolutely love it!  I like the shape of it. It&#x27;s much easier to use than the deep  round ones that make a mess with wax dripping off. NO mess with  this one!   I havent tried it yet but you can  also use it for your feet. AAHHH warm hands AND feet!  So... great shape,looks nice,works great.  It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> After recent hand surgery, deep into hand therapy, I purchased this paraffin bath to provide some pain relief (ok&#x27;d by my surgeon and OTR).  Previous hand therapists had used paraffin baths as a routine part of hand therapy, and I had always liked it.  As others may have noted, the Revlon Paraffin Bath is a bit of a bother to set up - but since I&#x27;d done my share of jam-making as a child, I melted the paraffin on the stove for the first time (do NOT do this unless you know what you are doing! paraffin is very flammable!).  I thought the temperature was too hot at Revlon&#x27;s setting of 125 degrees, but I checked online, and this is standard for paraffin baths. To make the wax feel cooler, I ended up wearing a bag over each hand before dipping, and another after dipping, as well as the mitt.  In this way I am able to reuse the paraffin - it is encased between the bags, which protect my hands from the full temperature.  The heat treatments are wonderfully comforting, reducing pain and inflammation, as well as increasing tolerance for exercise. I like smoothing on [[ASIN:B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream Facial Treatment, 4 Ounce]] for a wonderful hand spa treatment!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always review a product but others reviewing this product really helped to make my decision and I thank them for this.  I ordered the Revlon Paraffin Bath because my hands are always cold and terribly dry.  I also ordered the six pounds of unscented wax for two reasons, 1) one review indicated that the wax that came with the machine was scented and I am not fond of a lot of scents and 2) some indicated that three pounds that came with the unit were not enough wax starting out. The unscented wax that I ordered comes in tiny little balls, easier to melt than a large chunk that came with the machine.  Again, because of the many positive reviews and low price, I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived as promised and in perfect condition. The wax that came with it had to me a terrible scent and I was really glad I had ordered the extra unscented wax.  I used the machine the next day.  (Used 4 pounds of wax) Read directions twice, not really difficult but since this was my first time to use a warm wax machine, thought it was wise to do this.  Followed directions and it was wonderful.  My hands felt so nice and cozy with the liners and warm mits.  I dipped in the warm wax five times and kept the liners and mits on for about ten minutes.  When I peeled the wax off, my hands felt wonderful, during and after use.  I even think there are less lines on my hands.  It felt soo good, I did this twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend the Revlon Paraffin Bath to anyone considering buying it (along with the unscented wax).  By the way, I ordered some additional liners, some came with the unit but I am sure it won&#x27;t take me too long to go through them.</li>
            <li> I have had surgery on my hand. This wax treatment helps me to get through my exercises with more movement. I heat my hand up with the hot wax and it helps me move my fingers a lot better. Also it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. At 68 that is wonderful. Good product, I love it. The Doctor says he is very&lt;br /&gt;happy with the results I have had. Also thanks to therapy for&lt;br /&gt;giving me the wax treatments. My machine was a lot less cost then&lt;br /&gt;the one therapy has. Good luck to anyone who buys this machine.&lt;br /&gt;Just to let you know the kit comes with its own wax because it have lanoline in it, this stops the wax from burning the skin. It was also easy to use amazon.</li>
            <li> You must use this at a very hot temperature in order to have usable wax. This takes a very long time to heat up and if you try to leave it on &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; the wax hardens and you have to wait another hour to use it again.  I am surprised at how much you must endure and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GOOD AND MELTS FAST THE PARAFFIN</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mother.  She had the same item since the early 1980&#x27;s and it finally gave out so this was a replacement.  Was so happy that Revlon still made the paraffin bath.  My mother is 86 years old and has problems with her hands including recent surgery.  This paraffin bath is just the right thing to keep her skin soft and smooth and make her hands feel better.  She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. The first time we used it , 2hours for the wax to melt and it still had small solid pieces. We tried it 2 more times-over 3hours and it was 70% melted.  We are returning.  The wax felt good and the gloves fit my husband as did the bath. Too bad it took too long to melt wax.</li>
            <li> I made the best decision when I bought this product. Hellp me in differents ways. My skin looks to much better and relive my pains in my hands  for my arthritis. I started to use one time in a week but you can use it daily and is fantastic. Very easy to use and the best, you don&#x27;t need to go to any beauty salon and pay a lot of money for the treatment.  Also, leave a nice fragrance in your skin. I recommended this product 100%.</li>
            <li> I like best that the lid doesn&#x27;t clasp on. This unit meets all my requirements. Thanks VG</li>
            <li> I really like the item -- it takes a couple of hours for the paraffin wax to warm up -- but as long as you give yourself time and make sure to use it at least a few times a week -- - it does seem to help my hands</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a great product. The first one I got was damaged; I do not know if it was from the manufacturer or from the postman. Nevertheless, test your product as soon as you get it! Also, I love that it came with all the things you need to get started. Thank you!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t understand the review that it took 6 hours to melt the wax.  the wax would be boiling by then.  it took all of 1.5 hours to melt.  the 3 lbs. it comes with is plenty.  in fact i turned my unit down to the \\&quot;keep warm\\&quot; temp and it was the perfect temp at the 2 hour mark.  my hands were aching from varnishing and painting and planting all day.  they were actually white from using gasoline to get the stain and varnish off my hands and dried out.  after 20 min of soaking my hands in 3 layers of wax, i couldn&#x27;t believe they were the same hands i put in the mitts to start.  they were soft and felt incredible.  i love this machine!!!  don&#x27;t hesitate to get this if you are debating.  you won&#x27;t regret it.  the toughest thing about the whole set up was getting the freaking wax out of the plastic wrap and breaking it up.  but i don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff.</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk. It gets so hot it burns your hands!</li>
            <li> Product heated within 2hrs and worked great. Very easy to use and store. Helped with joint pain and dryness. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed.  I had ordered a \\&quot;new\\&quot; product but the one I received looked like it had been used and whoever repacked it did not so nice a repacking job.  We have not used it and may return it.  How long do I have to be able to return it?</li>
            <li> I purchased another brand from Wal-Mart, first.  It was a disaster!  So I tried the Revlon unit.  Like night and day!  This product does just what it claims and my wife loves it!  I would not hesitate to recomend it!</li>
            <li> The Revlon Paraffin Bath is an excellent product.....clean, nice-smelling, easy to use.  It does take longer than I would like for the wax to melt....at least 2 hours....but the wait is worth it.</li>
            <li> This product took 4 hours to melt the was fully which means it was not ready for my spa party 😞. However, once melted it was fine.</li>
            <li> This hot wax bath is easy to use and is helpful in easing the pain in my arthritic hands.  My only objection to its use is that it takes over two hours to melt the wax and get to a useable temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help my arthritic hands.  It does what it promises, heating up paraffin for dipping.  Unfortunately for me, I didn&#x27;t get that much relief from it.  It takes awhile to melt the wax, and after dipping your hands or feet in it, you have to sit still for awhile, something I don&#x27;t do very well, so for me it requires planning ahead - something else I don&#x27;t do very well.  I have only used it once, and as I said, it does do what it promises.  I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s a good product for me.  I figure if I don&#x27;t use it for my arthritis, I can always melt wax for candle making - lol.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this paraffin bath and appreciate the gloves that come with it.  Just a few concerns - don&#x27;t like the smell of the wax and was glad I had ordered extra Gigi Vanilla wax.  Also the wax that comes with it is not enough to fill it, so I used one more extra.  Also was surprised it takes so long to warm up, so I leave it plugged in most of the time.  Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good idea but don&#x27;t like to wait for hours for it to heat.</li>
            <li> As described - thanks.</li>
            <li> No on-off switch.  Must remove plug from wall outlet.  Temperature control not very precise.  Bowel for the paraffin is not very deep, does not cover much of the foot, even with 3 lbs of paraffin.  The device does not get the paraffin very hot.  All-in-all, not very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> omg this was a gift for my daughter she left it out for all of us to dip our hand and it does wonder for arthritis wonderful when i can i will geet one for me love love love it</li>
            <li> No longer have split skin on my fingers. No problem with it being too hot and the mits are a great addition to the kit</li>
            <li> Great product super fast delivery Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the perfect machine for paraffin wax. It&#x27;s easy to use and melts the wax in the timely manner as it&#x27;s supposed to. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because , it could be a bit deeper to get my hand in fully and the minimal directions.&lt;br /&gt;Using this for arthritis in hands, so , guidance would be nice in what setting to keep the wax at before dipping my hands in.  Also , what is the purpose of the plastic insert that fits the bottom with the holes in it? it says in the little multi-language paper to take it off and add wax and turn on , wax should melt in about 2 hours?  No explanation for gloves and baggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned this to full power and melted wax in under 2 hours . I cut the wax into about 12 pieces each. it melted nice and evenly, and I turn the heat down to about the 4th notch to set for a bit before I stick my hands in.  So far so good. No burns. I do need to keep twisting my hands around to coat them.  Should I be leaving them in?  It seems like that would be too hot.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I bought it mainly to see if it would help with my husband&#x27;s arthritis (which it has), but I find myself using it more than he does!  It does take a while for the wax to melt, but other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like the size, and that it came with wax&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t take long to heat up&lt;br /&gt;like the color. .</li>
            <li> Good quality product! Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Hands hurt?  This will soften your skin and hold heat on your hands.  Helps to relax and stops arthritis ache.</li>
            <li> Shape is nice; allows me to get my entire hand in for therapy. It heats quickly (faster than other brands) but does get too hot so it&#x27;s important to follow the instructions to cut back on the heat at a certain point.</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;Effective&lt;br /&gt;Simple to Use&lt;br /&gt;Soothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Uses&lt;br /&gt;Daily Uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the difficulty people commented on how long it took to melt the wax..it was very,very easy..would recommend breaking into small pieces rather than placing the bars whole..it literally took an hour to melt the wax..I use it on my hands..had surgery and it&#x27;s sooo soothing not to mention my hand feels soft and smooth after..it&#x27;s a wonderful product and it&#x27;s the only one that comes with the mits so you don&#x27;t have to purchase the mits separately..the price of $34 was perfect..since I&#x27;m the only one that uses the machine I replace the used wax into the parrafin bath to conserve the wax..you won&#x27;t be disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> My step mom has one of these an i remember always using it when i would visit my dad. her is professional and this one works just as well. i absolutely love it. It takes about 3 hours to fully melt the wax to use. the wax is pretty hot when you dip your hand in. i turned it to the lowest setting to let the wax cool down and after a while it actually hardened up to hard to use. i use the cool setting when i keep the machine on for a couple days so that way when i want to use it i just turn it to hot. this was the best bday gift ive ever gotten myself and i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this!!!!!  It heats up in slightly under 2 hours.  I use it for pain relief, but it does make my hands softer.  I am not crazy about smelly things in general.  The smell of the wax that came with it is alright.  I prefer unscented things.  In general it was easy to set up and the directions were easy to follow.  I only use it for my hands, but I can get my foot in it.  I put my foot in just to measure before I set up the bath.  There was about 4 inches left front to back of my foot at the widest part of the bath.  I wear a 6 or 6 1/2 shoe.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased at all with this product. I purchased it at the behest of my physical therapist for a finger injury. I was told to dip it in 10 times and then cover and wait for 10 minutes. My hand is softer however I am not pleased with how it works. I even purchased extra wax so that I could dip it in easily and with it being my pinky only I was dipping I thought would be easier. I turn it on and heat it for two hours then have to turn on low for 30 minutes. I have to set a timer because if I don&#x27;t get it at the 30 minute mark it is too solid for me to did my finger in. There is no off button so you have to unplug it every time as well. I wish the warmer setting would keep it warm enough that it stayed melted but not to hot to be used. I tried it first with the wax that came with it and then added the extra lb I purchased thinking that might make it better but it is still to shallow to dip my hand unless it is sideways. There is no way you could dip your foot as the opening is too small. If it were local I would honestly return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> When I take the trouble to set this up for use it is very helpful. If it had a switch on the cord and a temperature control I would give it 4 stars. Take care to unplug the unit and give it a moment to cool a bit before putting your hand into the wax.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice since it was delivered.  It makes my hands feel soft and helps to take the knuckle pain away!</li>
            <li> I just am not that crazy about it.  Takes hours to heat the wax and then it hardened quickly when you unplud it.</li>
            <li> The Revlon hand wax bath is perfect for dry, rough hands or feet.  I use mine daily year round and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The wax gets just the right temperature for me.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The item arrived within a couple days.  It took a couple hours to heat the wax,even after breaking it up as directions instructed.  Like the rain smelling wax,but it is rather strong,will try the lavender wax.  My hands feel great when dipping,leaves hands  soft and oily so rub in oil.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for great price.</li>
            <li> Bought this as the gift. Heats up in under 2 hours. Can leave it on on the low setting. I recommend using the low setting after melting the wax. It is still tolerable on the higher heat but may bother sensitive hands. I used it also for hands, feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> Did not get warm like it should wax barely melted, Was very disappointed threw in the trash . You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I like it. The wax melted faster than other posters said so that was good. My hands were soft after and soothed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it all winter and hopefully not get cracked hands this year.</li>
            <li> First let me say I love having this for my hands and feet. Both have arthritis.  As time has gone by I have to move to lower and lower dial set. When I first got it I was right in middle, but it gets hotter now and I am only two clicks from lowest setting. Just watch and be careful not to get burned.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  Three women are very happy now that we had a family hand spa Hot Parafin Wax day.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love it, heats up fast and makes your feet and hands feel oh, so good!</li>
            <li> Works fine. Can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it. Takes a while to heat up if you don&#x27;t leave it on but they all do. So, If you want to save electricity, turn it off when you are not using it and plan ahead to give it time to heat up.  Why pay more? Nice,  well-designed product. The only improvement I could suggest is to maybe put it on a heavy-duty timer that would handle the load, for preheating this appliance, if you use it on a regular daily basis, or else have the maid get it ready for you.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected. Temperature had to stay on high setting to keep wax melted but then it was to hot to put your hand in. Item was returned</li>
            <li> Although the product looks well made, I was very disappointed to see that it came with \\&quot;Rainforest\\&quot; scented wax. I did not see reference to a scent anywhere in the product listing and therefore assumed it was unscented. I melted the wax, hoping the scent wouldn&#x27;t be too bad. But as my whole house filled with an intense perfume I was forced to get the wax unit out of my house! Now I&#x27;ll need to go order unscented wax before I can use it.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands so I purchased this item hoping it could alleviate some of the pain.  The wax is difficult to break up to place in the unit especially for someone with arthritis.  It takes FOREVER for the wax to melt and then when it starts to cool off enough so it won&#x27;t burn your hands it begins to harden too quickly. Huge waist of time and money!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after using it at my sisters house.  I garden and wash my hands a lot in hot water so my hands take a beating almost daily.  Not to mention the usual dryness that comes with the cold winter weather.  My hands would get sore and dry. Using this a few days in a row I&#x27;d be brand new. I still haven&#x27;t had to buy anymore paraffin yet and I&#x27;ve used it about 15 times for My hands only.. The only draw back is that it takes an hour or more to melt so you have to plan ahead to use it.the plastic bags and warming mitts work well to keep in the heat. I even reuse the plastic gloves. I would recommend this as a nice gift for some one.  It seems like something you can do with out.  When I bought it for myself it seemed kind of frivolous but I am so glad to have it now.  I would use it every night if I could remember to plug in.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of other reviews but this is great. I have to wonder if others have ever had a paraffin warmer before. It actually heated a little faster than most. Its 3 pounds of wax... It takes a while. You control the tempeture of the wax. I like mine the hottest for my arthritis. I&#x27;m very happy with mine. I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> Quite nice. I&#x27;m stuck in a wheelchair after an accident and my hands ache terribly each night. A few dips in some hot paraffin has really helped cut down on the pain. I like the scent of this paraffin too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice but takes over 3  hours to melt the wax.  The wax that came with it smells very good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this paraffin bath as treatment for my sever tendonitis in my wrist and permanently sprained ankle on the recommendation of my physio therapist ( didn&#x27;t recommend this bath specifically just the treatment) After looking in every store I could think of and not finding one, I turned to amazon. After some researching I chose this bath as it came with the hand mitts, plastic liners, wax and an adjustable heat level. I was very happy when it arrived that my pain might finally be  eased only to find that the wax was very heavily scented rain scent, whatever that means. I only cut a small hole in the bag when I had an immediately allergic reaction to the scent. The listing made no reference to the wax being scented, let alone so heavily scent. So I have been unable to use it until the unscented wax I had to order to replace this wax arrives. Which leaves me very disappointed. It wouldn&#x27;t have been  hard to include the scent info in the listing, so I could have gotten unscented wax at the same time. So I can&#x27;t rate the spa in anyway as the smell has prevented me from using it.    Ok, so I have now gotten the unscented wax and used the spa several time. I can highly recommend it. It really helped my tendonitis. It also  helped my mother-in-laws rheumatoid arthritis so much that we got her one for mother&#x27;s day. It is just wonderful and not being in constant pain is the best. I would rate it a 5 star with plain wax and still 2 as it comes.</li>
            <li> This is beyond wonderful for the hands.  It keeps them soft and really helps reduce my arthritis pain.  I would hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> My hands need it especially during winter ... the wax melted quite quickly for me, the secret to that is to break it up into smaller pieces, they you don&#x27;t have to wait for hours ... it melted right away.  I love it enough that I put my feet in it also .. they really needed&lt;br /&gt;it although my large feet did not fit as well, however smaller feet would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought one of these for my sister who has arthritis in her hands, so I bought it for that reason.  Anyway with arthritis in hands and feet should try it, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this! It works as described. Just wish it was a little bigger for my boyfriends feet. The average man feet will not fit in here.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago because I did surgury on my  wrist.I only used it twice because I was going to the therapy ,now my therapy&lt;br /&gt;sessions are complete and need to use my parafin bath,I notice that the power, and the heat light comes on, the wax melted, but the light gages doesn&#x27;t comes on ,it just keeps the high hot temperature.I can&#x27;t put my hand in it because it&#x27;s too hot. I am so disappointed I am thinking of returning it. Is there anything anyone can advise me to ? Overall I would love it.</li>
            <li> Great value sent as a gift and it was very well recieved!!  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> bought this product from Ulta after exposing my hands to fiberglass.  It got the fiber glass got of my hands beautifully but I found that the product did not come with enough wax, I couldn&#x27;t get more that two dips with out my hand touching the bottom of the vessel.  Also I did not like the wax that came with it, i found &amp;#34;rain scent&amp;#34; a bit offensive, and it left my hands extremly greasy.  Bottom line, I did not find this product therapeutic in the least but it was able to do what i bought it for.  Bottom line, I would recommend if you are willing to spend extra money for more, less greasy wax, before use.</li>
            <li> I got this for my tendinitis in my wrist.  It holds in the heat really well.</li>
            <li> What was I expecting for under $40? I&#x27;m a massage therapist who suffers from occasional tendinitis and arthritis in my joints, so after doing a little research on the benefits of melted paraffin, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Plus, I didn&#x27;t want to have to spend $150 for other models advertised here on Amazon. I have three chief complaints. 1) Once melted, and your hand is dipped, it doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long, even after several dippings and with the glove, 2) When finished with one hand, there&#x27;s barely enough wax left to soak another hand, and this is mostly because, 3) the basin is way too shallow and doesn&#x27;t hold enough wax. I do not have big hands or big feet, but neither could fit into this small unit comfortably and completely cover my hand or foot. The directions say to put the unit on &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; after the paraffin has melted, but this does not work because it begins to solidify only leaving a small pool of melted wax in the middle. As a plus, I will say the paraffin felt good on the hands and it did peel off easily. If and when I get the money, I will splurge on the more expensive unit that Amazon offers. But right now, I&#x27;m hoping that Amazon will let me return this unit because it&#x27;s simply not useful enough. Bottom line: I do not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of my rehab for a hand injury. It has been great. Not as expensive as most but it gets the job done. You have to melt the wax on high and then turn it down to warm about an hour before use so that the wax is not too hot. It take a little planning to be able to use it consistently but it is worth it. My pain level and range of motion after getting this are night and day.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  It was a HUGE hit, one of the first things out of the box and immediately plugged in.  She gave the paraffin treatment to anyone who would let her on Christmas DAY!  I bought the refills of was and extra gloves, glad I did.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this it the red light wouldn&#x27;t  turn on. I left it alone then tried again, it turned on. 5 minutes later it was off again. Pos</li>
            <li> This product has been great no leaks but does take the full two hours to warm up.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s largest enough to do your feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who said it was really good, but not completely perfect.  She said it does do what it is supposed to do and helps her.</li>
            <li> Revlon RVSP3501B1 Moisturestay Quick Heat Paraffin Bath It made hands very smooth, especially after i did it twice. needed all three bars for usage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because this was supposed to be a \\&quot;controlled heat\\&quot; unit.  It is not.  It is either hot or hot.</li>
            <li> The first one I got was cracked and broken in front but the return process was super easy and the replacement was shipped and delivered right away. The new one seems to work perfectly, my doctor recommended I get one for pain I have in my hands and it works great! I wasn&#x27;t sure it would help that much but it really does, I&#x27;m very happy that I got this!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend with arthritis of the hands;  I set it up for her, tried it myself, and thought it was Great!!  She only did it once herself, and said she is &#x27;too lazy&#x27; to bother doing it.  As an older nurse, I recall using them years ago, with success, with my patients ----it is my friend&#x27;s loss that she chooses not to use it -- no reflection on the product.</li>
            <li> This item is not as promised. Takes way to long to heat up. Tried to return. Supplier did not respond to me for return it refund.DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It replaces one I had which I gave to my daughter. I Like it for soothing my arthritic hands. No cure, of course, but a temporary relief.</li>
            <li> Worked well, heated well. I would buy this again if I needed another one.  A good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> This product failed to work out of the box. After leaving it on high heat for 8 hours, there was still unmelted paraffin in the unit. Also, I wear a woman&#x27;s side 11 shoe and this unit, when filled according to directions, is too short for my feet. I am returning the unit.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to melt the wax which is to be expected, but I do like this bath. I buy canning wax, soooo much cheaper and I add one small bottle of the fragrant oil (Walmart sells these in their candle aisle) for a wonderful smell. Canning wax is at Walmart also.</li>
            <li> We order this one as a gift!  My wife was so pleased with hers, we order of one for a friend.  The product was delivered on time without any complications.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this item to soften her hands. She delivers mail and it soothes her hands after working outside during the Winter &amp; Fall days. She would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Its bad not good product because when i opened  its switch on after 5 minutes its switch off and the parrafin no lt melt</li>
            <li> Takes a couple hours to heat up, but otherwise a great tool for hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife...she loved it arrived in 2 days worked great she was up all night playing with it. Any man who has a wife that likes trying to get her skin soft here u go I promise u can&#x27;t go wrong very happy</li>
            <li> This is my first paraffin bath and I love it.  Big enough to get my whole hand with fingers open and up to my wrist.  Hands look and feel great after using.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT, SOOTHING AND IMPROVES SKIN TONE. EASY TO USE. CLEANS UP FAST. RECOMMENDED  FOR IMPRVIIIING AND RELAXING YOUR HANDS</li>
            <li> The product more than met my expectations,  Everything needed to get started is included with the paraffin bath.  The only change I would make, is add the ability to lock it so it would be easier and safer to move from one location to another.  However, other than that, the product meets all of my needs.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase experience, delivery and product. Use frequently to soak hands to relieve&lt;br /&gt;soreness and stiffness in hands due to arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> I have some nerve damage combined with arthritis in my hands.  There are some days when they ache and burn more than others.  My physical therapist suggested I try a paraffin bath.  The feeling I get after I give my hands a bath in the paraffin is absolute heaven.  Now if I could just find a way to make the feeling last all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Really Great Product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could even give this one star, let alone 5. I purchased one &amp; returned it the very next day.    First off, the unit took a couple hours to melt the 3 lbs. of supplied wax. Then I had to wait another hour or so for the wax to cool enough to \\&quot;safely\\&quot; dip my hand.     At that point, the wax had started to solidify around the sides, leaving a very small pool of wax directly over the center of the bottom heating plate. This meant I had to ball up my hand to insert into the still liquid wax. It was almost unbearably hot! I got a few quick dips in but because my hand was in a fist, the wax started cracking off before I could shove my hand into the plastic liner. Trying to get the 2nd hand in the liner meant completely cracking the wax on the 1st hand.  My teenage daughter couldn&#x27;t dip her hands at all, it was just too hot. Letting it cool longer left the wax was too solidified to dip. How useless.    Even with the mitts on, the heat didn&#x27;t last long at all. It wasn&#x27;t therapeutic at all. My skin was slightly softer but I suspect I could get the same results by putting a moisture cream on my hands, putting plastic baggies on them, then dipping in warm water for 10 min.    I have heard the more expensive units, such as Therabath, perform well, so perhaps I&#x27;ll try one of those in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon Paraffin Bath for my wife. The first one came damaged. I contacted the company and immediately was given instructions for returning at their expense and the option of my money back or another machine. Due to their promptness, I decided to try another one. It works wonderfully, according to my wife. This is probably the easiest I have ever had it in returning a product. And since my wife likes the paraffin bath very much, I am happy.</li>
            <li> It is spectacular. I love it for my carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li> Great order! Thank you</li>
            <li> Love it! I can have the spa experience at home without paying a spa price! I have arthritis in my hands and this feels so wonderful.  Best darn thing since sliced bread and pumpkin pie !</li>
            <li> It takes 2+ hours for the wax to melt then maybe 1 hour for it to safely cool down to use. You have to be available at the right time to use it.  However, it took 2 days of heating then melting to clean it up to return.</li>
            <li> I only used this a couple of times- It just seemed like so much trouble and the heat didn&#x27;t last that long.  Maybe it was just we, but I just couldn&#x27;t get into it.</li>
            <li> Just got it, plugged it in and already it is NOT working. The red light goes on and off spontaneously and it takes forever to melt the wax... Probably because the heater is not working. Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to heat up.</li>
            <li> Heated 3 pounds of paraffin within 2 hours. I was hesitant since so many people complained about the unit not heating and melting the paraffin for hours, but it took 2 hrs like it said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sucks that the paraffin refills are so expensive though...</li>
            <li> It really works. I leave it on all the time so that I do not have to wait for wax to melt each time I want to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for therapeutic reasons more than cosmetic.  I have arthritis in my hands and found that this was helpful.  I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of Revlon&#x27;s Paraffin Bath and very pleased with the purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> A couple reviews mentioned how objectionally strongly the supplied wax smells. I also ordered plain wax. Filling it for the first time, I accidentally put a small amount of one package of the supplied wax, before I was overwhelmed with the scent and filled it with the plain wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax I&#x27;m using is now lightly scented, not too objectionable, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose it. The wax takes several hours to melt. I like the results, but as I can&#x27;t leave it on to keep the wax melted, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly. Wish I had known that the product could not be plugged in continuously. Instead, two plus hours before intended use, need to plug it in, and turn it to high. After the paraffin melts - it takes over two hours, then, it is necessary to turn down the heat, and wait for at least 35 minutes. Actually, longer, because several times it has been too hot. The paraffin supplied was enough for one filling, and the internal design did not seem to allow all of the paraffin to melt - there would be areas on the top that did not fully melt down. All in all, an inexpensive and not too useful product.</li>
            <li> It takes about six hours to get the wax to the maximum temperature. I don&#x27;t understand why they would call it \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot;. I bought the unit so I could have heat treatments for my hands. I have Dupuytrens Syndrome which is a painful tendon/ligament condition. I dip my hands five times to get a good thick layer that will stay hot so the heat can soak into my joints. I use the plastic gloves then the mittens. I am satisfied that the unit can stay hot enough to keep the wax melted and at a good hot temperature but the amount of wax shipped with the unit was inadequate. The unit comes with three pounds of wax but needs to be at least six so one can dip the hands without getting too near the element. I use Gulf wax to fill the unit. The wax is a home canning product and with the addition of 1/2 cup of medium weight mineral oil will stay at the desired temperature for an indefinite time. The wax is cheaper than anything on the internet or beauty supply houses. I get it at the grocery store where the canning jars are sold. The mineral oil leaves the hands soft and supple and it assists with removing the wax after a treatment. Just shake the hands in the supplied plastic gloves and the wax fall off to be reused if desired or disposed of in the plastic gloves. My wife uses the unit to soften her heels after a day in work shoes. She dips her heels three times, I wrap her feet in plastic wrap, she tip toes to the bed and then I wrap her feet in soft towels to hold the heat for as long as possible. The temperature control actually works to cool the wax if the maximum temperature is too hot. One can drop the temperature so the wax can skin over for transport to another room.</li>
            <li> Early arthritis runs in my family, but words can&#x27;t really express how devastated I was to find my fingers stiff and aching at 35.  It was physically painful, occupationally problematic as my typing slowed down (my job involves a lot of digital communication), and just completely depressing to feel old and like my body was falling apart and was never going to be \\&quot;whole\\&quot; again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember that my mother used to use a paraffin bath (she had it early too), so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it took forever for the wax to heat up.  Easily 5+ hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I type this, my fingers don&#x27;t ache, for the first time in months.  I forgot what it was like to have flexibility in my fingers and no typing ache.  That&#x27;s all that matters.  I fee this huge sigh of relief to be ache free and know that it&#x27;s not a lost cause.  I can do this - I can dip my hands in wax for 10-15 minutes once or twice a day.  That won&#x27;t kill me.  I can do it while I watch TV or relax when I get home.  It&#x27;s manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like commenting on the melting time (slow) or the scent (NICE!!! - rain actually smells like post-rain outdoors) or the effect on skin (Smooth!  This is an oily wax and my skin feels soft and moisturized) or the heating unit (plastic, but doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as it could be, and it&#x27;s substantial enough)  is so tangential to the fact that my fingers don&#x27;t ache.  But I just included my thoughts on the other things regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  I fully expect it to last a long time, but even if I had to replace it every week, I would. If it cost a $1000 I&#x27;d pay it.  If you&#x27;ve got those achy fingers and hands, you know that a day of freedom from that is kind of priceless.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as an exchange gift  but received one as a gift. I have used it 3x&#x27;s so far. You MUST read the direction to be sure you don&#x27;t hurt yourself.  The important piece is to melt the wax and then turn the temp down for 1/2 hr before immersing your hands or feet in the wax. Also dip your hand in take it  out dip again 2more times and then wrap. the coating is thicker than. The only draw back is the vesicle is too small for large feet. But boy were my hands and feet soft!</li>
            <li> very messy, wax did not stay ;liquid.  Found it on  everything--including my floors.  Relief and smoothness expected from soaking  was not as expected.</li>
            <li> Like that you can control the temperature and leave&lt;br /&gt;It on</li>
            <li> Basically, I&#x27;ve been really happy w/this product.  Some of the downsides are inherent to melting wax--you have to plan about 2- 2 1/2 hours ahead when you want to use the paraffin bath, but it melts considerably faster than most of the home products on the market.  (It takes 1 1/2-2 hours to melt the wax &amp; then 1/2 hour to cool it to proper &amp;#34;dipping&amp;#34; temperature).  If you reuse the wax, the paraffin bath is to be cleaned after 20 uses &amp; the paraffin discarded.  (Or, if you discard the wax every time, then it&#x27;s to be cleaned after 40 uses.)  I didn&#x27;t realize this before I received the product.  The cleaning process doesn&#x27;t sound particularly difficult (I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to do this yet), but it does increase the cost of the unit when you factor in the replacement of the wax.  Still, I would have made the purchase.  I can&#x27;t imagine discarding the wax every time as the dipping process uses quite a bit of wax--about 1/4 of the wax that comes w/the machine is used w/each use; but for single-person use, I can&#x27;t imagine any reason to discard the wax each time.  I noticed from some of the reviews that there is some confusion about how to use the bath.  The plastic rack is to be removed from the container before the 1st use &amp; then the broken-up blocks of paraffin that come w/the machine are placed directly into the container (no liners of any sort).  Once the paraffin has melted (approx 2 hours) the plastic rack goes back into the container (it protects the body part from the heat source) &amp; stays there until you are ready to clean the machine (20-40 uses later).</li>
            <li> It is a bit small but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Takes a long while to warm up, like 3 hours, but it works well.  Arrived fine, box a little ripped up but not the sellers fault.</li>
            <li> this does the trick when my hands ache but it is so slow to heat up and I wish it had a thermometer built in.  still it was ok for the price. Buy 2 or 3 pounds more wax though and canning wax works fine.</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended paraffin treatment for my arthritis.  I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a more expensive bath without testing out the effective of this treatment method.  This is the highest rated paraffin machine under $50 and after reading the reviews it seems like a good and inexpensive test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is exactly as described, does a good job and easy to use.  Machine is sturdy but obviously for home use and not commercial quality.  Very satisfied with the number of accessories this comes with as it allows me to test out the machine immediately after open box.  This comes with 3 lbs of wax, once melted, I dipped my hands but it doesn&#x27;t even cover my wrist.  So I recommend ordering more wax so you can dip past your wrist and be able to use this machine daily.  I already placed an order for another 24lbs. of lavender wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment is a success and I will continue to use this machine until it no longer works before considering the more expensive Therabath product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: In order to melt the wax quicker, I placed a folded towel in a large pot with lukewarm water and placed the 3lbs of wax on top of the towel over medium heat.  The wax was about 30% melted by when the water boiled so I opened the package and poured that into the paraffin bath, set to high heat.  I think this dramatically decreased the melting time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far but it performed exactly as described. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is with the people who have complained about the wax taking a long time to melt - I think maybe they didn&#x27;t read the directions and/or didn&#x27;t have it turned to high for the melting process. I followed the directions and it took 2 hrs to melt the wax - just like the directions said. I waited another 30 mins for it to cool and it was perfect. It&#x27;s a wonderful item for the price! I got it to relieve arthritis pain in my thumb but I dipped both hands and they were SO soft afterwards! I&#x27;m going to do this at least once a week just for that!</li>
            <li> Purchased this wax bath unit for my wife to help relieve arthritis in her hands&lt;br /&gt;She complained that the wax was too hot...I moved the control to the far left, lowest&lt;br /&gt;setting and waited.  She still complained about the temperature as burning.&lt;br /&gt;I got a probe thermometer and checked the temp...It was 132F at the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;I believe most wax treatments are comfortable at about 125F.</li>
            <li> The wax smells bad but it is otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> It has to be on high heat to melt then you have to turn it down and let the wax cool before you can use it. It takes multiple hours to use it. Once set it works great to soften haves and feet.</li>
            <li> We have absolutely no complaints about this, other than it&#x27;s a bit too small to easily coat wrists along with hands, &amp; my gf&#x27;s wrists are a part of her problem.  With a substantial amount of wax, to coat as much of the wrist as possible, it takes a full three hours to melt and the final temperature is about 140 degrees F, too hot for most.  Turning it off for about 40 minutes drops it to about 130 degrees which is what we use.  Another 20 or 30 minutes brings it down to about 120 degrees where it begins to solidify.  We only use it twice or three times a week so we don&#x27;t leave it on.  However I put a kill-a-watt on it &amp; it&#x27;s drawing about 70 watts while it&#x27;s heating so leaving it on shouldn&#x27;t be a big expense.  The mitts are adequate.  We have no regrets about buying this unit one month after purchase.  Three months after purchase is another story.  The thing simply stopped working.  For a week or two it took a lot longer to melt the wax.  Now it&#x27;s stopped working entirely, leaving the unit on for five to six hours  (power and heating lights lit) leaves the unit stone cold.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely paraffin bath! I had owned a couple different brands previous to this, and I think this has the best construction, ease of use and customizable heat settings of any of them! It will take awhile to heat up (2-3 hours), so completely spontaneous use is not really possible. However, knowing that, you can turn it on when you go out to work in the yard or when you get home from work and have it ready when you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked mine, which I bought locally, so much that I bought one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s day, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> The wax gets very hot even on the lowest setting. I have to melt the wax and then turn off the warmer to ,et it cool for a bit before using.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have arthritis in both hands which at times can be very painful.  I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh. you have to try this.</li>
            <li> The wife likes it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if she would like it or not, so I took a gamble. She likes it and it has helped the cracking in her fingers.</li>
            <li> It feels great. It has a lot of &amp;#34;don&#x27;t do this&amp;#34; and don&amp;#34;t do that&amp;#34; associated with it that makes it not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Thus far, it is too hot to use and when I turn it down, it begins to solidify again even though the instructions say to turn it down. I&#x27;m still playing with it but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I love this and have used it a few times. My only recommendation is to buy lots of extra wax at the same time. The wax that comes with is one &amp;#34;serving&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Have not tried this product yet, but it really did not tell you what came with the paraffin bath.  It comes with mitts, plastic gloves and paraffin.  Glad that I only purchased extra paraffin and not the gloves, etc. to go with.  Could have saved money had I known.</li>
            <li> The product works great, everything you need was included in the original box. Takes two hours to head the wax, but well worth the wait. I&#x27;ve used it personally for my arthritis relief; my daughter used it for a bachelorette party. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> ..this is a good little paraffin bath! Just the right size for home use. I didn&#x27;t find the wax to have any foul odor - not sure why others have said that. This works great. If your feet are too big, just take the oil and put in the bag and insert your foot into the bag. Keeps the remaining wax clean, and serves the same purpose. It&#x27;s heaven!</li>
            <li> If you lead an active lifestyle using your hands for gripping weights, or doing the pull up bar, this bath is perfect for adding the right amount of therapy for your hands after a tiring workout.  The next day, I feel my hands have never even had the tightness it had like when I didn&#x27;t have this bath.  So far, I added 3lbs of Gulf Wax to the bath, in addition to the 3lbs of scented wax that comes with it and can dip my hand deeper to have my wrists in too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 minutes of keeping my hand in the glove, I take off the wax and massage my hand to get the knots out...and it takes less time than without the parraffin therapy and hurts less too.  The results are longer lasting and when I wake in the morning, I have no cramps in my hand.  I plan to do this therapy every weekend, as I know in the long run of doing this self care, my hands will thank me for it.  Hope you enjoy yours!</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly when it was supposed to. Not the seller&#x27;s fault UPS decided to not ring the bell or knock or anything. Even though the wax was pretty cold from being outside it still only took about 2 hours for it to melt and be usable. It has a scent, but neither my husband or I were bothered by it, it&#x27;s a slightly floral scent, not too girly, but there. There is no indications of leaking or anything going wrong yet, and I&#x27;m hopeful. All in all we&#x27;re pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I had it for 3 days and loved it until I saw wax beneath it and on the edge of the counter... what I thought was evaporation was actually dripping beneath it... ugh... spend the extra money... wish I had.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this paraffin bath for me for Christmas.  My niece helped him decide on this particular paraffin bath because it was \\&quot;quick heat\\&quot;.  Well, the instructions say to add the wax to the machine, turn the heat on high and wait for 120 minutes and then to let the wax cool for an additional 30 minutes.  Hmm, doesn&#x27;t sound \\&quot;quick\\&quot; to me.  I&#x27;d have to plan my whole day around using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would send it back to Amazon except something inside the package had leaked and the box and all contents were covered with oil so I don&#x27;t have the original box.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. The plastic bags for the hands are of poor quality though, the seam on the bottom comes apart and your hand will go all the way thru. Have begun to scotch tape all bottom seals to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands in the winter and purchase this to see if it could help the painful cracks on my fingers. Although it has not seemed to have much effect on the cracks, my hands are softer and doing this late at night before going to bed is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product does a great job helps out a lot</li>
            <li> The only barrier preventing me from giving this unit a 5-star review is the amount of time it takes to warm up. Give yourself about an hour if it&#x27;s pretty full of wax. You have to plan in advance, there&#x27;s no room for spontaneity here. Besides that, it does an excellent job. The wax gets hot but not so hot that you&#x27;ll burn yourself. (The plastic safety tray at the bottom of the unit is also a nice added safety measure.) My hands are terribly dry in the winter, cracked and bleeding at times (and they hurt too). This has been a lifesaver. I soften my hands in warm water first, then slather with Gold Bond Healing Hand Cream. Dip them in the hot wax 10-15 times each and cover in baggies and mitts. I sit on the couch for an hour (! I know...a lifetime) with useless, mitted hands but it&#x27;s worth it once the bags come off. (Why no thumbs on the mitts? It would help with the dexterity issue just a bit. Literally, you can&#x27;t do a thing wearing those mitts. Not even hold a cup.) The results? Softer skin, reduced redness, less cracking, the moisturizer gets a chance to really soak in.</li>
            <li> Brought one at BBand Beyond, but like this one much better.  Top fits better and heats well.</li>
            <li> This bath is pretty small, and only comes with 3 pounds of wax. I was hoping it would handle more. When dipping, it is hard to get the wax over the top of your hand because of how shallow the bath is.  Worse perhaps is the temperature. The \\&quot;Keep Warm\\&quot; setting is too hot to comfortably dip into. I have to unplug it for about 10 minutes before using. I regret not purchasing a better brand/model.</li>
            <li> Took hours to melt the wax.  Glad I bought extra!  Not as good wax coating.  Used re gloves.  Did not last an hour of softening my hands.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Melts the wax.  Deep enough to submerge hand.  Even girlfriend loves it.  Light weight.  Glad I bought it.  Had carpal tunnel surgery and it has helped recovery.  Riding dirt bikes again.</li>
            <li> same as the high price ones and does the somewhat better. heats up fast, so it can be used in less time</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  My husband suffers written advanced arthritis and this offers some relief. (The &#x27;rain&#x27; wax scent is not overpowering at all as some had posted.)</li>
            <li> It worked for almost a year and then had to be replaced because the lights didn&#x27;t stay on, but the company sent me a brand new one (including the wax) when I called within the year warranty.</li>
            <li> In February I fell and broke my wrist. After surgery I had rehab. and the Therapist recommended to start using a Paraffin Bath.I bought one and using it quite often. It feels so good and helps my Wrist flexibility.</li>
            <li> I received item on time from seller and packaged well.  I was so excited to try this wax machine because I have terrible pain in my hands from scleroderma.  I followed directions exactly and found wax to be too hot even after leaving it on lowest setting for 40 minutes (recommended wait time was 25).  There is no off button, you have to unplug it.  It takes two hours to melt wax and an almost equal amount of time for it to cool before it can be cleaned.  Cleaning is difficult and I just couldn&#x27;t get temp right.  I&#x27;m frustrated and give up.  Might see if someone else in my family wants to try it, my hands are super sensitive to temperature and this just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> She is very, very happy that I bought this product and uses it quite often.  A great value also :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, because she has dry hands from washing them ALL the time. It&#x27;s a pain to setup, but works really well to moisturize hands and feet. I even stick my hands in sometimes.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what you would expect this item to do.. I was getting maximum melting after about 2rs of warmup with 4lbs of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things: taking the burn-plate in and out is annoying. They should just have something built in to prevent you from touching the hot bottom while its on. The more wax you use the less of a problem this becomes. Which leads me to the second thing, the only include 3lbs of wax which about half-fills the unit. If they gave you more to start...you wouldnt need to stick your had as close to the hot plate. Problem solved. So if you buy this..do so knowing you will need more wax, immediately.</li>
            <li> Great product works just fine. The first time out it melts the wax in about 1 1/2-2 hours. Cool down about an hour. Then you can dunk. Does feet, hands and elbows. Can be left on when wax is finished with.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels. I don&#x27;t know if it will help my arthritis much but it feels good.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly. I like the ability to adjust the temperature. The lid should not be so loose and should be hinged.</li>
            <li> takes way too long to melt the wax and the container is not deep enough to get your&lt;br /&gt;hand all the way in - especially if you have bigger hands.</li>
            <li> very good product I recommend to everyone, very good and affordable price, high quality, never regret,good,good,good,good,i recommend to everyone who need this,but really need 6 lbs of wax to cover hand and wrist.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry and very dry hands. I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to add that other reviewers hadn&#x27;t covered, but I did want to stress that I don&#x27;t think the length of time required to melt the wax is a huge deterrent. You just have to remember to plan ahead. My advice is to turn the unit to high before you go to bed at night, then lower the heat right when you wake. By the time you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth, made your bed etc., it&#x27;s the perfect temp. I find soaking my hands in the morning is the most beneficial, as they tend to be most stiff and painful first thing when I wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this specifically to treat stiff joints in winter, but also love that it helps soften my chapped, over-washed hands. The hardened wax peels off easily and has a mild, nice scent. It is a little bit tricky to put your second hand in the mitt once you&#x27;re already wearing one on your first, but even without someone around to help it&#x27;s definitely feasible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with the reviewers who say this doesn&#x27;t come with enough wax, but then again I&#x27;m focusing on my fingers so only dip to cover all of them and just part of my hand. I imagine if you wanted to thoroughly coat them up to and including your wrist you&#x27;d need more wax.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MOISTURE STAY QUICK HEAT PARAFFIN BATH. I HAVE ARTHRITIS  AND IT WARMS AND SOFTENS THE HANDS NICELY. WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Nice size. It meets my needs.</li>
            <li> works great for hands with arthritis</li>
            <li> This is realoy cheap. It works just like one u can see spa. But way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;  One thing u wanna buy wax with this. It comes with bags, and wax, wax isnt enough i think. I bought couple peach wax. It smells so good. I put 2 of wax it comes with this package, i put 2 of mango. I just love it smell! I like peach too&lt;br /&gt;  Im nail tech where i work now they dont have one so i bought this for myself and family, friends.&lt;br /&gt;  Before i use, i scrub my hands dry them but not to dry, leave moisture on your hands.(no water) And deep your hands 3 time slowly. If its too thin, cool off easy and doesnt come off easy. And about 10 min take off u will see shiny hands ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Make sure wax is not too hot. And it takes longer time to melt it down than it says. I hope my review is helpful fot you. I highly recommand to you :)&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! Only couple times, it will make your skin soft and shiny looking ( i would say it depends your skin condition tho)</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of use however it takes a LONG time for the wax to melt, like more than an hour! Once it gets to the right temperature it is easy to use and the various heat settings are helpful.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other paraffin bath’s in my past and they all worked great. The only reason I got this one is because I could not find any in the local stores. I read most of the reviews on Amazon and decided this may work. The shipment was great I got this within 2 days of ordering it online. As soon as it came I read all the directions and did exactly what I read. Unfortunately this product did not work. The only light that came on ever was the power light so I just turned the dial all the way to the right where it says melt. Unfortunately this product never heated up. I even waited a good 5 hr’s on the first day and 9 hr’s on the second day. But it still never worked not even enough to melt one block that I cut up into small pieces. I hope I just got one that does not work correctly and I hope the next one will work enough to melt the wax. I did return this product in full and ordered a different bath. I now see why most people say how the old paraffin bath’s worked much better then these new cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great relief for arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Revlon Moisturestay Quick Heat up Bath. It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for both myself and my girlfriend. We are very happy with our units. I know you are not suppose to leave these on for more than an hour or two before and after use but because I never know when i am going to use it, it stays on and ready to use at all times. This unit melts the wax in about 60 - 90 minutes and is very reliable. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay a Hugh price&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great product - use if 3-4 times a week and my hands are so soft as are my cuticles!</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to help with very dry hands. I liked the idea of the adjustable temperature settings.  As soon as I got it I read the instructions (yes I actually read the instructions).  I plugged it in, cut the wax into 1&amp;#34; squares, put them in, and turned the temperature setting all the way to the right (high). The red light went on so I put the lid on and every two hours I would go back into the bathroom and check to see if it was ready.  Three days later I decided to take the wax out, heat it on the stove (it took 3 minute to melt the wax) and then carefully poured the melted wax back into the unit.  With the heat still turned to high I went back 30 minute later and the wax was starting to set up.  I went back 30 more minutes later and it was now set.  I am going to return the unit and see if there is another one that will actually melt the wax and then keep it melted.  Oh, by the way, I keep my house at 70 degrees in the winter so it isn&#x27;t because the house is too cold.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it included both the Paraffin and gloves.  It is efficient and compact,easy to use and a great help treating my arthritic hands.  It is hard to break the parafin - I had to use a hammer.  It is also hard to adjust the heat,but for the price I feel I got a great buy!!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new paraffin bath very much. It really works to soften dry, cracked skin. But I would warn everyone about two things. It takes a very long to melt the wax and it is very hot, despite my turning it way down. Caution children not to use it.</li>
            <li> Does not work as stated. Instructions state this unit melts 3 pounds of paraffin in approximately 120 minutes.  I had this plugged in for 2 days on the highest setting &amp; the paraffin was about 75% melted.  Instructions also state not to use unless all paraffin has melted.  After 2 days I turned the unit down to the keep warm setting &amp; paraffin began to harden up almost immediately.  Disappointing product, doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough heat to do the melting, returned to Amazon.  Will try &amp; find a better one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but the length of time that it takes to melt the paraffin is a VERY LONG TIME! I actually have to leave it for several hours to get the full melt.</li>
            <li> The first one did not work properly, I phoned Amazon, they sent me a return postage label, and sent me another Paraffin Bath.  This one works.  It does exactly what I thought it should, and after the initial wax melting, it only takes about 2 hrs to remelt the wax.  I would like to leave it plugged in, however most items these days do not allow that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase and in dealing with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does what it is meant to do.  It takes a little while to melt all the wax the first time and after letting the wax hardened, about 2 hours.  Like the fact that you can keep it on warm.  Light weight and easy to move from one area of the house to another.</li>
            <li> This Revlon paraffin bath was a poor purchase. After doing a little more research, I learned you cannot go \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; on these paraffin baths. This Revlon one melted the blocks of wax in an hour like it claimed. However, once you turn back the heat to dip your hands in, the wax has already hardened. Basically it has two temperatures: \\&quot;scalding hot liquid wax\\&quot; or \\&quot;warm solid wax\\&quot;... Unusable either way. I plan on saving up a little bit more money for the ThermaBath brand because it has a built in heat sensor to control the temperature so you don&#x27;t get burned. I returned the Revlon bath and got a full refund. Amazon customer service was excellent in the matter!</li>
            <li> i injured my left foot and needed a heated reservoir to soak my foot in 103-105 degree water and epsom salts. CAUTION: feet are very burn sensitive. start with a low temp and increase as you feel comfortable. Diabetics should be especially careful.  A previous device from HomeMedics worked fine until i wore it out. The language of the Revlon product led me to belive it would accommodate a size 13 foot, but when i received it, it was too small. i kept the Revlon for future use by my wife or friends who get injured. I also figured out how to open the HomeMedics heated bath and repaired the thermostat by sanding the burned electrical contacts with fine grit emery paper. One good feature of the smaller Revlon unit is the variable thermostat to continuously control the warmth of the reservoir. It just too small for Big Foot (Feet).</li>
            <li> First things first: this wax bath works exactly as advertised - it takes roughly two hours to melt the wax completely, which is fast compared to many other models, and it&#x27;s probably a good idea to turn down the heat some and wait before dipping once the wax melts. I&#x27;m the kind of person who is ready and willing to buy professional grade products if I can&#x27;t find a recreational type of sufficient quality. And I am very pleasantly satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my experience: How long it takes for the wax to melt obviously corresponds to how much wax you place in the tub. If you have three or more lbs. of wax, yes, it will take about two hours. But the less you have the faster it works. As for when to put your hand/foot in, the instructions advise waiting 25 minutes after turning down the heat before dipping. I&#x27;d say wait five, maybe ten minutes. The hotter the wax is when you dip, the more heat the wax retains and the longer your hands/feet stay warm. But do be careful with \\&quot;burning\\&quot; yourself. If you have the plastic protector (included part) in the bath, you should have nothing to worry about except a bit of tingling pain if you dip while the wax is too hot (fair warning: I have a high tolerance for pain, especially from heat, but I&#x27;m pretty sure my skin would burn at the same temperature as everyone else&#x27;s), but I haven&#x27;t even come close to burning myself. Also you&#x27;d be surprised at how much of a difference the room temperature makes at using this wax bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: not only would I recommend this to a friend, I&#x27;d recommend it to my boss or in-laws or anyone I would want to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One possible drawback, though, that I should mention: while this bath is great for dipping, it&#x27;s not so easy to use for painting the wax with a brush onto an area of the body, like a shoulder. That might have something to do with the fact that the heat source is exclusively from the bottom (which I can&#x27;t seriously imagine being the issue), or that might have to do with the fact that I am yet to figure out how to cover the wax on any non-limb so that it retains the heat better (which I suspect is the real issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions, if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> I love this little toy.  It takes a few hours to heat up but if you leave it plugged in and on warm it&#x27;s always ready when you need or want it :)</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much but the instructions were unclear about what to do with the plastic grate and I had to find out online. I also think the warming temperature is a bit too hot but I still can use it.</li>
            <li> It comes all accessories I need, wax, mitten, plastic cover. It melt the wax in 1.5-2 hours. The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect is the temperature, feel a bit too hot to my hands. So far used it 3 times</li>
            <li> Worked great right out of the box. Takes about an hour to melt the wax at the high temp, but I think that is about average. The hottest temp, while hot, did not burn my skin, but you can dial it down to a lower temp before use. Have used this several times, and no leaks, smells or problems!  The wax that is included is kinda fragrant for my taste, but still pleasant, although I think adding another pound or two of was will give you a fuller tub, so your hand does not touch the metal hot bottom. A very good purchase all around</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife from Amazon, arrived early with the solid paraffin pieces.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice looking, the heat control thermostat works. Heats up in 90 minutes. Good for home use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The paraffin that came with it has very strong fragrance. Takes up the entire room. Recommend using unscented&lt;br /&gt;  paraffin&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The system does not have a thermometer. Once melted in hi power, you need to reduce the dial and check the&lt;br /&gt;  temperature by a thermometer before you dip your hand otherwise severe burn may occur. Seems 125(F) is good.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does the job.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get heated up and then adjusted to the right temperature, but so worth the effort. I have moderate arthritis in my hands and this is a wonderful winter afternoon relaxation treat, and much less expensive than going to the nail salon or spa. Well worth the small investment!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and love it. It saves me money from going and having a manicure as often as I used to.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. I bought it as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mother who suffers from really bad arthritis. This little bad boy helps her sooo much. It seems to take what feels like all day to heat up and melt the wax, but its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times, but so far so good.  I love the ease of using it.  It does take a while for the wax to melt and one needs to test the wax before dipping your entire hand in it, but it works very well and makes my arthritic hands feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t work the way it was advertised. When the wax is melted, it&#x27;s too hot to use. When I turn it down the wax solidifies and it is still too hot to use underneath the solid layer. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. I purchased this to help ease the pain from arthritis in my hands but it&#x27;s too hot to use.</li>
            <li> I does take a long time to warm up but really like it.</li>
            <li> The bath has helped my hands and feet, which are very painful due to arthritis.  The bath makes me take the time to get off my feet and take better care of myself.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not being able to leave it on low means it takes 1 1/2 hours before you can use it.  Nice product, not very convenient</li>
            <li> I had a Homedics brand and it did not last very long. I love my new Revlon brand. It seems to be much better constructed than the Homedics unit. It is also large enough to dip my feet in.It was a great buy as well. I found other, used Homedics brand baths for sale that cost more than this one did.</li>
            <li> Tried on of these with a friend of mine at a Girls weekend and had to buy one. I love it, makes my hands and feet feel so smooth and really gives you a spa feel in your own home.</li>
            <li> Heating system failed after one use! Is it because we live at 6,000&#x27;? Trying to return unsuccessfully so stopped credit card payment!</li>
            <li> this hand paraffin bath warms your hands nicely.  to get the process started it does take a few hours to get the wax to melt but once it is melted, it is very easy.</li>
            <li> It is a paraffin bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro: I have talked to people who complained that the wax their unit evaporated quickly. The lid on this one fits snuggly and I have had little to no evaporation in the two months I have had it. I also leave it on high all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Con: I have to leave it on high all the time. If you turn it down to &amp;#34;keep warm&amp;#34; it turns solid so if you use it often, say daily, you will end up doing what I do and leave it all the way up. Even on high it won&#x27;t burn you to use it and the heat actually feels great soaking into your hands.</li>
            <li> This has worked perfectly for me in helping relieve the pain of Carpel Tunnel Syndrome which I have in both hands.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> This product works really well and does all that it says.  It feels like a really special treat when we get it out you just really need to plan ahead and be prepared for some clean up with wax pieces.  I got it for my husband and the unit isn&#x27;t long enough to be able to submerse his whole size 11 foot.  We manage but an xlg length would be good, even for me.</li>
            <li> The wax that comes with this paraffin bath is heavily perfumed. If you don&#x27;t like perfume, you might want to buy some unscented wax.</li>
            <li> Takes 3 hours to melt the wax, then the wax is too hot to use, have to cool down. So 4 hours after turning it on, we can use it</li>
            <li> Got this for our daughter and she loves it!  She has carpel tunnel and it helps relieve the pain  in her wrists!</li>
            <li> First use today and so far I am pleased. Heating/cooling times matched the brochure that came in the box - 2 hours to melt wax completely, about 25 minutes to cool enough to be comfortable.  (Amazon description of times says 60 minutes, which does not match product operating instructions.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two complaints, and I think I can get around them.  1) The wax that comes with the unit is perfumed and seems pretty strong to me when all three 1 lb packages are mixed.  In the future, I&#x27;ll buy unscented wax and maybe use 2 lbs unscented with 1 lb  scented.  2) I want to use this for my feet, and it&#x27;s pretty small.  I can dip toes first, then heel; I can get the full length of my foot inside if I go far enough to put my foot on the base (not supposed to do that because that&#x27;s where the heating element is), but either way it&#x27;s not deep enough for the wax to cover the top of my foot, where I want the benefits of the oils the most.  I tried moving around a little and ended up splashing wax over the side, which will be a bit of a mess to clean up.  Future uses will be with unit on cardboard on the floor to protect against splashing, and maybe another 1/2 pound of wax to get it deep enough for the top of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, product seems to work exactly as expected, and I think will be no problem when I decide to treat my hands.</li>
            <li> should have listen to some of the reviews that said about the waiting time. Mine was like some what 3hours to get all melt down.</li>
            <li> I am very happy. The shipping was onetime.the price was good.</li>
            <li> works good, it only took one hour not two like it said</li>
            <li> Small but does the job. It&#x27;s cheap looking but works. Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This bath is for my hands due to arthritis and it works well it just takes hours to heat and if I don&#x27;t use it on high it starts to set up right away. Now I wish I had invested in a more expensive one but this one will work until it wears out.</li>
            <li> Awsome product and service</li>
            <li> Hello I bought this device for my girlfriend. She always wanted one of these and this works great! It uses about 3.5 lbs of wax. Takes three hours or so to melt but my girlfriend uses this at least 3 to 4 days a week! This is a professional quality  Parafin bath!</li>
            <li> Of my goodness it feels so good&lt;br /&gt;Just thinking in the money I save ,it helps feel like a million dollar&lt;br /&gt;I use it as many times I want .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while and just thought to review it.  It is every convenient to be able to do a paraffin hand and foot treatment at home...not to mention more cost effective.  I also will use it when my hands or feet are very cold and I want to heat them up.  The drawback is that it actually takes hours (at laest 3 sometimes 4 for the wax to melt depending on how much is in the container. That is the one reason I don&#x27;t use it more than I do.  I could and have left it on low heat, but then if it gets bumped and slouches it is problematic to get the wax up.</li>
            <li> the machine is great I love the scent and the smoothness of your hands afterwards.  I Would recommend super product.</li>
            <li> Was in an accident and have tenden tightness. So, this little machine is my saving grace right now. The instructions are very strait forward and the paraffin provided smells great (I bought an additional pound in lavender scent and added to the mix). The only thing is it takes 2 hours for the paraffin to melt, so, you have to plan ahead. Otherwise, love this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product once you have it warmed up... takes FOREVER!</li>
            <li> I love it! I bought it for the arthritis in my hands, and it really relieves the pain and swelling. So soothing. This comes with plastic bags and mitts, which keeps the heat in for approx. 15 minutes. It takes about 2-3 hours to melt the wax, so plan ahead. Also, a special benefit to the bath is the softness that comes after you peel the wax off your hands. I would recommend this to all who have arthritis in their hands or fingers, or even your feet.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Makes you&#x27;re hands feel like silk. Price is right and delivery was fast!  A great gift for anyone who loves beautiful hands or suffers from arthritis.</li>
            <li> As a rural letter carrier, my hands take a beating especially during the winter.  The joints in my thumb are worn out from griping mail hundreds of times a day.  My doctor suggested purchasing a paraffin bath to help with the pain.  I seldom take arthritis  meds because they bother me and don&#x27;t give that much relief.  I use it everyday I work and it is very comforting on really cold days.</li>
            <li> I like this Revlon product except that one the paraffin melts you must turn it down or it is too hot for your hands.  Also, the paraffin that is included is way too oily for me.  Not as effective as paraffin in a salon. Ended up ordering new paraffin and am happier.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift has never been used. Feel it would be helpful if utilized but just takes up space.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great product for home use.  Takes about 1 hour to 1-1/2 hours for the wax to melt completely, so be sure to plan ahead.  Only real complaint is that the cover does not snap securely closed.  Not a deal breaker by any means, but something to be aware of when moving or storing.</li>
            <li> WHAT A WONDERFUL TREAT TO MYSELF. THE ONLY COMPLAINT WOULD BE THAT IT ISN&#x27;T READY TO USE FAST ENOUGH. BUT, WORTH THE WAIT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one of these.  I use this almost every night, and my hands have never been in better shape at this point in the winter season.  I also suffered for months with my nails splitting, filing them down just to have them grow back and split.  Since I&#x27;ve been using paraffin, my nails have healed and are growing in health again.  It does take awhile to heat up, but I&#x27;m in no hurry.  I turn it on and go about my business.  I turn it down to warm when the wax is completely melted to cool off before dipping my hands.  I only hope the heating element lasts, and I don&#x27;t burn it out from using it so often.  The dial doesn&#x27;t have an OFF setting, so it turns on immediately once you plug it in.  To turn it off, you pull the plug.  Usually that type of action burns out an appliance, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Built well and works as described.  Fast shipper!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I had carpel tunnel in both hands a few yes ago and my chiropractor used this for therapy on my hands- WOW did it feel great! And now my husband has arthritis in his hands and the warmth from this gives him temporary relief. It&#x27;s great for helping softening your hands, elbows &amp; feet.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product after my old one finally gave up on me, I was afraid it would be too small. But now I can happily say it is much better than the old larger model. It fits better on the countertop and my hands fit just fine. It also heats up very quickly (allow about three hours) and the heat setting is adjustable; another great improvement!</li>
            <li> Works really well. It takes 2 1/2 hrs to heat up. (I&#x27;ve only used it once. It may take less time to reheat, since the blocks are already melted). I had to cut the paraffin blocks with a knife. The process is  a little messy, the  next time should be better. Really helped my hands</li>
            <li> Great product.  Absolutely no need to spend $$ on a more expensive version.  This works great!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this for chistmas. In certain times of the year my hands get very dry and despite using lotion constantly they do not seem to get enough moisture to make them feel or look healthy. I had heard that regular paraffin bath&#x27;s can help with this issue so I researched this product for a while. I really liked this one because it was small and portable and the paraffin melts fast. In my experience with it the paraffin when completely full it takes about an hour to completely melt (that&#x27;s not bad at all). I set up the wax and go do something else while it melts and then I come back to treat my hands. I read some reviews that mentioned that this product had leaks but in the time that I have had it I have had absolutely no problems with it. I have used this with one of my friends who has arthritis and she loved it as well. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The directions say to heat the wax for 120 minutes.  Then cool the wax for 25 minutes.  Then test it on your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my way of thinking, 145 minutes is not quick.</li>
            <li> The heater is slow to respond when turning on to full heat.. takes over 2 hours to heat up once it cools off .&lt;br /&gt;But once completely hot,, does a good job on covering my right hand , which has developed arthritis.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended paraffin bath for my arthritic hands.  This device does a great job at a very decent price.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying a good chuck of change to have my feet done at the spa so this is one of the items I bought to help get the same treatment at home. I have a regimen that I use along with this and my feet are so soft and look great. I also use it for my hands. It takes a while to heat the paraffin but I just plug it in after I wake up and it&#x27;s ready to use in about an hour or so. I highly recommend this paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> What more can I say than the title.  Bought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it.  She was very excited that it came with all the extras like disposable plastic gloves etc.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product.  No problem with it at all.  Will buy again and its useful.  Thank you for this item</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but sometimes it gets too hot for your hands and if you reduce the temperature, paraffin gets hard.</li>
            <li> i have carporal tunnel and this really helps with the pain. i use it almost everyday. also it keeps you hands soft.</li>
            <li> I can barely get my hand in this bath,  I think the measurement is an outside measurement and the bath looses about 3 inches from the outside to the inside due to its design.  I do not have overly large hands, only 7 inches from heel of palm to fingertips.  I am quite disappointed.  I have used it several times but worry about touching the sides and getting burned.  It has been about 3 weeks since I last used it.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars b/c it works great!  It heats up in the time described and it does get hot, but you let it cool off,  as described in the instructions.  It comes with a good amount of wax and bags and the mits.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a spa like experience at home!</li>
            <li> This is a fun way to soften your hands at home. It does take a while to melt the wax but that isn&#x27;t hard if you are doing stuff before hand. The only thing I would say I had a hard time with was after the wax was on my hands. I could barely get the plastic sleeves on, let alone trying to get the mitts on as well. This is more of a 2 person job than anything else.</li>
            <li> They call it &amp;#34;quick heat&amp;#34;, but there&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; about it. It  takes at lease 40-60 minutes for the paraffin to melt.</li>
            <li> inexpensive and works well. What&#x27;s more to like?</li>
            <li> This takes more than a hour to heat and melt wax</li>
            <li> Works well for my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> This way was purchased  for my mother  and she love it. Uses it for her hands</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  My first attention made my little finger feel&lt;br /&gt;Burned.  The tiny pieces of wax get everywhere.  On low heat it doesn&#x27;t melt.  On high heat it&#x27;s too hot!</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this! It took about 100 minutes until the wax to be melted completely. It is really hot at first but as instructed, I left it cooler for a little more than a half hour, it was perfect for me to put my hands in. The wax smells nice and it is just what I had expected! I even left the remaining wax inside the chamber overnight, unplugged. I used it again next day and it was just fine!!</li>
            <li> This machine works well and comes adequately equipped with all of the supplies needed to enjoy it right out of the box. The only downfall is that it takes a pretty long time to heat up the wax.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have RA in both wrist and thumbs. The paraffin bath is very soothing. I just wish it were a little deeper and longer to fit my size 11 foot. : )</li>
            <li> This melts the wax fast and gets it nice and hot for wax play. The paraffin feels great on the sick and softens it well.</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t I love this product? I am 29 years old and have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon. You might ask why I&#x27;m telling you this....some of my friends suggested I buy this to help with my arthritis pain. I thought that was a great idea and I&#x27;m willing to try anything to help with the pain, so I ordered one right away. There&#x27;s not that big of a selection and this one looked the best. The machine comes with a huge block of wax that you turn it on and warm it up to your desired temp. The first heating took forever. Like hours. Then when it was finally all melted I stuck the tip of my finger in and realized it was scalding hot. It burned me pretty bad. So I turned the heat switch way way down. Pretty much as low as it would go. Then I waited and tried again. OUCH!! Still really hot. So, basically I realized the first time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. Because of my conditions my skin is just too sensitive. It&#x27;s been sitting in my closet since that one time I used it. So to me, it was a big waste of money. I could see someone who is healthy and just wants to do a spa treatment might really like this. But, if you have RA or Raynaud&#x27;s or anything like that - I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It is great if you have aching in your hands, the warmth from the paraffin lasts a bit after you have immersed your hands in the bath and feels very good on your joints.  It is also very good for dry and cracking skin.  The paraffin contains oils and once the paraffin is removed, you rub the oils into your hands and it really helps the dry skin.  You do have to plan ahead for using it, as it takes a good two hours for the wax to heat up, but it is well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I bought this paraffin bath because I used one at physical therapy to warm up my hand before exercises after hand surgery for a severed tendon.  After I was released to home therapy, I would use it and it really helped with the stiffness and pain.  The moist heat enabled me to move my fingers and keep up with my exercises.  My hand feels great after a treatment - it would probably work wonders for those with arthritis as well. I keep it plugged in and on all of the time so I don&#x27;t waste time while the wax melts.  Since everyone has different sensitivity to temperature (the hottest setting is very hot but I use it to melt the wax) once you figure out the best setting to keep the bath on and the wax from cooling - keep it there. I use it once or twice a week and it&#x27;s always ready for a dip.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my feet yet - (they just fit) but plan to.  At PT they used to use heated towels to keep your hands warm after the wax bath.  Bags are included (and I reuse them) and this one also comes with the mitts - not all do.  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I love this paraffin bath.  I have not had the problems with long melting times like other reviewers have.  For me, the wax melts after about an hour and a half and then is cool enough to use after about 2.  I don&#x27;t even break up the wax, I just let it cool in the machine and then just turn the machine back on when I need it again.  It&#x27;s wonderful to have in the winter, after you use it, the increased circulation keeps your hands and feet warm for hours.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for in home use, and much cheaper than going to a spa!</li>
            <li> The bath is too small for large or wide stiff hands. Regardless, I can still make do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order extra paraffin if the paraffin that sticks to the hand after each bath is discarded the reservoir is small and will need additional paraffin after three or so baths IF you have large or wide stiff hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad hand feels oh so good after the bath. I probably use it once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A maximum paraffin level mark on the bath would be useful so one doesn&#x27;t overfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paraffin melts fairly quickly especially after the first melt down so the wait time for a new melting is not objectionable.</li>
            <li> I got my package today. I plugged the unit with the paraffin wax in it. I followed the instructions.It was supposed to melt the wax in 2 hours. I waited about 2 1/2. I noticed that the red heater light was off. The green power light was still on. The bottom of the unit(inside) was lukewarm. The wax was still solid. So, I unplugged it and replugged it. No luck! The red light which is the highest heat setting won&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning the item. I assumed a $40 dollar paraffin bath would do better than some cheaper brands. I will go ahead and buy some other brand locally.</li>
            <li> I like it but wish it came with unscented wax as I have allergies. You will need to invest in more wax pretty quickly but definitely helping my very dry hands during this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas and we just got a chance to use it. The wax took about an hour and a half to melt down fully, it went faster if you broke it into smaller chunks. The only thing I have to say is the smell of the wax is /very/ potent, I think it supposed to be like rain smell or something. For a person who is very sensitive to smells (migraines, asthma) that was disappointing. Thankfully I had ordered some unscented additional wax, so we mixed them together and it was much more bearable.</li>
            <li> Great item!  I used the paraffin wax beads and 3 lbs melted in 1.5 hours.  The temperature was fine for me.  The mitts are nice and thick.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my dry skin. I&#x27;m a massage therapist and have been having skin problems. I turned it on and the wax melted and it worked great, then I tried to use it again the next day but the wax wouldn&#x27;t melt. I unplugged it and tried again and it still wouldn&#x27;t work. Then a few days later I tried it once again and it did work. So over the next week or so it would work sometimes and not work others, till finally it won&#x27;t work at all. I emailed the manufacturer so to return it, but I didn&#x27;t realize that they ONLY gave me 10 days to return it, until after the ten days was already up. It was a total waste of $50 (including shipping) and I can&#x27;t get anything back from it.</li>
            <li> This paraffin bath was securely packaged for shipping without using an excess of packing material.  The bath was easy to set up and true to its name was ready to use in a very short time.  Once the paraffin melted, I set the dial on its lowest setting.  The paraffin stays very hot requiring very quick dips into it.  Therefore, this paraffin bath should not be placed where a young, curious child has access.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact.  It heats up quickly and the wax melts right away.  Makes my hands soft and takes the pain away</li>
            <li> Just love dipping my arthritic ands in it before bedtime, a wonderful gift from my son! Eases pain and discomfort of arthritis and tendonitis...Love it!</li>
            <li> This machines melts the wax fast, and does everything it promises. The problem, the wax is way TOO HOT, even in the lowest setting. I have a high tolerance and I cannot use it just like that. I tried with two friends, they could not take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my solution? I melt the was, I unplug the machine and I wait... half an hour later I can use it and enjoy a relaxing moment. Which is not practical, specially if you forget and wait too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paraffin it comes with is really good and you are set for a while with the gloves liners and the mittens.</li>
            <li> I got this for arthritis in my hands, recommended by my doctor. It does take several hours to melt the paraffin, so turn it on way before you want to use it.  Then you have to let it cool down some as it will be too hot to stick your hand into.  This is the reason I gave it a 3-star.  But I do love the soothing heat and the way it makes your hands look after use.  Really nice if you have severe arthritis.</li>
            <li> I have used this Revlon product several times since purchase and have been very pleased with results. I had researched paraffin baths thoroughly and for the money found this unit to meet my needs. Dry skin and cracks are quickly healed and hands / feet feel so very soft. Easy to use. I would definitely recommend this bath. Excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after heating the wax the first time, letting it harden, and then melting it again for the next treatment, too much wax ended up stuck to the sides and did not melt. I needed to scrape it off and into the melted wax. This was very inconvenient and defeated the purpose of having this at home ready to use. Still looking for a replacement. .</li>
            <li> This replaced and older version.  I went ahead and bought a &amp;#34;returned and without box&amp;#34; version.  It is wonderful and as expected.</li>
            <li> i really like the paraffin bath.  the heat feels great on my hands and they feel super soft afterwards.  I do leave the unit on all the time though.</li>
            <li> works well but takes 3+ hours to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> I use this especially in the winter to soothe the arthritis pain in my hands.  It really helps make them feel less painful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in November to help with my arthritis in my hands. It worked well enough till one month after return policy allows it to be returned. Now it is no longer working.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with my paraffin bath since I purchased it...and have used it many times!!!! I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this with in hopes of its helping to ease some of my wife&#x27;s arthritis pain in her fingers.  (It does.)  To my surprise, I like it too because of its healing assistance - the natural oils in the paraffin are relatively long-lasting and seem to offer nice relief for chapping.  (My wife reports the same, and is conscientious about rubbing into her elbows when finishing a treatment.)  I have several tins and tubes of various &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; down-home remedies, but my hands are best-served by the paraffin.</li>
            <li> Was a present for my Mom, she says she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Works fine, no problems</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for a friend of ine who was suffering with nerve damage in her hand. She is still evaluating the product.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft and smooth this makes my hands. The heat from the wax helps relieve the pain in my joints it seems.</li>
            <li> Bought for arthritis. The 3 lbs of wax included were not enough to cover my wrist so I added more. READ the instructions on melting and cooling the wax. It is very hot if you don&#x27;t follow them to the letter. Used this to replace an old &amp;#34;Therabath&amp;#34; wax unit which was heavy and ugly. This looks fine on a kitchen cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have been quite pleased with this paraffin bath. It is slow to melt, but once you learn to plan ahead it is fine.</li>
            <li> The parrafin needs to heat for about two hours--followed by a 25-minute cool-off period--before you can dip your hands.  Usage requires advance planning.</li>
            <li> Unit works great but wish it were just a bit longer to fit whole foot inside with out rubbing was off heel.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a Christmas gift. My friend is still thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;difficulty&amp;#34; is that it takes about 2 hr to melt the wax and sometimes I don&#x27;t realize I would really need the relief it provides, then it&#x27;s the evening and I&#x27;m tired and waiting 2 hr just isn&#x27;t on my schedule at that point! It&#x27;s really my own need to plan to use it when the weather is changing/a front is coming in and what activities I&#x27;m going to be doing really using my hands. I haven&#x27;t used it on my feet yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this.  I researched all avaliable products.  The thing thaat made me hesitate was the talk of exposed heating element.  This proved to be no concern.  It is a metal contained heating element you don&#x27;t see and it comes with a plastic cover that keeps you from touching the metal.  A lot ot the units talked abot hoe long it took them to melt the wax.  This one was very quick.  I leave it plugged in all the time it has a auto heater that kicks on when needed to keep the wax at the temperature you set.  Seems to help my hands.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Other reviews stated it took forever to melt the wax...mine was very quick, no problem.  I will say that once the wax has melted you really need to turn it down before you put your feet and hands in, it is VERY hot!</li>
            <li> Takes too long to heat up.  I keep forgetting to plug it in and turn it on way before needing it.  The benefits are wonderful though.</li>
            <li> When I got this, I would say it worked as expected and really helped my arthritis and my skin.  But now the unit has stopped working which is very disappointing.  I know others have had this problem as well.  I had kept the return box for awhile, but finally threw it away as the product appeared to be working.  It is now too late to return for full refund and I would have to pay shipping.  I am very disappointed, especially in view of its effectiveness when it was working well.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my sore, dry hands.  Keeps the little bit of arthritis away.&lt;br /&gt;Came early, works perfectly.  Enjoy the quick warm  up time.  Don&#x27;t have to&lt;br /&gt;wait 8 hours to use it.  About 1-1/2 hours and it is ready.  Melt it on high, turn it&lt;br /&gt;down to a little below medium with the lid off.  Wait a little while if  your hands are&lt;br /&gt;sensitive to heat.  High temp is about 127 degrees.  A little too warm so you need&lt;br /&gt;to turn it down and wait.  Do this a couple of hours before using it.&lt;br /&gt;Got a candy thermometer?  Use it to decide on  your temperature.</li>
            <li> I have had several hand surgeries and sometimes my hands just aren&#x27;t happy, so I use this for heat therapy.  I have found that the heat therapy is also helpful for Pplantar Fasciitis.  In addition the good affects of the heat therapy I have also found using the paraffin bath is helpful in moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it would not work. I had to get an expert to look at it. Apparently there was some cable that was not doing proper contact so it would not heat up. It works well now, but it was a hassle for 3 days trying to figure out the issue and fix it, when it was supposed to be brand new.</li>
            <li> I love this  my hands feel better then ever before</li>
            <li> I really like this machine however the warm up time the first time is way over an hour and the subsequent times it takes at least an hour to melt it all then you have to turn down the heat before you use it and wait for a comfortable temperature. However if you preplanned and gave yourself enough time then this is the best! I love the way it makes my skin soft and also the joint pains just melt away. I don&#x27;t have any medical issues but occasional over work my hands and have achy hands and fingers doing this before bedtime means I wake up with out pain the next day.&lt;br /&gt;  The other thing I want to mention is the don&#x27;t burn yourself bottom piece I wish it had a way to esily  remove it  without re-dipping my hands into the wax and to be able to hang it on the side of the machine so that after you used it you could easily lift it up and attach it inside above the wax since if you don&#x27;t take it out until the wax is all hardened again and place it back on top then  takes longer to melt all the wax the next time this is a little messy but otherwise not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> This warmer works well for hand dipping . Comes with wax and bags and mitts. I wish it came with 2 more bars of wax to fill it more ( I ordered more) there is a warmer switch to hot switch- no on and off switch- you have to plug it in to turn it on. Anyone who has arthritus in their hands needs a wax warmer!!! It helps!</li>
            <li> This had mits and was, which I didn&#x27;t expect. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to relieve my arthritis in my hands and my dry desert skin. This works wonders for my arthritic hands on cold days or when they just ache. The soothing heat is amazing. I put my hands in the warm wax and then the plastic gloves then the mittens they provide and sit back and relax for a few minutes . Its wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;This is also really good because I live in the desert and my hands get really dry.The paraffin bath moisturizes my hands so well. I couldn&#x27;t live without this product, it helps me that much.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use this once a week. Works wonders on my dry hands. I handle a lot of papers daily.</li>
            <li> Great at home treatment.</li>
            <li> i love it!! Works great</li>
            <li> OK product, didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would for my hands but the machine itself works good, next i will try my feet. I will see what happens.</li>
            <li> This product takes way too long to make use of.  The wax has to heat for almost an hour and a half and I found it to be not user friendly.  It&#x27;s awkward to get your hand into the vat and dipping it five times makes it more awkward.  it&#x27;s cumbersome to handle with the heated wax in it and forget trying to use it on your foot.  i tried it once, packaged it up and will donate it to Good Will.&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for a once-in-a-while experience, I guess it&#x27;s ok but I wanted to use it daily as I have a problem with my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I say forget it.</li>
            <li> works great. melts quickly. Only thing I wasn&#x27;t super happy about was the wax has a lot of fragrance....would prefer unscented or a very light scent. So nice to have this during the winter for dry hands and feet</li>
            <li> overall good product though a bit small. There is NOT enough wax included with it so order more in the beginning. It takes quite some time to warm enough to melt the wax then seems too hot and you have to wait a bit till it gets a little cooler BUT still a good bargain</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at the behest of  a physical therapist for my hand, which was swollen, and arthritic.  I am also suffering from Achilles Tenden itis and bursitis in both feet from wearing heels my entire adult  life,  So, i am getting therapy for that.  I found that dipping my feet in the paraffin bath helps to sooth them.  It is large enough to dip each foot in.  Helps to obtain some relief.</li>
            <li> I just love this product it is easy to use and feels great when you put it on sore hands. Great personal pamper me gift</li>
            <li> I had a table saw injury on my right hand last summer. After 5 months of physical therapy, I decided to get a home treatment similar to the paraffin bath they used at the hospital. I use this regularly. I have no complaints other than the highest setting is way too hot. I set it 2 tabs lower. Reusing the same wax with a little mineral oil, the original wax blocks have lasted quite a while. Adding mineral oil helps the wax to peel away from your skin, wash with soap and water and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> As expected, it takes a while for the oil to heat.  It works just fine though!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I got it and could not wait to use it so my roomie and I declared a spa day. I read a lot of reviews that it takes over two hours for the wax to melt and it worried me....not at all the case for me. I read the instructions which explain to cut each pound of wax in half then in half again...so I doubled it. I cut each block into 8 pieces, set all 3 lbs of wax on high and in just over 90 minutes it was all melted. I set it to low for about 20 minutes (wax was very hot but I like it that way..some people may like to let it cool further) and dipped both of my hands 5 times. I have big hands so I really don&#x27;t get the reviewer who said the vessel was barely big enough to dip her small hands. Well, you can&#x27;t believe everything you read I guess. I dipped mine 5 times each, so did my roommate and she did her feet too so it was a five star success. You can probably get much cheaper wax and add your own oils if you like to save money. I intend to use this baby a lot so that&#x27;s probably what I&#x27;ll do. Buy it, love it, enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s description is missing a major component.  The paraffin wax that is included in the package is scented.  I have an allergy to perfume scented products and will not be able to use it due to that fact.  If you don&#x27;t mind scents it is fine, but for me that is a very important part of the product which should be part of the description.</li>
            <li> Big enough to easily dip a large hand so it does take up a lot of counterspace. Plan on a couple of hours for it to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s a winner.  The 90 min - 2 hr melting time is not overwhelming.  And it&#x27;s not a problem to keep warm for a few hours to use later in the day.  I love it for arthritic thumb joint.  And because I like things really hot, I did not find the high setting to be extreme.  The bonus of the 2 mitts and plastic bags make this a great bargain.  They are extras in many baths at 4 times the price.</li>
            <li> We ordered this parraffin bath to assist us with melting sealing wax to use on test tubes for a salt giveaway.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The quality of starter wax provided is not of the best quality however the value for the product itself met my expecations and am happy with it.  I would recomend the unit however you will need to invest a little more money to get the better wax from another source.</li>
            <li> This unit is great to renew parched feet and hands.  Used with my favorite lotion, it gives me softness! I love it!</li>
