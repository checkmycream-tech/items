            <li>It makes my nails look bright and shiny but not too shiny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a really good strengthener.  </li>
            <li>Worked fairly well did not work as well as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Loving this already.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>Most amazing fingernail polish.</li>
            <li>They do look clean and bright and not stained by anything.</li>
            <li>Then, as if by magic, your tips will look quite a bit whiter.</li>
            <li>I recalled this from many years ago and am glad it still works as well as I remember.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use more than two coats at a time and change it often (esp.</li>
            <li>Even makes short nails look awesome!</li>
            <li>worked ok</li>
            <li>I have just ordered more of this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Love the sparkly color, too.</li>
            <li>Be sure when you apply it that your nails are polish free, stain free and clean.</li>
            <li>They will look fantastic.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it sated!!</li>
            <li>Great as a clear coat over bare nails, gives a nice finish.</li>
            <li>So far Im pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>No matter how good I cleaned under them, they still had a yellow look to them.</li>
            <li>Even still, my nails did look good and definitely brghtened up.  </li>
            <li>I will use it, but would have liked to receive what I ordered in the same package shown...</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it dries pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Today is my second day wearing it and my nails dont necesarily look whiter, but i think becasue of the shade of the polish, they do look more presentable.  </li>
            <li>Just as described love it on my French manicure</li>
            <li>I put on two coats and was pleased at how quick it dried.  </li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>So I really couldn&#x27;t understand why my finger nails didn&#x27;t look whiter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a whole process to get the stains out of the nails and this product is part of it..</li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>Slap a coat on and then look at your nails in natural light (outside).  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this to all with problem nails.  </li>
            <li>It makes your nail look like a fresh French manicure and way stronger.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The polish somehow makes your nail beds look pink and clean as if you just had them done professionally.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how anyone who uses their hands, even typing, and has clear nails, can live without it.</li>
            <li>I just put this coat on yesterday after cleaning and buffing my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>I would have never gone out in public with just any plain top coat.</li>
            <li>i put on two heavy coats; it may have looked a little more natural if i had done one coat.</li>

            <li> Most amazing fingernail polish. It makes your nail look like a fresh French manicure and way stronger.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;yello out&amp;#34; but it does exactly opposite! Not good at all!</li>
            <li> Great as a clear coat over bare nails, gives a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Wow! This really works. I actually don&#x27;t wear polish on my finger nails, only my toe nails. So I really couldn&#x27;t understand why my finger nails didn&#x27;t look whiter. No matter how good I cleaned under them, they still had a yellow look to them. So after reading the other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The transformation is immediate. Like others have said it does give a slight pink hue to the upper portion of the nail which makes them look healthier. Then, as if by magic, your tips will look quite a bit whiter. Another plus is that it dries pretty quick. So you can polish and be out the door in 5 minutes. I am so happy I tried this product. This will probably be the only thing I use on my finger nails from now on.</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well did not work as well as I would have liked. Not sure if I would order again but maybe.</li>
            <li> I looked in stores for months for this product as I&#x27;d had some that I bought in the drugstore and then never could find again. I finally found it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t know how anyone who uses their hands, even typing, and has clear nails, can live without it. It makes my nails look bright and shiny but not too shiny so they don&#x27;t even look that polished. They do look clean and bright and not stained by anything. It&#x27;s one of those products you just can&#x27;t believe no one thought of before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to my nails, but all of a sudden they had turned yellow. I recalled this from many years ago and am glad it still works as well as I remember. It is a life saver if you want to leave your nails without color.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !! It works like it says it does. No more yellow nails.</li>
            <li> It does take the yellow out of nails.. I started seeing results after three weeks.. It&#x27;s a whole process to get the stains out of the nails and this product is part of it.. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish EVERRR!!!  Be sure when you apply it that your nails are polish free, stain free and clean. Slap a coat on and then look at your nails in natural light (outside).  They will look fantastic. The polish somehow makes your nail beds look pink and clean as if you just had them done professionally. Don&#x27;t use more than two coats at a time and change it often (esp. if you&#x27;re a smoker like me). It&#x27;s also a really good strengthener.  I&#x27;m in the army currently serving in Afghanistan and my nails were difficult to maintain out here (and in general).  But this stuff is a god send and I won&#x27;t use anything else (except maybe an under nailtip whitening pencil when I get back to the states).  Also my nails have grown really long so I have to keep a file with me to keep them at bay.  I highly reccommend this to all with problem nails.  Even if your nails aren&#x27;t discolored this stuff will still make them POP and look great.  Hope you are as happy with it as I am as well as get the compliments I do.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I order this and when it came it was in a different bottle than what was shown online.  The bottle I saw online was just like the one at the spa I go to and the one I got looks like a boot leg version.  I will use it, but would have liked to receive what I ordered in the same package shown...</li>
            <li> Great product! Does exactly as it sated!! Even makes short nails look awesome!</li>
            <li> worked ok but I didn&#x27;t like the flourescent blue tint that it had...</li>
            <li> This works very well and I like it.  It creates a barrier between the polish &amp; nail, but allows polish to adhere well.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered more of this nail polish. It works wonders on my nails. Love the sparkly color, too. Makes my nails stronger.</li>
            <li> I just put this coat on yesterday after cleaning and buffing my natural nails.  My nails have been splitting and peeling for the past few months and have been yellowing becasue Im constantly painting them.  I put on two coats and was pleased at how quick it dried.  When I stepped outside, i was a little taken aback by the flourescent purple shade it left on my nail, but it may be becasue i put on two heavy coats; it may have looked a little more natural if i had done one coat. Even still, my nails did look good and definitely brghtened up.  Today is my second day wearing it and my nails dont necesarily look whiter, but i think becasue of the shade of the polish, they do look more presentable.  I would have never gone out in public with just any plain top coat. So far Im pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Loving this already. Having undergone chemo, my nails are very fragile &amp; brittle. This seems to make my nails harder where they don&#x27;t split and break. I will never have the nails I used to have, but this is a big improvement! Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Just as described love it on my French manicure</li>
