            <li>WELL, I THINK THEY ARE STILL A GREAT HAIR APPLIANCE!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>The rollers were perfect sized for me, and I like the release button</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>excellent product , I recommend</li>
            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>it is still wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the Revlon Perfect Heat</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is great!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great tool to have!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This hair styling device has given me the best hair I&#x27;ve had in years.  </li>
            <li>and it is awesome.</li>
            <li>The concept is wonderful!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very happy about it!</li>
            <li>but besides that is great!</li>
            <li>When this was working I was very happy with it</li>
            <li>A very good buy</li>
            <li>My brilliant husband looked at it and discovered that the barrel had a crack in it where it entered into the handle.</li>
            <li>and it works real nice without frizzing up my hair.</li>
            <li>Good choice!</li>
            <li>Quite good styler and dryer!</li>
            <li>Otherwise good product choice at the best price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>from that moment on I was hooked, it did everything I needed it to do to get the job done beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had them fly out across the room.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received this brush hair dryer, I tried it out ... with great results.  </li>
            <li>If this sounds like your hair Revlon still has a great product for you</li>
            <li>all the brush is great.</li>
            <li>While she was happy to receive it, she, nor I, were happy with how it came packaged.</li>
            <li>or so it will be great  </li>
            <li>I had a great expectation from it</li>
            <li>IT does a great job if you can keep the brush on--thus my 3 stars.</li>
            <li>These are the best dryers of this kind but thy fall apart in about a year&lt;</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>great for the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>Great price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>It was the best product out there for my hair until this latest model came along.  </li>
            <li>Why manufacturers choose to change a successful product like this is beyond me.  </li>
            <li>Loving this &amp; am looking forward to doing my hair again!</li>
            <li>and they were very courteous and all is good.</li>
            <li>It is a fair product.  </li>
            <li>so it went to good will.</li>
            <li>Each time I remember why I gave it to Good Will and bought another product.  </li>
            <li>Good idea</li>
            <li>there is nothing out there as good for my hair</li>
            <li>Even with those problems and having to replace about once a year I still loved.</li>
            <li>I loved it until it broke after 2 months....</li>
            <li>Good air flow</li>
            <li>Good dryer.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun  cordless curler before which I loved</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good solution for my mom who likes to touch up her hair in between salad visits.</li>
            <li>She loved it and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The hair dries quickly as the brush gives excellent control.</li>
            <li>I am impressed how quickly it heats up and drys hair.</li>
            <li>is something practical, useful and excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;reached</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It was not the best hot air brush design I have used.  </li>
            <li>It works OK, it should just get hotter!</li>
            <li>I love the result!  </li>
            <li>The Revlon hot air brush (RV444) is the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>AND MOST OF THEM CAME FROM AMAZON!</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT CURLS MY HAIR!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>this one is much, much better!</li>
            <li>but gladly it still works and does miracles to my hair!</li>
            <li>Revlon Perfect Heat 1 inch &amp; 1 - 1/2 inch hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I can use it again with this easy fix.</li>
            <li>Does the job,  don&#x27;t expect amazing curls though.</li>
            <li>But over all nice.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself is ok the attachments are great for many styles.  </li>
            <li>So I always try to be gentle on my hair and this product is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>I own three - one for the upstairs bathroom, one for the downstairs bathroom, and one for travel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Had a styler/dryer like this years ago, and liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then I lose the control of my hair that I liked before.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if AMAZON  would have informed me before I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Oh and by the way it doesn&#x27;t spin on its own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay MORE money for a better quality item!</li>
            <li>I bought 3 just to make sure I am never without one! : )  </li>
            <li>THis is by far the best product and an added bonus</li>
            <li>but it is a cheap product and broke fairly soon after I got it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and my hair looks shiny and voluminous!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s design is great, but the air isn&#x27;t as hot as a dryer should be.</li>
            <li>The hot air brush is great for drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Because the Hot Air Styler and Dryer is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I bought two, one is great, the first one I used the head came off</li>
            <li>I had a GREAT hot air brush, bought in the 90&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and not sturdy at all.</li>
            <li>The on/off is a bit tricky and the plastic is VERY cheap - otherwise a 5</li>
            <li>this product is very cheap in the making of it.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to use and liked the 2 sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy this brand again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I actually love this thing...</li>
            <li>I do love the results.  </li>
            <li>Then I section it off and spray each section with a John Frieda heat protectant to my ends just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)   </li>
            <li>Thank God for Amazon, who fortunately seems to have almost everything!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this would survive many trips in \\&quot;checked\\&quot; luggage.</li>
            <li>I paid more at a Beauty Supply outlet for this hair dryer</li>
            <li>The more I try to fix it, the more it messes up another section of my hair.  </li>
            <li>My kinky/frizzy hair was smoother and straighter but still had body, unlike when using a straightening iron, so it was okay.  </li>
            <li>Frankly i expect more from Revlon.</li>
            <li>The end result, nice smooth, silky, shiny and controlled with just a spriter of hair spray.  </li>
            <li>It grabs my hair better.    </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>but I would never be with out one of these stylers!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found one in the stores in quite awhile, so glad to find this...</li>
            <li>in fact, I purchased two of them to make sure I have one when this one stops working.  </li>
            <li>I plan to use the curling size brush tomorrow to get more than lift.  </li>
            <li>One star because it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something I could handle better.  </li>
            <li>I just cute my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this on the recommendation of my sister &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>many times I don&#x27;t even need to use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do wish it were a bit more durable.  </li>
            <li>but Revlon should be doing more product control on what they put out on the market.</li>
            <li>I will look until I find a better product.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li>I have had one of these for many years, but mine broke</li>
            <li>The plus is I&#x27;m sure it is better for my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay without the brush</li>
            <li>It was much more in stores</li>
            <li>fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many hair styling products which lasted for years.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>It would have been helpful if more information had been included in the description.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the more it happens.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of it</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably be better off buying something else.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I had the old style for many years and loved it!  </li>
            <li>It makes my bangs beautiful and professional looking, something I&#x27;ve never been able to do before.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good for 6 months.</li>
            <li>The brushes are easily changed by just pulling them out of the top of the blower/ heating unit.  </li>
            <li>Too much air blowing the hair around...not able to get a good curl because of this functuion.  </li>
            <li>I have used the hot air curling irons for many years and this seems the best so far.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, good temperature control, easy to work with ;)</li>
            <li>I suppose a large man could get a good grip</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the old hair dryers without this \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to return it to the store for a refund.</li>
            <li>This is so cheaply made I&#x27;m hoping it lasts until I can find a dryer/styler I like better.</li>
            <li>works okay for straightening my bangs, but it took a while to straighten my hair with it, and it still wasn&#x27;t that smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase, the unit gives a soft, yet holding curl to my hair.</li>
            <li>Extremely reasonable price wise and will buy another if and</li>
            <li>and I am now buying a more powerful one at Amazon!</li>
            <li>With this hot air brush, my hair has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>but they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also, wish it got hotter on &#x27;Low&#x27;, so my hair wouldn&#x27;t get so many fly aways.</li>
            <li>so I think all these types of curlers come apart easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>It could easily have been repurposed or refurbished (neither of which were disclosed on the product listing).</li>
            <li>I do like shopping for bargains on Amazon and they are easy to shop with, on returns, no problems.</li>
            <li>If this was made better and with a different latching system for the brush it would be a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Neither roller units were easy to clamp in and once in they loosened and fell out.</li>
            <li>rotate button was so easy to use</li>
            <li>I have purchased from Revlon because it is so easy to use and makes curing my hair faster because it dries as I curl.  </li>
            <li>Easy to operate, easy to change tips and will never be with out it.</li>
            <li>The styler pictured is the older model, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>I am by no means burly or exceptionally strong.</li>
            <li>Be sure to let the cool tip rotate while you press the button.”  </li>
            <li>This one is weaker and does not give as nice a finished product as the Revlon Shine Enhancing Hot Air Kit</li>
            <li>I had tried another type and it was so powerful that it was too strong to keep my hair wound around it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything good about the new model.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have no issues with the bristles pulling my hair through because I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product works fine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s like cat fur.  </li>
            <li>My hair turned out fine the 3 times I used it  </li>
            <li>This styler works well on my fine, somewhat sparse, medium length hair.</li>
            <li>It literally will go flying through the air 50 feet or more, hitting something or someone, and it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Makes great curls for short fine hair - and doesn&#x27;t cause any damage.</li>
            <li>Love the way it grips my fine hair and gives me the right amount of curl.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, though, to get those fantastic results!</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and it gives great results.</li>
            <li>Also it was so light and as soon as I started to use it</li>
            <li>In my opinion,  they need to fix this issue, minimumly make the brushes available as a separate perchase.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product.  </li>
            <li>And the unit is extremely light</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason why this thing is so cheap: it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the RV444 is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>is no longer available if this is the case, because I must have 8 of the RV444c in the attic.</li>
            <li>The barrels seem to be secure when they are placed onto the drying unit.  </li>
            <li>It is loud but it sounds like a good blow dryer</li>
            <li>I have never done a lot with my hair as far as styling it, But worked really good for even me.</li>
            <li>First off I want to say that I have used and LOVED this hot air brush for YEARS...</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and can not use the higher wattage units; like 800 or 1200 watts.  </li>
            <li>I see they have changed what was originally advertized.</li>
            <li>The original item stated ...</li>
            <li>I first owned a red one loved it!</li>
            <li>My original stopped working after about 3+ years</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone looking for more control when using a hot air brush dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this hot air styler/dryer.</li>
            <li>This product works better than any curling iron or hot brush</li>
            <li>and she is pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the Revlon Hot air stylers for many years.  </li>
            <li>&quot; it would come in it&#x27;s original packaging with an owners manual.</li>
            <li>3 stars is generous  because this never should have happened in the first place, and it seems to happen to so many people. .</li>
            <li>Because the barrell rotates, there isn&#x27;t significant pull on the hair - which causes breakage-</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom and she was really excited with it.</li>
            <li>It seems like it would be great for long to medium hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality, easy to grip, not big and awkward like all the others- perfect tool!</li>
            <li>Works great if you spritz the hair with some water or works well if hair partially dry.</li>
            <li>When it was working, it was not working great, as the brush would keep coming loose and sometimes would fall out.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to dry your hair!  </li>
            <li>I found a great substitute in the concair infitinity pro spinning barrel but the barrel is too wide for my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the earlier designed hairdrier for years and loved it, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li>It may work better on straight hair, but I can not attest to this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool temperature for setting a curl.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, but wish it a bit more heat.</li>
            <li>I had purchased that same styler from Walmart some years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I had never used one before, and I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely it dries</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s much cheaper than most of the rest in this category.</li>
            <li>I roll my hair up like I would with a curling iron and then flip it to cool before i release the hair from the barrel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good styler, but something I only use on occasion, depending on the time I have to spend on my hair that morning.  </li>
            <li>I finally had to replace it and thought Revlon should make a good product.  </li>
            <li>I have owned one of these Hot Air Stylers for many, many years and thought I should replace it with a new model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power switch is actually pretty easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>I used to own an older model Revlon Hot air styler/dryer.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a 3 star rating because, other than the design, I think for those with thicker hair, it probably will do a great job.  </li>
            <li>Does blow warm air through the barrels which are actually smaller than most on this type of appliance, which was why I wanted this one in the first place.</li>
            <li>I looked all over for a new one and ended up trying many different types and none of them worked as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>The first month or so it worked fine, but got looser over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a hair dryer/styler that is more solidly manufactured with more power, a concentrator and durable brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair super silky with lots of body and a bit of a curl at the ends.  </li>
            <li>Dries and styles quickly without damaging hair.</li>
            <li>This nice electric brush can curl, smooth and style with such speed it makes doing my hair a pleasure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying super glue, like they did.....</li>
            <li>When my Revlon hot air dryer broke after many years I replaced it with another Revlon hot air styler.</li>
            <li>This is an adequate device for curling your hair.  </li>
            <li>The pieces move and pop off too easily, so I glued the large rod in place.</li>
            <li>I sent my back and got a Conair one that it is a lot more user friendly and durable!</li>
            <li>I spend most of my time trying to get to the right setting and for an older person with arthritis</li>
            <li>The air flow too strong and the brush head very sparse</li>
            <li>First one was a good working wand for years, si I replaced it with the same brand.</li>
            <li>I am not coordinated enough to do the hairdryer/roller brush thing separately, so I LOVE this hairdryer!  </li>
            <li>The button to turn it off and on stuck more than once and now is completely stuck!  </li>
            <li>I later purchased a better brand where the heat comes through the holes on the roller as it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>Works good but the attachment is loose and shakes while combing hair.</li>
            <li>The end result is a very smooth, shiny and soft head of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a good dryer if you have straight to slightly wavy hair or if you have more time to do it.</li>
            <li>This product works well on fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when I realized that the heat and air are more concentrated with the smaller barrel, because the drying and smooth styling process were moving more quickly than with the larger barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles go in smoothly and really grip the hair</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;spin,&amp;#34; the brush just comes free to turn if you unlock it...</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice balance of qualities.</li>
            <li>I realized that I had to look more professional to teach students, so I set out for a timesaving solution.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>The device itself is a good styling tool, but 4 months is too short a lifespan, even at this reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed, too, that the brush falls off more often than my old styler/dryer did,</li>
            <li>For the larger brush my wife is happy and she likes that a lot as it works like her old curler brush used to.  </li>
            <li>but this one if totally different than the description....the air does not come through the  tube but blows more freely from where it attaches to the heating element.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be great for my daughter and I, but it does not straighten my naturally curly hair like a regular blow dryer does.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for easy hair care.</li>
            <li>Bring back the original design!!</li>
            <li>The blow power is just right for me.</li>
            <li>Just right for me.</li>
            <li>Did not work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Right out of the packaging</li>
            <li>The brush part just lifts right off.  </li>
            <li>But it is the right size I needed, clients still bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>The two different brush sizes are great for choosing more or less curl.</li>
            <li>I love this little gadget that was so powerful to take the kink right out of my hair making it smooth and styled in minutes!</li>
            <li>If the larger barrel is your thing, then I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be adequate for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the barrel wants to fall out, but, I just push it in and do my hair...</li>
            <li>only good thing is that it is much more quiet than the older model.  </li>
            <li>This is great for people with thin  / fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to switch from  Cool to Low Heat to High Heat with the slider switch.  </li>
            <li>Ceramic, Black and Purple, which was the style my wife loved.</li>
            <li>I finally learned how to style my own hair, but my abilities are absolutely reliant on using this type of brush.  </li>
            <li>The dryer doesn&#x27;t get very hot or have much velocity.  </li>
            <li>Loved this when i first got it, but in less than a year the barrel started to fall out.</li>
            <li>Came very fast and looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because I can blowdry my hair with one hand leaving the other free to grab hair to wrap around the brush portion.</li>
            <li>but, for me with short, rather thin and baby fine hair..it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My happiness was short lived, however, when I noticed a MAJOR design flaw:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did a great job on my hair and flexible bristles did not hurt my scalp, but the handle is so large that I have a difficult time gripping it.</li>
            <li>It was advertised as being able to dry hair more quickly than others of the same type.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>much better choice for about the same price:</li>
            <li>Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of them seem to last more than a year or two</li>
            <li>Before I review this product, I just want to make a comment about wattage first.  </li>
            <li>I have a Conair hot air brush which is 300 watts.  </li>
            <li>This Revlon hot air brush is 500 watts.  </li>
            <li>I then use the hot air brush to finish my hair, as if I was using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I got this Revlon hot air brush to replace my Conair hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>So, I thought I&#x27;d give this hot air brush a try.       </li>
            <li>I was amazed the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>This definitely is geared more to curling with</li>
            <li>My hair pretty much tends to stay that way!</li>
            <li>However, it does not last more than 4-6 months.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, both barrels came out as I was using it.</li>
            <li>The handle gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>I have used the hot air brushes for years ....</li>
            <li>I knew it was weeker and didn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li>This is the second one i&#x27;ve had and the first one was much better.</li>
            <li>I have two in different sizes and love them.</li>
            <li>It adds tons of volume and the first two days I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>This is NOT like the Conair hot air spin brush.  </li>
            <li>I have used this Revlon Hot Air styler for years, but now they have changed the style and I will never buy another one.</li>
            <li>I have had two hot air brushes before.</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what she wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li>and it can be so hot that it can burn your skin or scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, frizzy hair and this makes it beautiful, wavy or with pretty curls depending on how much time I want to take and there is no frizz and</li>

            <li>B000PXYAL2 Revlon RV444C Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic, Black]]&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Smaller brush roll bristles work better.</li>
            <li>B0012TOAGI Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic]]    </li>
            <li>Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic     </li>
            <li>Enter the hot air brush:</li>
            <li>Also, the barrell isn&#x27;t shockingly hot to touch, and my hair isn&#x27;t hot at all when done with a section.</li>
            <li>I did get the \\&quot;hot air\\</li>
            <li>This was not the hot air styler I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Some may be okay with burning the crapola out of their hands while removing it from their hair and placing it back on the unit.  </li>
            <li>So I switch to this Hot Air brush which I like.</li>
            <li>I thought the first one was just a lemon</li>
            <li>I will not purchase another Hot Air Brush ever again from Revlon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother to read the reviews because it looked exactly like the one I had been using.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and upon the first time using it, the attachment came off.</li>
            <li>Ok, but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl well</li>
            <li>This is my first blow dryer brush and I found heaven.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair in no time flat and gives me more volume than just about anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go from sopping wet hair to perfectly styled and dried in 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but as I got a new one that also rotates, I think this is not useful</li>
            <li>The first lasted over 3 years and did a terrific job ~ greta style, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>- the brush detaches so you can use it just as a dryer, it&#x27;s easy to switch to a different size brush while styling and the heat level isn&#x27;t so hot that it burns my hair.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use a heat protectant and not focus on a section too long.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>Ok so I must like to curl and dry my hair in one step.  </li>
            <li>Larger brush roll bristles tend to fall out easily.</li>
            <li>Had to spend two phone calls and numberous explanations to accomplish returning...not a pleasant experience and still not able to find the older model.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and very hard to find - but not hard to find on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>The handle on this one is large but not as large as the one I bought two months ago-also Revlon.  </li>
            <li>I used the large brush, which I thought would be too large</li>
            <li>The handle on this Styler is so large you can not get your hand around it.  </li>
            <li>This model is pure trash.  </li>
            <li>That said, however, it certainly has some design flaws.</li>
            <li>If you have short to medium length hair and want to do styling when hair is partially dry then this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and fine</li>
            <li>I have two of the older models and they are held together by duct tape and STILL work !  </li>
            <li>but I have never seen a women&#x27;s hand large enough to fit around it.  </li>
            <li>I am very upset with the Revelon Company for doing that.  </li>
            <li>They give you lots of body and work as fast as blowdryers do.</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon...</li>
            <li>I really wish I kept the receipt</li>
            <li>I paid $20 for it, which was $20 too much.</li>
            <li>but each time I use it, the time to do my whole head gets shorter and shorter.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE HAS BECOME QUITE HIGH!</li>
            <li>The model I had before the switch was a push button and it was so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Eventhough, BOTH my Vidal Sassoon and this one are made by Helen Of Troy in China, this is very inferior.</li>
            <li>However, the brush barrell eventually broke apart from the handle (from much use)</li>
            <li>The barrel does not spin as described, in fact, you press the button and it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the feature that allows me to release the brush and roll out the chunk of hair wrapped in the dryer.  </li>
            <li>The newer version is bulkier, brush heads very skimpy and cheaper all around.  </li>
            <li>Two weeks later the unused-by-me \\&quot;rotate\\&quot; button fell off, allowing the barrel to spin freely.      </li>
            <li>The whole thing is just too Mickey Mouse.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I have wavy to curly hair that is very frizzy.</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t need it anyway.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not seem to have much drying power.</li>
            <li>I really did like it  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li>Aside from not rotating I really like the product...</li>
            <li>Very aggravating.</li>
            <li>She found this one and it was very close in design to the one she had been using.  </li>
            <li>buy one very 18 months</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as comfortable when you have a smaller hand.  </li>
            <li>This works very well....easy to handle and work with.....</li>
            <li>, the downside is that my hair doesn&#x27;t curl very well with it.  </li>
            <li>I am very upset with the Revlon Company for doing that.</li>
            <li>Since this thing was so cheap, I don&#x27;t want to spend the time or $ to send it back for a refund, so I&#x27;ll probably just pitch it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied..</li>
            <li>Such a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I cannot use a regular brush and dryer on my own hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>but I would love to have my old model back.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find the old one anywhere!!!</li>
            <li>gets blown right off the brush, which defeats the purpose completely of using a blower brush for styling.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which is usually easy to curl, but this blows too hard and really doesn&#x27;t curl that well.</li>
            <li>Revlon needs to go back to the original design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more is that there were only about two hairs on the brush when I was done - usually there are many, and I didn&#x27;t feel any hair falling after I was done.</li>
            <li>When it arrived it was NOT in original packaging, but in a torn plastic case only.</li>
            <li>My old 300W Conair does a much better job but the barrel is too big for my newly shortened hair.</li>
            <li>I only use the large barrell, so i am going to super glue the barrell to the blower to fix this issue.</li>
            <li>I use this after taking most of the moisture out of my hair with a conventional dryer.  </li>
            <li>The old one you pushed a button to release the wand, this one just comes off sometimes, but its easy to put back on.  </li>
            <li>I also agree with another person that said it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the old ones used to.  </li>
            <li>300W Hot Air Styler and Dryer is marked 500W.</li>
            <li>Was so thrilled to find this because I was not able to find this &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; version in any of the stores.  </li>
            <li>I, like the one lady, prefer the old version of hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>That hot air should go directly up into the roller; it serves no purpose to be coming out the vents at all.  </li>
            <li>I do love my styler brush but its got its down sides.</li>
            <li>As soon as I plugged it in the first time, it made an odd noise, started smoking and smelled strongly of burning plastic.  </li>
            <li>It has 3 heat settings, cool, low, and high.  </li>
            <li>dryer has three settings: cool, low, and high.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was really fast and the product was brand new.</li>
            <li>This particular hot air brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>this tool not only makes up for my lack of styling skills, but, fits a lot better in my gym bag than a regular blow dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li>I thought this to be a sidekick and possible replacement for an OLD Vidal Sassoon hair dryer/styler kit that&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>I returned the 1st one, acepted the replacement, and sure enough the 2nd one did not spin either.  </li>
            <li>The product is what I expected, easy to use and closest to the older model I have.  </li>
            <li>Also the older model would break inside the chamber and then the brush wouldn&#x27;t stay in..</li>
            <li>So when I saw the older version online,(at</li>
            <li>I had an older one that worked well, but when it quit, I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I had the older version and the on/off did not stay on....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy thinking you are getting the older model version.  </li>
            <li>I had a way older model just like this one that was fantastic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heat doesn&#x27;t come out of the holes on the roller, instead the heat comes from the main unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several curling brushes over the years, most are Revlon and last for years...</li>
            <li>After searching on the internet for a new Revlon hot air styler, the product which resembled the old one I have, was found on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job as long as you don&#x27;t mind having to reinsert the brush 10 times every morning while trying to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>Two major problems with this hot air brush are deal breakers for me.  </li>
            <li>I like this product if the design would have been a little better.</li>
            <li>Also, with my fine hair, I ended up with a static electricity mess, I would assume due to the nylon bristles.      </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t nearly as quick as a flat iron,  </li>
            <li>I have had 2 Revlon brush blowdryers in the past several years and have liked them very much.  </li>
            <li>The brush is to soft but it drys really well</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to buy cheap, but I thought I might at least get an idea if I would even like this type of product before blowing over a hundred on a big girl tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean with dry shampoo</li>
            <li>The power isn&#x27;t consistent and I noticed on the 2nd use that the amount of air isn&#x27;t much and the temperature fluctuates while using it on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting, which I do.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed is that there is not a lot of power behind it, but it did add shine which I liked.</li>
            <li>And in order to change the attachments, I would use the smaller one on the crown section of my hair and the larger on the rest, you have to turn off the appliance, unplug it, and let it cool first.  </li>
            <li>I liked it well enough that I bought a second Freida brush slightly smaller</li>
            <li>I get a much better outcome with it than I did with a round brush and my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have kind of thick hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good idea, but poor quality.</li>
            <li>I guess I will try to dry it with a regular blow dryer most of the way then try and curl it with the brush, which will defeat the purpose of why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like: because it doesn&#x27;t get super hot, there is significantly less damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>So, I bought a new one and noticed they redesigned the way the brush attaches to the handle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li>it said it was new on the amazon review.</li>
            <li>So who is to say it was actually new?</li>
            <li>This new version has a button you push to allow the wand to spin.</li>
            <li>NEW?  </li>
            <li>Could&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Looking for a new one</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even have instructions as a new product would have.</li>
            <li>When I ordered, this was advertised as new.</li>
            <li>The barrel constantly fell off and it didn&#x27;t dry anything like the original model!</li>
            <li>Quick way to dry and curl hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use this for a quick finishing dry to prevent the frizzes</li>
            <li>like the fact that this product has a comfortable and workable brush head and does not get so hot that it burns my hair as other similar products do.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hot air brush finally died and she had to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>This product is the only thing I know that can make me curse first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a replacement for the exact same hair styler.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Revlon RV444C hot air styler and dryer because I thought I would be receiving the same dryer as pictured in the ad.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I have purchased this hot hair curling rod.</li>
            <li>Simply wore the first one out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several hot air brushes.</li>
            <li>Last one too hot</li>
            <li>The handle is larger than I like, cannot seem to find one like my original, but it works until I find a smaller handle one.</li>
            <li>the barrel gets hot enough to create some curl and it does have a smoothing effect.  </li>
            <li>It constantly comes off, which is a real pain in the neck!  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, my first I dropped on the tile floor and the curl attachment cracked</li>
            <li>They used to make all hot air brushes with thinner handles, and now you can only find the fat ones.  </li>
            <li>The hot air brush makes it possible</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that is a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;  fix, but it works until I can find something better.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hot air styler about a year ago and only used about 3 times.</li>
            <li>Although it stings the pocketbook initially, it will be a better investment to purchase a stronger, more expensive model.</li>
            <li>and I try to keep my flat iron to minimal usage to keep my hair healthy and try to use this in between.</li>
            <li>Today the low setting cut out completely, and I can only use the dryer on the cool or high settings.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how good a product is, 500 watts will NOT dry hair (at least in this lifetime), nor should you expect it to!  </li>
            <li>Needed a new one because the brush keeps falling off my old one.</li>
            <li>The vents blow your hair around while drying your hair, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough like the old model; therefore, the styling doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The next thing you will notice is the fact it does not get as hot as the old model.  </li>
            <li>Release curls by placing the finger of one hand on the cool tip and pressing the rotate barrel button with the other hand.</li>
            <li>I first completely dry my hair with a normal hair dryer, then I use this unit to curl it.  </li>
            <li>.. get&#x27;s a little hot for fine hair after a bit so have to stop if you are using for a long time.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve added a large air vent between the barrel and the brush, which blows the hair every which way, so that it doesn&#x27;t wrap about the brush properly and therefore doesn&#x27;t create the desired curl.  </li>
            <li>However, I only use the large part.</li>
            <li>I did not order a used brush/dryer, but it arrived with a large scratch on one portion and there were hairs in the smaller brush attachment!!!  </li>
            <li>The one that bothers me most is the way you interchange the barrels -- no release, you just pull them, rather hard.</li>
            <li>&quot; part to work, but I agree with other reviewers that it seems like the air flow isn&#x27;t strong enough (</li>
            <li>High is equivalent to my hair dryer&#x27;s low setting, low is kind of irrelevant &amp; cool sets the curl quite well.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this product should be listed as NEW...came in a clear plastic zip bag without manual, manufacturers name...</li>
            <li>It came in a clear plastic zipper bag with no manual.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really recommend for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I know the person or persons who redesigned the drier never dried their hair with it.  </li>
            <li>When purchasing this on Amazon the photo is of the OLD model which was what I was loooking for.  </li>
            <li>The effect is soft and natural.</li>
            <li>As a college student, I&#x27;m really busy.</li>
            <li>One con: it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li>I cannot manage a straight-bladed hair straightener, and even if I COULD, I would have to straighten out my natural chaos and then curl my hair into some semblance of style.  </li>
            <li>The old style brush blow dryers have always worked wonders for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking on ebay to see if I can find one of the old models.  </li>
            <li>My old Revlon curler did not come apart</li>
            <li>No rotation or spin action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like my money back.</li>
            <li>the old model I used every day, this one I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>and the brushes are too soft and do not grip the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Revlon fan for a long time but won&#x27;t buy another hot air curling iron from you until you change it.</li>
            <li>So far they haven&#x27;t fallen out like</li>
            <li>I had no trouble whatsoever returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li>The pictures on this site are showing the old design.  </li>
            <li>But.. I notice -mart is also showing the old model on their site.  </li>
            <li>Still like the old model that did not blow air through the brush.  </li>
            <li>Hope the next one is not broken.</li>
            <li>Leaving hair, as advertised, soft, shiny and softly curled.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old with arthritis</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I was so sure I would love this I threw all packaging away and will just have to lose the money I spent on this.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for the old model that I used.</li>
            <li>For what I spent it isn&#x27;t worth the return hassles.</li>
            <li>The handle is not quite as slim as it used to be, but still not as thick as most.  </li>
            <li>The Revlon RV 444c hot styler because it falls apart in your hand while you are trying to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>If I am in a hurry, I semi blow dry my hair first.  </li>
            <li>This model is not as superhot for sensitive skin as my previous Revlon brush dryer, and it switches to the powerful cool down setting faster.  </li>
            <li>The new ones have what they call an &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; but they have holes that just blow some of the hair around and is not really directed to a certain area.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hot air brush at KMart, its the only one they have with a larger size barrel.</li>
            <li>Since I couldn&#x27;t find the same hot air brush dryer in stores, I ordered it from Amazon since it looked the same as the one I had.  </li>
            <li>The smaller barrel, which I use on my older model, is ineffective on this newer model.  </li>
            <li>This is the third Hot Air Brush (same model)</li>
            <li>but I was looking for the older model that was advertised and received a different model</li>
            <li>I bought this brush a few years ago (an old model) and I really liked it while it lasted (about 2 years), then it started overheating and would turn off after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li>I like the way it works, but it simply does not hold up under normal use.</li>
            <li>i have naturally curly, coarse thick hair, but I loved my other Revlon Airbrush.</li>
            <li>It used to take two to three days for my hair to calm down after washing.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I love the other Revlon Air Brush, 1200 watt and pink, but mine broke after a year, and i was on vacation, so the only product they had at Walmart was the Revlon 444C.  </li>
            <li>Not helpful when you are sent the new model which I could have purchased locally.  </li>
            <li>The new design of this product does not allow it to be used as it was prior to this change.  </li>
            <li>but the new 444c is a total redesign and</li>
            <li>However, while it did appeared to be new (in that it did not appear to be used), it came in a plastic baggie sealed only with a sticker.</li>
            <li>I bought the new model thinking it would be the same as advertised.</li>
            <li>Nothing but a sticker on outside saying item name &amp; NEW....</li>
            <li>The plastic \\&quot;seat\\&quot; for the smaller roller unit broke when still fairly new.</li>
            <li>Is this package really new as the print-out white label claims?</li>
            <li>The new one has air holes above handles which dry your hair too fast</li>
            <li>Handle too thick to turn easily.</li>
            <li>(I flip it upside down) and with my fine hair, it takes about a minute to get it almost dry.   </li>
            <li>My hot air brush recently burnt out and I ran out to the nearest store and found this one it was the same brand but a different model.</li>
            <li>The barrel gets hot, but there isn’t enough air blowing to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>nor hot enough) to dry and curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That makes it very hard for someone who has difficulty gripping to use it.  </li>
            <li>That makes it very hard for someone who has difficulty gripping to use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that this would be as effective for someone with very long, thick or coarse hair...</li>
            <li>I had a older model for several years, it finally quit working.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a year and the switch on this model is hard to move from high to low and cool.  </li>
            <li>But in hindsight, I didn&#x27;t try to order another curl attachment as this one was hard enough to find, I was only able to find it online.</li>
            <li>The bristles are short and don&#x27;t grab super tight on the hair.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is the barrel does not stay securely on the device, so</li>
            <li>However it is gentler in general on my hair when I need to use it.</li>
            <li>and I think the whole handle will break if I try any harder.</li>
            <li>I will buy another one if Revlon can go back to some of the old ideas.</li>
            <li>Plugged it in this morning and it barely starts up plus has a burning smell.</li>
            <li>Last one ,vital piece of plastic broke off  and brush at top end became thin.  </li>
            <li>Even worse is that air blows out of vents at the bottom of the brush in the top of the handle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok just hard to switch between large and small barrel.  </li>
            <li>My previous Revlon 444c hot air brush just died after about two years</li>
            <li>The other model gets much hotter.  </li>
            <li>After that short time, it would only heat for a minute or less before the heating element turned off and it blew only cool air.</li>
            <li>Even with little resistance and no rotating, the barrel sneaks its way out of the coupling, which leaves a hot ceramic brush dangling from your flowing locks.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed in this model as it is very flimsy and the brush slides off the blowers very easly, making the styling difficult.</li>
            <li>I tried to obtain the same model, but had to settle for the RV444C, which is apparently its newer replacement.  </li>
            <li>I am keeping mine for the reasons I mentioned above, but still need to use another older model of a different manufacturer to dry and style my hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li>In just that few seconds, the handle also became hot.</li>
            <li>I bought a John Freida brush here on amazon which was more expensive but a much better use of money since this one was extremely frustrating.  </li>
            <li>It takes longer to dry and without consistent heat through out one single sitting, I can get different outcomes on different sections of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two, due to the fact that it is an older model, and Revlon said that Amazon bought all their stock.</li>
            <li>My daughter has super thick and long hair and this does not have enough power to dry her hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>to dry and style hair with one hand with professional results.  </li>
            <li>The air holes at the base of the barrel prevent hot air from being directed effectively into the barrel.  </li>
            <li>MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE AS IT GETS HOT WHILE USING IT, IT JUST COMES LOOSE DUE</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summation, if you have thick, coarse, or long hair, this specific product will likely not be strong enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>The blower is not nearly as strong as my previously styling brush, which actually allows my fine hair to stay around the brush.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and this hair dying brush</li>
            <li>and I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li>I like the way it gently dries my hair and styles it a little too.  </li>
            <li>This item has too little wattage to achieve the straight (no curl) effect I want.</li>
            <li>This is impossible to do when they are hot, and seems like it would break rather easily</li>

            <li> Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> it is still wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the Revlon Perfect Heat</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is great!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great tool to have!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This hair styling device has given me the best hair I&#x27;ve had in years.  </li>
            <li> and it is awesome.</li>
            <li> The concept is wonderful!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very happy about it!</li>
            <li> but besides that is great!</li>
            <li> When this was working I was very happy with it</li>
            <li> A very good buy</li>
            <li> My brilliant husband looked at it and discovered that the barrel had a crack in it where it entered into the handle.</li>
            <li> and it works real nice without frizzing up my hair.</li>
            <li> Good choice!</li>
            <li> Quite good styler and dryer!</li>
            <li> Otherwise good product choice at the best price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> from that moment on I was hooked, it did everything I needed it to do to get the job done beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had them fly out across the room.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this brush hair dryer, I tried it out ... with great results.  </li>
            <li> If this sounds like your hair Revlon still has a great product for you</li>
            <li> all the brush is great.</li>
            <li> While she was happy to receive it, she, nor I, were happy with how it came packaged.</li>
            <li> or so it will be great  </li>
            <li> I had a great expectation from it</li>
            <li> IT does a great job if you can keep the brush on--thus my 3 stars.</li>
            <li> These are the best dryers of this kind but thy fall apart in about a year&lt;</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li> great for the price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> Great price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It was the best product out there for my hair until this latest model came along.  </li>
            <li> Why manufacturers choose to change a successful product like this is beyond me.  </li>
            <li> Loving this &amp; am looking forward to doing my hair again!</li>
            <li> and they were very courteous and all is good.</li>
            <li> It is a fair product.  </li>
            <li> so it went to good will.</li>
            <li> Each time I remember why I gave it to Good Will and bought another product.  </li>
            <li> Good idea</li>
            <li> there is nothing out there as good for my hair</li>
            <li> Even with those problems and having to replace about once a year I still loved.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it broke after 2 months....</li>
            <li> Good air flow</li>
            <li> Good dryer.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun  cordless curler before which I loved</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good solution for my mom who likes to touch up her hair in between salad visits.</li>
            <li> She loved it and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The hair dries quickly as the brush gives excellent control.</li>
            <li> I am impressed how quickly it heats up and drys hair.</li>
            <li> is something practical, useful and excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;reached</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It was not the best hot air brush design I have used.  </li>
            <li> It works OK, it should just get hotter!</li>
            <li> I love the result!  </li>
            <li> The Revlon hot air brush (RV444) is the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> AND MOST OF THEM CAME FROM AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT CURLS MY HAIR!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> this one is much, much better!</li>
            <li> but gladly it still works and does miracles to my hair!</li>
            <li> Revlon Perfect Heat 1 inch &amp; 1 - 1/2 inch hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I can use it again with this easy fix.</li>
            <li> Does the job,  don&#x27;t expect amazing curls though.</li>
            <li> But over all nice.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself is ok the attachments are great for many styles.  </li>
            <li> So I always try to be gentle on my hair and this product is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li> I own three - one for the upstairs bathroom, one for the downstairs bathroom, and one for travel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> Had a styler/dryer like this years ago, and liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then I lose the control of my hair that I liked before.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if AMAZON  would have informed me before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Oh and by the way it doesn&#x27;t spin on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay MORE money for a better quality item!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 just to make sure I am never without one! : )  </li>
            <li> THis is by far the best product and an added bonus</li>
            <li> but it is a cheap product and broke fairly soon after I got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and my hair looks shiny and voluminous!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design is great, but the air isn&#x27;t as hot as a dryer should be.</li>
            <li> The hot air brush is great for drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Because the Hot Air Styler and Dryer is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I bought two, one is great, the first one I used the head came off</li>
            <li> I had a GREAT hot air brush, bought in the 90&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and not sturdy at all.</li>
            <li> The on/off is a bit tricky and the plastic is VERY cheap - otherwise a 5</li>
            <li> this product is very cheap in the making of it.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use and liked the 2 sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this brand again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I actually love this thing...</li>
            <li> I do love the results.  </li>
            <li> Then I section it off and spray each section with a John Frieda heat protectant to my ends just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)   </li>
            <li> Thank God for Amazon, who fortunately seems to have almost everything!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this would survive many trips in \\&quot;checked\\&quot; luggage.</li>
            <li> I paid more at a Beauty Supply outlet for this hair dryer</li>
            <li> The more I try to fix it, the more it messes up another section of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My kinky/frizzy hair was smoother and straighter but still had body, unlike when using a straightening iron, so it was okay.  </li>
            <li> Frankly i expect more from Revlon.</li>
            <li> The end result, nice smooth, silky, shiny and controlled with just a spriter of hair spray.  </li>
            <li> It grabs my hair better.    </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> but I would never be with out one of these stylers!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found one in the stores in quite awhile, so glad to find this...</li>
            <li> in fact, I purchased two of them to make sure I have one when this one stops working.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use the curling size brush tomorrow to get more than lift.  </li>
            <li> One star because it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something I could handle better.  </li>
            <li> I just cute my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my sister &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to be a great product.  </li>
            <li> many times I don&#x27;t even need to use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do wish it were a bit more durable.  </li>
            <li> but Revlon should be doing more product control on what they put out on the market.</li>
            <li> I will look until I find a better product.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for many years, but mine broke</li>
            <li> The plus is I&#x27;m sure it is better for my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay without the brush</li>
            <li> It was much more in stores</li>
            <li> fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many hair styling products which lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> It would have been helpful if more information had been included in the description.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the more it happens.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of it</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably be better off buying something else.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I had the old style for many years and loved it!  </li>
            <li> It makes my bangs beautiful and professional looking, something I&#x27;ve never been able to do before.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good for 6 months.</li>
            <li> The brushes are easily changed by just pulling them out of the top of the blower/ heating unit.  </li>
            <li> Too much air blowing the hair around...not able to get a good curl because of this functuion.  </li>
            <li> I have used the hot air curling irons for many years and this seems the best so far.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, good temperature control, easy to work with ;)</li>
            <li> I suppose a large man could get a good grip</li>
            <li> I was so happy with the old hair dryers without this \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was able to return it to the store for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is so cheaply made I&#x27;m hoping it lasts until I can find a dryer/styler I like better.</li>
            <li> works okay for straightening my bangs, but it took a while to straighten my hair with it, and it still wasn&#x27;t that smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase, the unit gives a soft, yet holding curl to my hair.</li>
            <li> Extremely reasonable price wise and will buy another if and</li>
            <li> and I am now buying a more powerful one at Amazon!</li>
            <li> With this hot air brush, my hair has never looked better!  </li>
            <li> but they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also, wish it got hotter on &#x27;Low&#x27;, so my hair wouldn&#x27;t get so many fly aways.</li>
            <li> so I think all these types of curlers come apart easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> It could easily have been repurposed or refurbished (neither of which were disclosed on the product listing).</li>
            <li> I do like shopping for bargains on Amazon and they are easy to shop with, on returns, no problems.</li>
            <li> If this was made better and with a different latching system for the brush it would be a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Neither roller units were easy to clamp in and once in they loosened and fell out.</li>
            <li> rotate button was so easy to use</li>
            <li> I have purchased from Revlon because it is so easy to use and makes curing my hair faster because it dries as I curl.  </li>
            <li> Easy to operate, easy to change tips and will never be with out it.</li>
            <li> The styler pictured is the older model, which I loved.  </li>
            <li> I am by no means burly or exceptionally strong.</li>
            <li> Be sure to let the cool tip rotate while you press the button.”  </li>
            <li> This one is weaker and does not give as nice a finished product as the Revlon Shine Enhancing Hot Air Kit</li>
            <li> I had tried another type and it was so powerful that it was too strong to keep my hair wound around it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything good about the new model.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have no issues with the bristles pulling my hair through because I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product works fine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s like cat fur.  </li>
            <li> My hair turned out fine the 3 times I used it  </li>
            <li> This styler works well on my fine, somewhat sparse, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> It literally will go flying through the air 50 feet or more, hitting something or someone, and it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Makes great curls for short fine hair - and doesn&#x27;t cause any damage.</li>
            <li> Love the way it grips my fine hair and gives me the right amount of curl.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, though, to get those fantastic results!</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and it gives great results.</li>
            <li> Also it was so light and as soon as I started to use it</li>
            <li> In my opinion,  they need to fix this issue, minimumly make the brushes available as a separate perchase.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product.  </li>
            <li> And the unit is extremely light</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why this thing is so cheap: it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the RV444 is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> is no longer available if this is the case, because I must have 8 of the RV444c in the attic.</li>
            <li> The barrels seem to be secure when they are placed onto the drying unit.  </li>
            <li> It is loud but it sounds like a good blow dryer</li>
            <li> I have never done a lot with my hair as far as styling it, But worked really good for even me.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I have used and LOVED this hot air brush for YEARS...</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and can not use the higher wattage units; like 800 or 1200 watts.  </li>
            <li> I see they have changed what was originally advertized.</li>
            <li> The original item stated ...</li>
            <li> I first owned a red one loved it!</li>
            <li> My original stopped working after about 3+ years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone looking for more control when using a hot air brush dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air styler/dryer.</li>
            <li> This product works better than any curling iron or hot brush</li>
            <li> and she is pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Revlon Hot air stylers for many years.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it would come in it&#x27;s original packaging with an owners manual.</li>
            <li> 3 stars is generous  because this never should have happened in the first place, and it seems to happen to so many people. .</li>
            <li> Because the barrell rotates, there isn&#x27;t significant pull on the hair - which causes breakage-</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she was really excited with it.</li>
            <li> It seems like it would be great for long to medium hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality, easy to grip, not big and awkward like all the others- perfect tool!</li>
            <li> Works great if you spritz the hair with some water or works well if hair partially dry.</li>
            <li> When it was working, it was not working great, as the brush would keep coming loose and sometimes would fall out.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to dry your hair!  </li>
            <li> I found a great substitute in the concair infitinity pro spinning barrel but the barrel is too wide for my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used the earlier designed hairdrier for years and loved it, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li> It may work better on straight hair, but I can not attest to this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool temperature for setting a curl.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but wish it a bit more heat.</li>
            <li> I had purchased that same styler from Walmart some years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I had never used one before, and I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely it dries</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s much cheaper than most of the rest in this category.</li>
            <li> I roll my hair up like I would with a curling iron and then flip it to cool before i release the hair from the barrel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good styler, but something I only use on occasion, depending on the time I have to spend on my hair that morning.  </li>
            <li> I finally had to replace it and thought Revlon should make a good product.  </li>
            <li> I have owned one of these Hot Air Stylers for many, many years and thought I should replace it with a new model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power switch is actually pretty easy to navigate.</li>
            <li> I used to own an older model Revlon Hot air styler/dryer.  </li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 star rating because, other than the design, I think for those with thicker hair, it probably will do a great job.  </li>
            <li> Does blow warm air through the barrels which are actually smaller than most on this type of appliance, which was why I wanted this one in the first place.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for a new one and ended up trying many different types and none of them worked as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> The first month or so it worked fine, but got looser over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a hair dryer/styler that is more solidly manufactured with more power, a concentrator and durable brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair super silky with lots of body and a bit of a curl at the ends.  </li>
            <li> Dries and styles quickly without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> This nice electric brush can curl, smooth and style with such speed it makes doing my hair a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying super glue, like they did.....</li>
            <li> When my Revlon hot air dryer broke after many years I replaced it with another Revlon hot air styler.</li>
            <li> This is an adequate device for curling your hair.  </li>
            <li> The pieces move and pop off too easily, so I glued the large rod in place.</li>
            <li> I sent my back and got a Conair one that it is a lot more user friendly and durable!</li>
            <li> I spend most of my time trying to get to the right setting and for an older person with arthritis</li>
            <li> The air flow too strong and the brush head very sparse</li>
            <li> First one was a good working wand for years, si I replaced it with the same brand.</li>
            <li> I am not coordinated enough to do the hairdryer/roller brush thing separately, so I LOVE this hairdryer!  </li>
            <li> The button to turn it off and on stuck more than once and now is completely stuck!  </li>
            <li> I later purchased a better brand where the heat comes through the holes on the roller as it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> Works good but the attachment is loose and shakes while combing hair.</li>
            <li> The end result is a very smooth, shiny and soft head of hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a good dryer if you have straight to slightly wavy hair or if you have more time to do it.</li>
            <li> This product works well on fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I was excited when I realized that the heat and air are more concentrated with the smaller barrel, because the drying and smooth styling process were moving more quickly than with the larger barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles go in smoothly and really grip the hair</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;spin,&amp;#34; the brush just comes free to turn if you unlock it...</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice balance of qualities.</li>
            <li> I realized that I had to look more professional to teach students, so I set out for a timesaving solution.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The device itself is a good styling tool, but 4 months is too short a lifespan, even at this reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed, too, that the brush falls off more often than my old styler/dryer did,</li>
            <li> For the larger brush my wife is happy and she likes that a lot as it works like her old curler brush used to.  </li>
            <li> but this one if totally different than the description....the air does not come through the  tube but blows more freely from where it attaches to the heating element.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be great for my daughter and I, but it does not straighten my naturally curly hair like a regular blow dryer does.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for easy hair care.</li>
            <li> Bring back the original design!!</li>
            <li> The blow power is just right for me.</li>
            <li> Just right for me.</li>
            <li> Did not work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Right out of the packaging</li>
            <li> The brush part just lifts right off.  </li>
            <li> But it is the right size I needed, clients still bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> The two different brush sizes are great for choosing more or less curl.</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget that was so powerful to take the kink right out of my hair making it smooth and styled in minutes!</li>
            <li> If the larger barrel is your thing, then I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be adequate for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the barrel wants to fall out, but, I just push it in and do my hair...</li>
            <li> only good thing is that it is much more quiet than the older model.  </li>
            <li> This is great for people with thin  / fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to switch from  Cool to Low Heat to High Heat with the slider switch.  </li>
            <li> Ceramic, Black and Purple, which was the style my wife loved.</li>
            <li> I finally learned how to style my own hair, but my abilities are absolutely reliant on using this type of brush.  </li>
            <li> The dryer doesn&#x27;t get very hot or have much velocity.  </li>
            <li> Loved this when i first got it, but in less than a year the barrel started to fall out.</li>
            <li> Came very fast and looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because I can blowdry my hair with one hand leaving the other free to grab hair to wrap around the brush portion.</li>
            <li> but, for me with short, rather thin and baby fine hair..it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My happiness was short lived, however, when I noticed a MAJOR design flaw:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did a great job on my hair and flexible bristles did not hurt my scalp, but the handle is so large that I have a difficult time gripping it.</li>
            <li> It was advertised as being able to dry hair more quickly than others of the same type.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> much better choice for about the same price:</li>
            <li> Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of them seem to last more than a year or two</li>
            <li> Before I review this product, I just want to make a comment about wattage first.  </li>
            <li> I have a Conair hot air brush which is 300 watts.  </li>
            <li> This Revlon hot air brush is 500 watts.  </li>
            <li> I then use the hot air brush to finish my hair, as if I was using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I got this Revlon hot air brush to replace my Conair hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> So, I thought I&#x27;d give this hot air brush a try.       </li>
            <li> I was amazed the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> This definitely is geared more to curling with</li>
            <li> My hair pretty much tends to stay that way!</li>
            <li> However, it does not last more than 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, both barrels came out as I was using it.</li>
            <li> The handle gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> I have used the hot air brushes for years ....</li>
            <li> I knew it was weeker and didn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> This is the second one i&#x27;ve had and the first one was much better.</li>
            <li> I have two in different sizes and love them.</li>
            <li> It adds tons of volume and the first two days I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> This is NOT like the Conair hot air spin brush.  </li>
            <li> I have used this Revlon Hot Air styler for years, but now they have changed the style and I will never buy another one.</li>
            <li> I have had two hot air brushes before.</li>
            <li> and it does exactly what she wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li> and it can be so hot that it can burn your skin or scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair and this makes it beautiful, wavy or with pretty curls depending on how much time I want to take and there is no frizz and</li>

            <li> Enter the hot air brush:</li>
            <li> Also, the barrell isn&#x27;t shockingly hot to touch, and my hair isn&#x27;t hot at all when done with a section.</li>
            <li> I did get the \\&quot;hot air\\</li>
            <li> This was not the hot air styler I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Some may be okay with burning the crapola out of their hands while removing it from their hair and placing it back on the unit.  </li>
            <li> So I switch to this Hot Air brush which I like.</li>
            <li> I thought the first one was just a lemon</li>
            <li> I will not purchase another Hot Air Brush ever again from Revlon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to read the reviews because it looked exactly like the one I had been using.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and upon the first time using it, the attachment came off.</li>
            <li> Ok, but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl well</li>
            <li> This is my first blow dryer brush and I found heaven.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair in no time flat and gives me more volume than just about anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go from sopping wet hair to perfectly styled and dried in 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but as I got a new one that also rotates, I think this is not useful</li>
            <li> The first lasted over 3 years and did a terrific job ~ greta style, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> - the brush detaches so you can use it just as a dryer, it&#x27;s easy to switch to a different size brush while styling and the heat level isn&#x27;t so hot that it burns my hair.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use a heat protectant and not focus on a section too long.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> Ok so I must like to curl and dry my hair in one step.  </li>
            <li> Larger brush roll bristles tend to fall out easily.</li>
            <li> Had to spend two phone calls and numberous explanations to accomplish returning...not a pleasant experience and still not able to find the older model.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very hard to find - but not hard to find on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The handle on this one is large but not as large as the one I bought two months ago-also Revlon.  </li>
            <li> I used the large brush, which I thought would be too large</li>
            <li> The handle on this Styler is so large you can not get your hand around it.  </li>
            <li> This model is pure trash.  </li>
            <li> That said, however, it certainly has some design flaws.</li>
            <li> If you have short to medium length hair and want to do styling when hair is partially dry then this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and fine</li>
            <li> I have two of the older models and they are held together by duct tape and STILL work !  </li>
            <li> but I have never seen a women&#x27;s hand large enough to fit around it.  </li>
            <li> I am very upset with the Revelon Company for doing that.  </li>
            <li> They give you lots of body and work as fast as blowdryers do.</li>
            <li> Thanks Revlon...</li>
            <li> I really wish I kept the receipt</li>
            <li> I paid $20 for it, which was $20 too much.</li>
            <li> but each time I use it, the time to do my whole head gets shorter and shorter.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE HAS BECOME QUITE HIGH!</li>
            <li> The model I had before the switch was a push button and it was so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Eventhough, BOTH my Vidal Sassoon and this one are made by Helen Of Troy in China, this is very inferior.</li>
            <li> However, the brush barrell eventually broke apart from the handle (from much use)</li>
            <li> The barrel does not spin as described, in fact, you press the button and it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the feature that allows me to release the brush and roll out the chunk of hair wrapped in the dryer.  </li>
            <li> The newer version is bulkier, brush heads very skimpy and cheaper all around.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks later the unused-by-me \\&quot;rotate\\&quot; button fell off, allowing the barrel to spin freely.      </li>
            <li> The whole thing is just too Mickey Mouse.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly hair that is very frizzy.</li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t need it anyway.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not seem to have much drying power.</li>
            <li> I really did like it  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li> Aside from not rotating I really like the product...</li>
            <li> Very aggravating.</li>
            <li> She found this one and it was very close in design to the one she had been using.  </li>
            <li> buy one very 18 months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as comfortable when you have a smaller hand.  </li>
            <li> This works very well....easy to handle and work with.....</li>
            <li> , the downside is that my hair doesn&#x27;t curl very well with it.  </li>
            <li> I am very upset with the Revlon Company for doing that.</li>
            <li> Since this thing was so cheap, I don&#x27;t want to spend the time or $ to send it back for a refund, so I&#x27;ll probably just pitch it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied..</li>
            <li> Such a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I cannot use a regular brush and dryer on my own hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> but I would love to have my old model back.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the old one anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> gets blown right off the brush, which defeats the purpose completely of using a blower brush for styling.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which is usually easy to curl, but this blows too hard and really doesn&#x27;t curl that well.</li>
            <li> Revlon needs to go back to the original design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> many other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more is that there were only about two hairs on the brush when I was done - usually there are many, and I didn&#x27;t feel any hair falling after I was done.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was NOT in original packaging, but in a torn plastic case only.</li>
            <li> My old 300W Conair does a much better job but the barrel is too big for my newly shortened hair.</li>
            <li> I only use the large barrell, so i am going to super glue the barrell to the blower to fix this issue.</li>
            <li> I use this after taking most of the moisture out of my hair with a conventional dryer.  </li>
            <li> The old one you pushed a button to release the wand, this one just comes off sometimes, but its easy to put back on.  </li>
            <li> I also agree with another person that said it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the old ones used to.  </li>
            <li> 300W Hot Air Styler and Dryer is marked 500W.</li>
            <li> Was so thrilled to find this because I was not able to find this &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; version in any of the stores.  </li>
            <li> I, like the one lady, prefer the old version of hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> That hot air should go directly up into the roller; it serves no purpose to be coming out the vents at all.  </li>
            <li> I do love my styler brush but its got its down sides.</li>
            <li> As soon as I plugged it in the first time, it made an odd noise, started smoking and smelled strongly of burning plastic.  </li>
            <li> It has 3 heat settings, cool, low, and high.  </li>
            <li> dryer has three settings: cool, low, and high.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was really fast and the product was brand new.</li>
            <li> This particular hot air brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> this tool not only makes up for my lack of styling skills, but, fits a lot better in my gym bag than a regular blow dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li> I thought this to be a sidekick and possible replacement for an OLD Vidal Sassoon hair dryer/styler kit that&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li> I returned the 1st one, acepted the replacement, and sure enough the 2nd one did not spin either.  </li>
            <li> The product is what I expected, easy to use and closest to the older model I have.  </li>
            <li> Also the older model would break inside the chamber and then the brush wouldn&#x27;t stay in..</li>
            <li> So when I saw the older version online,(at</li>
            <li> I had an older one that worked well, but when it quit, I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I had the older version and the on/off did not stay on....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy thinking you are getting the older model version.  </li>
            <li> I had a way older model just like this one that was fantastic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heat doesn&#x27;t come out of the holes on the roller, instead the heat comes from the main unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several curling brushes over the years, most are Revlon and last for years...</li>
            <li> After searching on the internet for a new Revlon hot air styler, the product which resembled the old one I have, was found on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job as long as you don&#x27;t mind having to reinsert the brush 10 times every morning while trying to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> Two major problems with this hot air brush are deal breakers for me.  </li>
            <li> I like this product if the design would have been a little better.</li>
            <li> Also, with my fine hair, I ended up with a static electricity mess, I would assume due to the nylon bristles.      </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t nearly as quick as a flat iron,  </li>
            <li> I have had 2 Revlon brush blowdryers in the past several years and have liked them very much.  </li>
            <li> The brush is to soft but it drys really well</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to buy cheap, but I thought I might at least get an idea if I would even like this type of product before blowing over a hundred on a big girl tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean with dry shampoo</li>
            <li> The power isn&#x27;t consistent and I noticed on the 2nd use that the amount of air isn&#x27;t much and the temperature fluctuates while using it on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting, which I do.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed is that there is not a lot of power behind it, but it did add shine which I liked.</li>
            <li> And in order to change the attachments, I would use the smaller one on the crown section of my hair and the larger on the rest, you have to turn off the appliance, unplug it, and let it cool first.  </li>
            <li> I liked it well enough that I bought a second Freida brush slightly smaller</li>
            <li> I get a much better outcome with it than I did with a round brush and my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have kind of thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good idea, but poor quality.</li>
            <li> I guess I will try to dry it with a regular blow dryer most of the way then try and curl it with the brush, which will defeat the purpose of why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like: because it doesn&#x27;t get super hot, there is significantly less damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> So, I bought a new one and noticed they redesigned the way the brush attaches to the handle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li> it said it was new on the amazon review.</li>
            <li> So who is to say it was actually new?</li>
            <li> This new version has a button you push to allow the wand to spin.</li>
            <li> NEW?  </li>
            <li> Could&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Looking for a new one</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even have instructions as a new product would have.</li>
            <li> When I ordered, this was advertised as new.</li>
            <li> The barrel constantly fell off and it didn&#x27;t dry anything like the original model!</li>
            <li> Quick way to dry and curl hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use this for a quick finishing dry to prevent the frizzes</li>
            <li> like the fact that this product has a comfortable and workable brush head and does not get so hot that it burns my hair as other similar products do.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hot air brush finally died and she had to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> This product is the only thing I know that can make me curse first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a replacement for the exact same hair styler.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon RV444C hot air styler and dryer because I thought I would be receiving the same dryer as pictured in the ad.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this hot hair curling rod.</li>
            <li> Simply wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several hot air brushes.</li>
            <li> Last one too hot</li>
            <li> The handle is larger than I like, cannot seem to find one like my original, but it works until I find a smaller handle one.</li>
            <li> the barrel gets hot enough to create some curl and it does have a smoothing effect.  </li>
            <li> It constantly comes off, which is a real pain in the neck!  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, my first I dropped on the tile floor and the curl attachment cracked</li>
            <li> They used to make all hot air brushes with thinner handles, and now you can only find the fat ones.  </li>
            <li> The hot air brush makes it possible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that is a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;  fix, but it works until I can find something better.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air styler about a year ago and only used about 3 times.</li>
            <li> Although it stings the pocketbook initially, it will be a better investment to purchase a stronger, more expensive model.</li>
            <li> and I try to keep my flat iron to minimal usage to keep my hair healthy and try to use this in between.</li>
            <li> Today the low setting cut out completely, and I can only use the dryer on the cool or high settings.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how good a product is, 500 watts will NOT dry hair (at least in this lifetime), nor should you expect it to!  </li>
            <li> Needed a new one because the brush keeps falling off my old one.</li>
            <li> The vents blow your hair around while drying your hair, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough like the old model; therefore, the styling doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The next thing you will notice is the fact it does not get as hot as the old model.  </li>
            <li> Release curls by placing the finger of one hand on the cool tip and pressing the rotate barrel button with the other hand.</li>
            <li> I first completely dry my hair with a normal hair dryer, then I use this unit to curl it.  </li>
            <li> .. get&#x27;s a little hot for fine hair after a bit so have to stop if you are using for a long time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve added a large air vent between the barrel and the brush, which blows the hair every which way, so that it doesn&#x27;t wrap about the brush properly and therefore doesn&#x27;t create the desired curl.  </li>
            <li> However, I only use the large part.</li>
            <li> I did not order a used brush/dryer, but it arrived with a large scratch on one portion and there were hairs in the smaller brush attachment!!!  </li>
            <li> The one that bothers me most is the way you interchange the barrels -- no release, you just pull them, rather hard.</li>
            <li> &quot; part to work, but I agree with other reviewers that it seems like the air flow isn&#x27;t strong enough (</li>
            <li> High is equivalent to my hair dryer&#x27;s low setting, low is kind of irrelevant &amp; cool sets the curl quite well.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this product should be listed as NEW...came in a clear plastic zip bag without manual, manufacturers name...</li>
            <li> It came in a clear plastic zipper bag with no manual.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really recommend for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I know the person or persons who redesigned the drier never dried their hair with it.  </li>
            <li> When purchasing this on Amazon the photo is of the OLD model which was what I was loooking for.  </li>
            <li> The effect is soft and natural.</li>
            <li> As a college student, I&#x27;m really busy.</li>
            <li> One con: it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> I cannot manage a straight-bladed hair straightener, and even if I COULD, I would have to straighten out my natural chaos and then curl my hair into some semblance of style.  </li>
            <li> The old style brush blow dryers have always worked wonders for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking on ebay to see if I can find one of the old models.  </li>
            <li> My old Revlon curler did not come apart</li>
            <li> No rotation or spin action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like my money back.</li>
            <li> the old model I used every day, this one I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> and the brushes are too soft and do not grip the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Revlon fan for a long time but won&#x27;t buy another hot air curling iron from you until you change it.</li>
            <li> So far they haven&#x27;t fallen out like</li>
            <li> I had no trouble whatsoever returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li> The pictures on this site are showing the old design.  </li>
            <li> But.. I notice -mart is also showing the old model on their site.  </li>
            <li> Still like the old model that did not blow air through the brush.  </li>
            <li> Hope the next one is not broken.</li>
            <li> Leaving hair, as advertised, soft, shiny and softly curled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old with arthritis</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was so sure I would love this I threw all packaging away and will just have to lose the money I spent on this.</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for the old model that I used.</li>
            <li> For what I spent it isn&#x27;t worth the return hassles.</li>
            <li> The handle is not quite as slim as it used to be, but still not as thick as most.  </li>
            <li> The Revlon RV 444c hot styler because it falls apart in your hand while you are trying to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> If I am in a hurry, I semi blow dry my hair first.  </li>
            <li> This model is not as superhot for sensitive skin as my previous Revlon brush dryer, and it switches to the powerful cool down setting faster.  </li>
            <li> The new ones have what they call an &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; but they have holes that just blow some of the hair around and is not really directed to a certain area.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush at KMart, its the only one they have with a larger size barrel.</li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t find the same hot air brush dryer in stores, I ordered it from Amazon since it looked the same as the one I had.  </li>
            <li> The smaller barrel, which I use on my older model, is ineffective on this newer model.  </li>
            <li> This is the third Hot Air Brush (same model)</li>
            <li> but I was looking for the older model that was advertised and received a different model</li>
            <li> I bought this brush a few years ago (an old model) and I really liked it while it lasted (about 2 years), then it started overheating and would turn off after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I like the way it works, but it simply does not hold up under normal use.</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly, coarse thick hair, but I loved my other Revlon Airbrush.</li>
            <li> It used to take two to three days for my hair to calm down after washing.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I love the other Revlon Air Brush, 1200 watt and pink, but mine broke after a year, and i was on vacation, so the only product they had at Walmart was the Revlon 444C.  </li>
            <li> Not helpful when you are sent the new model which I could have purchased locally.  </li>
            <li> The new design of this product does not allow it to be used as it was prior to this change.  </li>
            <li> but the new 444c is a total redesign and</li>
            <li> However, while it did appeared to be new (in that it did not appear to be used), it came in a plastic baggie sealed only with a sticker.</li>
            <li> I bought the new model thinking it would be the same as advertised.</li>
            <li> Nothing but a sticker on outside saying item name &amp; NEW....</li>
            <li> The plastic \\&quot;seat\\&quot; for the smaller roller unit broke when still fairly new.</li>
            <li> Is this package really new as the print-out white label claims?</li>
            <li> The new one has air holes above handles which dry your hair too fast</li>
            <li> Handle too thick to turn easily.</li>
            <li> (I flip it upside down) and with my fine hair, it takes about a minute to get it almost dry.   </li>
            <li> My hot air brush recently burnt out and I ran out to the nearest store and found this one it was the same brand but a different model.</li>
            <li> The barrel gets hot, but there isn’t enough air blowing to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> nor hot enough) to dry and curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That makes it very hard for someone who has difficulty gripping to use it.  </li>
            <li> That makes it very hard for someone who has difficulty gripping to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this would be as effective for someone with very long, thick or coarse hair...</li>
            <li> I had a older model for several years, it finally quit working.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and the switch on this model is hard to move from high to low and cool.  </li>
            <li> But in hindsight, I didn&#x27;t try to order another curl attachment as this one was hard enough to find, I was only able to find it online.</li>
            <li> The bristles are short and don&#x27;t grab super tight on the hair.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the barrel does not stay securely on the device, so</li>
            <li> However it is gentler in general on my hair when I need to use it.</li>
            <li> and I think the whole handle will break if I try any harder.</li>
            <li> I will buy another one if Revlon can go back to some of the old ideas.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in this morning and it barely starts up plus has a burning smell.</li>
            <li> Last one ,vital piece of plastic broke off  and brush at top end became thin.  </li>
            <li> Even worse is that air blows out of vents at the bottom of the brush in the top of the handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok just hard to switch between large and small barrel.  </li>
            <li> My previous Revlon 444c hot air brush just died after about two years</li>
            <li> The other model gets much hotter.  </li>
            <li> After that short time, it would only heat for a minute or less before the heating element turned off and it blew only cool air.</li>
            <li> Even with little resistance and no rotating, the barrel sneaks its way out of the coupling, which leaves a hot ceramic brush dangling from your flowing locks.  </li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed in this model as it is very flimsy and the brush slides off the blowers very easly, making the styling difficult.</li>
            <li> I tried to obtain the same model, but had to settle for the RV444C, which is apparently its newer replacement.  </li>
            <li> I am keeping mine for the reasons I mentioned above, but still need to use another older model of a different manufacturer to dry and style my hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> In just that few seconds, the handle also became hot.</li>
            <li> I bought a John Freida brush here on amazon which was more expensive but a much better use of money since this one was extremely frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry and without consistent heat through out one single sitting, I can get different outcomes on different sections of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two, due to the fact that it is an older model, and Revlon said that Amazon bought all their stock.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super thick and long hair and this does not have enough power to dry her hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> to dry and style hair with one hand with professional results.  </li>
            <li> The air holes at the base of the barrel prevent hot air from being directed effectively into the barrel.  </li>
            <li> MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE AS IT GETS HOT WHILE USING IT, IT JUST COMES LOOSE DUE</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summation, if you have thick, coarse, or long hair, this specific product will likely not be strong enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> The blower is not nearly as strong as my previously styling brush, which actually allows my fine hair to stay around the brush.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and this hair dying brush</li>
            <li> and I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> I like the way it gently dries my hair and styles it a little too.  </li>
            <li> This item has too little wattage to achieve the straight (no curl) effect I want.</li>
            <li> This is impossible to do when they are hot, and seems like it would break rather easily</li>
            <li> The only things I don&#x27;t like are that it gets really hot after a while and if you aren&#x27;t careful you could get burnt, and that the power switch is a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say any of the above about either a flat iron or brush/dryer combo.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I sent it back.  </li>
            <li> I like the two different size brushes it comes with  to use on short or long hair.</li>
            <li> The package is hard to get into when opening for the first time.</li>
            <li> That makes it very difficut to dry the hair because the air from the vents blows the hair that is not on the brush and disturbes the styled hair that has already been dried.  </li>
            <li> (The small barrel allowed too much air to blow everywhere.)  </li>
            <li> I used the small barrel, with much cursing, to semi-control my poodle hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this dryer when my hair was long and now that it is short</li>
            <li> Since I bought it as a Christmas present, and it was not opened until long after the purchase, will not be returning.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Again; not too long after the perchase of my secound as well as the third styler the bristles receded into the barrel.</li>
            <li> It worked Ok for drying and smoothing my thin, straight hair, but not great.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the previous Revelon hot air styler that I purchased a few years ago with a smaller barrell..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it at night because it&#x27;s loud enough to disturb my sleeping roommate in the other room, even with the door closed.</li>
            <li> My hair is long past my shoulders, so this is a fast way to dry and style at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have a short bob and it is all I need to dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that she has to have dry hair to use it....</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t fall into toilet.</li>
            <li> Love the look, hate the tired arms and constant repositioning to get the hair straight in the right places, curled in others etc.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to flat iron every day or use a curling iron (both damaging and takes too long).</li>
            <li> But what I received was the newer Revlon hot air dryer and as I mentioned before the new model is useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this one, the brush won&#x27;t stay on long enough to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this one does not have the same BTUs that my previous one did.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those with short styles that do not require a long period of time for their hair to dry and/or style .</li>
            <li> I wish they still sold these in the stores, I&#x27;m only able to find them online now!  :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Wal Mart, but am now on Amazon looking for a sturdier product of the same style.&lt;br /&gt;Although it takes a bit longer to dry my hair than a typical blow dryer, it makes up for the time that would be spent styling with a flat or curling iron, and is considerably lighter in weight.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it at first but managed to make the large barrel work for me.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is this one is not very hot.  </li>
            <li> I think that these will replace blowdryers before too long.</li>
            <li> but the product is a complete waste.</li>
            <li> incase it tangles in long hair.</li>
            <li> For long hair, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Granted, these kinds of products are not made to last very long, but I&#x27;ve had it roughly 3 months</li>
            <li> Ceramic, Black and Red, which my wife has currently and does not like.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t put out enough heat to quickly rough dry my hair while finger combing.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a long time to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for it to completely dry your hair or if your hair is really long as this would take a while.</li>
            <li> you have very have thick or heavy hair, this particular item not strong enough to use without continuous troubleshooting.</li>
            <li> little more difficult as you rotate the brush through your hair.</li>
            <li> , this one not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other Revlon models but last night when I returned the Revlon I purchased the Conair.</li>
            <li> I like this ,but just wish they made them a little smaller for us gals who prefer our hair short!</li>
            <li> Air flow is newly directed and unable to achieve desired reults of older models.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser said to blow dry my hair 80% before using this.</li>
            <li> It is NOT meant to dry your hair like a blow dryer does.</li>
            <li> I use an 1800 watt dryer to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I just hop out the shower, towel dry my hair well and put in a salon gloss/heat protector.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry my hair</li>
            <li> I blow my hair dry</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t imagine having longer hair or a coarser hair and trying to dry it.</li>
            <li> I do partially dry my hair with a blow dryer leaving it a bit damp, then finish it off with the Styler/Dryer.  </li>
            <li> There is no locking mechanism and it just falls out while I trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I work out, wash, and blow dry in 12 minutes.  </li>
            <li> least the picture shows the older version), I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Gotta keep the toilet closed while using styling brush</li>
            <li> BUT, AFTER USING IT FOR A WHILE, THE BRUSHES THAT ATTACH TO IT, BECOME LOOSE AND WILL NOT STAY ON.</li>
            <li> While I am curling and drying a section of my hair, the open space between the handle and the barrell is blowing air toward other sections of my hair (curled or uncurled), causing my hair to stick up in every direction!  </li>
            <li> Bought the new one several months ago and returned it when I discovered the air vents at base of smaller roller was shooting out hot air on to my scalp</li>
            <li> This is the third one I bought in a less than a 2 year period.</li>
            <li> Compared to the previous model, I don&#x27;t think this one is going to last 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick straight hair and usually dry it then use the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The noise level is minimal, much less than my traditional 1200w hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> so may be a little bit different design.</li>
            <li> but my hair is a little too short  </li>
            <li> However, the smaller barreled brush does have open air holes at the base of the brush, therefore, when attempting to roll/brush/dry your hair, fine, silky hair</li>
            <li> Also, not liking the &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; factor... I don&#x27;t want the brush to be loose!  </li>
            <li> This one also is a lot less shrill than my previous brush, also due to its being less strong, I suppose.</li>
            <li> I have to stop and push it back in every few brush strokes.  </li>
            <li> and I purchased a pink one.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any official announcement that Revlon is discontinuing production of this styler, but I know that they are harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> The handle has been made bigger and it&#x27;s harder to twirl and the top section does not lock well into the base.</li>
            <li> The newer model has fewer rows of bristles in the brush (much smaller surface area) and the handle base is not only fatter but constructed of really cheap and flimsy plastic.</li>
            <li> My hair dried overall in about 10 minutes tops.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> it is the white one with the 3 attachements 2 round brushs and the angled blower.</li>
            <li> But since it doesn&#x27;t actually rotate at all, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> just paid $17.99 at a local retailer for a piece of non-functioning junk that I now have to waste my time returning.  </li>
            <li> This being a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product, I expected it to come packaged as a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product was.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to manually spin the brush without pushing the button.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> I bought another model Revlon hair styler, but it is harder to handle, I find this one easier.  </li>
            <li> , Amazon sent me this thing in a plastic case with absolutely NO documentation or instruction manual with it.  </li>
            <li> This items only lasted a few months, then crack and started falling apart.  </li>
            <li> The dryer was what I expected, with one exception.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are too wide</li>
            <li> Trust me, I know these units intimately, and this was not new-it was used and broken.    </li>
            <li> so it is really not even usable anymore.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only had it a few days).</li>
            <li> The second time I used it the barrel split in half in the middle of using it, again on a small section of hair</li>
            <li> Sadly I had to throw my second Revlon hot air styler away in less than a year.</li>
            <li> The only possible issue with this dryer/curler is it can be delicate when changing from one styling brush to the other</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is not hot enough to dry my hair, even if I take small strands at a time.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 20 min when the other one takes 5 to 10 minutes depending how wet your hair is.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful</li>
            <li> It is not very powerful for drying after shampooing.</li>
            <li> but it flies off a few seconds later if I&#x27;m not pressing it down.  </li>
            <li> so far not good.</li>
            <li> My hair also continually gets caught in the space between the handle and the barrel, which usually means losing several hairs during each use.</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s demise - from extreme overuse, I presume -  </li>
            <li> , my other Revlon Ionizer had 1200W. Didn&#x27;t pay attention to the wattage.</li>
            <li> In addition, I prefer the smaller handles of the past.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the other revlon model</li>
            <li> so i always separate it into smaller sections so as not to overpower any tool I&#x27;m using, but this couldn&#x27;t take even small amounts without falling out of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> just received dryer so no testing other than turning it on.  </li>
            <li> and the other is 1 ½ inches in diameter.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This one (I&#x27;m guessing due to safety concerns?)</li>
            <li> Oh, and I have extreme curls (think traci Ellis Ross).  </li>
            <li> The brush will not stay in and it has heating vents before the brush so no hot air reaches the hair.</li>
            <li> I do not dry my hair with it as I have thick Hispanic wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The base of the barrel on the brush portion looks sealed/closed when actually the smaller one has vents which allow hot air to escape and blow your hair while trying to style it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed for the past few days that the low setting was not making contact some of the time.  </li>
            <li> It is clumsy to handle, especially if you have some arthritis in your hands.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the brushes keep falling out while I am using it</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that there is no way to lock the brush on to the barrel.  </li>
            <li> This is THE most annoying thing you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> This is a love / hate relationship.  </li>
            <li> The pink one has a shortage and I had trouble keeping it on when i used it.</li>
            <li> You can roll your hair around the brush and then press the button while holding one finger onto the plastic end of the brush and by pulling down on the bush unroll your hair.  </li>
            <li> No need to hold a brush in one hand and the hair dryer in the other!</li>
            <li> The smaller brush has ports at the base of the brush and they blow out very hot air that messes up your hair that you have just styled</li>
            <li> Only minus would be the brush heads which are very hard to change.</li>
            <li> This is the third hot air styler I&#x27;ve purchased, and by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Not very strong.  </li>
            <li> I have had a half a dozen of these hair dryers over the years before they introduced the rotating barrel \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> THEY USE TO COST LESS THAN $10.</li>
            <li> I got this because I thought it would cut my time in half when blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite, but definitely not the worst.</li>
            <li> and it unlocks with any slight pressure inward.  </li>
            <li> I also find myself using MUCH less product, which is easier on my tresses and</li>
            <li> When the small brush is attached there are large gaps left where the head attaches the the base, causing air to blow across the curl rather than out from the middle of it.  </li>
            <li> very thin and fragile and smaller barrel was cracked and would not be grasped by the heating unit.  </li>
            <li> If you have long and/or thick hair, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> He put electrician&#x27;s tape on the inside of the cracked barrel to hold it tight, and now it works and stays in the handle like it should.</li>
            <li> You have to pull hard to remove  the brush and when it&#x27;s hot from use,  just a little difficult</li>
            <li> I had a Revlon with a round brush previously and it lasted for years</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to touch up my little failures with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The brush attachment is a little wobbly too.</li>
            <li> has transformed my boring hair like magic!</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is a little touchy.</li>
            <li> the little I used it</li>
            <li> One little piece broke off in the process of changing a brush head....</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am missing something?  </li>
            <li> Just purchased this a few days ago</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.</li>
            <li> The brush after a few minutes of use becomes detached.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a hair dryer and round brush for years.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and the results</li>
            <li> Now the end rotates and falls off before you can get a section of hair dried with it.</li>
            <li> The barrel randomly detaches and literally flies off loudly hitting your mirror and then the floor.</li>
            <li> A disappointed loyal customer.</li>
            <li> My hair is just under the chin and not as thick as it was 30 years ago, but the brush comes off about every other section of hair.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Not Cool Revlon!  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine but lots of it, along with those miserable thick curly gray hairs mixed in with the split ends.  </li>
            <li> The air flow is so weak that you HAVE to use another dryer to dry your hair before you can use this to curl your ends.  </li>
            <li> BUT..... I have purchased and returned three in the past few months because the brush will not stay on the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Somehow, it managed to give my thin, dry hair, a body and sheen</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the previous negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> My heavy hair pulls the brush right out of the base.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get the tape too far down that it prevents inserting the brush into the base.</li>
            <li> Very weak hair dryer and the barrel never would seat properly.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, they were sent back for a refund</li>
            <li> I had one of these in the past</li>
            <li> When your hair is heavy and thick, drying it is a chore.  </li>
            <li> Being unable to locate the RV444, I finally had to go to Helen of Troy, which manufactures those Revlon products and purchased one for twice the cost of the 444C.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully in a few weeks when I get the replacement that one works!      </li>
            <li> For the smaller brush it is useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered and returned this item twice over the past week because of the packaging issue.  </li>
            <li> on the smaller brush has vents in the WRONG place...</li>
            <li> No more tangle &amp; no breakage.</li>
            <li> So buyer beware: don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing!</li>
            <li> I looked at the return policy and it&#x27;s past the 30 days</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I received the Revlon dryer and I was not totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Once I felt the bristles on the brushes I decided it was not for me, the were hard and stiff.  </li>
            <li> It has hard bristles which I&#x27;m not crazy about but at least I can use it without part of it falling on the floor.  :(</li>
            <li> The air blows out of a small hole and it takes forever to dry my hair and its NOT that thick!!</li>
            <li> Not a very good quality item.  </li>
            <li> The metal base get&#x27;s SO hot that it will burn your hair</li>
            <li> the powered base of the hot brush is a button labeled rotate barrel.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are very stiff on my hair though.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on wet hair, the \\&quot;blow dryer\\&quot; function is a bit weak!</li>
            <li> My Conair is not ceramic, and it has hard plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the barrel is ceramic and it&#x27;s hard to burn your fingers or head with this thing.</li>
            <li> it is hard.  </li>
            <li> I prefer ones that have bristles like this one as opposed to hard plastic.</li>
            <li> All of them are hard for me to handle and manage because of the weight and balance.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be very weak in drying power, and I use it for spot drying my hair , if it gets wet after showering with a shower cap  where the cap may miss coverage .</li>
            <li> The packaging was so hard and covered in thick plastic</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already showing its shoddy design.     </li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD AT LEAST 10 OF THESE</li>
            <li> Sucker for the REVLON name ...</li>
            <li> I bought it 2 months ago so too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered it late</li>
            <li> If I could give this negative stars, I would.</li>
            <li> The barrel loses its grip with the slightest resistance, which means that every time you hit a tangle the barrel rolls and straightens your hair instead of curling it</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it was just a hassle to use.</li>
            <li> That makes it very difficult to dry the hair because the air from the vents blows the hair that is not on the brush and distributes the styled hair that has already been dried.</li>
            <li> Received without any defect or failure.</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed and saddened I cannot purchase the old style and will not use Revlon stylers anymore.</li>
            <li> That part is not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not sturdy and it makes it really hard to you use!</li>
            <li> Looks like I have to send it back for a replacement :(  </li>
            <li> Air flow too weak.</li>
            <li> so I was unable to see the plug was not suitable for the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles have broken off and I don&#x27;t want it to damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> brushing my ends actually makes the barrel twist on its base (and sometimes it just pops off).</li>
            <li> Then again, we have thin walls.</li>
            <li> This dryer do not work even in my thin hair, the brush falls all the time.</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> Poor design.........</li>
            <li> It really is poor quality and will go in the trash.  </li>
            <li> The thin ones are easier to manage, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spin at all, so either the spin button is broken, or something inside the mechanism is busted.  </li>
            <li> Poor Quality.  </li>
            <li> so it hasn&#x27;t been exhausted by use.</li>
            <li> This was replacement to my broken one.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of dryer for years and this is absolutely the worst one ever made.</li>
            <li> Also, the air blowing out the attachment end of the smaller barrel, as well as the barrel itself, is annoying, but doesn&#x27;t keep it from working on my hair.</li>
            <li> Replaces my broken Revlon.  </li>
            <li> If you are stuck with one of these like me, I took a strip of black electrical tape and wrapped it around the base where the air blows out the holes and now at least the style is functional.  </li>
            <li> The new model is terrible.  </li>
            <li> What a mistake, the new version was terrible.</li>
            <li> The pins that hold the barrel in are made poorly and will snap off and break, leaving you with a useless dryer/styling tool.</li>
            <li> this is by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> After three months the large barrel base cracked so it wouldn&#x27;t lock into the base.  </li>
            <li> but I feel the same way very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> 30 days after purchase, the barrel broke from the handle, so now it is useless.</li>
            <li> I have looked around town for replacement units, and have been unable to find them.  </li>
            <li> I like this type of hair dryer because it makes it easier to work with my hair, but Revlon makes a lousy product.</li>
            <li> Saves me a lot of time between blow drying my hair or trying to get the waves out of it from sleeping on it wrong.</li>
            <li> Silly me.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I bought it from the USA site and it had their plug on it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because, silly me...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it soon burned out.</li>
            <li> It does everything the expensive one does.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they do not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Not happy!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that you are trying to get manufacturers to come up with some other packaging for products they sell thru Amazon - please don&#x27;t give up - this tough plastic enclosing the product is horrible to deal with.</li>
            <li> It is the newer version which is a very poor design.</li>
            <li> It was very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the brush part comes loose when you are curling your hair; however, the Conair product I bought at the store did it even worst</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very expensive, but 2 months is absurd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use it because my hair will snap the plastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll return it, but I&#x27;m almost afraid to buy another.</li>
            <li> This product was quite disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Kept turning while using and afraid it was going to fall off.  </li>
            <li> The air escaping from the vents blows your hair in all the wrong directions!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as the handle was thicker and clumsy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was somewhat like the very expensive one.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to control once it starts spinning</li>
            <li> and it is impossible to keep it locked in so that it doesn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to style your hair with this product now.  </li>
            <li> I orderd this item, despite the bad reviews i read.  </li>
            <li> All the bad reviews i read were correct.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I used it.</li>
            <li> As always, badly conceived and executed.  </li>
            <li> I have bad hair.  </li>
            <li> No two ways about it, bad hair.  </li>
            <li> Bad product</li>
            <li> It gives my hair some volume, dries my hair quicker than a blow dryer but does nothing to help it curl. :(</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the quality or lack there of, of this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is very dangerous.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hate it but could not return it as I dont want to pay for the mailing cost</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hate?  </li>
            <li> It blows air out at the base of the brush and blows your hair away from the styler.  </li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> Look for the Helen of Troy, it is a plastic/rubber base and brush.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted a blower that did not have air holes at the base of the brush, as this picture depicts.  </li>
            <li> though, I must say it&#x27;s a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> so it does not spin unless you push a button,  but doesn&#x27;t latch on to the base so it won&#x27;t slide off.  </li>
            <li> but both times I had problems with the brush coming out of the base while I use it.</li>
            <li> This also is not working correctly as the brushes that are supposed to snap in DON&#x27;T, so it is worthless.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; won&#x27;t stay attached to the heating/dryer base.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in this model.</li>
            <li> Very worthless.  </li>
            <li> This style is horrible.</li>
            <li> Very annoying!</li>
            <li> I HATE this redesign!</li>
            <li> Totally worthless piece of junk!</li>
            <li> This is worst hair dryer of this type I have bought.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace it and was horribly dissappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this brush a few years ago (an old model) and I really liked it while it lasted (about 2 years), then it started overheating and would turn off after a few minutes of use. So, I bought a new one and noticed they redesigned the way the brush attaches to the handle. There are no screws anymore and the brush keeps falling off while I brush my hair. The first month or so it worked fine, but got looser over time. Now I can&#x27;t return it and I&#x27;m looking for a new brush. Will not buy Revlon anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Wal-Mart. My hairdresser said to blow dry my hair 80% before using this. It is NOT meant to dry your hair like a blow dryer does. I found it easy to use and liked the 2 sizes of brushes. The reason I give it 2 starts is the button that you push to rotate the barrel popped out after one week and the barrel constantly rotates and I can not wrap my hair around it. Tried to pop it back in but no luck and I think the whole handle will break if I try any harder. It is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Best air brush I have ever owned. Lightweight, good temperature control, easy to work with ;)</li>
            <li> The power of this is not like what I had before. Don&#x27;t really recommend for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> excellent product. I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;This is something practical, useful and excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;reached the expectations. Received without any defect or failure.</li>
            <li> This hairdrier has been redesigned.  I am very upset with the Revelon Company for doing that.  The brush surface has been shortened and air vents put in the brush attachments.  That makes it very difficut to dry the hair because the air from the vents blows the hair that is not on the brush and disturbes the styled hair that has already been dried.  The handle has been made larger around.  That makes it very hard for someone who has difficulty gripping to use it.  I have used the earlier designed hairdrier for years and loved it, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.  I wish Revelon had left the design alone and not made the so called improvements.  I know the person or persons who redesigned the drier never dried their hair with it.  Because if they had, they would have never gotten through the styling process.</li>
            <li> It worked Ok for drying and smoothing my thin, straight hair, but not great.  It blows air from the handle, not from the bristles holding the hair,  The hair not wrapped around the bristles flies away because of this.  It was not the best hot air brush design I have used.  30 days after purchase, the barrel broke from the handle, so now it is useless. I do not recommend this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I have had a half a dozen of these hair dryers over the years before they introduced the rotating barrel \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.  This is THE most annoying thing you can imagine.  It is impossible to control once it starts spinning and it is impossible to keep it locked in so that it doesn&#x27;t spin.  This product is the only thing I know that can make me curse first thing in the morning.  I was so happy with the old hair dryers without this \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.  I have switched to a similar product by Conair.</li>
            <li> I see they have changed what was originally advertized. The original item stated ...Ceramic, Black and Purple, which was the style my wife loved. I ordered two, due to the fact that it is an older model, and Revlon said that Amazon bought all their stock. The one&#x27;s recieved were ...Ceramic, Black and Red, which my wife has currently and does not like. Needless to say, they were sent back for a refund</li>
            <li> If you have long and/or thick hair, this is not the product for you. Very cheaply made and not sturdy at all. I&#x27;m afraid to use it because my hair will snap the plastic.</li>
            <li> I only got 2 months of use out of this product, which I bought at a local store. After that short time, it would only heat for a minute or less before the heating element turned off and it blew only cool air. Fortunately, I was able to return it to the store for a refund. It wasn&#x27;t very expensive, but 2 months is absurd. Won&#x27;t buy this brand again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Very weak hair dryer and the barrel never would seat properly. I only bought the RV444 because the store did not have the RV440C. Just found my receipt so I can try to get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much better choice for about the same price: Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of them seem to last more than a year or two but they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had one of these in the past and I couldn&#x27;t find another one in ANY stores. I found it here on Amazon and bought a COUPLE of them! This is great for people with thin  / fine hair.  The blow power is just right for me. I had tried another type and it was so powerful that it was too strong to keep my hair wound around it! This one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Came very fast and looked just like the picture. Bristles are very stiff on my hair though. But over all nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I can blowdry my hair with one hand leaving the other free to grab hair to wrap around the brush portion. I think that these will replace blowdryers before too long. They give you lots of body and work as fast as blowdryers do.</li>
            <li> This particular hot air brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. It works OK, it should just get hotter! If you have curly hair and are planning to use this product, don&#x27;t bother. It may work better on straight hair, but I can not attest to this.</li>
            <li> When purchasing this on Amazon the photo is of the OLD model which was what I was loooking for.  Not helpful when you are sent the new model which I could have purchased locally.  The new design of this product does not allow it to be used as it was prior to this change.  Air flow is newly directed and unable to achieve desired reults of older models.  Then the website did not allow me to return the product - only exchange.  Had to spend two phone calls and numberous explanations to accomplish returning...not a pleasant experience and still not able to find the older model.</li>
            <li> Hate it but could not return it as I dont want to pay for the mailing cost</li>
            <li> I actually love this thing...I have one of these and one of the Ionic models...I don&#x27;t think that this would be as effective for someone with very long, thick or coarse hair...but, for me with short, rather thin and baby fine hair..it&#x27;s perfect.  Dries my hair in no time flat and gives me more volume than just about anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s true that the barrel wants to fall out, but, I just push it in and do my hair...Thanks Revlon...this tool not only makes up for my lack of styling skills, but, fits a lot better in my gym bag than a regular blow dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li> Before I review this product, I just want to make a comment about wattage first.  I have a Conair hot air brush which is 300 watts.  This Revlon hot air brush is 500 watts.  I don&#x27;t care how good a product is, 500 watts will NOT dry hair (at least in this lifetime), nor should you expect it to!  I use an 1800 watt dryer to dry my hair (I flip it upside down) and with my fine hair, it takes about a minute to get it almost dry.   I then use the hot air brush to finish my hair, as if I was using a curling iron.  I love the result!  Now, that being said...     I got this Revlon hot air brush to replace my Conair hot air brush.  My Conair is not ceramic, and it has hard plastic bristles.  Some of the bristles have broken off and I don&#x27;t want it to damage my hair.  So, I thought I&#x27;d give this hot air brush a try.       Two major problems with this hot air brush are deal breakers for me.  I don&#x27;t like the design.  The brush part just slides into the dryer portion with no locking mechanism.  It&#x27;s a flimsy plastic which tells me over time it will melt, distort or break, which is probably what&#x27;s causing the brush to fall out.   Also, with my fine hair, I ended up with a static electricity mess, I would assume due to the nylon bristles.      I gave this a 3 star rating because, other than the design, I think for those with thicker hair, it probably will do a great job.  It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing this product.  Just right for me.</li>
            <li> This model is not as superhot for sensitive skin as my previous Revlon brush dryer, and it switches to the powerful cool down setting faster.  Still, vigilance may be required for tender scalps.  Overall, a nice balance of qualities. The hair dries quickly as the brush gives excellent control.</li>
            <li> This is a love / hate relationship.  When your hair is heavy and thick, drying it is a chore.  I use this after taking most of the moisture out of my hair with a conventional dryer.  Then this tool does the rest of the styling and drying work and I don&#x27;t need to touch up my little failures with a curling iron.  The effect is soft and natural. That&#x27;s the love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hate?  My heavy hair pulls the brush right out of the base.  I have to stop and push it back in every few brush strokes.  Now?  The brush no longer holds &#x27;at all&#x27;.  I found a great substitute in the concair infitinity pro spinning barrel but the barrel is too wide for my medium length hair.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> This is the third hot air styler I&#x27;ve purchased, and by far the worst. Granted, these kinds of products are not made to last very long, but I&#x27;ve had it roughly 3 months and it&#x27;s already showing its shoddy design.     My biggest complaint is the barrel does not stay securely on the device, so brushing my ends actually makes the barrel twist on its base (and sometimes it just pops off). My hair also continually gets caught in the space between the handle and the barrel, which usually means losing several hairs during each use. I really wish I kept the receipt so I could return this piece of junk. I paid $20 for it, which was $20 too much.</li>
            <li> I purchased a replacement for the exact same hair styler.  The first lasted over 3 years and did a terrific job ~ greta style, easy to use.  I give it an A+++++</li>
            <li> The Revlon hot air brush (RV444) is the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  Somehow, it managed to give my thin, dry hair, a body and sheen it&#x27;s never had before.  After it&#x27;s demise - from extreme overuse, I presume -  I tried to obtain the same model, but had to settle for the RV444C, which is apparently its newer replacement.  They&#x27;ve added a large air vent between the barrel and the brush, which blows the hair every which way, so that it doesn&#x27;t wrap about the brush properly and therefore doesn&#x27;t create the desired curl.  Being unable to locate the RV444, I finally had to go to Helen of Troy, which manufactures those Revlon products and purchased one for twice the cost of the 444C.  It&#x27;s worth it, though, to get those fantastic results!</li>
            <li> This is my third Revlon hair styler. I do not dry my hair with it as I have thick Hispanic wavy/curly hair.  This syler works like a charm with one hand. I cannot use a regular brush and dryer on my own hair at the same time.  I first owned a red one loved it! My original stopped working after about 3+ years and I purchased a pink one.  The pink one has a shortage and I had trouble keeping it on when i used it. I am very dissapointed in this model as it is very flimsy and the brush slides off the blowers very easly, making the styling difficult.I only use the large barrell, so i am going to super glue the barrell to the blower to fix this issue. I would rate this item lower, execept I do love the results.  I do hope that Revlon redsigns the styler.</li>
            <li> As a college student, I&#x27;m really busy. I realized that I had to look more professional to teach students, so I set out for a timesaving solution. I didn&#x27;t want to flat iron every day or use a curling iron (both damaging and takes too long). I found this at Walmart and gave it a try. I LOVE it! I just hop out the shower, towel dry my hair well and put in a salon gloss/heat protector. Then I section it off and spray each section with a John Frieda heat protectant to my ends just to be on the safe side. This brush dries and curls my hair in record time - and the curls stay!!! I was amazed the first time I tried it. It&#x27;s worth the money. I&#x27;m still working with it but each time I use it, the time to do my whole head gets shorter and shorter. (I have layered ,wavy, frizzy medium length hair and side swept bangs). It makes my bangs beautiful and professional looking, something I&#x27;ve never been able to do before. I feel so polished, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel overheated or fried. Just be sure to use a heat protectant and not focus on a section too long. The bristles go in smoothly and really grip the hair so curling and straightening is a breeze. Plus, the barrel is ceramic and it&#x27;s hard to burn your fingers or head with this thing. Why didn&#x27;t I get one sooner? &#x3D;)   One con: it&#x27;s loud. I can&#x27;t use it at night because it&#x27;s loud enough to disturb my sleeping roommate in the other room, even with the door closed. Then again, we have thin walls.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD AT LEAST 10 OF THESE AND MOST OF THEM CAME FROM AMAZON! I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT CURLS MY HAIR! BUT, AFTER USING IT FOR A WHILE, THE BRUSHES THAT ATTACH TO IT, BECOME LOOSE AND WILL NOT STAY ON. MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE AS IT GETS HOT WHILE USING IT, IT JUST COMES LOOSE DUE TO THE GLUE THAT KEEPS IT IN PLACE. I JUST WISH REVLON STILL MADE THEM AND SOLD THEM AT ALL THE LOCAL STORES LIKE THEY USE TO. THE PRICE HAS BECOME QUITE HIGH! THEY USE TO COST LESS THAN $10. OH WELL, I THINK THEY ARE STILL A GREAT HAIR APPLIANCE!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and the switch on this model is hard to move from high to low and cool.  I spend most of my time trying to get to the right setting and for an older person with arthritis it is hard.  The model I had before the switch was a push button and it was so much easier.  The dryer itself is ok the attachments are great for many styles.  The package is hard to get into when opening for the first time.</li>
            <li> This dryer do not work even in my thin hair, the brush falls all the time. Do not recommend at all!</li>
            <li> I finally learned how to style my own hair, but my abilities are absolutely reliant on using this type of brush.  I have looked around town for replacement units, and have been unable to find them.  Thank God for Amazon, who fortunately seems to have almost everything!  I have not seen any official announcement that Revlon is discontinuing production of this styler, but I know that they are harder and harder to find.  I cannot manage a straight-bladed hair straightener, and even if I COULD, I would have to straighten out my natural chaos and then curl my hair into some semblance of style.  This airbrush has been a godsend for me...if you feel likewise, I would recommend that you order some backups before they are all gone.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry my hair I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Sucker for the REVLON name ... I thought this to be a sidekick and possible replacement for an OLD Vidal Sassoon hair dryer/styler kit that&#x27;s no longer available. This definitely is geared more to curling with it&#x27;s cool temperature for setting a curl. But it doesn&#x27;t put out enough heat to quickly rough dry my hair while finger combing. This is so cheaply made I&#x27;m hoping it lasts until I can find a dryer/styler I like better. I don&#x27;t think this would survive many trips in \\&quot;checked\\&quot; luggage. I&#x27;m still looking for a hair dryer/styler that is more solidly manufactured with more power, a concentrator and durable brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now it&#x27;s passable, but REVLON should be ashamed to have it&#x27;s name on it. Eventhough, BOTH my Vidal Sassoon and this one are made by Helen Of Troy in China, this is very inferior. Before you ask, the attachments are NOT interchangeable with my Sassoon.</li>
            <li> I paid more at a Beauty Supply outlet for this hair dryer and I am now buying a more powerful one at Amazon! This only has 500W, my other Revlon Ionizer had 1200W. Didn&#x27;t pay attention to the wattage. I would recommend the 1200 W ionizer if you have stubborn hair to curl like me.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but wish it a bit more heat. But it gets the job done for me.</li>
            <li> I did not like it! The Revlon RV 444c hot styler because it falls apart in your hand while you are trying to dry your hair. It is not sturdy and it makes it really hard to you use! I sent my back and got a Conair one that it is a lot more user friendly and durable!</li>
            <li> I have had 2 Revlon brush blowdryers in the past several years and have liked them very much.  However, the brush barrell eventually broke apart from the handle (from much use) so they had to be replaced.  I recently purchased Revlon&#x27;s replacement model and do not like it at all!  I have to agree with some of the previous negative reviews.  I have short hair and use the smaller barrell.  The old style brush blow dryers have always worked wonders for me.  I can&#x27;t say anything good about the new model.  While I am curling and drying a section of my hair, the open space between the handle and the barrell is blowing air toward other sections of my hair (curled or uncurled), causing my hair to stick up in every direction!  My hair pretty much tends to stay that way! The more I try to fix it, the more it messes up another section of my hair.  I also agree with another person that said it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the old ones used to.  In addition, I prefer the smaller handles of the past.  Please, please Revlon, fix this problem if you&#x27;re listening.  It was the best product out there for my hair until this latest model came along.  I will buy another one if Revlon can go back to some of the old ideas.</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush at KMart, its the only one they have with a larger size barrel. This is the third one I bought in a less than a 2 year period. I use it daily, and it gives great results. However, it does not last more than 4-6 months. The point at which it breaks each and every time is where 2 flimsy screws are attached to the barrel. I am now looking here at Amazon to find a different brand, for when my current airbrush breaks I will not buy another Revlon one. If it wasn&#x27;t for the barrel breaking off so soon after purchase I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Did a great job on my hair and flexible bristles did not hurt my scalp, but the handle is so large that I have a difficult time gripping it.</li>
            <li> Not very strong.  The dryer doesn&#x27;t get very hot or have much velocity.  It takes quite a long time to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to dry your hair!  No need to manage a brush and a dryer at the same time.  My hair is long past my shoulders, so this is a fast way to dry and style at the same time.</li>
            <li> The brush is to soft but it drys really well</li>
            <li> The styler pictured is the older model, which I loved.  Each time one would wear out, I would replace it with the same model.  The new model is terrible.  It&#x27;s bulky to handle and they have re-styled the airflow.  It blows air out at the base of the brush and blows your hair away from the styler.  It&#x27;s impossible to style your hair with this product now.  I&#x27;m looking on ebay to see if I can find one of the old models.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ll be looking at other brands.  Revlon needs to go back to the original design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip:  If you are stuck with one of these like me, I took a strip of black electrical tape and wrapped it around the base where the air blows out the holes and now at least the style is functional.  Just be careful not to get the tape too far down that it prevents inserting the brush into the base.</li>
            <li> This Revlon product should be recalled. The barrels don&#x27;t stay in while you are drying your hair. I&#x27;ve even had them fly out across the room. I&#x27;d return it, but I don&#x27;t know where the receipt is.</li>
            <li> the hair dryer/curler looked used and it had hair rolled on it...it said it was new on the amazon review. The barrol didnt even spin!</li>
            <li> I used to own an older model Revlon Hot air styler/dryer.  and it died after 1 year of use. So I purchased this one.  It&#x27;s design is great, but the air isn&#x27;t as hot as a dryer should be.</li>
            <li> I orderd this item, despite the bad reviews i read.  All the bad reviews i read were correct.  The barrel does not spin as described, in fact, you press the button and it does absolutely nothing.  I returned the 1st one, acepted the replacement, and sure enough the 2nd one did not spin either.  This product should be removed from the market.  Waste of time.  Gave it one star becuase you cant put zero stars.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as the other revlon model but I really like the feature that allows me to release the brush and roll out the chunk of hair wrapped in the dryer.  The power isn&#x27;t consistent and I noticed on the 2nd use that the amount of air isn&#x27;t much and the temperature fluctuates while using it on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting, which I do.  It takes longer to dry and without consistent heat through out one single sitting, I can get different outcomes on different sections of my hair.  I would return, but then I am S.O.L so I just put up with it for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that you are trying to get manufacturers to come up with some other packaging for products they sell thru Amazon - please don&#x27;t give up - this tough plastic enclosing the product is horrible to deal with.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and very hard to find - but not hard to find on Amazon!! Makes great curls for short fine hair - and doesn&#x27;t cause any damage.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and can not use the higher wattage units; like 800 or 1200 watts.  They just straighten my hair instead of curling.  I first completely dry my hair with a normal hair dryer, then I use this unit to curl it.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> The handle has been made bigger and it&#x27;s harder to twirl and the top section does not lock well into the base.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon RV444C hot air styler and dryer because I thought I would be receiving the same dryer as pictured in the ad.  I had purchased that same styler from Walmart some years ago and loved it.  Since I couldn&#x27;t find the same hot air brush dryer in stores, I ordered it from Amazon since it looked the same as the one I had.  I was very disappointed as the handle was thicker and clumsy to hold.  The air flow too strong and the brush head very sparse so my air blew all over the place when using it.  To make a long story short, I sent it back.  Why manufacturers choose to change a successful product like this is beyond me.  The newer version is bulkier, brush heads very skimpy and cheaper all around.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone looking for more control when using a hot air brush dryer.</li>
            <li> My previous Revlon 444c hot air brush just died after about two years so I bought the same model again-- but the new 444c is a total redesign and not what is pictured on Amazon&#x27;s website.  The newer model has fewer rows of bristles in the brush (much smaller surface area) and the handle base is not only fatter but constructed of really cheap and flimsy plastic. The brush attachment is a little wobbly too. Compared to the previous model, I don&#x27;t think this one is going to last 6 months.  I&#x27;ve lost loyalty to Revlon now.  Pay attention corporations--I&#x27;d rather pay MORE money for a better quality item!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have enough &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; and the brush doesn&#x27;t lock in so its always flying off or coming out tangled up in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air styler/dryer. I had never used one before, and I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely it dries/styles my hair. Yes, I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love the other Revlon Air Brush, 1200 watt and pink, but mine broke after a year, and i was on vacation, so the only product they had at Walmart was the Revlon 444C.  works okay for straightening my bangs, but it took a while to straighten my hair with it, and it still wasn&#x27;t that smooth.  i have naturally curly, coarse thick hair, but I loved my other Revlon Airbrush.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to replace an ancient, sadly-deceased Conair model.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it at first but managed to make the large barrel work for me.  (The small barrel allowed too much air to blow everywhere.)  My kinky/frizzy hair was smoother and straighter but still had body, unlike when using a straightening iron, so it was okay.  After three months the large barrel base cracked so it wouldn&#x27;t lock into the base.  I used the small barrel, with much cursing, to semi-control my poodle hair.  Two weeks later the unused-by-me \\&quot;rotate\\&quot; button fell off, allowing the barrel to spin freely.      The device itself is a good styling tool, but 4 months is too short a lifespan, even at this reasonable price.  I hope this was just a bum item and not a design flaw, but I&#x27;m still rating it a one.</li>
            <li> I got this because I thought it would cut my time in half when blow drying my hair. Here is why I give it only one star:&lt;br /&gt;1. The first thing that I noticed is that there is not a lot of power behind it, but it did add shine which I liked. 2. The first time I used it, both barrels came out as I was using it. I have kind of thick hair so i always separate it into smaller sections so as not to overpower any tool I&#x27;m using, but this couldn&#x27;t take even small amounts without falling out of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is supposed to spin, but even before I ever put it to my head, it never spun. The only think it did was loosen if it got tangled in my hair&lt;br /&gt;4. The second time I used it the barrel split in half in the middle of using it, again on a small section of hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good idea, but poor quality. Frankly i expect more from Revlon.</li>
            <li> Omg, where has this been all my life? I have fine, thin hair and this hair dying brush has transformed my boring hair like magic! It&#x27;s so easy to use and my hair looks shiny and voluminous! I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> This product works better than any curling iron or hot brush I&#x27;ve tried - I blow my hair dry and it&#x27;s all frizzy - then I just section my hair out and use this curling brush on it and it makes my hair super silky with lots of body and a bit of a curl at the ends.  I bought one of these at the store about a two years ago and then I broke it.  I looked all over for a new one and ended up trying many different types and none of them worked as good as this one.  I finally did a search on the internet and found it on Amazon.  I bought 3 just to make sure I am never without one! : )  THis is by far the best product and an added bonus is that it&#x27;s much cheaper than most of the rest in this category.</li>
            <li> I have very thick straight hair and usually dry it then use the curling iron.  This blow dryer is not hot enough to dry my hair, even if I take small strands at a time.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my hair either.  I guess I will try to dry it with a regular blow dryer most of the way then try and curl it with the brush, which will defeat the purpose of why I bought it.  Also, I&#x27;ve switched brushes a couple times and now the brush falls off while I am blow drying my hair.  I feel I waisted my money.  Another product I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this hot hair curling rod. Works great! Simply wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this brush hair dryer, I tried it out ... with great results.  My hair is fine but lots of it, along with those miserable thick curly gray hairs mixed in with the split ends.  So I always try to be gentle on my hair and this product is perfect for that.  The rollers were perfect sized for me, and I like the release button so there wasn&#x27;t any tangling.  My hair dried overall in about 10 minutes tops.  The noise level is minimal, much less than my traditional 1200w hairdryer.  The end result, nice smooth, silky, shiny and controlled with just a spriter of hair spray.  Extremely reasonable price wise and will buy another if and when the time comes this one doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all.  It&#x27;s way too loud for doing not much.  The handle gets too hot.  And in order to change the attachments, I would use the smaller one on the crown section of my hair and the larger on the rest, you have to turn off the appliance, unplug it, and let it cool first.  The whole thing is just too Mickey Mouse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several hot air brushes. This is not my favorite, but definitely not the worst. I prefer ones that have bristles like this one as opposed to hard plastic. It grabs my hair better.    This one has an interchangeable head. However, I only use the large part. The pieces move and pop off too easily, so I glued the large rod in place. Works like a charm now! :)    The on/off switch is a little touchy. Also, wish it got hotter on &#x27;Low&#x27;, so my hair wouldn&#x27;t get so many fly aways.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job styling my hair.  I own three - one for the upstairs bathroom, one for the downstairs bathroom, and one for travel.</li>
            <li> Does the job,  don&#x27;t expect amazing curls though.</li>
            <li> It is a fair product.  The problem is that the brush part comes loose when you are curling your hair; however, the Conair product I bought at the store did it even worst so I think all these types of curlers come apart easily.  My old Revlon curler did not come apart but they don&#x27;t make it anymore so I guess you just have to put up with it.</li>
            <li> excellent product , I recommend</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Dries and styles quickly without damaging hair. Can not do without this styler. Ordering the second one now.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would rotate on it&#x27;s own, it doesn&#x27;t, there is just a button on it and it unlocks it so the brush can swivel. It gives my hair some volume, dries my hair quicker than a blow dryer but does nothing to help it curl. :(</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I thought it rotated but it doesn&#x27;t. Really didn&#x27;t work for me. I have thick hair and it was just a hassle to use.</li>
            <li> Needed a new one because the brush keeps falling off my old one.</li>
            <li> I have received a hairdryer that does not have a plug on it that can be used in the UK.  I cannot afford to send it back to you and therefore I would like something sent to me for me to return the article and then I can be refunded.  The packaging was so hard and covered in thick plastic so I was unable to see the plug was not suitable for the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to hearing from you with regards the necessary packaging to return the goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanking you in anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A disappointed loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Ok so I must like to curl and dry my hair in one step.  This has a larger roller on this and it works real nice without frizzing up my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the hot air brushes for years .... I LOVE THEM. I have wavy to curly hair that is very frizzy. My hot air brush recently burnt out and I ran out to the nearest store and found this one it was the same brand but a different model. As soon as I plugged it in I knew it was weeker and didn&#x27;t get as hot. Also it was so light and as soon as I started to use it I almost broke it because the one I had could handle double the hair and the pull from the strands of hair to straighten them. If this sounds like your hair Revlon still has a great product for you it is the white one with the 3 attachements 2 round brushs and the angled blower. It is loud but it sounds like a good blow dryer does I rate it a five star. I used this dryer when my hair was long and now that it is short it is still wonderful. I wish I knew the model #.   This is a good dryer if you have straight to slightly wavy hair or if you have more time to do it. It takes about 20 min when the other one takes 5 to 10 minutes depending how wet your hair is.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer about 3 months ago.  It has 3 heat settings, cool, low, and high.  I&#x27;ve noticed for the past few days that the low setting was not making contact some of the time.  Today the low setting cut out completely, and I can only use the dryer on the cool or high settings. I would return this dryer immediately, but I don&#x27;t have the receipt.  I like this type of hair dryer because it makes it easier to work with my hair, but Revlon makes a lousy product.</li>
            <li> Did not work right out of the box. No rotation or spin action. Does blow warm air through the barrels which are actually smaller than most on this type of appliance, which was why I wanted this one in the first place. But since it doesn&#x27;t actually rotate at all, it was a waste of money. Since I bought it as a Christmas present, and it was not opened until long after the purchase, will not be returning.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to buy cheap, but I thought I might at least get an idea if I would even like this type of product before blowing over a hundred on a big girl tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just paid $17.99 at a local retailer for a piece of non-functioning junk that I now have to waste my time returning.  Plugged it in, turned it on and pressed the rotate barrel button - nothing.  So I give in and open the instructions.  As brief as they are - they are not for this model.  They refer to a non-existent curl release button, and a \\&quot;click\\&quot; to be heard upon inserting a barrel.  Maybe I am missing something?  So I put in the smaller roller that came with it.  I must have been way too determined to hear that click, because this barrel practically crumbled in my hand.  The metal bent away from the plastic and the thing started falling apart.  I am by no means burly or exceptionally strong.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and I hate it. Too bad I used it. I&#x27;d really like my money back. Wish I&#x27;d checked this website before I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I do love my styler brush but its got its down sides. This is the second one i&#x27;ve had and the first one was much better. This paticular style has a thicker handle which makes holding it little more difficult as you rotate the brush through your hair. the brushes also do not stay snapped in and sometimes come off while i have my hair wrapped up in it.&lt;br /&gt;Over all the brush is great. Saves me a lot of time between blow drying my hair or trying to get the waves out of it from sleeping on it wrong. Eventually I will get a different style of brush but I would never be with out one of these stylers!!!! :)</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has tamed my frizz. I love it! I have had no problems using it but I did just get it so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last. I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet though!  I roll my hair up like I would with a curling iron and then flip it to cool before i release the hair from the barrel. Easy.</li>
            <li> Had a styler/dryer like this years ago, and liked it a lot.  Haven&#x27;t found one in the stores in quite awhile, so glad to find this...in fact, I purchased two of them to make sure I have one when this one stops working.  It&#x27;s a good styler, but something I only use on occasion, depending on the time I have to spend on my hair that morning.  My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; is still a traditional blow dryer and curling iron.  I have noticed, too, that the brush falls off more often than my old styler/dryer did, so may be a little bit different design.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, easy to grip, not big and awkward like all the others- perfect tool!</li>
            <li> The blower is not nearly as strong as my previously styling brush, which actually allows my fine hair to stay around the brush.  It&#x27;s very easy to switch from  Cool to Low Heat to High Heat with the slider switch.  The handle on this one is large but not as large as the one I bought two months ago-also Revlon.  This one is a bit easier to hold and to guide.  The Barrel release didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped but I didn&#x27;t have one before so I really didn&#x27;t need it anyway.  I used the large brush, which I thought would be too large but it gave my hair the lift I had been searching for.  I plan to use the curling size brush tomorrow to get more than lift.  This one also is a lot less shrill than my previous brush, also due to its being less strong, I suppose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok just hard to switch between large and small barrel.  You have to pull hard to remove  the brush and when it&#x27;s hot from use,  just a little difficult</li>
            <li> As always, badly conceived and executed.  Last one too hot, this one not hot enough.  Last one ,vital piece of plastic broke off  and brush at top end became thin.  Wish I could fnd another make.  Did not like swivel on this one.</li>
            <li> The handle is larger than I like, cannot seem to find one like my original, but it works until I find a smaller handle one.</li>
            <li> The metal base get&#x27;s SO hot that it will burn your hair and you can&#x27;t control the temp.  Look for the Helen of Troy, it is a plastic/rubber base and brush.  I have two in different sizes and love them.</li>
            <li> I had a older model for several years, it finally quit working. I bought this one, the brush won&#x27;t stay on long enough to dry hair.  The red button fell off after a week. the old model I used every day, this one I can&#x27;t use. I don&#x27;t have my receipt to return so it went to good will. I had to buy another brand never will buy Revlon again</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother-in-law. While she was happy to receive it, she, nor I, were happy with how it came packaged. This being a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product, I expected it to come packaged as a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product was. However, while it did appeared to be new (in that it did not appear to be used), it came in a plastic baggie sealed only with a sticker. with a sticker. It did not have a box. It had no instructions whatsoever or any paperwork. So who is to say it was actually new? It could easily have been repurposed or refurbished (neither of which were disclosed on the product listing).</li>
            <li> The hair gets tangled.  The directions say: “Release curls by placing the finger of one hand on the cool tip and pressing the rotate barrel button with the other hand. Be sure to let the cool tip rotate while you press the button.”  This gave me the impression that the barrel rotates. Silly me. The barrel did not rotate. I called the company and was told that it does not rotate, but it just loosens and lets you pull the brush out. It does NOT loosen. It actually pulls out any curt and lift that I managed to get in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not seem to have much drying power. The barrel gets hot, but there isn’t enough air blowing to dry my hair. My old 300W Conair does a much better job but the barrel is too big for my newly shortened hair. I’d still be using it if the smaller brush hadn’t gotten lost in my recent move. Since I bought the Revlon for the smaller brush rotating brush, it&#x27;s going back today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the Revlon Perfect Heat 300W Hot Air Styler and Dryer is marked 500W. (It feels like I imagine a 100W would feel.) One star because it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget that was so powerful to take the kink right out of my hair making it smooth and styled in minutes! This nice electric brush can curl, smooth and style with such speed it makes doing my hair a pleasure. I like the two different size brushes it comes with  to use on short or long hair. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store. I highly recommend this product for easy hair care.</li>
            <li> I have two of the older models and they are held together by duct tape and STILL work !  I bought the new model thinking it would be the same as advertised. NOT.  The vents blow your hair around while drying your hair, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough like the old model; therefore, the styling doesn&#x27;t work.  Very worthless.  Someone truly messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy Fox</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.  I was hoping for something I could handle better.  It is clumsy to handle, especially if you have some arthritis in your hands.</li>
            <li> I am not coordinated enough to do the hairdryer/roller brush thing separately, so I LOVE this hairdryer!  It creates just enough curl and lots of body every time I use it.  My only issue is that I wish it lasted longer.  Each time I order one, they typically last a year before I have to get another one.  The removable brush always breaks at the connection.  I wish they still sold these in the stores, I&#x27;m only able to find them online now!  :(</li>
            <li> Just purchased this a few days ago and I LOVE it!  I have fine hair and it&#x27;s stacked.  I like the stacked look because it adds volume to my hair.  But using a straightener flattens it some.  Using this allows me to not even have to use the straightener!  It adds tons of volume and the first two days I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve had tons of compliments.  The only things I don&#x27;t like are that it gets really hot after a while and if you aren&#x27;t careful you could get burnt, and that the power switch is a little flimsy.  I do like how it has the rotating button.  This is NOT like the Conair hot air spin brush.  This rotating brush is only to help you pull your hair out of the brush.  I have no issues with the bristles pulling my hair through because I have fine hair.  In my opinion it is great!</li>
            <li> I had this air brush before but they since changed the style. (i wished they hadn&#x27;t) . The old one you pushed a button to release the wand, this one just comes off sometimes, but its easy to put back on.  I do like the curls it gives. Would have given 5 starts if it wasn&#x27;t for it coming off the wand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but as I got a new one that also rotates, I think this is not useful anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I gave mine to my roommate and she is pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just cute my hair so I have used it but my hair is a little too short  I think about 1 week or so it will be great  the little I used it I really did like it  drys  your hair and curls it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer - the brush detaches so you can use it just as a dryer, it&#x27;s easy to switch to a different size brush while styling and the heat level isn&#x27;t so hot that it burns my hair.</li>
            <li> I have never done a lot with my hair as far as styling it, But worked really good for even me.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and it did not serve the purpose intended. I would not recommend. I do like shopping for bargains on Amazon and they are easy to shop with, on returns, no problems.</li>
            <li> As soon as I plugged it in the first time, it made an odd noise, started smoking and smelled strongly of burning plastic.  In just that few seconds, the handle also became hot. So, obviously, I didn&#x27;t even get to try it.  I&#x27;ll return it, but I&#x27;m almost afraid to buy another.</li>
            <li> After searching on the internet for a new Revlon hot air styler, the product which resembled the old one I have, was found on Amazon.  The price was very reasonable.  The product is what I expected, easy to use and closest to the older model I have.  I am happy with my purchase, the unit gives a soft, yet holding curl to my hair.</li>
            <li> Not as well made as the one I owned before which was just like it. Brushes keep coming off .  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as advertised.  Would have returned it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this product should be listed as NEW...came in a clear plastic zip bag without manual, manufacturers name...Nothing but a sticker on outside saying item name &amp; NEW....just received dryer so no testing other than turning it on.  Looks like others have received the dryer in similar condition &amp; product is &amp;#34;under investigation&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The Rotate Barrel switch gets stuck and it does not rotate the barrel at all.I had a great expectation from it but the product is a complete waste. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.</li>
            <li> Was so thrilled to find this because I was not able to find this &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; version in any of the stores.  The new ones have what they call an &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; but they have holes that just blow some of the hair around and is not really directed to a certain area.  Hope I can find another one later when I need it.</li>
            <li> I have used this Revlon Hot Air styler for years, but now they have changed the style and I will never buy another one. The new one has air holes above handles which dry your hair too fast and the brushes are too soft and do not grip the hair. I am totally disappointed and saddened I cannot purchase the old style and will not use Revlon stylers anymore.</li>
            <li> Brush does not stay attached. I have had two hot air brushes before. This style is horrible. The brush after a few minutes of use becomes detached. Not worth the money. Poor design.</li>
            <li> I did not even take this out of the packing.  Once I felt the bristles on the brushes I decided it was not for me, the were hard and stiff.  returned it.&lt;br /&gt;bb</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted a blower that did not have air holes at the base of the brush, as this picture depicts.  However, the smaller barreled brush does have open air holes at the base of the brush, therefore, when attempting to roll/brush/dry your hair, fine, silky hair gets blown right off the brush, which defeats the purpose completely of using a blower brush for styling.  I will be returning this one.</li>
            <li> I, like the one lady, prefer the old version of hot air brush.  Bought the new one several months ago and returned it when I discovered the air vents at base of smaller roller was shooting out hot air on to my scalp and I was getting burned.  That hot air should go directly up into the roller; it serves no purpose to be coming out the vents at all.  I&#x27;ve been a Revlon fan for a long time but won&#x27;t buy another hot air curling iron from you until you change it.</li>
            <li> Bought this yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to open it and try it out this morning.  Right out of the packaging it doesn&#x27;t rotate AT ALL!  Looks like I have to send it back for a replacement :(  Hopefully in a few weeks when I get the replacement that one works!      Aside from not rotating I really like the product...the barrel gets hot enough to create some curl and it does have a smoothing effect.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this on wet hair, the \\&quot;blow dryer\\&quot; function is a bit weak!</li>
            <li> I like the way it gently dries my hair and styles it a little too.  The only negative is that the brushes keep falling out while I am using it and I have to keep picking it up off the floor and resume drying my hair.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, as described item,,,,thank you</li>
            <li> 2 barrels make it convenient for multiple hair styles. I bought this on the recommendation of my sister &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> If this was made better and with a different latching system for the brush it would be a great blow dryer. But the brush falls off a minimum of 4 times every time I use it. Very aggravating.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hot air brush finally died and she had to purchase a new one.  She found this one and it was very close in design to the one she had been using.  This one has two ceramic brushes and one is 1 inch in diameter and the other is 1 ½ inches in diameter.  She has used it and she likes the larger brush and it does exactly what she wanted it to do.  She would rate that part as a 5 star item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brush is a different story.  The brushes are easily changed by just pulling them out of the top of the blower/ heating unit.  So far they haven&#x27;t fallen out like many other reviewers have stated. The smaller brush has ports at the base of the brush and they blow out very hot air that messes up your hair that you have just styled and it can be so hot that it can burn your skin or scalp.  That part is not good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the powered base of the hot brush is a button labeled rotate barrel.  You can roll your hair around the brush and then press the button while holding one finger onto the plastic end of the brush and by pulling down on the bush unroll your hair.  This is a fairly nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is about a 3 star item.  For the larger brush my wife is happy and she likes that a lot as it works like her old curler brush used to.  For the smaller brush it is useless.</li>
            <li> A very good buy but unfortunately I bought it from the USA site and it had their plug on it. I know I could use a adaptor but I did not want to. I had no trouble whatsoever returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful but it works.</li>
            <li> I like this product if the design would have been a little better. The brushes constantly fall off while doing my hair. I have short hair and fine so I can&#x27;t imagine having longer hair or a coarser hair and trying to dry it. IT does a great job if you can keep the brush on--thus my 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have always had the weirdest hair... somewhere between curly and wavy AND frizzy just after washing.  It used to take two to three days for my hair to calm down after washing.  With this hot air brush, my hair has never looked better!  The only complaint I have is that there is no way to lock the brush on to the barrel.  It constantly comes off, which is a real pain in the neck!  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great tool to have!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to be a great product.  I gave it 2 stars because, silly me... I have bought two of them.  Each time I remember why I gave it to Good Will and bought another product.  My biggest issue is the rotating barrel.  It rotates when you don&#x27;t want it to.  I am constantly trying to click the barrel back into place so I can finish drying my hair.  And there are those times when the barrel will just detach and sail through the air.  Not Cool Revlon!  I will keep my last one, so that I don&#x27;t forget and buy another.  I have had this brush for three weeks and have already replaced.</li>
            <li> My second one. First one was a good working wand for years, si I replaced it with the same brand. This new version has a button you push to allow the wand to spin. Good idea incase it tangles in long hair. Just be careful not to manually spin the brush without pushing the button. It will break. Otherwise good product choice at the best price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it when my hair is still wet.  If I am in a hurry, I semi blow dry my hair first.  I have thick, frizzy hair and this makes it beautiful, wavy or with pretty curls depending on how much time I want to take and there is no frizz and many times I don&#x27;t even need to use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it were a bit more durable.  This is my second one, my first I dropped on the tile floor and the curl attachment cracked and that was the end of that.  But in hindsight, I didn&#x27;t try to order another curl attachment as this one was hard enough to find, I was only able to find it online.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering a replacement brush but this one if totally different than the description....the air does not come through the  tube but blows more freely from where it attaches to the heating element.  Can&#x27;t find the old one anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best dryers of this kind but thy fall apart in about a year&lt;br /&gt;I buy one very 18 months or so bc there is nothing out there as good for my hair</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that I have used and LOVED this hot air brush for YEARS...but for some reason they decided to revise it. There was a problem with overheating which I think they tried to remedy by adding the holes but that wasn&#x27;t too bothersome. I have very thick hair and it was a lot to ask for. ;)  Also the older model would break inside the chamber and then the brush wouldn&#x27;t stay in.. Even with those problems and having to replace about once a year I still loved. BUT..... I have purchased and returned three in the past few months because the brush will not stay on the barrel.  Does anyone have this problem? Or a remedy for this problem?  I haven&#x27;t tried the other Revlon models but last night when I returned the Revlon I purchased the Conair. It has hard bristles which I&#x27;m not crazy about but at least I can use it without part of it falling on the floor.  :(</li>
            <li> the spin button doesn&#x27;t work - it was a gift so I found out after I threw away the packaging</li>
            <li> The brush part just lifts right off.  It comes off as I&#x27;m trying to do my hair.  Poor design.........</li>
            <li> I had the old style for many years and loved it!  This model has a larger handle and the brush will not stay attached.  Why, Revlon, did you change something that worked so well?</li>
            <li> I loved it until it broke after 2 months....2 of my friends have it and theirs broke, too.  I&#x27;m trying super glue, like they did.....so far not good. Grrrrrrrr</li>
            <li> The hot air brush is great for drying my hair.  No need to hold a brush in one hand and the hair dryer in the other!</li>
            <li> I did not order a used brush/dryer, but it arrived with a large scratch on one portion and there were hairs in the smaller brush attachment!!!  I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li> Where do I start? Air flow too weak. The plastic \\&quot;seat\\&quot; for the smaller roller unit broke when still fairly new. Neither roller units were easy to clamp in and once in they loosened and fell out. Handle too thick to turn easily. I don&#x27;t know what country this thing was made in but Revlon should be doing more product control on what they put out on the market.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Revlon Hot air stylers for many years.  This one though, I must say it&#x27;s a piece of crap.  Please do yourself a favor and do not buy.</li>
            <li> 5 stars.. Because the Hot Air Styler and Dryer is a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using this same dryer from Revlon for years.  Yes.. they have changed the design of this model.  The pictures on this site are showing the old design.  But.. I notice -mart is also showing the old model on their site.  The handle is not quite as slim as it used to be, but still not as thick as most.  It&#x27;s not quite as comfortable when you have a smaller hand.  I do not see a difference in  air flow though.  This makes styling my short-thick-curly hair in the morning a breeze.  I do partially dry my hair with a blow dryer leaving it a bit damp, then finish it off with the Styler/Dryer.  I can use the 1\\&quot; brush if I&#x27;m going for curl or the 1-1/2\\&quot; brush if I&#x27;m going for no curl but want fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was another issue.  I would think because this item is being sold as \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; it would come in it&#x27;s original packaging with an owners manual. It came in a clear plastic zipper bag with no manual.  NEW?  NO IDEA! I&#x27;ve ordered and returned this item twice over the past week because of the packaging issue.  Contacted customer service.. and they were very courteous and all is good. Both have been returned for credit.  I will buy this item again from Amazon when the issues have been resolved.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair product similiar to this for years.  I finally had to replace it and thought Revlon should make a good product.  I could not find another Conair blow brush dryer at the store I was shopping at so decided to go with the Revlon.  It really is poor quality and will go in the trash.  I will look until I find a better product.  Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> When my Revlon hot air dryer broke after many years I replaced it with another Revlon hot air styler. What a mistake, the new version was terrible. The barrel constantly fell off and it didn&#x27;t dry anything like the original model! So when I saw the older version online,(at least the picture shows the older version), I ordered it. But what I received was the newer Revlon hot air dryer and as I mentioned before the new model is useless. Had the correct picture of this Revlon product been shown online I would never have ordered it.</li>
            <li> Works good but the attachment is loose and shakes while combing hair.</li>
            <li> This product works well on fine straight hair.  It gives the look of a fuller head of hair.  I have used Revlon styling brushes for years.  Still like the old model that did not blow air through the brush.  It seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this styling brush a couple of months ago and have only used it maybe 20 times.  The brush won&#x27;t stay on at all. I think I have it latched in but it flies off a few seconds later if I&#x27;m not pressing it down.  I don&#x27;t understand the function of the red button that is supposed to allow you to turn the brush while you&#x27;re drying your hair.  And of course I threw away the receipt, so there is yet another $20.00 gone.  There is just no quality anymore!</li>
            <li> When I received the item, it was not as pictured.  The base of the barrel on the brush portion looks sealed/closed when actually the smaller one has vents which allow hot air to escape and blow your hair while trying to style it.  Not what I was looking for.  Was hoping to receive the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these Hot Air Stylers for many, many years and thought I should replace it with a new model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a mistake!!! The handle on this Styler is so large you can not get your hand around it.  I suppose a large man could get a good grip but I have never seen a women&#x27;s hand large enough to fit around it.  The next thing you will notice is the fact it does not get as hot as the old model.  Even worse is that air blows out of vents at the bottom of the brush in the top of the handle so your hair is blowing all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing is that it is much more quiet than the older model.  Maybe I am just too set in my ways but I would love to have my old model back.</li>
            <li> I have a short bob and it is all I need to dry and style my hair.  Could&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Wal-mart.  Good air flow but the brushes fall off....over and over.  The brush latches so it does not spin unless you push a button,  but doesn&#x27;t latch on to the base so it won&#x27;t slide off.  My hair is just under the chin and not as thick as it was 30 years ago, but the brush comes off about every other section of hair.  I bought a John Freida brush here on amazon which was more expensive but a much better use of money since this one was extremely frustrating.  I liked it well enough that I bought a second Freida brush slightly smaller so I had two sizes.</li>
            <li> I used this once, it does not rotate at all, and it is not what I wanted. The product description did not match.</li>
            <li> The smaller barrel, which I use on my older model, is ineffective on this newer model.  The air holes at the base of the barrel prevent hot air from being directed effectively into the barrel.  If the larger barrel is your thing, then I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be adequate for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I tried the larger barrel &amp; it kept popping off.  This model is pure trash.  Bring back the original design!!</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t lock. They keep falling off in the floor. Gotta keep the toilet closed while using styling brush so it doesn&#x27;t fall into toilet. I dread doing my hair every morning. I had an older one that worked well, but when it quit, I bought this one. I&#x27;ve regretted it ever since.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be great for my daughter and I, but it does not straighten my naturally curly hair like a regular blow dryer does.  My daughter has super thick and long hair and this does not have enough power to dry her hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> This works very well....easy to handle and work with.....I had the older version and the on/off did not stay on....this one is much, much better! Good choice!</li>
            <li> I received this item and it doesn&#x27;t work!! Can I return it??</li>
            <li> Good dryer. No hair pulling. The on/off is a bit tricky and the plastic is VERY cheap - otherwise a 5</li>
            <li> Tenia otra idea sobre el producto, creia que giraba completamente.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000PXYAL2 Revlon RV444C Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;  several years ago my daughter baught one of these to try out; from that moment on I was hooked, it did everything I needed it to do to get the job done beautifully. Unfortunately it soon burned out. Again; not too long after the perchase of my secound as well as the third styler the bristles receded into the barrel. I have tried others but none seem to do the job as well. In my opinion,  they need to fix this issue, minimumly make the brushes available as a separate perchase.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for many years, but mine broke and I have been looking to replace it.  I bought another model Revlon hair styler, but it is harder to handle, I find this one easier.  The only downside is this one is not very hot.  The other model gets much hotter.  The plus is I&#x27;m sure it is better for my hair, the downside is that my hair doesn&#x27;t curl very well with it.  I gave it 4 stars though because I like the ease of handling it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was somewhat like the very expensive one.  It does everything the expensive one does.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product was quite disappointing.  I had a Revlon with a round brush previously and it lasted for years so I decided to buy another one.  Apparently this one does not have the same BTUs that my previous one did.  There is no power whatsoever when the brush is attached.  It&#x27;s okay without the brush but then I lose the control of my hair that I liked before.</li>
            <li> Larger brush roll bristles tend to fall out easily. Smaller brush roll bristles work better.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job as long as you don&#x27;t mind having to reinsert the brush 10 times every morning while trying to dry your hair.  I bought it 2 months ago so too late to return it.  It&#x27;s in the garbage now.</li>
            <li> I like this ,but just wish they made them a little smaller for us gals who prefer our hair short! I am impressed how quickly it heats up and drys hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly I had to throw my second Revlon hot air styler away in less than a year. I like the way it works, but it simply does not hold up under normal use. Yes, it is inexpensive, but I prefer products that last and do not end up in landfills after such a short time.</li>
            <li> I received my hair styler and dryer on June 14, 2013, and it quit working on July 22,2013.  Not a very good quality item.  When it was working, it was not working great, as the brush would keep coming loose and sometimes would fall out.  Would like to have returned it to Amazon, but my return window expired July 15, 2013.  I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product works fine but I wish the handle was &amp;#34;skinnier&amp;#34;.  They used to make all hot air brushes with thinner handles, and now you can only find the fat ones.  The thin ones are easier to manage, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> plastic on curlers is very thin and fragile and smaller barrel was cracked and would not be grasped by the heating unit.  Returned for replacement.  Hope the next one is not broken.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Mom for Christmas.  She asked me specifically for this product.  It was much more in stores and I ordered it late and it still came in for Christmas!  She loved it and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have bad hair.  No two ways about it, bad hair.  It&#x27;s thin, it&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s like cat fur.  This hair styling device has given me the best hair I&#x27;ve had in years.  I get a much better outcome with it than I did with a round brush and my blow dryer.  I would definitely repurchase and may buy another one just to have a spare.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! The air blows out of a small hole and it takes forever to dry my hair and its NOT that thick!! Last week It burnt out!&lt;br /&gt;Now it doesnt work! Total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0012TOAGI Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic]]    Fantastic Product.  The hot air brush makes it possible to dry and style hair with one hand with professional results.  The two different brush sizes are great for choosing more or less curl.</li>
            <li> Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic     Quite good styler and dryer! Only minus would be the brush heads which are very hard to change. Didn&#x27;t work like it was said in the instructions. One little piece broke off in the process of changing a brush head....but gladly it still works and does miracles to my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought two, one is great, the first one I used the head came off and I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this product has a comfortable and workable brush head and does not get so hot that it burns my hair as other similar products do.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was unaware that this was for the USA, and had a USA plug on.It would have been nice if AMAZON  would have informed me before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Loved this when i first got it, but in less than a year the barrel started to fall out. Very annoying! My brilliant husband looked at it and discovered that the barrel had a crack in it where it entered into the handle. This caused it to fall out. He put electrician&#x27;s tape on the inside of the cracked barrel to hold it tight, and now it works and stays in the handle like it should. I&#x27;m happy I can use it again with this easy fix. 3 stars is generous  because this never should have happened in the first place, and it seems to happen to so many people. .</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair. No curl or volume. Very disappointing. If I hadn&#x27;t thrown out the packaging I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> I took this from someone else&#x27;s post but I feel the same way very disappointed.  Looking for a new one now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer has been redesigned. I am very upset with the Revlon Company for doing that. The brush surface has been shortened and air vents put in the brush attachments, that blow on the hair not being styled. That makes it very difficult to dry the hair because the air from the vents blows the hair that is not on the brush and distributes the styled hair that has already been dried. The handle has been made larger around. That makes it very hard for someone who has difficulty gripping to use it.</li>
            <li> great for the price.. get&#x27;s a little hot for fine hair after a bit so have to stop if you are using for a long time. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price</li>
            <li> Clean with dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I had a GREAT hot air brush, bought in the 90&#x27;s...it finally broke.  This one (I&#x27;m guessing due to safety concerns?) on the smaller brush has vents in the WRONG place... The air escaping from the vents blows your hair in all the wrong directions!  I did a workaround by wrapping a headband around the vents,... I&#x27;m not sure that is a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;  fix, but it works until I can find something better.  Also, not liking the &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; factor... I don&#x27;t want the brush to be loose!  Now understand...it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;spin,&amp;#34; the brush just comes free to turn if you unlock it... and it unlocks with any slight pressure inward.  So if you like to hold both ends, like I do, you unlock the brush.  Makes me swear a lot in the morning :-Z</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a hair dryer and round brush for years. Love the look, hate the tired arms and constant repositioning to get the hair straight in the right places, curled in others etc. Enter the hot air brush: fabulous! Ok it&#x27;s not perfect. You can&#x27;t go from sopping wet hair to perfectly styled and dried in 20 minutes.  But you can do your hair well and without fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has three settings: cool, low, and high.  High is equivalent to my hair dryer&#x27;s low setting, low is kind of irrelevant &amp; cool sets the curl quite well.  It also has a button to allow you to rotate the barell for the curl. The bristles are short and don&#x27;t grab super tight on the hair. The power switch is actually pretty easy to navigate. And the unit is extremely light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like: because it doesn&#x27;t get super hot, there is significantly less damage to my hair. Also, the barrell isn&#x27;t shockingly hot to touch, and my hair isn&#x27;t hot at all when done with a section. Because the barrell rotates, there isn&#x27;t significant pull on the hair - which causes breakage- and if you happen to tangle ( which only happened because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to what I was doing) you just hit the barrell rotate button, and poof! No more tangle &amp; no breakage. What&#x27;s more is that there were only about two hairs on the brush when I was done - usually there are many, and I didn&#x27;t feel any hair falling after I was done. Nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it isn&#x27;t nearly as quick as a flat iron,  but I can&#x27;t say any of the above about either a flat iron or brush/dryer combo. Loving this &amp; am looking forward to doing my hair again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air styler about a year ago and only used about 3 times. My hair turned out fine the 3 times I used it  but it stopped working all of sudden. I&#x27;ve owned many hair styling products which lasted for years. Revlon should just stick to what they started with, makeup.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why this thing is so cheap: it doesn&#x27;t work.  It doesn&#x27;t spin at all, so either the spin button is broken, or something inside the mechanism is busted.  Perhaps I got a defective one; all I know is that it doesn&#x27;t work.  I did get the \\&quot;hot air\\&quot; part to work, but I agree with other reviewers that it seems like the air flow isn&#x27;t strong enough (nor hot enough) to dry and curl your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon sent me this thing in a plastic case with absolutely NO documentation or instruction manual with it.  Since this thing was so cheap, I don&#x27;t want to spend the time or $ to send it back for a refund, so I&#x27;ll probably just pitch it.  So buyer beware: don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing!</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year now and it is awesome. I have used the hot air curling irons for many years and this seems the best so far. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice blow dryer.  Leaving hair, as advertised, soft, shiny and softly curled.  I love the results. You can also use this to refresh style later in the day without burning up your ends.  The only possible issue with this dryer/curler is it can be delicate when changing from one styling brush to the other</li>
            <li> This items only lasted a few months, then crack and started falling apart.  Poor Quality.  It was pretty good for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy thinking you are getting the older model version.  It is the newer version which is a very poor design.</li>
            <li> this product is very cheap in the making of it. But it is the right size I needed, clients still bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> This item has too little wattage to achieve the straight (no curl) effect I want. Perhaps the manufacturer assumes the customer understand the difference between wattage and styling. I did not. It would have been helpful if more information had been included in the description.</li>
            <li> I had a way older model just like this one that was fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;The rotate button was so easy to use BUT on this one it is an&lt;br /&gt;absolute joke, not to mention the brushes WILL NOT stay&lt;br /&gt;on the wand.  Into the garbage it goes!</li>
            <li> This was not the hot air styler I wanted.  I was looking for the RV444 without the letter C at the end.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product before. Now each time I order the Rv444, I&#x27;m sent RV444C.  I&#x27;m guessing the RV444 is no longer available.  I would like to have been told the RV444 styler is no longer available if this is the case, because I must have 8 of the RV444c in the attic. Not being used.&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn Lewis</li>
            <li> It was very poor quality.  Kept turning while using and afraid it was going to fall off.  The button to turn it off and on stuck more than once and now is completely stuck!  I bought two and am returning them both!!</li>
            <li> The concept is wonderful! I purchased this item from Wal Mart, but am now on Amazon looking for a sturdier product of the same style.&lt;br /&gt;Although it takes a bit longer to dry my hair than a typical blow dryer, it makes up for the time that would be spent styling with a flat or curling iron, and is considerably lighter in weight.  The end result is a very smooth, shiny and soft head of hair.  I also find myself using MUCH less product, which is easier on my tresses and my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two interchangeable brushes, 1\\&quot; and 1 1/2\\&quot;.  I was excited when I realized that the heat and air are more concentrated with the smaller barrel, because the drying and smooth styling process were moving more quickly than with the larger barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My happiness was short lived, however, when I noticed a MAJOR design flaw:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very have thick or heavy hair, this particular item not strong enough to use without continuous troubleshooting. The barrels seem to be secure when they are placed onto the drying unit.  Unfortunately, they do not stay in place.  Even with little resistance and no rotating, the barrel sneaks its way out of the coupling, which leaves a hot ceramic brush dangling from your flowing locks.  Some may be okay with burning the crapola out of their hands while removing it from their hair and placing it back on the unit.  I, however, refuse to use all of my Hello Kitty band aids on styling related finger blisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, if you have thick, coarse, or long hair, this specific product will likely not be strong enough to do the job.  Although it stings the pocketbook initially, it will be a better investment to purchase a stronger, more expensive model.</li>
            <li> I like this curler and dryer since I have short hair.  It grabs the hair while your drying and styling it.  I had a Braun  cordless curler before which I loved but you cannot get the replacement cartridges anymore and some places are over charging them.  So I switch to this Hot Air brush which I like.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was wanting, I was wanting a rotating curling iron. This has a button that says &amp;#34;Rotate&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t rotate</li>
            <li> Does not rotate, you basically Need to hold the brush to not fall, overall. Bad product</li>
            <li> Within two months of ordering this, it no longer works. Plugged it in this morning and it barely starts up plus has a burning smell. I don&#x27;t use it every day and I have thin, fine hair so it hasn&#x27;t been exhausted by use. I looked at the return policy and it&#x27;s past the 30 days so I&#x27;m stuck. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used two of these hair dryers and do not recommend them at all. I thought the first one was just a lemon but both times I had problems with the brush coming out of the base while I use it. There is no locking mechanism and it just falls out while I trying to dry my hair. The more I use it the more it happens. This happened with both dryers. I have short hair and this shouldn&#x27;t happen. I have burned my self a couple of times because of this. Also it catches my hair in the seams. It&#x27;s a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she was really excited with it. She uses it everyday and the results it&#x27;s really great. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. The delivery was really fast and the product was brand new. Thanks</li>
            <li> This was my third Revlon Styler, and it just quit working after about 6 weeks.  Not happy!  Don&#x27;t know if it was just a dud, or if their quality has diminished.</li>
            <li> This is an adequate device for curling your hair.  All of them are hard for me to handle and manage because of the weight and balance.  I&#x27;m old with arthritis so all I can say is it works when i use it.</li>
            <li> The dryer was what I expected, with one exception.  When the small brush is attached there are large gaps left where the head attaches the the base, causing air to blow across the curl rather than out from the middle of it.  Makes hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> Revlon Perfect Heat 1 inch &amp; 1 - 1/2 inch hot air brush.  It does not work, and it did not come with instructions and I have no way of sending it back, I don&#x27;t know where to send it to.  Very dissatisfied.. I will not purchase another Hot Air Brush ever again from Revlon.</li>
            <li> It seems like it would be great for long to medium hair.  My hair was too short for this.  Need a smaller barrel</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the quality or lack there of, of this product. While I was using it the attachment flew out across my bathroom! I love the idea of it but there&#x27;s something lacking in the execution.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom and she&#x27;s very happy about it! The only thing is that she has to have dry hair to use it.... that&#x27;s a bummer... but besides that is great!</li>
            <li> Bought it, used it it does it&#x27;s job but the brush attachments like to pop off while you&#x27;re trying to style your hair. You&#x27;ll probably be better off buying something else.</li>
            <li> Love the way it grips my fine hair and gives me the right amount of curl.  However. the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; button seems to engage itself when I don&#x27;t want it to</li>
            <li> This one is weaker and does not give as nice a finished product as the Revlon Shine Enhancing Hot Air Kit</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past and loved it. I didn&#x27;t bother to read the reviews because it looked exactly like the one I had been using. Who ever redesigned this ruined it! Now the end rotates and falls off before you can get a section of hair dried with it. Unfortunately, I was so sure I would love this I threw all packaging away and will just have to lose the money I spent on this. I HATE this redesign! Totally worthless piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Does not heat up enough to bend the hair.</li>
            <li> Is this package really new as the print-out white label claims? Anyone can put that label on. It was not in a box as the picture showed, it came in a plastic see-through bag. It doesn&#x27;t even have instructions as a new product would have. I am dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy! Such a cheap piece of junk. The barrel randomly detaches and literally flies off loudly hitting your mirror and then the floor. Oh and by the way it doesn&#x27;t spin on its own. Mine broke permanently within 4 months of using it. The pins that hold the barrel in are made poorly and will snap off and break, leaving you with a useless dryer/styling tool. Don&#x27;t waist your money on this!</li>
            <li> The brushes are too wide I would like it a narrower brush say three quarters of an inch or half-inch</li>
            <li> This was replacement to my broken one. Since Revlon has been making this, I have gone through five units. When I ordered, this was advertised as new. When it arrived it was NOT in original packaging, but in a torn plastic case only. This also is not working correctly as the brushes that are supposed to snap in DON&#x27;T, so it is worthless. For what I spent it isn&#x27;t worth the return hassles. Trust me, I know these units intimately, and this was not new-it was used and broken.    As an update, I called Helen of Troy, who makes this product for Revlon. They were of no help regarding this product. This is made out of country and they have no clue what I am talking about when I tell them the brush disengages when you are blow-drying as you brush through your hair. This is very dangerous. It literally will go flying through the air 50 feet or more, hitting something or someone, and it gets very hot. I hit my spouse with it and a lamp, causing it to fall and break. This product needs to be taken off the market. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> This is the third Hot Air Brush (same model) I have purchased from Revlon because it is so easy to use and makes curing my hair faster because it dries as I curl.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and upon the first time using it, the attachment came off. It is poorly designed (the button to remove attachments is where you put your hand to hold the thing) and cheaply made (feels as though it is about to fall apart ).  The heat doesn&#x27;t come out of the holes on the roller, instead the heat comes from the main unit. I used it one time and gave it away. I later purchased a better brand where the heat comes through the holes on the roller as it&#x27;s supposed to! I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Too much air blowing the hair around...not able to get a good curl because of this functuion.  I prefer the previous Revelon hot air styler that I purchased a few years ago with a smaller barrell..it was easier for me to handle.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which is usually easy to curl, but this blows too hard and really doesn&#x27;t curl that well.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, easy to change tips and will never be with out it.Quick way to dry and curl hair. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received this today and it does not work.  Don&#x27;t buy.  I didn&#x27;t even get to use it once.  It NEVER worked!</li>
            <li> When this was working I was very happy with it but it is a cheap product and broke fairly soon after I got it. The problem is that the barrel will not stay connected to the handle and falls off repeatedly with every use.  Now after that has happened on a regular basis, the barrel teeth broke in several places so it is really not even usable anymore.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several curling brushes over the years, most are Revlon and last for years...this is by far the worst.  The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; won&#x27;t stay attached to the heating/dryer base.  VERY disappointed in this model.</li>
            <li> I wish the barrels stayed in, they do not lock in and fall out a lot.</li>
            <li> Ok, but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl well</li>
            <li> This is worst hair dryer of this type I have bought. The barrel will not stay on the handle and my hair gets caught in the seams of the device. I have used this type of dryer for years and this is absolutely the worst one ever made. If I could give this negative stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I have used a similar item for years until the heating element broke in it.  I bought this one to replace it and was horribly dissappointed.  The air flow is so weak that you HAVE to use another dryer to dry your hair before you can use this to curl your ends.  The barrel loses its grip with the slightest resistance, which means that every time you hit a tangle the barrel rolls and straightens your hair instead of curling it and you have to take the dryer and push the barrel back on it.  And then it broke after only 3 weeks of use.  What a waste of money! I will keep looking for the old model that I used.</li>
            <li> This is my first blow dryer brush and I found heaven.  I work out, wash, and blow dry in 12 minutes.  Oh, and I have extreme curls (think traci Ellis Ross).  I keep it short...  Love this product.</li>
            <li> If you have short to medium length hair and want to do styling when hair is partially dry then this is a good solution. It&#x27;s also a good solution for my mom who likes to touch up her hair in between salad visits. Works great if you spritz the hair with some water or works well if hair partially dry. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for it to completely dry your hair or if your hair is really long as this would take a while. Sometimes I use this for a quick finishing dry to prevent the frizzes and I try to keep my flat iron to minimal usage to keep my hair healthy and try to use this in between.</li>
            <li> This styler works well on my fine, somewhat sparse, medium length hair. I need this design of all over bristles to hold my hair. That said, however, it certainly has some design flaws. The one that bothers me most is the way you interchange the barrels -- no release, you just pull them, rather hard. This is impossible to do when they are hot, and seems like it would break rather easily (I&#x27;ve only had it a few days). Also, the air blowing out the attachment end of the smaller barrel, as well as the barrel itself, is annoying, but doesn&#x27;t keep it from working on my hair. The larger barrel does not have this problem.</li>
            <li> Replaces my broken Revlon.  Works the same.  Great price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li> It was not the same item advertised. Same type but I was looking for the older model that was advertised and received a different model</li>
            <li> The brush will not stay in and it has heating vents before the brush so no hot air reaches the hair.</li>
            <li> I received the Revlon dryer and I was not totally satisfied with it. It was advertised as being able to dry hair more quickly than others of the same type. I find it to be very weak in drying power, and I use it for spot drying my hair , if it gets wet after showering with a shower cap  where the cap may miss coverage . It is not very powerful for drying after shampooing. However it is gentler in general on my hair when I need to use it. I would recommend it to those with short styles that do not require a long period of time for their hair to dry and/or style . For long hair, I would not recommend it. I am keeping mine for the reasons I mentioned above, but still need to use another older model of a different manufacturer to dry and style my hair after shampooing.</li>
