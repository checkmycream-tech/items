    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Can see a great improvement in my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was a bit worried about the hydro..thingy (lol)</li>
            <li>I still gave it 4 star because I am happy that it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Within a week his face was greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>so i read good things about it</li>
            <li>and i still got good results</li>
            <li>Do your own research and be aware, search the web, be your own best advocate .</li>
            <li>Well I used it for 2 months, twice a day, and honestly it didn&#x27;t do anything for my face.</li>
            <li>Hydroquinone is the effective ingredient in Porcelana Skin Cream.</li>
            <li>it has a kind of..</li>
            <li>anyways, use at your own risk.</li>
            <li>It helps to use both night and day creme to be more effective.</li>
            <li>Many high-end (Mario Badescu and others) continue to add this ingredient to otherwise great products despite the fact that some people have mild to severe allergic skin reactions to this ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Pat your hands all over your face, rub it on your skin, and voila- able to be evenly</li>
            <li>but for now i can say that the smell is not awful like some people are saying (maybe they changed it?)</li>
            <li>I stopped using it as soon as I realized that i was seeing more spots than I had.   </li>
            <li>I know because I had counted how many there were on each cheek.   </li>
            <li>This product is greasy, smelly and causes more brown spots rather than fading the one I have.   </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>once you do it will smoothly glide more onto your skin well.</li>
            <li>I am light brown skin</li>
            <li>I was really looking for something that would make my scars disappear; however, this product will greatly lighten scars (I can&#x27;t speak for all scars or everyone&#x27;s skin) with regular use.  </li>
            <li>I use this cream on my elbows, knees, and some dark spots on my body, and I have a great result from it, my skin gets lighter.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, hydroquinone (2%) products (along with kojic acid) are some of the most clinically effective dark spot treatments.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend it to someone that would be happy to just reduce the appearance of scars or uneven skin</li>
            <li>I may have to eventually cover my whole body with the treatment because I have light skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>But it was well worth it</li>
            <li>but I noticed a fading of the spots pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I took a picture of myself one day and noticed blemishes on my right cheek.</li>
            <li>Apparently the ingredient is banned in many countries around the world, but I don&#x27;t know why the US is still using it..</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve seen no visible improvement maybe because it requires more time to kick in and display a real change.</li>
            <li>This cream is really helping my legs tho!</li>
            <li>but I think my expectations were higher than they should have been.  </li>
            <li>this is my first time using and first day so as to results i will have to let you know</li>
            <li>Received product exactly as described in the time frame given at the time order was placed.   </li>
            <li>This product actually caused more brown spots to appear.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>I have so much scarring</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hispanic but very fair-skinned.</li>
            <li>a left over light mark from acne is now a huge red spot.  </li>
            <li>So I went searching, I found Porcelana, a friend said she used it and that it worked really well for her, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>really did not know what to expect my sun spots are getting lighter</li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>I was never a sun worshiper but spent a lot of vacations in various islands where the sun is very hot so the marks were sure to appear.  </li>
            <li>He was allergic to it and it had begun to affect his kidneys - it had started with headaches and general achiness and dizziness - apparently all sign sof poisoning and fortunately a doctor gave him a blood test which showed that he had this reaction to the cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just to be sure i applied a small amount on a specific area and sure enough huge bruise the next day</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>But after a few weeks i started noticing my face became brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li>I tried flushing my face with cool water, I patted my face dry with the softest towel I could find, and what I saw scared me to death.</li>
            <li>So far my face is much much lighter and the dark spots and acne scars all over my face are around 20% of their original size and are almost invisible.</li>
            <li>It is very, very, very thick and can form crust at the very top.</li>
            <li>not yet sure if thats good or bad) i will check back in a week or two and give an update as to results so for now i give 3 stars&#x60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has only been two weeks since I first applied it.</li>
            <li>I like this product my face and neck feel so soft after using it</li>
            <li>so what&#x27;s the point in spending so much &amp; going thru with following a regime, if there is no effect.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I  used this product and was very happy with it and bought some for a friend who became sick after using it daily for a week.</li>
            <li>does feel a bit dry on my face but that doesnt bother me as i have very oily skin...</li>
            <li>, the spots on my face are gone after on two weeks and my hands are starting to look young and clear.</li>
            <li>I did get a little more pale.</li>
            <li>As I didn&#x27;t use it for very long, I can&#x27;t say whether using it longer would have yielded results, but as I recently found out about Hydroquinone (the active ingredient) and it&#x27;s link to many health problems-including cancer-I&#x27;m not willing to take the risk, especially when the packaging says that it may take up to 3 months to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I can put up with the smell only last for a few minutes but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>I happen to have sensitive skin, so if you are planning on using this product only put it directly on the dark spot you are trying to reduce, do not use it over your entire face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but i did read the ingredients and found that either they changed the name or took it out completely because it is not mentioned as an active ingredient.</li>
            <li> After using the product for two months I couldn&#x27;t take the smell and difficulty in applying the thick goo any more, and I only saw a slight reduction is dark spots.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> am giving the daytime product the same review as the nighttime because the only difference is that one contains sunscreen while the other doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 3 months too long of applying a toxic cream to my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought other product similar to this but not works as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as I expected but not worth shipping to send  back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other dark spot correctors before, the last one I used was the Garnier one and that thing did not work at all.</li>
            <li> but because it is so thick a VERY small amount covers a large area so it will last you a long time....</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it long enough with these issues to get a noticeable effect.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on a regular basis during the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for one, but I won&#x27;t use any with hydroquinone because it has been banned in other countries because research has linked it to increased cancer risk.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share this with other viewers who might be allergic to it also.</li>
            <li> the cream is VERY thick and actually requires a little extra rubbing to work in</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks-twice a day and have not seen any difference in the dark spots on my hands and arms.  </li>
            <li> (Fade Dark Spots)]]appointed.  </li>
            <li> I read up on it before making a purchase and based on what I read, it was supposed to have faded the dark spots on my hands and arms.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My dark spots were reduced by applying this creme.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in hopes it would lessen the dark spots on my face and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> She had black spots on her face and with in one week her face was already showing results and it even made her lighter and her face wasn&#x27;t as oily as it was before.</li>
            <li> Then I put a little moisturizer on my face because my face dries a bit.  </li>
            <li> i bought this product today at Walmart for a little over $4 after reading the reviews</li>
            <li> I bought porcelana and used a thin layer over my entire face.</li>
            <li> Will recommend people not to waste their money.  </li>
            <li> but i do know i stopped using it and within a few days bruises were gone.</li>
            <li> However I did expect to lighten my skin a few shades but this was not noticeable.</li>
            <li> when u r using this product during the day, u don&#x27;t want to look so greasy &amp; it feels heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> recommendation is don&#x27;t waste ur money &amp; time on this product.</li>
            <li> I put the same as the average star rating because those of you who are reporting bad reactions are likely allergic to Diazolidinyl Urea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this cream on my face, I just don&#x27;t like the thick heavy feeling from it.</li>
            <li> It VERY Heavy</li>
            <li> For some people, this is a very dangerous product and can have possible long term affects.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to apply.</li>
            <li> My skin felt burnt, and it itched, plus it was dry and it was impossible to wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will NEVER EVER EVER buy or use this product again, the warming sensation tuned to a slight burning in places applied, and i ended up in the emergency room because a few days after consecutive use i woke up and every area that this cream was applied was covered in bruises, i looked so battered the doctor had the audacity to ask me if i was harming myself or had a violent spouse.</li>
            <li> Very thick</li>
            <li> Had terrible reaction requiring much medical attention.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Thick and greasy and very unpleasant on the underarms (where I have my skin discoloration).</li>
            <li> and it is impossible to use under make up.</li>
            <li> I have some acne scars, nothing bad, they are just something I don&#x27;t want on my face.</li>
            <li> (horrible mosquito bites, scars, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; it worked like a charm</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t like the smell its awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought porcelana and used a thin layer over my entire face. I woke up red, swollen with bumps all around my cheeks. I happen to have sensitive skin, so if you are planning on using this product only put it directly on the dark spot you are trying to reduce, do not use it over your entire face.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on a regular basis during the past two weeks. So far, I&#x27;ve seen no visible improvement maybe because it requires more time to kick in and display a real change. I&#x27;ll keep on using it a post back again later.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks-twice a day and have not seen any difference in the dark spots on my hands and arms.  Very dis[[ASIN:B001EW6I5E Porcelana Skin Lightening Cream Daytime Treatment - 3 Oz (Fade Dark Spots)]]appointed.  Will recommend people not to waste their money.  I read up on it before making a purchase and based on what I read, it was supposed to have faded the dark spots on my hands and arms.[[ASIN:B00383K2R2 Porcelana Skin Lightening Cream, Day]]</li>
            <li> I can agree with the rest of the costumers about the consistency of the paste, but I also can tell you how you can work with the consistency...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a hint: It&#x27;s like using shortening yet if you want the shortening to soften and turn into solution, you rub it in your hands and create thermal sensation, once you do it will smoothly glide more onto your skin well. Pat your hands all over your face, rub it on your skin, and voila- able to be evenly applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars because I like how it does brighten my skin, lighten my acne marks, and stays on my skin even after I sleep. The only problem is... The scent isn&#x27;t too like-able.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised.  I&#x27;m African American (brown hue) and use the product once per day instead of twice a day.  After two weeks I began to see a difference.  My recommendation would be to use a small amount on the area first.  Because it does not go on like a creamy cream.  Then I put a little moisturizer on my face because my face dries a bit.  Oh yeah you can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> Well I used it for 2 months, twice a day, and honestly it didn&#x27;t do anything for my face. (Made it paler in my opinion.) I don&#x27;t like the smell at all, but it goes away after a while. It VERY Heavy, It takes awhile to smear it across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would given this a 2, but i actually started using it for my legs. (horrible mosquito bites, scars, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; it worked like a charm and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks!!! Can see a great improvement in my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, or any part of the body i guess. This cream is really helping my legs tho!</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my elbows, knees, and some dark spots on my body, and I have a great result from it, my skin gets lighter. I don&#x27;t use this cream on my face, I just don&#x27;t like the thick heavy feeling from it.</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is the effective ingredient in Porcelana Skin Cream. It is also the same ingredient which is in skin lightening creams dispensed by dermatologists with cost over $100 a tube. It has only been two weeks since I first applied it. I cannot tell you that it works or does not. The instructions do say that if there is no improvement in 3 months to discontinue it&#x27;s use, so the jury won&#x27;t be out forever.</li>
            <li> I probably should have given this 4-stars instead of 3-stars but I think my expectations were higher than they should have been.  I was really looking for something that would make my scars disappear; however, this product will greatly lighten scars (I can&#x27;t speak for all scars or everyone&#x27;s skin) with regular use.  I was looking for a miracle in a jar which doesn&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I used this product again?  Probably... if my goal was to lighten existing scars.  I have so much scarring I don&#x27;t think anything would work to get rid of the discoloration in entirety but I would recommend it to someone that would be happy to just reduce the appearance of scars or uneven skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the daytime product the same review as the nighttime because the only difference is that one contains sunscreen while the other doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i bought this product today at Walmart for a little over $4 after reading the reviews i was a bit worried about the hydro..thingy (lol) my apologies can&#x27;t remember the word but i did read the ingredients and found that either they changed the name or took it out completely because it is not mentioned as an active ingredient. this is my first time using and first day so as to results i will have to let you know but for now i can say that the smell is not awful like some people are saying (maybe they changed it?) it has a kind of.. i don&#x27;t know... gingery scent to it personally i like it (will see what hubby says when he gets home about the smell as a second opinion) the cream is VERY thick and actually requires a little extra rubbing to work in but because it is so thick a VERY small amount covers a large area so it will last you a long time....does feel a bit dry on my face but that doesnt bother me as i have very oily skin...did however feel a warming sensation when applied to my face (not yet sure if thats good or bad) i will check back in a week or two and give an update as to results so for now i give 3 stars&#x60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will NEVER EVER EVER buy or use this product again, the warming sensation tuned to a slight burning in places applied, and i ended up in the emergency room because a few days after consecutive use i woke up and every area that this cream was applied was covered in bruises, i looked so battered the doctor had the audacity to ask me if i was harming myself or had a violent spouse. maybe i am just allergic to this product who knows but i do know i stopped using it and within a few days bruises were gone. just to be sure i applied a small amount on a specific area and sure enough huge bruise the next day i stopped using it and never will again i have had no problem since then.</li>
            <li> My dark spots were reduced by applying this creme. It helps to use both night and day creme to be more effective. However I did expect to lighten my skin a few shades but this was not noticeable. It is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I got the product on time, it was what I ordered.  I would buy again from this person again</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used other dark spot correctors before, the last one I used was the Garnier one and that thing did not work at all. I bought Porcelana at a local Walgreens for like $6, been using it for several weeks now. So far my face is much much lighter and the dark spots and acne scars all over my face are around 20% of their original size and are almost invisible. My only complaints about this product is the consistency and the smell. It is very, very, very thick and can form crust at the very top. It&#x27;s so hard to apply. And the smell--it has virtually no scent while inside the container but once you start putting it on, I think it&#x27;s either the oxidation process or how it reacts to the residue of my facial cleanser but it turns into a fishy smell... it goes away after a while. I still gave it 4 star because I am happy that it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Received product exactly as described in the time frame given at the time order was placed.   Would definitely do business with this seller again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic but very fair-skinned. Bought both the Day and Night creams and endured applying them for about a week. Thick and greasy and very unpleasant on the underarms (where I have my skin discoloration). As I didn&#x27;t use it for very long, I can&#x27;t say whether using it longer would have yielded results, but as I recently found out about Hydroquinone (the active ingredient) and it&#x27;s link to many health problems-including cancer-I&#x27;m not willing to take the risk, especially when the packaging says that it may take up to 3 months to notice a difference. That&#x27;s 3 months too long of applying a toxic cream to my skin. Apparently the ingredient is banned in many countries around the world, but I don&#x27;t know why the US is still using it..anyways, use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I got this product for a friend of mine.  I bought other product similar to this but not works as well as this one.  Within a week his face was greatly improved.  This product is great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a day for 2+ months and it has ruined my skin. I am light brown skin and I was using it to fade the sun spots on my cheeks. This product actually caused more brown spots to appear. I stopped using it as soon as I realized that i was seeing more spots than I had.   I know because I had counted how many there were on each cheek.   This product is greasy, smelly and causes more brown spots rather than fading the one I have.   I feel like suing these people... then I read the label again and it says that in some people it causes an increase in pigmentation/ brown spots.  Just my luck!</li>
            <li> so i read good things about it so i figured i give it a try, well that didn&#x27;t go so well, bought it on friday and sunday (after 2 nights of using it) my nose now looks like a strawberry on fire + it feels like that as well, a left over light mark from acne is now a huge red spot.  this is in my experience rubbish.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before readying about the cancer causing ingredients.  Do your own research and be aware, search the web, be your own best advocate .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product. I&#x27;m looking for one, but I won&#x27;t use any with hydroquinone because it has been banned in other countries because research has linked it to increased cancer risk. I thought I would pass this info along for all it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I have some acne scars, nothing bad, they are just something I don&#x27;t want on my face. So I went searching, I found Porcelana, a friend said she used it and that it worked really well for her, so I decided to try it. I used the Porcelana Night cream one time. I applied the cream all over my face and neck, and I went on with my day. I went to work and followed my daily routine. The next morning I woke up with red blotches all over my face. My skin felt burnt, and it itched, plus it was dry and it was impossible to wash. I tried flushing my face with cool water, I patted my face dry with the softest towel I could find, and what I saw scared me to death. There was blood coming out my pores. I don&#x27;t recommend this garbage to anybody unless you are trying to burn your face.</li>
            <li> Did not work as I expected but not worth shipping to send  back.  Would not order this product again but not a reflection against Amazon.  Just didn&#x27;t like product.</li>
            <li> I put the same as the average star rating because those of you who are reporting bad reactions are likely allergic to Diazolidinyl Urea. Many high-end (Mario Badescu and others) continue to add this ingredient to otherwise great products despite the fact that some people have mild to severe allergic skin reactions to this ingredient.  Otherwise, hydroquinone (2%) products (along with kojic acid) are some of the most clinically effective dark spot treatments.</li>
            <li> Had terrible reaction requiring much medical attention. For some people, this is a very dangerous product and can have possible long term affects.  Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend. She had black spots on her face and with in one week her face was already showing results and it even made her lighter and her face wasn&#x27;t as oily as it was before. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the consistency and pilling of product on my face. I was not able to use it long enough with these issues to get a noticeable effect.</li>
            <li> I have spots on my skin from over exposure to the sun.  The Porcelana did not help at all.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product if you if you are looking to lighten sun spots.</li>
            <li> It says it takes a while to work but I noticed a fading of the spots pretty quickly. It will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I like this product my face and neck feel so soft after using it&lt;br /&gt;I really did not know what to expect my sun spots are getting lighter&lt;br /&gt;but I know  I am going to buy the night cream also</li>
            <li> I used this cream not even every day because i forguet and i still got good results,i  definetly recommend it</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and has an unpleasant smell. After using the product for two months I couldn&#x27;t take the smell and difficulty in applying the thick goo any more, and I only saw a slight reduction is dark spots.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. I wanted to return but there is no return label.  Very thick and it is impossible to use under make up. I  used it for about a week. I bear the discomfort for 1 week hoping I&#x27;ll get over it and will see improvement. Nada!</li>
            <li> I  used this product and was very happy with it and bought some for a friend who became sick after using it daily for a week. He was allergic to it and it had begun to affect his kidneys - it had started with headaches and general achiness and dizziness - apparently all sign sof poisoning and fortunately a doctor gave him a blood test which showed that he had this reaction to the cream.&lt;br /&gt;So I just wanted to share this with other viewers who might be allergic to it also.</li>
            <li> I took a picture of myself one day and noticed blemishes on my right cheek. I searched and searched for products and came across this cream. Found out they had it at my local Walgreens, I bought i tried it and i don&#x27;t like the smell its awful. I don&#x27;t know reminds me of \\&quot;pigs feet\\&quot;. But after a few weeks i started noticing my face became brighter and more even toned. I did get a little more pale. But it was well worth it the blemishes faded and i look refreshed. Now i take a picture and i don&#x27;t notice the blemishes at all. I love this cream. I can put up with the smell only last for a few minutes but the results are well worth it. I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product. This may not be a case for if you were to use it. I gave this rating the benefit of the doubt. It may work for others.</li>
            <li> when u r using this product during the day, u don&#x27;t want to look so greasy &amp; it feels heavy on the skin. I don&#x27;t see any improvement  after using this product so what&#x27;s the point in spending so much &amp; going thru with following a regime, if there is no effect.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is don&#x27;t waste ur money &amp; time on this product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in hopes it would lessen the dark spots on my face and neck areas.  I used it for a month and it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable changes at all.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my face, especially under foundation.  It was rather sticky feeling.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After looking at a lot of spot treatments I went with this one that has been around for years.  I am starting to see age spots on my hands and face so I went for inexpensive and well known. This works very well, the spots on my face are gone after on two weeks and my hands are starting to look young and clear. I may have to eventually cover my whole body with the treatment because I have light skin. I was never a sun worshiper but spent a lot of vacations in various islands where the sun is very hot so the marks were sure to appear.  Even though I use a 50 sun block I still have sun damage. I may have to order a case of it.</li>
