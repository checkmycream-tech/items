            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Love this brow tint!</li>
            <li>This is the first eyebrow gel that actually perfectly matches.  </li>
            <li>the color I chose is just a shade darker than my own.</li>
            <li>Fawn Color is nice for brunettes.</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of the handy to use brow tint</li>
            <li>She liked it so well</li>
            <li>It was a nice way to understand the product.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find this brow tint.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, it covers beautifully and does not smear (dries quickly)</li>
            <li>The fawn tint is perfect with my skin tone and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Since this product seems to lift and plump existing hairs, it gives the effect of of flawless full eyebrows which is great for those of us who don&#x27;t have a lot of eye brow hair due to thyroid issues, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fine-ness of the brush.  </li>
            <li>wish though, that there is one more shade lighter.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow product is so SO much better.  </li>
            <li>I simply love it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I also think it would better with a paintbrush type of applicator rather than a mascara brush.  </li>
            <li>For two years I used Lancome&#x27;s eyebrow mascara and started noticing I had more gray/white hairs that were not being covered.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>my eyebrows are beginning to get many silver hairs in them.  </li>
            <li>I am a redhead with mostly auburn hair.  </li>
            <li>And I also love dyeing them as well with Godefrey dye.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite go-to make up products.</li>
            <li>Maybe with more practice, I&#x27;d like it better</li>
            <li>Color is perfect, universal.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered this brow tint.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brow tint gel.  </li>
            <li>and this may be my favorite.</li>
            <li>This product works okay -</li>
            <li>color was a pretty good match</li>
            <li>The brush is a pretty good size.</li>
            <li>I purchased the brow tint in Fawn and the coverage is great and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>So many brow products require two steps, but this is just a light brown gel that applies on the eyebrow the way mascara is used on the lashes.</li>
            <li>It takes some patience to apply but it looks great and you don&#x27;t even realize you are wearing it because it feels natural.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily at night.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and stays.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to control the brush.  </li>
            <li>Also easy to remove with cleaning cream.</li>
            <li>Mistakes are easy to correct, and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to define your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and stays on.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a nice product, I just wish the colors were explained better so a choice was more clear.</li>
            <li>When I first used the Mommy Makeup Brow Tint, I was thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>Color is fine.</li>
            <li>This product goes on nicely and looks very natural, lasts most the day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>The first tube I purchased a few months ago  was just great and lasted very nicely.   </li>
            <li>I just love products that perform exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>and everyone said you could put it on lightly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just light brown mascara that you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li>next morning my brows looked just as great as when I applied it.</li>
            <li>also use a light colored brow pencil to fill in bald areas before hand and then finish with brow</li>
            <li>too light for me.</li>
            <li>I applied it at 7AM and lightly retouched it at 6PM because I was going out to dinner, but all of make-up needed to be retouched.</li>
            <li>This is a product I also use to color the gray hairs and smooth the hairs along my part and forehead.</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised, the texture is good.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow makeup looks natural on my fairly sparse brows.  </li>
            <li>Framing my eyes without looking overly made up (especially in the daytime) was becoming more and more challenging.</li>
            <li>Love that I can just take a quick swipe at my brows in the morning and have a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, the brown color Fawn that I ordered is good, not too light or too dark.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, mush better than the gel I was using previously.</li>
            <li>I think this color would be great for someone with light golden blonde hair.</li>
            <li>At 68 yrs my eyebrows started turning gray and losing their original shape.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find the Mommy Makeup Brow Tint on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and a great color for dark or light brunettes.</li>
            <li>I use a Q-tip to clean off the exxtra tht get on the out side of brow</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and rarely requires a touch-up.  </li>
            <li>The tint is the right color, goes on easily and wears well.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly as advertised and the color is very true to the pictures.  </li>
            <li>and so happy I finally found a product that does exactly what it says and more![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>, then the gel, and the results are amazing, it looks natural, not like I painted my eyebrows on.</li>
            <li>Fawn color works beautifully with my med dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and am glad I found it.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a natural looking product to fill-in and help my brows look nice.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly the Fawn goes well with my white hair.  </li>
            <li>This fawn shade is a true taupe...grayish brown.</li>
            <li>It holds the &amp;#34;unrulys&amp;#34; in place all day and gives nice, natural cover to my grays.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shade, not too dark, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and looks real.</li>
            <li>can also color in areas to create a more full look and still keep it looking competely natural.  </li>
            <li>I do 2 light coats, really scrubbing in the first coat to get all sides of my thinning light brows.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying some more products from them!</li>
            <li>Even when I try to put it on lightly and brush it in it is too much.  </li>
            <li>This product is even better than the old Maybeline eyebrow tint I used to use.</li>
            <li>look more natural.</li>
            <li>and this one is a bigger size, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural, and the packaging is so cute.</li>
            <li>The design of the opening is unique and keeps the product from coming out with too much tint on the brush.  </li>
            <li>And the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Brushes on evenly with just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li>I especially like the quality of the gel; it does not clump in the tube and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I never had red brows, just very light</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are very very sparse</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for adding a more natural, darker look to your brows.</li>
            <li>Not complicated to use.</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 other &#x27;store brands&#x27; but this is absolutely my favorite!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted in eyebrow makeup.  </li>
            <li>The Fawn color looks exactly like the ad and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for eyebrows that are starting to fade and have more grays.  </li>
            <li>This stuff coats just enough to make me look like I have more brows-</li>
            <li>This is exactly the product I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also gives the appearance of lifted eyelids, just a fresher more awake look- a younger look to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first was even worse.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>Most of the lighter brow makeup has too much red in it.</li>
            <li>I bought two hoping the second would possibly be better than the first.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry super quickly, so you can wipe off a bit if you need to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I like the most is that it&#x27;s very neutral - not too chocolaty and not a touch of red in the color.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the gray brows blended in with my dark ones and grooms them nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows are fine and light even though I have dark hair.  </li>
            <li>If you get outside the lines, you can easily remove excess with a Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I certainly hope others are helped.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who are starting to get some gray in our brows or have light brows</li>
            <li>I love the gel but am only giving it 3 stars because the color is far from medium brown; its actually much lighter.  </li>
            <li>The brow tint was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>and I really thank you for the video.</li>
            <li>Makeup was much darker than shown.</li>
            <li>I really like the concept of having a brush for the applicator.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I really should give it a try...</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>especially when opening applicator it was light beige in color.</li>
            <li>Thanks, for asking and God Bless you and your company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way I don&#x27;t want a refund.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with this product..  </li>
            <li>Much quicker and easier than tinting  .</li>
            <li>The product in this  tube I just received was kind of dried out, still usable</li>
            <li>Definitely names me look more alive and awake.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this brush on brow tint goes on, stays on and makes my brows look natural!!!</li>
            <li>If I want a little more impact I go over them with a pencil first</li>
            <li>Mommy Makeup products are high quality and the company is very customer oriented.  </li>
            <li>I am a blond and not sure of is the right color-have bought fawn and auburn- think the brush could be more narrower</li>
            <li>Love this product and just purchased  my second one plus one for a friend - so easy to use and long lasting - it truly tops off a finished look.</li>
            <li>so the dawn really brings them out without being too heavy but that may be unusual for most redheads.  </li>
            <li>If you would shorten it up and make a full but compact short bristles brush</li>
            <li>But other than that minor thing, its a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde with brownish eyebrows that are have more of a gray tone than red or gold tones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using another similar and better known product by a big name co.  </li>
            <li>Altho, I am much older than &amp;#34;mommy&amp;#34; age.....</li>
            <li>most products are either much too light, or MUCH too dark, or just flat out the wrong color, but this one is absolutely spot-on for me, I love it!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The My Mommie products that I have ordered so far, are very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>finally have eyebrows that look full and natural, not drawn on and fake.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It was more trouble to get the dots off.</li>
            <li>Am gonna get a few more in case this gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>For eyebrows it shouldnt be so thick, a thinner brush would of been nice.</li>
            <li>Then a second light coat to smooth and tame everything into place.</li>
            <li>The blonde is too light and the red</li>
            <li>if they redesigned their brush, it&#x27;s a large mascara brush when what you need is something smaller as you are mainly using the tip to catch the hairs of the brows.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know why it is so different from my first purchase.    </li>
            <li>it did not die my brows ...and it was odd to fit in my hand</li>
            <li>after it dries I use a little hair wax to smooth the hairs</li>
            <li>Clear mascara over brows</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it looks so natural on my forehead</li>
            <li>This brow tint in Fawn looks natural for brunettes.  </li>
            <li>However all companies who use a brush consistently makes the brush too long IMO.  </li>
            <li>Have tried lots if brow makeup from Anastasia to Bobbi Brown to old mascaras.</li>
            <li>It enhances my eyebrows just enough without being too much...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too thick for eyebrows but will work OK for root touchups.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m mostly gray and have to be careful not to get my brows too dark.</li>
            <li>It might be just a bit too dark for my skin and hair color, but for the first time ever, I have brows!</li>
            <li>I had to fumble around getting 2 other colors before I found the right one.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy the universal taupes offered by most brow products and they are usually just a touch too light.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brow tint but will order the Blonde the next time as this one was a bit darker than what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It looks completely natural, and simply enhances the brow hairs that you already have.</li>
            <li>I have naturally almost black hair, but my brows are very sparse, so I chose the fawn color (I asked for it as a gift).  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too  dark (the mascara always too dark), and it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I find it looks a little better if I wipe off the applicator a little before applying it.</li>
            <li>Product worked as advertised however the deep brown color was much darker than I expected considering the name of the color.</li>
            <li>This fawn is too dark to me and really makes my eyebrows too overstated.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the color I chose is just a shade darker than my own.</li>
            <li> Fawn Color is nice for brunettes.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of the handy to use brow tint</li>
            <li> She liked it so well</li>
            <li> It was a nice way to understand the product.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find this brow tint.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on, it covers beautifully and does not smear (dries quickly)</li>
            <li> The fawn tint is perfect with my skin tone and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Since this product seems to lift and plump existing hairs, it gives the effect of of flawless full eyebrows which is great for those of us who don&#x27;t have a lot of eye brow hair due to thyroid issues, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fine-ness of the brush.  </li>
            <li> wish though, that there is one more shade lighter.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow product is so SO much better.  </li>
            <li> I simply love it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I also think it would better with a paintbrush type of applicator rather than a mascara brush.  </li>
            <li> For two years I used Lancome&#x27;s eyebrow mascara and started noticing I had more gray/white hairs that were not being covered.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> my eyebrows are beginning to get many silver hairs in them.  </li>
            <li> I am a redhead with mostly auburn hair.  </li>
            <li> And I also love dyeing them as well with Godefrey dye.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite go-to make up products.</li>
            <li> Maybe with more practice, I&#x27;d like it better</li>
            <li> Color is perfect, universal.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this brow tint.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brow tint gel.  </li>
            <li> and this may be my favorite.</li>
            <li> This product works okay -</li>
            <li> color was a pretty good match</li>
            <li> The brush is a pretty good size.</li>
            <li> I purchased the brow tint in Fawn and the coverage is great and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> So many brow products require two steps, but this is just a light brown gel that applies on the eyebrow the way mascara is used on the lashes.</li>
            <li> It takes some patience to apply but it looks great and you don&#x27;t even realize you are wearing it because it feels natural.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily at night.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and stays.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to control the brush.  </li>
            <li> Also easy to remove with cleaning cream.</li>
            <li> Mistakes are easy to correct, and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to define your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily and stays on.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a nice product, I just wish the colors were explained better so a choice was more clear.</li>
            <li> When I first used the Mommy Makeup Brow Tint, I was thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> Color is fine.</li>
            <li> This product goes on nicely and looks very natural, lasts most the day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> The first tube I purchased a few months ago  was just great and lasted very nicely.   </li>
            <li> I just love products that perform exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> and everyone said you could put it on lightly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just light brown mascara that you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li> next morning my brows looked just as great as when I applied it.</li>
            <li> also use a light colored brow pencil to fill in bald areas before hand and then finish with brow</li>
            <li> too light for me.</li>
            <li> I applied it at 7AM and lightly retouched it at 6PM because I was going out to dinner, but all of make-up needed to be retouched.</li>
            <li> This is a product I also use to color the gray hairs and smooth the hairs along my part and forehead.</li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised, the texture is good.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow makeup looks natural on my fairly sparse brows.  </li>
            <li> Framing my eyes without looking overly made up (especially in the daytime) was becoming more and more challenging.</li>
            <li> Love that I can just take a quick swipe at my brows in the morning and have a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, the brown color Fawn that I ordered is good, not too light or too dark.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, mush better than the gel I was using previously.</li>
            <li> I think this color would be great for someone with light golden blonde hair.</li>
            <li> At 68 yrs my eyebrows started turning gray and losing their original shape.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find the Mommy Makeup Brow Tint on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and a great color for dark or light brunettes.</li>
            <li> I use a Q-tip to clean off the exxtra tht get on the out side of brow</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and rarely requires a touch-up.  </li>
            <li> The tint is the right color, goes on easily and wears well.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly as advertised and the color is very true to the pictures.  </li>
            <li> and so happy I finally found a product that does exactly what it says and more![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> , then the gel, and the results are amazing, it looks natural, not like I painted my eyebrows on.</li>
            <li> Fawn color works beautifully with my med dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a natural looking product to fill-in and help my brows look nice.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly the Fawn goes well with my white hair.  </li>
            <li> This fawn shade is a true taupe...grayish brown.</li>
            <li> It holds the &amp;#34;unrulys&amp;#34; in place all day and gives nice, natural cover to my grays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shade, not too dark, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and looks real.</li>
            <li> can also color in areas to create a more full look and still keep it looking competely natural.  </li>
            <li> I do 2 light coats, really scrubbing in the first coat to get all sides of my thinning light brows.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying some more products from them!</li>
            <li> Even when I try to put it on lightly and brush it in it is too much.  </li>
            <li> This product is even better than the old Maybeline eyebrow tint I used to use.</li>
            <li> look more natural.</li>
            <li> and this one is a bigger size, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural, and the packaging is so cute.</li>
            <li> The design of the opening is unique and keeps the product from coming out with too much tint on the brush.  </li>
            <li> And the price was right.  </li>
            <li> Brushes on evenly with just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> I especially like the quality of the gel; it does not clump in the tube and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I never had red brows, just very light</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very very sparse</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for adding a more natural, darker look to your brows.</li>
            <li> Not complicated to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other &#x27;store brands&#x27; but this is absolutely my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted in eyebrow makeup.  </li>
            <li> The Fawn color looks exactly like the ad and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for eyebrows that are starting to fade and have more grays.  </li>
            <li> This stuff coats just enough to make me look like I have more brows-</li>
            <li> This is exactly the product I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also gives the appearance of lifted eyelids, just a fresher more awake look- a younger look to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first was even worse.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> Most of the lighter brow makeup has too much red in it.</li>
            <li> I bought two hoping the second would possibly be better than the first.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry super quickly, so you can wipe off a bit if you need to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I like the most is that it&#x27;s very neutral - not too chocolaty and not a touch of red in the color.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the gray brows blended in with my dark ones and grooms them nicely as well.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows are fine and light even though I have dark hair.  </li>
            <li> If you get outside the lines, you can easily remove excess with a Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I certainly hope others are helped.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who are starting to get some gray in our brows or have light brows</li>
            <li> I love the gel but am only giving it 3 stars because the color is far from medium brown; its actually much lighter.  </li>
            <li> The brow tint was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> and I really thank you for the video.</li>
            <li> Makeup was much darker than shown.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of having a brush for the applicator.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I really should give it a try...</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> especially when opening applicator it was light beige in color.</li>
            <li> Thanks, for asking and God Bless you and your company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way I don&#x27;t want a refund.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with this product..  </li>
            <li> Much quicker and easier than tinting  .</li>
            <li> The product in this  tube I just received was kind of dried out, still usable</li>
            <li> Definitely names me look more alive and awake.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this brush on brow tint goes on, stays on and makes my brows look natural!!!</li>
            <li> If I want a little more impact I go over them with a pencil first</li>
            <li> Mommy Makeup products are high quality and the company is very customer oriented.  </li>
            <li> I am a blond and not sure of is the right color-have bought fawn and auburn- think the brush could be more narrower</li>
            <li> Love this product and just purchased  my second one plus one for a friend - so easy to use and long lasting - it truly tops off a finished look.</li>
            <li> so the dawn really brings them out without being too heavy but that may be unusual for most redheads.  </li>
            <li> If you would shorten it up and make a full but compact short bristles brush</li>
            <li> But other than that minor thing, its a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with brownish eyebrows that are have more of a gray tone than red or gold tones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another similar and better known product by a big name co.  </li>
            <li> Altho, I am much older than &amp;#34;mommy&amp;#34; age.....</li>
            <li> most products are either much too light, or MUCH too dark, or just flat out the wrong color, but this one is absolutely spot-on for me, I love it!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The My Mommie products that I have ordered so far, are very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> finally have eyebrows that look full and natural, not drawn on and fake.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It was more trouble to get the dots off.</li>
            <li> Am gonna get a few more in case this gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> For eyebrows it shouldnt be so thick, a thinner brush would of been nice.</li>
            <li> Then a second light coat to smooth and tame everything into place.</li>
            <li> The blonde is too light and the red</li>
            <li> if they redesigned their brush, it&#x27;s a large mascara brush when what you need is something smaller as you are mainly using the tip to catch the hairs of the brows.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know why it is so different from my first purchase.    </li>
            <li> it did not die my brows ...and it was odd to fit in my hand</li>
            <li> after it dries I use a little hair wax to smooth the hairs</li>
            <li> Clear mascara over brows</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it looks so natural on my forehead</li>
            <li> This brow tint in Fawn looks natural for brunettes.  </li>
            <li> However all companies who use a brush consistently makes the brush too long IMO.  </li>
            <li> Have tried lots if brow makeup from Anastasia to Bobbi Brown to old mascaras.</li>
            <li> It enhances my eyebrows just enough without being too much...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too thick for eyebrows but will work OK for root touchups.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m mostly gray and have to be careful not to get my brows too dark.</li>
            <li> It might be just a bit too dark for my skin and hair color, but for the first time ever, I have brows!</li>
            <li> I had to fumble around getting 2 other colors before I found the right one.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy the universal taupes offered by most brow products and they are usually just a touch too light.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brow tint but will order the Blonde the next time as this one was a bit darker than what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It looks completely natural, and simply enhances the brow hairs that you already have.</li>
            <li> I have naturally almost black hair, but my brows are very sparse, so I chose the fawn color (I asked for it as a gift).  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too  dark (the mascara always too dark), and it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I find it looks a little better if I wipe off the applicator a little before applying it.</li>
            <li> Product worked as advertised however the deep brown color was much darker than I expected considering the name of the color.</li>
            <li> This fawn is too dark to me and really makes my eyebrows too overstated.  </li>
            <li> I have totally white hair and my eyebrows are nearly all white as well which is not pretty.  </li>
            <li> 61 yr old who had dark brown hair and brows.</li>
            <li> I have used the Merle Norman version in the past, and this is very comparable.</li>
            <li> Use it and forget it, it&#x27;s so long lasting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how long a tube lasts , if that is an issue I will revise my feedback.  </li>
            <li> but it does not go on  as it should and won&#x27;t last very long because it is so dry.</li>
            <li> I will be re-ordering this as long as it is produced.</li>
            <li> use it everyday so far</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a super obvious effect, but it definitely adds polish.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried them all short of &#x27;Anastasia&#x27; brand which I&#x27;m not interested in.  </li>
            <li> However after applying and allowing to dry, I was amazed with the results.</li>
            <li> the color is thick and you have to be careful not to apply to much  </li>
            <li> I was really bummed and have been using mascara which really was hard to put it without it being too thick and too dark.  </li>
            <li> No more plucking out gray eyebrow hairs because this produce covers them completely.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing special about this product, plus I find the name annoying.</li>
            <li> Gives just enough tint to the few grey hairs in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find tinted brow gel that doesn&#x27;t look too much or too heavy for blonds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit darker than I expected.  </li>
            <li> it will smear when wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different versions of products like this</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to control application then I expected.</li>
            <li> It is far too thick at one end which results in a blob when it is applied at the beginning of the eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> I have dark drown hair, and black, (what&#x27;s left, of them)&lt;br /&gt;eyebrows</li>
            <li> There is also likely to be less waste at the end of the product&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I thought I&#x27;d give this a try</li>
            <li> just not right...</li>
            <li> When I first received it I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> I also have dark brown eyes</li>
            <li> This brow color tint is not too dark.....</li>
            <li> it looks like a mascara brush, big thick and all.</li>
            <li> what shade I needed as she was on her cell phone walking down the street in Manhattan.  </li>
            <li> I think I expected it to tame my brows as well as color them</li>
            <li> I have off black hair</li>
            <li> The colors are not what I expected and it is difficult to apply for natural looking results</li>
            <li> It coats every little hair.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the brush was a little shorter in length.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it fits my needs.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few brow products (I prefer a brush rather than a pencil)</li>
            <li> I wanted something to cover up the few gray hairs in my brows.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, almost barely there eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I found it to be waxy and very difficult to apply without it looking like I took a crayon and drew on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I feel like spending another $20 to find out if the blond would work for me or not.  </li>
            <li> No one had ever told me to expect my eyebrows to go gray and thin as I aged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pencils, waxes with powders, and mascara in the past...</li>
            <li> Not sure they are making it anymore,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review cosmetic items, but as a redhead finding things like eyebrow gel is often an exercise in futility...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bobby Brown, but that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> But, alas, the product is not that color.  </li>
            <li> It makes my thin brows appear fuller</li>
            <li> I have very blonde eyebrows and hate the look of pencil as it looks like I drew them on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am SO tired of buying &amp; returning brow products that fail me in some way.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, in that I was hoping it would not leave little thick dots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed.  </li>
            <li> Pencils look painted on and artificial.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have bought this product before  it does not go on as the video states in her simple manner the color is thick and you have to be careful not to apply to much  I use a Q-tip to clean off the exxtra tht get on the out side of brow I am a blond and not sure of is the right color-have bought fawn and auburn- think the brush could be more narrower</li>
            <li> Hard to find tinted brow gel that doesn&#x27;t look too much or too heavy for blonds. This works very well.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Like the color. Stays on well. Not complicated to use.</li>
            <li> So loving this tinted gel! So many brow products require two steps, but this is just a light brown gel that applies on the eyebrow the way mascara is used on the lashes. It looks completely natural, and simply enhances the brow hairs that you already have.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for. At 68 yrs my eyebrows started turning gray and losing their original shape. I have tried dye, which does not last and does not help the shaping. Pencils look painted on and artificial. I have tried 3 other &#x27;store brands&#x27; but this is absolutely my favorite! So happy I found it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are fine and light even though I have dark hair.  I am constantly looking for products to make them looks darker and thicker but not over-done.  This works really well.  I love the fine-ness of the brush.  It coats every little hair.  The fawn color goes great with my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted in eyebrow makeup.  Just wish the brush was a little shorter in length.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Oh my! this is really, really good!  I can&#x27;t believe it looks so natural on my forehead, it&#x27;s like I have my teenage grade eyebrows back again.&lt;br /&gt;I wish though, that there is one more shade lighter. This one, although it looks natural, and as I expected the color to be, is still a bit darker for my skin and hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with brownish eyebrows that are have more of a gray tone than red or gold tones.  From the picture on Amazon, the Fawn color looked like it might be the gray-brown I needed.  But, alas, the product is not that color.  Plus, I found it tended to smear a bit.  I will probably be returning it.</li>
            <li> Great thing works well</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product.   The first tube I purchased a few months ago  was just great and lasted very nicely.   The product in this  tube I just received was kind of dried out, still usable but it does not go on  as it should and won&#x27;t last very long because it is so dry. I must add that the tube was sealed and had never been opened so I don&#x27;t know why it is so different from my first purchase.    The 1st tube was a 5 star, this one is not.   Marti</li>
            <li> So easy to use and looks real. If you never got the hang of using the eyebrow pencil then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way.  I love it!</li>
            <li> For those of us who are starting to get some gray in our brows or have light brows Mommy Makeup Brow Tint works fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day and the color I chose is just a shade darker than my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another similar and better known product by a big name co.  This eyebrow product is so SO much better.  I simply love it.  Use it and forget it, it&#x27;s so long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love the gel but am only giving it 3 stars because the color is far from medium brown; its actually much lighter.  I think this color would be great for someone with light golden blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This does exactly as advertised and the color is very true to the pictures.  Lots of products will profess to last all day, but this one REALY does.  Will order this again.</li>
            <li> The Fawn color looks exactly like the ad and was exactly what I was looking for.  It is easy to use and rarely requires a touch-up.  No issues with it when I get rained on.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how long a tube lasts , if that is an issue I will revise my feedback.  Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for eyebrows that are starting to fade and have more grays.  Washes off easily at night.  Fawn color works beautifully with my med dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> this brow tint is really good. Fawn Color is nice for brunettes. Only thing I wish was different is the brush. it looks like a mascara brush, big thick and all. For eyebrows it shouldnt be so thick, a thinner brush would of been nice. But other than that minor thing, its a good product. A little goes along way. After I swipe a bit on I brish it out with an eyebrow comb/brush. it stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this color because I couldn&#x27;t decide between it and the blond and everyone said you could put it on lightly.  This fawn is too dark to me and really makes my eyebrows too overstated.  You can&#x27;t wipe it off and have it look even.  Even when I try to put it on lightly and brush it in it is too much.  I&#x27;m not sure I feel like spending another $20 to find out if the blond would work for me or not.  I also think it would better with a paintbrush type of applicator rather than a mascara brush.  It seems to be a nice product, I just wish the colors were explained better so a choice was more clear.</li>
            <li> color was a pretty good match but it didn&#x27;t last as long as expected. I like the convenience of the handy to use brow tint..works well on those pesky grays!</li>
            <li> The brow tint was everything I expected and more. The design of the opening is unique and keeps the product from coming out with too much tint on the brush.  This makes the application easier.</li>
            <li> You need to update your wand. It is far too thick at one end which results in a blob when it is applied at the beginning of the eyebrow.  Color is good.</li>
            <li> For two years I used Lancome&#x27;s eyebrow mascara and started noticing I had more gray/white hairs that were not being covered.  After reading other reviews I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  No more plucking out gray eyebrow hairs because this produce covers them completely. It also helps keep unruly brows in place. I bought the color fawn and it worked well for me, my eyebrows are brown (on the darker side).  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it fits my needs. It goes on easy and stays. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s a good shade, not too dark, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this brush on brow tint goes on, stays on and makes my brows look natural!!!</li>
            <li> Would be easier to apply if they redesigned their brush, it&#x27;s a large mascara brush when what you need is something smaller as you are mainly using the tip to catch the hairs of the brows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m what u would call &amp;#34;brow challenged&amp;#34; ! This stuff coats just enough to make me look like I have more brows- after it dries I use a little hair wax to smooth the hairs and I&#x27;m all set to go</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.  I must say I use a smaller brush so I don&#x27;t overdo my eyebrows but it doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and a great color for dark or light brunettes. It applies easily and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I like it!  It might be just a bit too dark for my skin and hair color, but for the first time ever, I have brows!</li>
            <li> my eyebrows are beginning to get many silver hairs in them.  Altho, I am much older than &amp;#34;mommy&amp;#34; age.....this works great for me. Once it&#x27;s on, it covers beautifully and does not smear (dries quickly)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I found it to be waxy and very difficult to apply without it looking like I took a crayon and drew on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I had to fumble around getting 2 other colors before I found the right one.  I like the fawn the best.  I am a redhead with mostly auburn hair.  The blonde is too light and the red just not right... I never had red brows, just very light so the dawn really brings them out without being too heavy but that may be unusual for most redheads.  I also have dark brown eyes so I can pull it off.  Highly recommend this product!  And I also love dyeing them as well with Godefrey dye.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I just love products that perform exactly as advertised! No one had ever told me to expect my eyebrows to go gray and thin as I aged. Framing my eyes without looking overly made up (especially in the daytime) was becoming more and more challenging. This brow tint has solved my morning crisis (lol). The fawn tint is perfect with my skin tone and looks very natural. Because of the brush &amp; dispenser design, there is no clumping. There is also likely to be less waste at the end of the product&#x27;s life. I will be ordering the next darker shade for evening use.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the product I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Gives just enough tint to the few grey hairs in my eyebrows.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, or run if you swim or sweat.  And the price was right.  I did some comparisons and decided to take a chance and so glad I did.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair with greying eyebrows. I purchased the brow tint in Fawn and the coverage is great and very natural looking. I really like this product and am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few brow products (I prefer a brush rather than a pencil) and this is the best yet.  It makes my thin brows appear fuller and it&#x27;s easy to control the brush.  Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> However this will be my third order of it.  So hopefully lives up to what I&#x27;m currently using.  It&#x27;s just perfect.  Keeps the gray brows blended in with my dark ones and grooms them nicely as well.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite go-to make up products.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to cover up the few gray hairs in my brows.  Maybe with more practice, I&#x27;d like it better but it&#x27;s too thick for eyebrows but will work OK for root touchups.</li>
            <li> Best product of all I&#x27;ve tried.  I will stick with this brand; forget the rest. Clear mascara over brows it makes the tint last all day.</li>
            <li> This brow tint in Fawn looks natural for brunettes.  It takes some patience to apply but it looks great and you don&#x27;t even realize you are wearing it because it feels natural.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I could find that covers the white hair on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My daughter came to visit and found it.  She liked it so well, we had to buy another.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use the product yet but the service was terrific and I really thank you for the video. It was a nice way to understand the product.</li>
            <li> I finally found the product I had been looking for. This product is even better than the old Maybeline eyebrow tint I used to use.</li>
            <li> Works great on eyebrows to cover gray and stays on. Have bought 3x now.</li>
            <li> Love this product and just purchased  my second one plus one for a friend - so easy to use and long lasting - it truly tops off a finished look. thank you!😄🎉</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit darker than I expected.  I&#x27;m not really impressed.  It&#x27;s just light brown mascara that you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li> Have used different products of this type........this one actually works. I applied it as soon as I got it in the mail......it lasted not only all day, but that night I cleansed my face but did not touch my eyebrows.......next morning my brows looked just as great as when I applied it. Also easy to remove with cleaning cream.</li>
            <li> Makeup was much darker than shown.</li>
            <li> it is basically mascara you put on your eyebrows.  i like it, once you get the hang of applying with tip in sparse places and brush to thickin/darken brow hair it works great.  it will smear when wet just so you know. will not tint hair just washes off.  i recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pencils, waxes with powders, and mascara in the past...this is the BEST product ever!  I have naturally almost black hair, but my brows are very sparse, so I chose the fawn color (I asked for it as a gift).  Perfect!  I will be re-ordering this as long as it is produced. Mistakes are easy to correct, and it doesn&#x27;t sweat off.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat purchaser.  I especially like the quality of the gel; it does not clump in the tube and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> For the cost, does not do any different than regular mascara, did not care for it, will search for something else.</li>
            <li> Color is perfect, universal.  I really like the concept of having a brush for the applicator.  However all companies who use a brush consistently makes the brush too long IMO.  If you would shorten it up and make a full but compact short bristles brush I think you&#x27;d be on the track to a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO tired of buying &amp; returning brow products that fail me in some way.  I think I&#x27;ve tried them all short of &#x27;Anastasia&#x27; brand which I&#x27;m not interested in.  Maybe I really should give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this one again.  And If you use my idea/suggestion above, please don&#x27;t forget who gave the idea to you.  That would be,&lt;br /&gt;Susan C Hester&lt;br /&gt;shester24@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this brow tint. My eyebrows are very very sparse and I was looking for a natural looking product to fill-in and help my brows look nice. This product definitely does the job for me. I really like it. I have off black hair and I ordered the fawn tint. When I first received it I was a little skeptical especially when opening applicator it was light beige in color. However after applying and allowing to dry, I was amazed with the results. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow tint but will order the Blonde the next time as this one was a bit darker than what I wanted.  Mommy Makeup products are high quality and the company is very customer oriented.  I actually spoke with the owner of the company this week about a different product and what shade I needed as she was on her cell phone walking down the street in Manhattan.  Now that&#x27;s service !!!!</li>
            <li> this works well for the price would recommend and buy again, works for me I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt; use it everyday so far</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brow tint gel.  I have very thin, almost barely there eyebrows.  This brow tint seems to plump up your existing eyebrows while adding a touch of color to them.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to define your eyebrows.  If you get outside the lines, you can easily remove excess with a Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a light colored brow pencil to fill in bald areas before hand and then finish with brow tint.&lt;br /&gt;I finally have eyebrows that look full and natural, not drawn on and fake.&lt;br /&gt;You can also color in areas to create a more full look and still keep it looking competely natural.  Since this product seems to lift and plump existing hairs, it gives the effect of of flawless full eyebrows which is great for those of us who don&#x27;t have a lot of eye brow hair due to thyroid issues, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It also gives the appearance of lifted eyelids, just a fresher more awake look- a younger look to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I am a customer for life now and so happy I finally found a product that does exactly what it says and more![[ASIN:B000J2652Q Mommy Makeup Brow Tint - Blond]]</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find the Mommy Makeup Brow Tint on Amazon.  I have totally white hair and my eyebrows are nearly all white as well which is not pretty.  I used to use a Maybelline Eyebrow color gel and it was discontinued.  I was really bummed and have been using mascara which really was hard to put it without it being too thick and too dark.  When I first used the Mommy Makeup Brow Tint, I was thrilled with the results.  Surprisingly the Fawn goes well with my white hair.  It isn&#x27;t too  dark (the mascara always too dark), and it is so easy to use.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!! I have very blonde eyebrows and hate the look of pencil as it looks like I drew them on. This product goes on nicely and looks very natural, lasts most the day and washes off easily. Highly recommend for adding a more natural, darker look to your brows.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, in that I was hoping it would not leave little thick dots&lt;br /&gt;but look more natural. It was more trouble to get the dots off.I probably will never use a brow tint again. The first was even worse.&lt;br /&gt;However, I certainly hope others are helped. Thanks, for asking and God Bless you and your company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way I don&#x27;t want a refund. you can give it to an orphanage foundation this is your choice.</li>
            <li> I am visually paired and can&#x27;t see well enough to use brow pencils. Have tried lots if brow makeup from Anastasia to Bobbi Brown to old mascaras. This one in the fawn color is great for me. I am a graying 61 yr old who had dark brown hair and brows. Now I&#x27;m mostly gray and have to be careful not to get my brows too dark. Don&#x27;t want that clown look. Most of the lighter brow makeup has too much red in it. This fawn shade is a true taupe...grayish brown. I do 2 light coats, really scrubbing in the first coat to get all sides of my thinning light brows. Then a second light coat to smooth and tame everything into place. Does not dry super quickly, so you can wipe off a bit if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was considering brow tattoos, but now don&#x27;t have to. Am gonna get a few more in case this gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> The Mommy Makeup Brow Tint works great.  I only gave it 4 stars because the applicator brush is too big.  I use a slant tip eye brow brush to apply it for an easier application.  It is a great product, mush better than the gel I was using previously.</li>
            <li> it did not die my brows ...and it was odd to fit in my hand poppy  it was a good price  but so what/</li>
            <li> Product worked as advertised however the deep brown color was much darker than I expected considering the name of the color.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve used a few different versions of products like this and this may be my favorite. I never heard of this brand, so I was hesitant. I&#x27;ve used Bobby Brown, but that&#x27;s hard to find. Not sure they are making it anymore, and this one is a bigger size, which is nice. It&#x27;s very easy to use, the brown color Fawn that I ordered is good, not too light or too dark. The brush is a pretty good size. It&#x27;s a fairly big brush. I&#x27;d prefer it just a tiny bit smaller, but I&#x27;m being picky. Keeps brows in place. If you&#x27;re looking for this type of product, I think this is a good one to try.</li>
            <li> The My Mommie products that I have ordered so far, are very good.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised, the texture is good. On this color, it&lt;br /&gt;was too light for me. I have dark drown hair, and black, (what&#x27;s left, of them)&lt;br /&gt;eyebrows</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Have recommended it to others. This brow color tint is not too dark.....you can make it darker by applying several times.  Will continue to buy this int he future.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find this brow tint. I look younger when I use it.  I have been looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as expected. I applied it at 7AM and lightly retouched it at 6PM because I was going out to dinner, but all of make-up needed to be retouched. I have used the Merle Norman version in the past, and this is very comparable. This is a product I also use to color the gray hairs and smooth the hairs along my part and forehead. It holds the &amp;#34;unrulys&amp;#34; in place all day and gives nice, natural cover to my grays. Great product, great price. Will definitly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with this product..  I bought two hoping the second would possibly be better than the first.  The colors are not what I expected and it is difficult to apply for natural looking results</li>
            <li> Great product!  Goes on easily and stays on. Definitely names me look more alive and awake.Much quicker and easier than tinting  .</li>
            <li> great color and application</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review cosmetic items, but as a redhead finding things like eyebrow gel is often an exercise in futility... most products are either much too light, or MUCH too dark, or just flat out the wrong color, but this one is absolutely spot-on for me, I love it!  It enhances my eyebrows just enough without being too much... it&#x27;s not a super obvious effect, but it definitely adds polish.  If I want a little more impact I go over them with a pencil first, then the gel, and the results are amazing, it looks natural, not like I painted my eyebrows on.</li>
            <li> Love this brow tint! Looks so natural, and the packaging is so cute. Will definitely be buying some more products from them!</li>
            <li> This eyebrow makeup looks natural on my fairly sparse brows.  The color that I picked, Fawn is close to the color of my brows, and the makeup fills up the spaces well.  I find it looks a little better if I wipe off the applicator a little before applying it.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyebrow gel that actually perfectly matches.  My hair is medium brown with lots of gray around my face, and my sparse brows are a tad bit darker.  I usually buy the universal taupes offered by most brow products and they are usually just a touch too light.  This Faun is a perfect happy medium between taupe and brunette.  It would probably work for blonds that have brown brows as well.  What I like the most is that it&#x27;s very neutral - not too chocolaty and not a touch of red in the color.  Love that I can just take a quick swipe at my brows in the morning and have a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> This brow tint works great. Brushes on evenly with just the right amount of color.</li>
            <li> The tint is the right color, goes on easily and wears well.  Provide the coverage necessary and lasts throughout evening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to control application then I expected. Color is fine.</li>
            <li> This product works okay - but I don&#x27;t know what possessed me to buy an $18 mascara, but I did. I think I expected it to tame my brows as well as color them But my plan in the future is to buy a $4 brown mascara at the grocery store. There&#x27;s really nothing special about this product, plus I find the name annoying.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Looks great.  Good price. Delivery arrived on time as indicated at ordering.  I&#x27;ll buy from this site again.</li>
