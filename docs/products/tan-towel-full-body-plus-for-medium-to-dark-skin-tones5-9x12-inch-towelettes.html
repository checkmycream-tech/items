            <li>I can put it on in the morning and have a wonderful glow several hours later.</li>
            <li>Easier to apply than lotions and dries quickly.  </li>

            <li> Not sure why these are so different from fhe ones I ordered from hsn</li>
            <li> I would not use any other self tanner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with the other review about the size.</li>
            <li> Your skin does not get &amp;#34;The Orange Glow&amp;#34; like other self-tanners give......</li>
            <li> I am average size, and one did my legs/abd., and chest.</li>
            <li> I had the dark formula.  </li>
            <li> so they stay as dark as the rest of me.  </li>
            <li> They do not give you an orange look like a LOT of other that claim they don&#x27;t DO!  </li>
            <li> I use one every other week!</li>
            <li> This may have been because the skin was a little rougher/drier.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tan towels for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Creams and sprays are messy and streaky.  </li>
            <li> kinda waiting for a few days off work (just in case).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not huge either.  </li>
            <li> For reference I am a brunette with olive undertones to my skin and can tan well but get pale in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I do think the color has a slight orange tint, but not enough to keep me from using them,and there was a faint smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Least smelly and messy of all the brands i have tried.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> it took 1 time to see a small result.</li>
            <li> so not really a good deal.  </li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about trying these I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These towels are great, no streaking or smell. Good fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love these towels. They cover the entire body and provide a nice, sensible tan for those of us in the Midwest who cannot count on the sun!</li>
            <li> I am VERY fair-skinned; completely unable to get a natural tan.  These towels are easy to use and give me a very natural color.  I have been using them for a couple of years now and LOVE them.</li>
            <li> The best thing ever this Tan Towel really works.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t take that much sun like i use too, So after searching for something that makes me tan this was the best by far the best. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to apply and the tan looks great, wish it would last a little longer but otherwise very happy w the product</li>
            <li> I love this !! I have been a devout sun worshiper my entire life!! I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to use this product as a healthy alternative so that I don&#x27;t look like a wrinkled up old prune at 50 years old!! Better git while the gittens good the way I see it!! ;)</li>
            <li> Nice product to fill in between tanning</li>
            <li> These towels are great because there are white/clear and there is no brown stains left behind anywhere and no fake tan smell!  In addition to this the tan it gives you is just as if you went to a tanning salon.  Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with all the hype over these wipes. I used exactly as instructed however still ended up with a few missed spots and orange looking feet. I also think you need to use two or you end up using most of the moist towel before you finish entire body it dries up. This left parts of my body darker than others. Much better results with other products.</li>
            <li> My wife loves them and will purchase more.  What more can I say.  Safer than a tanning booth.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair/freckley skin and I still recommend using the tan towels for medium-dark skin if you want to see significant results. The color is perfect, not orange. Lasts for a few days.  Just make sure you thoroughly wash your hands; scrub around your palms, between your fingers, on your knuckles.</li>
            <li> This gives just the right color tan. Does not streak. Least smelly and messy of all the brands i have tried. Travels well. Life time customer here!</li>
            <li> Tan towels are great. And they are mark fair to med or med to dark skin tones. The med/dark give me great color.. BUT NOT THESE. They are not marked anything when you get them and are NOT THE MED DARK. I used 3 towels in 2 days and It&#x27;s not even the color I get from the regular fair to med towels. Not sure why these are so different from fhe ones I ordered from hsn but I&#x27;ll never buy them from Amazon vendors again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tan towels for a few years now. It gives me a pretty natural looking color. My only gripe is that once in a while, despite my care, I get streaks.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It covers without streaks, and looks very natural. I can put it on in the morning and have a wonderful glow several hours later. If I want to go darker, I can reapply. I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li> Tan Towels were recommended to me by one of my friends.  I have been using it for two years and it is by far the best tanning product on the market.  Creams and sprays are messy and streaky.  When used with instructions, you will get an even tan with no mess and absolutely no smell.    This product deserves five stars!    Denise  6/24/10</li>
            <li> I used the same towels a year of so ago.  They worked better then.  The body towel does not cover the body.  You have to use at least 2, 3 is better. I am not huge either.  1 and half used to work for me back when I started using them.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years after I saw what a natural looking tan my friend had - I asked her where she went on vaca - she said it was TanTowels!  I tried them immediately after that and have been using them for almost 5 years now.  They do not give you an orange look like a LOT of other that claim they don&#x27;t DO!  Just be sure to wash the palms of your hands after application.  I prefer the larger towels, the smaller ones don&#x27;t cover much &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> Thank you for the Tan Towels.  They do work well.  I&#x27;m too old to be in the sun in a swimsuit.</li>
            <li> This got five stars easily.  The towels help to the product to spread smoothly.  I have been using this product for a couple of years and no streaking.  I am pretty thorough with going over ankles and other &amp;#34;trouble areas&amp;#34; that could streak.  I get a nice even glow.  For reference I am a brunette with olive undertones to my skin and can tan well but get pale in the winter.  This products is a but pricier than other towels but gives a better result.</li>
            <li> Work great! I&#x27;m a \\&quot;sunless tanning junky\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much year round, tried them all! Some good, some suck..,., this is a good one!</li>
            <li> These towelettes create an natural looking tan better than any other sunless product that I&#x27;ve tried.  Easier to apply than lotions and dries quickly.  Have not noticed any ruboff on any of my clothing.  This product is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> being tan all year around is a blessing. I even have my husband using it now. I am indulging in an expense hobby</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE TAN TOWELS!!  Very natural looking tan.  I&#x27;ve used them for two years and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Easy to use and the tanning results look very natural.</li>
            <li> been using these tan towels for several years.  I cannot go out in the sun for long periods so only way I can get a &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  I would recommend these and the fair to medium ones without a doubt.</li>
            <li> not as good as I hoped it would be.  had to use two packs for one application.  so not really a good deal.  thought it would cover much better than indicated.</li>
            <li> Tan Towels are the BEST!  I use 1 Full body towel for my upper body and 1 Full Body towel for my lower body before going to the beach and it gives me a great natural tan that lasts for about 5 days.  Just remember to exfoliate your feet and ankles well before use.</li>
            <li> I have used several self tanners, and this is by far the best. I followed instructions to the letter! I did not have any streaking, but did see the color grab a little more just above heel, and side of foot (just above arch). The knee area was very natural. This may have been because the skin was a little rougher/drier. I did exfoliate really well before using the towels. I do think the color has a slight orange tint, but not enough to keep me from using them,and there was a faint smell.&lt;br /&gt; These body towels would not do your whole body...I am average size, and one did my legs/abd., and chest. I did two applications the same night. I did one let it dry (dries very quick) waited ~ five hrs, and did second application. I waited ~ 5 mins went to bed, and woke up with a really good looking tan. I have not seen any rubbing off on bed linen or clothes. I have not used on my face yet....kinda waiting for a few days off work (just in case).&lt;br /&gt;I got mine from HSN and paid a much higher price....double to be exact! I will be buying my next ones from here! I still think they are priced a little high...thus my 4 star rating. If you are on the fence about trying these I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry. I would not use any other self tanner.</li>
            <li> Tan towels are fantastic!! I have a darker skin tone and this color is amazing.I don&#x27;t agree with the other review about the size. They are plenty big - an more than enough to do your whole body. The item arrived quickly and at a great price!! Thanks and will be ordering again...</li>
            <li> First of all, this is called full body.  I could barely cover with 2 towels.  I am 6&#x27;0\\&quot; and 210#, so I am far from enormous.  Second of all, the directions say you need to re-apply 2 - 3 times a week.  This means, that this 6 pack is only good for a week!!!!!!!!  What a ripoff!!  I had the dark formula.  I am very pasty white, and did not notice much of a change, anyway.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> theses r the best way 2 get a safe natural lookin tan, i love this product .uv got 2 try it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two years and everyone always compliments me on my tan!  Much better price here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Such a great product, easily applied, great coverage, no streaking.... Your skin does not get &amp;#34;The Orange Glow&amp;#34; like other self-tanners give......not so sure about being able to use one tan towel two to three times though.....Full body towels seem to work better for me than the half body style. I&#x27;m not a big girl but the full body towel gives me better all over coverage.  I think tan towel is a great product and will continue to use, as I am a sun person and have tanned for years...This product gives me a great tan applied at night and wake up with a nice color..  The greatest thing about tan towel is that anyone can easily use and apply without streaking.&lt;br /&gt;A Very Good Product !  Thanks for great service Amazon....it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> it took 1 time to see a small result. over several uses you do see a gradual tanning on skin. however it does smell as the day progresses and tends to be kind of sticky</li>
            <li> One day I was visiting my friend and noticed she had some great color. We were leaving for vacation and I asked her if she went tanning (I was about to lecture her on the dangers of it since I use to work in a tanning salon). To my surprise she told me about tan towels and how fast they were. I didn&#x27;t need the proof if they worked, I saw it right on her skin when I went to pick her up. Working in an office, it&#x27;s hard to get as much sunlight as I use to when I was in college, so this was the perfect, safe and affordable alternative. The price you can&#x27;t beat and shipping is lighting fast!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have referred it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> Love these and the price was very good</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with no streaking or different colored patches.  For me the color only lasts about 3 days.  Unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t make you more than 2- 3 shades darker.</li>
            <li> I have used these towels for 5 years. They work better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. When you follow the instructions!  Be sure to wash your hands well after using them, between your fingers and finger nails. You turn a nice brown with no orange.</li>
            <li> Beat self tan I&#x27;ve used yet!!</li>
            <li> been using  this for  3 yrs now .... great color with no odor!!</li>
            <li> I started using these towels when I quit going to the tanning salon.  They work great!  I start in the spring and get just dark enough that I don&#x27;t burn the bejeezus out of myself when I first get in the sun.  I also use them on my legs after I shave so they stay as dark as the rest of me.  The smaller towelettes are great, too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Not orange color , just golden tan and takes the edge off my Lilly white legs. Better than sun damage and my dermatologist supports using them! I use one every other week!</li>
            <li> I use them all over my body and it does show a good tan.  Would use these rather than go tanning.  Been using them for awhile now and have to complaints.</li>
