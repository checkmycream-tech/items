            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased at how the package was shipped as it wasn&#x27;t damaged in any way..</li>
            <li>they are nice.  </li>
            <li>This is also nice for experimenting with blending colors.</li>
            <li>Using your fingers to warm up and apply the product would also work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice if you just want to add gloss.</li>
            <li>reason why I rated this palette 4 stars is because all of the colors are wearable in their own way and they are nice colors.</li>
            <li>#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of deal.</li>
            <li>shades showed nicely all the Rogers a bust.</li>
            <li>I love how there is so many color variations to choose from!</li>
            <li>I think this is an ideal set for someone wanting to learn what colors are best on them, as its an easy mix and match set, including a pure white to mix with.</li>
            <li>There are kits with more colors</li>
            <li>but I know I will run out of the colors I like the most.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, it just takes someone with a bit more experience or knowledge of the art of makeup to realise these faults before the occur.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Many colors gave off a coral tint.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are shimmery, but there are some mattes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Descent lip gloss for the price, needs more pigmentation.</li>
            <li>ok I guess.</li>
            <li>I would probably buy more as gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li>and I just love it..</li>
            <li>all the colors are very wearable and the price is great..</li>
            <li>Also, love the variety of colors, as I like to mix them up for a cuter color.</li>
            <li>So many colors etc.</li>
            <li>Not one of my favorite items.</li>
            <li>Good for makeup artist to use.. quick and easy...</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for someone who wants to experiment with makeup without spending too much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ideally, I think this set is great for beginning make up artists and those looking to find new colors that suit them without breaking the bank on countless lipsticks.</li>
            <li>yes i do clean my lipstick brush!</li>
            <li>Other than that, i love the gloss palette!!!!!</li>
            <li>Good, was looking for something that would match my skin tone and this fit very well.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this palette, these colors are very pigmented very shiny, smooth &amp; makes lips feel great not sticky.</li>
            <li>It did not come with an ingredient list, but based on its scent and texture, I&#x27;m assuming its primary ingredient is petrolatum.</li>
            <li>Even if it was free I would toss it</li>
            <li>Case is fine, the lip stick is very colorful, lots of nice shades, no mess.</li>
            <li>Love the lip color palette little smuchier than I thought but it works great  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost all of the colors are sheer, but with most colors you can layer the product to achieve a more opaque look.</li>
            <li>I only wish all colors were more opaque and that there was more of a variety of colors, like reds and plums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid Petroleum jelly user and the scent and texture was instantly familiar to me;</li>
            <li>Plenty of colorful options and each color</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good value for the price, considering one tube of lipstick or gloss costs twice as much.</li>
            <li>i would not buy this again, but had fun with it.</li>
            <li>I was anxious to get this set and thought it would be great.</li>
            <li>It was very reasonable for the price</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, it&#x27;s versatile, fantastic and fun!</li>
            <li>came earlier than expected, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this order!</li>
            <li>That shows how much they care About customers satisfaction!</li>
            <li>I apply them with a lip brush,  but I swirl the brush into the pot and mix the color up first.</li>
            <li>you just like to play with makeup, this product would most likely satisfy your needs.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>That said, it seems like these lip butters are pretty moisturizing</li>
            <li>and I love their sheer, buttery, glossy texture.</li>
            <li>Cute colors, but very sheer.</li>
            <li>and I can keep going in to check it and apply more if necessary.</li>
            <li>SSome of the shades were so light they ended up looking clear not pigmented.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long but good if you just want a variety of colors</li>
            <li>Purchased for my mother who loves to paint her lips and she is very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>Overall, I do enjoy this lip palette.</li>
            <li>For this price, I got a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>I really like all the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tote it around with you</li>
            <li>Anyway, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>The colors show very well and hold very well</li>
            <li>but I wear lip color mainly with business dress, so I don&#x27;t need whacky fashion colors.</li>
            <li>The colors go on light but your lips are left soft and mositurized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap product, good for young girls, but it doesn&#x27;t really last long enough to use daily, maybe just if you are in your house.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;ll just be smearing the dried top layer and not get any product on the brush.</li>
            <li>The colors are very sheer, kind of like those lip gloss things they make for little kids.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s not much you can do about it, namely the top row and one or two others individual colors.</li>
            <li>They do not stay on too long and do transfer to cups or bottles when you drink  - pretty fast.</li>
            <li>, I keep one in my desk drawer at work for quick touch ups, and the other stays at home.  </li>
            <li>Colors were very diff, not off, but different colors.</li>
            <li>Of course, they are small, but enough for me:) they have lasted quite a while already.</li>
            <li>I got the chance to try a few different colors and see if I should invest in another better brand similar color.  </li>
            <li>Sorry, but this is as honest as I can get.</li>
            <li>The glosses are shimmery, I usually go for complete matte finishes, but if you really like shimmery lip gloss</li>
            <li>These are really glossy and do not leave my lips feeling dry or irritable like some other brands do.  </li>

            <li> The white, light pinks, and nude colors have little to no color and are hard to build up the product.</li>
            <li> All the lipsticks are small, there is no applicator and the whole result</li>
            <li> And its not darker colors at all..its like clear with a little bit of color..</li>
            <li> Of course, it doesn&#x27;t last a long time on your lips, but hey, what&#x27;s what is expected.</li>
            <li> It was dry and cracked up.</li>
            <li> They would be considered sheer lipsticks and a few of them are only glosses.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any dark browns and doesn&#x27;t look like that color can be mixed.</li>
            <li> It arrived long before the expected date too.  </li>
            <li> I definitely need a lipstick application brush, as this is not very easy to use with fingers</li>
            <li> Only thing is, when u open it, it kinda smells like a NEW smell or some type of chemicals, also i believe they sent the wrong palette.</li>
            <li> They sent it way faster than I expected so that was a bonus.</li>
            <li> The pinks are either Barbie pink or baby pink.</li>
            <li> delivery was also faster than what I expected...</li>
            <li> There are not many neutrals but it seems like it will be possible to mix one.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to explain that, but they all look the same on my lips...</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as a lipstick but not as sheer as a lipgloss.</li>
            <li> I mean, a little bit goes a long way with me.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of plastic to package this mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this palette now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> The product was horrid in general and smelt weird.</li>
            <li> Sadly the pigmentation is simply not there in 90% of the glosses.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because the pots are small.</li>
            <li> They are hard to scoop out to use and they are not gloosy at all.</li>
            <li> Also, the pots are very shallow, so I don&#x27;t see this as an everyday wear palette, unless you like variety.</li>
            <li> is a mess from a useless product</li>
            <li> Ugh, I just hate this in general.</li>
            <li> This thing came in completely broken.</li>
            <li> Its thin.</li>
            <li> All the colors have a weird orange pigmant to it.</li>
            <li> But, I mean, even I had sense from the start that this was indecently stupid.</li>
            <li> buy this unless you&#x27;re stupid.</li>
            <li> If I had to keep this crap, it would have been war.</li>

            <li> they are nice.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long but good if you just want a variety of colors</li>
            <li> There are kits with more colors but I wear lip color mainly with business dress, so I don&#x27;t need whacky fashion colors. This kit has enough of a range of colors without wasting. The pots are enough but I know I will run out of the colors I like the most. This is also nice for experimenting with blending colors. I deducted a star because there is no mirror. Overall, it is a good value for the price, considering one tube of lipstick or gloss costs twice as much.</li>
            <li> Love the lip color palette little smuchier than I thought but it works great  defitnally recommend it and buy it again</li>
            <li> I basically don&#x27;t even know why this is being sold. This is a waste of plastic to package this mess. Sorry, but this is as honest as I can get. This made no sense and the colors were nothing as in the picture. The product was horrid in general and smelt weird. It was dry and cracked up. Go figure. Ugh, I just hate this in general. I only thank the stars that someone paid me to get this for them off of Amazon and I got the money. If I had to keep this crap, it would have been war. But, I mean, even I had sense from the start that this was indecently stupid. Sometimes, it just takes someone with a bit more experience or knowledge of the art of makeup to realise these faults before the occur.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this unless you&#x27;re stupid. #CaseClosed.</li>
            <li> Even thou I was not so happy with the product, I am Completely Satisfied with there customer service and there feedback! That shows how much they care About customers satisfaction!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my clients. I figured it was worth a try especially for the price. Sadly the pigmentation is simply not there in 90% of the glosses. Though they all have great shine. It isn&#x27;t something I would repurchase and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do enjoy this lip palette. It&#x27;s perfect for someone who wants to experiment with makeup without spending too much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all of the colors are sheer, but with most colors you can layer the product to achieve a more opaque look. Some colors are just very sheer and there&#x27;s not much you can do about it, namely the top row and one or two others individual colors. I apply them with a lip brush,  but I swirl the brush into the pot and mix the color up first. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll just be smearing the dried top layer and not get any product on the brush. Using your fingers to warm up and apply the product would also work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures and the palette itself can be deceiving, colors that look gold or brown give off a peachy/nude color. The pinks are either Barbie pink or baby pink. Many colors gave off a coral tint. The white, light pinks, and nude colors have little to no color and are hard to build up the product. They&#x27;re nice if you just want to add gloss. Most of the colors are shimmery, but there are some mattes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I rated this palette 4 stars is because all of the colors are wearable in their own way and they are nice colors. The packaging is nice and clean. I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because the pots are small. They&#x27;re about the size of a quarter and not deep at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just like to play with makeup, this product would most likely satisfy your needs. I only wish all colors were more opaque and that there was more of a variety of colors, like reds and plums.</li>
            <li> All the lipsticks are small, there is no applicator and the whole result is a mess from a useless product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the range of colors; a perfect shade for every occasion.  These are really glossy and do not leave my lips feeling dry or irritable like some other brands do.  I actually bought two of these, I keep one in my desk drawer at work for quick touch ups, and the other stays at home.  For this price, I got a real bargain.  It arrived long before the expected date too.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love how there is so many color variations to choose from! I use these glosses on top of my lipsticks to create a beautiful glossy finish!</li>
            <li> So many colors!! I love it</li>
            <li> This item was in excellent condition. Thanks!</li>
            <li> All the colors have a weird orange pigmant to it. And its not darker colors at all..its like clear with a little bit of color..</li>
            <li> Descent lip gloss for the price, needs more pigmentation. Product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This thing came in completely broken. I don&#x27;t feel like returning because it will just take another month to send and another to get back and I don&#x27;t have time for that. The colors are very sheer, kind of like those lip gloss things they make for little kids. The lip glosses smell like petroleum jelly. Definitely not a fan.</li>
            <li> All in all this was just what I had hoped. It is not as thick as a lipstick but not as sheer as a lipgloss. One of my colors had started to breakdown.  I hope a night in the freezer will stop it or I will have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Good, was looking for something that would match my skin tone and this fit very well. It was very reasonable for the price</li>
            <li> This is a great set for the price. It&#x27;s definitely a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of deal. It did not come with an ingredient list, but based on its scent and texture, I&#x27;m assuming its primary ingredient is petrolatum. I&#x27;m an avid Petroleum jelly user and the scent and texture was instantly familiar to me; just a guess! That said, it seems like these lip butters are pretty moisturizing and I love their sheer, buttery, glossy texture. They would be considered sheer lipsticks and a few of them are only glosses. I will use them with lipliner to get fuller coverage. I think this is an ideal set for someone wanting to learn what colors are best on them, as its an easy mix and match set, including a pure white to mix with. There are not many neutrals but it seems like it will be possible to mix one. Ideally, I think this set is great for beginning make up artists and those looking to find new colors that suit them without breaking the bank on countless lipsticks. There aren&#x27;t any dark browns and doesn&#x27;t look like that color can be mixed. Also, the pots are very shallow, so I don&#x27;t see this as an everyday wear palette, unless you like variety. I definitely need a lipstick application brush, as this is not very easy to use with fingers (it&#x27;s gooey).  Overall, for the price, it&#x27;s versatile, fantastic and fun!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, colors so bright and creamy, and looks amazing on any skin color. Only thing is, when u open it, it kinda smells like a NEW smell or some type of chemicals, also i believe they sent the wrong palette. Colors were very diff, not off, but different colors. Other than that, i love the gloss palette!!!!!</li>
            <li> ok I guess. They do not stay on too long and do transfer to cups or bottles when you drink  - pretty fast. A lot of choices though. I got the chance to try a few different colors and see if I should invest in another better brand similar color.  i would not buy this again, but had fun with it. You will notice that after a while - all colors kinda ...blend...I am not sure how to explain that, but they all look the same on my lips...yes i do clean my lipstick brush!</li>
            <li> Even if it was free I would toss it</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. I really like all the variety of colors. I can&#x27;t afford to buy all the M.A.C. lip glosses, so this is my nock off brand.</li>
            <li> I love it the colors look awesome and can use any color with anything I wear. I would probably buy more as gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this palette now for a few weeks and I just love it..all the colors are very wearable and the price is great..I&#x27;m very pleased at how the package was shipped as it wasn&#x27;t damaged in any way..delivery was also faster than what I expected...I will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> This lip balm/lip stick is great for the price.  The colors go on light but your lips are left soft and mositurized.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, but very sheer. It&#x27;s a cheap product, good for young girls, but it doesn&#x27;t really last long enough to use daily, maybe just if you are in your house. Can&#x27;t really tote it around with you so oh well. I use it when company is over and I can keep going in to check it and apply more if necessary.</li>
            <li> SSome of the shades were so light they ended up looking clear not pigmented. It took over 20 something applications to even get it to show, plus it has a plastic crayon smell.&lt;br /&gt;Two shades showed nicely all the Rogers a bust.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Great for the price. Of course, they are small, but enough for me:) they have lasted quite a while already. I mean, a little bit goes a long way with me. Also, love the variety of colors, as I like to mix them up for a cuter color. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t last a long time on your lips, but hey, what&#x27;s what is expected. Anyway, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The colors show very well and hold very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Its in a Palette&lt;br /&gt;The wells are way larger than I thought..they are about quarter size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The shipping takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;The palette is not that sturdy but it will do. Its thin.</li>
            <li> Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I was anxious to get this set and thought it would be great. So many colors etc. They are hard to scoop out to use and they are not gloosy at all. Not one of my favorite items.</li>
            <li> Great mix of colors for every Skin tone.</li>
            <li> Good for makeup artist to use.. quick and easy...good value for your money. It&#x27;s better than buying at Sephora since they are expensive.</li>
