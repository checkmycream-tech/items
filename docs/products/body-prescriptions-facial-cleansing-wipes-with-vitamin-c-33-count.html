            <li>I have the vitamin C ones, and they smell and feel great!</li>
            <li>The best part, my eyes were not watering from the cleaner getting into them.</li>
            <li>They smell great</li>
            <li>A pack of these on my night stand would have been a welcome alternative to sleeping in makeup.</li>
            <li>These are a great alternative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for 5 years, and people think I have great skin.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job at removing makeup and even mascara with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The packet reseals itself once opened, so a great option to take on trips.</li>

            <li>The wipes have a pleasant orange citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>They have a great citrus scent and feel very refreshing on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They smell good.  </li>
            <li>It has Vitamin C and Ginseng, which is good, but then it had a lot of unpronounceables as well.  </li>
            <li>I got these for my wife after reading about them, and she has been very pleased with these.</li>
            <li>Feels good and is an effective after-exercise skin cleaner for me.  </li>
            <li>And best, and most importantly of all...</li>
            <li>But they do feel lovely!</li>
            <li>But not all that effective either.</li>
            <li>These cleansing wipes do the job, and have a nice scent and feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a product or two that used citrus - can&#x27;t remember if it was for scent or for health purposes - and my skin kind of felt like it was &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; a bit after the use of</li>
            <li>They also smell good, which helps me wake up in the morning. :)</li>
            <li>These are really nice cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>you love the citrus smell, you&#x27;ll love these!</li>
            <li>I use very light makeup and washable mascara.  </li>
            <li>the very VERY light citrus scent dissipates immediately.  </li>
            <li>These wipes are very moist, pleasantly citrus scented, and seem to cleanse my face effectively.  </li>
            <li>They smell very refreshing and they clean well.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I love that the product wasn&#x27;t tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>These facial pre-moistened cleansing wipes smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better product out there that will work on the type of makeup I use.  </li>
            <li>This product was ok.  </li>
            <li>Nor did it make me feel better since it did not foam like others.  </li>
            <li>These wipes removed most of my makeup without being abrasive or drying.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it would be okay for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these wipes since they are infused with Vitamin C and that is suppose to be great for your skin</li>
            <li>My extremely cheap store brand wipes work way better than this for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>Love the light, citrus scent.</li>
            <li>This wipes work fine for removing make up or freshening up your face</li>
            <li>The scent of these wipes was very light and pleasant but they were not moist enough to clean my skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see anything particularly amazing about them, they are just a decent product!</li>
            <li>A light citrusy scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering, even when you were cleaning your face.  </li>
            <li>lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These wipes are very convenient when on the go, pleasant to use and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I assume that the company would want to make that known if it was a significant amount.  </li>
            <li>Which I think had an impact on their ability to clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to how well they remove makeup, but they do make my skin feel clean without the need for rinsing.</li>
            <li>This is a pleasant facial cleansing wipe.</li>
            <li>but for those SPECIAL occasions, I will, and afterwards, I would not like to use umpteen cloths/wipes</li>
            <li>but for those SPECIAL occasions, I will, and afterwards, I would not like to use umpteen cloths/wipes</li>
            <li>They stay cool, moist, and fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is a great price compared to other cleaners on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I probably would rate them more highly</li>
            <li>is my new favorite makeup remove.</li>
            <li>Each towelette lasts a nice time for a full facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li>But for those that want a gentle wipe for light makeup, these may work out ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They smell nice, so I am keeping them in a drawer at work for occasional use of freshening up or when I spill something on my clothes, they have been useful for that.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, while the package does say &amp;#34;designed in the USA&amp;#34;, the wipes are made in China.</li>
            <li>The extra orangey-smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>first thing that I noticed was the wonderful citrus scent of the thick and large wipes.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne, so it is important to keep the face clean after working up a sweat.</li>
            <li>The slight citrus scent is also pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use regularly.</li>
            <li>Funny, though, speaking of drying out, when I first opened the packet, I almost got &amp;#34;squirted&amp;#34; because of the bit of excess liquid that is inside to keep the wipes moisturized!  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wear makeup, and my work doesn&#x27;t require me to get &amp;#34;dirty,&amp;#34; (though I wouldn&#x27;t mind;) however, those times that my face just becomes &amp;#34;grimy&amp;#34; from the days activities - ESPECIALLY those days I&#x27;m around and helping to take care of animals, specifically dogs - these cleansing wipes do an incredibly effective job when it comes to cleaning deep and cleansing the face (and neck, too...perfectly safe).</li>
            <li>However, I DID notice that over time, while I didn&#x27;t use it every day, the more I opened and closed it, the more I had to make efforts to ensure that the seal was secure to ensure the wipes did not dry out overnight.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li>My face FEELS fresh, clean, and - to a certain extent - new, or, refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first used them on my face to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I rated Vitamin C Infused Facial Cleansing Wipes a 4 star because I wasn&#x27;t able to smell a scent of orange.  </li>
            <li>These seem to work pretty well as makeup removers.</li>
            <li>It never fails; any makeup remover wipe I have ever used has caused my eyes to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that these clean the way they do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much good the &amp;#34;vitamin C&amp;#34; part is doing me.</li>
            <li>My face was left clean, fresh, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>They were able to take off a majority of my makeup and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry the way most cleansers do.</li>
            <li>medium to large size&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have any HUGE issues with the facial</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>They have a fresh citrus smell and have not dried out at all in the packaging.</li>
            <li>These are fairly gentle cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>On the plus side it does have a very invigorating citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, isn&#x27;t harsh or abrasive and doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li>Are they better than other wipes I have used?</li>
            <li>noticed that the wipes go a LONG way, in that I can use 1 wipe to do a nice, slow, thorough &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; of my face and neck, and there is quite a bit that is picked up, more than what I did notice.</li>

            <li>Still, they do a fair job of cleansing (they seem a little less effective, but not much).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find any particular benefit to the Vitamin C infusion, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>(you can only really smell it if you put your nose right up to the wipe or to the pack of wipes.)  </li>
            <li>is easy to open, but not so easy that a toddler or young one wanting to reach up on the counter to grab and explore could open initially.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Towelettes are substantial, and appear to be high quality.</li>
            <li>While these wipes smell nice and come in a convenient package, they are not effective at removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>Now, granted, I&#x27;ve just said I&#x27;m not one to normally wear makeup,</li>
            <li>Now, granted, I&#x27;ve just said I&#x27;m not one to normally wear makeup,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good, not great.</li>
            <li>Thus, for balls, weddings, and other events that might require makeup, such as a variety of performances (I did do some theatre a fair ways back in my past - and believe me, I would have LOVED to have had these back then!)</li>

            <li>Perhaps someone with less sensitive skin would fare better.</li>
            <li>It might be a tad different if one wears heavy(ier) makeup, but as a whole, I can still seeing just ONE cloth - which feels like it&#x27;s a HUGE cloth at times (especially when one does a nice, slow sweep over the face with the entire hand in circular/wave-like movements! ^_^)</li>
            <li>It removes most of the make up and dirt, but I usually find it necessary to use a second wipe to ensure that my face is clean.</li>
            <li>The main selling point is the Vitamin C; however, the packaging doesn&#x27;t indicate how much Vitamin C is actually in the wipes.  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read on the packaging, and from what I remember reading on the description online before having this item shipped to me, the main purpose for this facial cleanser is for removing make-up...that, or, it is a product that is highly optimal for the removal of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>, they remove your makeup completely and you don&#x27;t need a sink to use them.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you probably don&#x27;t want to use these.</li>
            <li>Softly.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin and my skin didn&#x27;t become irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin soft</li>
            <li>Not harsh.  </li>
            <li>These are a decent facial cleansing wipe.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if these are any better than regular face wipes.</li>
            <li>It might be a tad different if one wears heavy(ier) makeup, but as a whole, I can still seeing just ONE cloth - which feels like it&#x27;s a HUGE cloth at times (especially when one does a nice, slow sweep over the face with the entire hand in circular/wave-like movements! ^_^)bit finicky (at least, on my package it was)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them on everyday makeup, as well as on full face paint, and they powered through all of it.</li>
            <li>I also think you can certainly find another product for less money that works better and isn&#x27;t such a waste of product.</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t take off makeup quite as well as some other wipes I have used, but they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>As this may represent a serious shortcoming for many potential users, I feel compelled to give them a so-so rating.</li>
            <li>well, maybe not to that extreme, but I say that to make a point, that the less of something I can use, thus making it last longer, the more I&#x27;m going to WANT to use it.</li>

            <li>These per-moistened wipes are so soft and gentle but manage to get my makeup off pretty well without leaving my face raw and dry.  </li>
            <li>But at least nothing was tested on animals, which is almost an important decision when buying these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every once in awhile I will get a professional facial.  </li>
            <li>sensitivity or facial out break developed as a result of using these towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, the shadow came off easily but it took some hard scrubbing to get the liner off (a couple of different kinds of pencil eyeliner)</li>
            <li>I had to rub so hard to remove a light coating of waterproof mascara eyelashes came out and mascara was still present.</li>
            <li>These work well as basic facial cleansing wipes, but don&#x27;t expect complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li>They do not dry the skin.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how thick the makeup is - theatre makeup, I could see as working, but not working as effective/efficient as everyday makeup - will depend upon how effective it would be.</li>

            <li>Those harsher astringents actually make the oiliness problem worse because the drying effect stimulates the skin to produce MORE oil to compensate.  </li>
            <li>A single sheet can clean my oily face, heavy foundation and eye liner.</li>
            <li>Some are innefective, and others are pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li>They were a little damp, but not very saturated, even when I first opened the brand new pack.  </li>
            <li>No more super dry spots that get oily within the hour.</li>

            <li> However, I DID notice that over time, while I didn&#x27;t use it every day, the more I opened and closed it, the more I had to make efforts to ensure that the seal was secure to ensure the wipes did not dry out overnight.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> My face FEELS fresh, clean, and - to a certain extent - new, or, refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first used them on my face to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I rated Vitamin C Infused Facial Cleansing Wipes a 4 star because I wasn&#x27;t able to smell a scent of orange.  </li>
            <li> These seem to work pretty well as makeup removers.</li>
            <li> It never fails; any makeup remover wipe I have ever used has caused my eyes to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that these clean the way they do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much good the &amp;#34;vitamin C&amp;#34; part is doing me.</li>
            <li> My face was left clean, fresh, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> They were able to take off a majority of my makeup and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry the way most cleansers do.</li>
            <li> medium to large size&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have any HUGE issues with the facial</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> They have a fresh citrus smell and have not dried out at all in the packaging.</li>
            <li> These are fairly gentle cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> On the plus side it does have a very invigorating citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, isn&#x27;t harsh or abrasive and doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li> Are they better than other wipes I have used?</li>
            <li> noticed that the wipes go a LONG way, in that I can use 1 wipe to do a nice, slow, thorough &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; of my face and neck, and there is quite a bit that is picked up, more than what I did notice.</li>

            <li> Still, they do a fair job of cleansing (they seem a little less effective, but not much).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find any particular benefit to the Vitamin C infusion, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> (you can only really smell it if you put your nose right up to the wipe or to the pack of wipes.)  </li>
            <li> is easy to open, but not so easy that a toddler or young one wanting to reach up on the counter to grab and explore could open initially.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Towelettes are substantial, and appear to be high quality.</li>
            <li> While these wipes smell nice and come in a convenient package, they are not effective at removing makeup.  </li>
            <li> Now, granted, I&#x27;ve just said I&#x27;m not one to normally wear makeup,</li>
            <li> Now, granted, I&#x27;ve just said I&#x27;m not one to normally wear makeup,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good, not great.</li>
            <li> Thus, for balls, weddings, and other events that might require makeup, such as a variety of performances (I did do some theatre a fair ways back in my past - and believe me, I would have LOVED to have had these back then!)</li>

            <li> Perhaps someone with less sensitive skin would fare better.</li>
            <li> It might be a tad different if one wears heavy(ier) makeup, but as a whole, I can still seeing just ONE cloth - which feels like it&#x27;s a HUGE cloth at times (especially when one does a nice, slow sweep over the face with the entire hand in circular/wave-like movements! ^_^)</li>
            <li> It removes most of the make up and dirt, but I usually find it necessary to use a second wipe to ensure that my face is clean.</li>
            <li> The main selling point is the Vitamin C; however, the packaging doesn&#x27;t indicate how much Vitamin C is actually in the wipes.  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read on the packaging, and from what I remember reading on the description online before having this item shipped to me, the main purpose for this facial cleanser is for removing make-up...that, or, it is a product that is highly optimal for the removal of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> , they remove your makeup completely and you don&#x27;t need a sink to use them.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you probably don&#x27;t want to use these.</li>
            <li> Softly.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin and my skin didn&#x27;t become irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin soft</li>
            <li> Not harsh.  </li>
            <li> These are a decent facial cleansing wipe.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if these are any better than regular face wipes.</li>
            <li> It might be a tad different if one wears heavy(ier) makeup, but as a whole, I can still seeing just ONE cloth - which feels like it&#x27;s a HUGE cloth at times (especially when one does a nice, slow sweep over the face with the entire hand in circular/wave-like movements! ^_^)bit finicky (at least, on my package it was)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them on everyday makeup, as well as on full face paint, and they powered through all of it.</li>
            <li> I also think you can certainly find another product for less money that works better and isn&#x27;t such a waste of product.</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t take off makeup quite as well as some other wipes I have used, but they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> As this may represent a serious shortcoming for many potential users, I feel compelled to give them a so-so rating.</li>
            <li> well, maybe not to that extreme, but I say that to make a point, that the less of something I can use, thus making it last longer, the more I&#x27;m going to WANT to use it.</li>

            <li> These per-moistened wipes are so soft and gentle but manage to get my makeup off pretty well without leaving my face raw and dry.  </li>
            <li> But at least nothing was tested on animals, which is almost an important decision when buying these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile I will get a professional facial.  </li>
            <li> sensitivity or facial out break developed as a result of using these towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, the shadow came off easily but it took some hard scrubbing to get the liner off (a couple of different kinds of pencil eyeliner)</li>
            <li> I had to rub so hard to remove a light coating of waterproof mascara eyelashes came out and mascara was still present.</li>
            <li> These work well as basic facial cleansing wipes, but don&#x27;t expect complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li> They do not dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how thick the makeup is - theatre makeup, I could see as working, but not working as effective/efficient as everyday makeup - will depend upon how effective it would be.</li>

            <li> Those harsher astringents actually make the oiliness problem worse because the drying effect stimulates the skin to produce MORE oil to compensate.  </li>
            <li> A single sheet can clean my oily face, heavy foundation and eye liner.</li>
            <li> Some are innefective, and others are pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li> They were a little damp, but not very saturated, even when I first opened the brand new pack.  </li>
            <li> No more super dry spots that get oily within the hour.</li>
            <li> In any case, other than the seal being a bit finicky (at least, on my package it was), I don&#x27;t have any HUGE issues with the facial</li>
            <li> Additionally, it would appear that one doesn&#x27;t need to use MUCH of the cloth, that (the old adage) &amp;#34;A little bit goes a long way,&amp;#34; is extremely applicable for these wipes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the Vitamin C makes these different from other face cleansing wipes, but there is a very very faint scent of fresh oranges which is not at all overpowering and really refreshing</li>

            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> But they weren&#x27;t exactly wet wipes.  </li>
            <li> To me, it just felt like I was using a wet paper towel on my face.  </li>
            <li> This will likely be one of the few reviews this product receives from a man.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not a HUGE citrus fan, but the scent is not overwhelming/overpowering, AND, it&#x27;s not as if it smells like one citrus fruit over another citrus ______(fill in the blank with a citrus-scented/flavoured food).</li>
            <li> These wipes have worked well both on the glue residue and the oil, without leaving my skin dry and tight like cheaper astringents I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>

            <li> I would say that for someone who wears makeup everyday, not tooooooo thick or heavy, mind you,  the way it works for me now just as a &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; facial cleanser would be about the same.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are fantastic! They smell great, they remove your makeup completely and you don&#x27;t need a sink to use them. I wish I had these back in my club days when I&#x27;d come home too tired to wash my face. A pack of these on my night stand would have been a welcome alternative to sleeping in makeup. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I used these wipes for a week to remove makeup at the end of the day.  I use very light makeup and washable mascara.  These wipes require a lot of SCRUBBING to get eye makeup off.  I had to go over and over my eyelashes to get all the mascara off.  That is really hard on the skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive - the very VERY light citrus scent dissipates immediately.  No residue, not oily.  But not all that effective either.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I skip washing my face when I know I should. All that splashing about in the sink just seems too much trouble. These are a great alternative. I can pop one out and cleanse my face in just a few moments with no mess. They have a great citrus scent and feel very refreshing on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This wipes work fine for removing make up or freshening up your face but they made me break out. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the Vitamin C or something else added. They smell nice, so I am keeping them in a drawer at work for occasional use of freshening up or when I spill something on my clothes, they have been useful for that. If you have sensitive skin, you probably don&#x27;t want to use these. I also think you can certainly find another product for less money that works better and isn&#x27;t such a waste of product.</li>
            <li> It cleans and tones.  Softly.  The sheets could be softer, but look at the price and quantity compared to Ponds!  I would buy these again.  I am a fan of towelettes.  I&#x27;ve been using them for 5 years, and people think I have great skin.  Every once in awhile I will get a professional facial.  Maybe once a year. Highly recommended.  I have the vitamin C ones, and they smell and feel great!</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant facial cleansing wipe. They are unscented, which I appreciate.  I use them when it is difficult to wash my face with a cleanser and water.  It removes most of the make up and dirt, but I usually find it necessary to use a second wipe to ensure that my face is clean. I don&#x27;t find any particular benefit to the Vitamin C infusion, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;These are serviceable - but not anything out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> Feels good and is an effective after-exercise skin cleaner for me.  I suffer from adult acne, so it is important to keep the face clean after working up a sweat.</li>
            <li> These per-moistened wipes are so soft and gentle but manage to get my makeup off pretty well without leaving my face raw and dry.  I&#x27;m not sure how the Vitamin C makes these different from other face cleansing wipes, but there is a very very faint scent of fresh oranges which is not at all overpowering and really refreshing (you can only really smell it if you put your nose right up to the wipe or to the pack of wipes.)  It didn&#x27;t sting my eyes, which is a problem with a lot of face wipes out there and I love that the product wasn&#x27;t tested on animals.  For what it&#x27;s worth, while the package does say &amp;#34;designed in the USA&amp;#34;, the wipes are made in China.</li>
            <li> Terrific stuff.  Really terrific stuff.  My daughter, who experiences stubborn acne, has been using countless over the counter products for her face.  Some are innefective, and others are pretty harsh.  She LOVES this product.  It smells nice, isn&#x27;t harsh or abrasive and doesn&#x27;t sting.  And best, and most importantly of all... it WORKS!  We will definitely be keeping this product on hand!</li>
            <li> These facial pre-moistened cleansing wipes smell wonderful.  The vitamin C is soothing on the skin and delicate eye area. They do a great job at removing makeup and even mascara with no irritation.  They do not dry the skin.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> These cleansing wipes do the job, and have a nice scent and feel. Are they better than other wipes I have used? Not really. They&#x27;re good, not great.</li>
            <li> These are a decent facial cleansing wipe.  They smell very refreshing and they clean well.  I didn&#x27;t see anything particularly amazing about them, they are just a decent product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup too often.  But when I do I don&#x27;t like to sleep in it.  Since water doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell good.  A light citrusy scent that wasn&#x27;t overpowering, even when you were cleaning your face.  But they weren&#x27;t exactly wet wipes.  They were a little damp, but not very saturated, even when I first opened the brand new pack.  Which I think had an impact on their ability to clean.  I first used them on my face to remove eye makeup. Just some shadow and liner, nothing extreme.  It took off the shadow well but didn&#x27;t get the liner off.  Intrigued, I tested all the products on my arm and took the wipe to them.  Again, the shadow came off easily but it took some hard scrubbing to get the liner off (a couple of different kinds of pencil eyeliner) and I can&#x27;t see someone rubbing at their eyes that hard with this wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t overly enthused with the ingredients either.  They aren&#x27;t terrible, but they aren&#x27;t great either.  It has Vitamin C and Ginseng, which is good, but then it had a lot of unpronounceables as well.  But at least nothing was tested on animals, which is almost an important decision when buying these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy these.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better product out there that will work on the type of makeup I use.  But for those that want a gentle wipe for light makeup, these may work out ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2013</li>
            <li> While these wipes smell nice and come in a convenient package, they are not effective at removing makeup.  My wife complains that she needs to rub her face excessively, which leaves her skin red and puffy.  It seems that any antioxidant effect the vitamin C infusion might give is nullified by the inflammation caused by the required amount of rubbing.  Perhaps someone with less sensitive skin would fare better.</li>
            <li> This product was ok.  I used it for over a week and I did not see any difference in my skin.  I did not like that it was very wet like some facial cleaning.  Nor did it make me feel better since it did not foam like others.  To me, it just felt like I was using a wet paper towel on my face.  I had high hopes for these wipes since they are infused with Vitamin C and that is suppose to be great for your skin but I was not impressed.  I guess maybe if I use it for a longer period of time, I might see some results?  I am not sure.  I will go back to using my Dove facial wipes.  It may work for other skin types or if used for a longer period of time.  I just did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read on the packaging, and from what I remember reading on the description online before having this item shipped to me, the main purpose for this facial cleanser is for removing make-up...that, or, it is a product that is highly optimal for the removal of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t wear makeup, and my work doesn&#x27;t require me to get &amp;#34;dirty,&amp;#34; (though I wouldn&#x27;t mind;) however, those times that my face just becomes &amp;#34;grimy&amp;#34; from the days activities - ESPECIALLY those days I&#x27;m around and helping to take care of animals, specifically dogs - these cleansing wipes do an incredibly effective job when it comes to cleaning deep and cleansing the face (and neck, too...perfectly safe). My face FEELS fresh, clean, and - to a certain extent - new, or, refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not a HUGE citrus fan, but the scent is not overwhelming/overpowering, AND, it&#x27;s not as if it smells like one citrus fruit over another citrus ______(fill in the blank with a citrus-scented/flavoured food). I&#x27;ve used a product or two that used citrus - can&#x27;t remember if it was for scent or for health purposes - and my skin kind of felt like it was &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; a bit after the use of this(these) other product(s). NOT so for these wipes. I&#x27;ve yet to experience that stinging/burning/irritated feeling I&#x27;ve felt with other products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packet itself is easy to open, but not so easy that a toddler or young one wanting to reach up on the counter to grab and explore could open initially. However, I DID notice that over time, while I didn&#x27;t use it every day, the more I opened and closed it, the more I had to make efforts to ensure that the seal was secure to ensure the wipes did not dry out overnight. Funny, though, speaking of drying out, when I first opened the packet, I almost got &amp;#34;squirted&amp;#34; because of the bit of excess liquid that is inside to keep the wipes moisturized!  In any case, other than the seal being a bit finicky (at least, on my package it was), I don&#x27;t have any HUGE issues with the facial wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the wipes go a LONG way, in that I can use 1 wipe to do a nice, slow, thorough &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; of my face and neck, and there is quite a bit that is picked up, more than what I did notice. Additionally, it would appear that one doesn&#x27;t need to use MUCH of the cloth, that (the old adage) &amp;#34;A little bit goes a long way,&amp;#34; is extremely applicable for these wipes. Now, would they function similarly/the same for makeup users? Well...yes and no. Now, granted, I&#x27;ve just said I&#x27;m not one to normally wear makeup, but for those SPECIAL occasions, I will, and afterwards, I would not like to use umpteen cloths/wipes and/or x number of bottles of makeup remover - well, maybe not to that extreme, but I say that to make a point, that the less of something I can use, thus making it last longer, the more I&#x27;m going to WANT to use it. Thus, for balls, weddings, and other events that might require makeup, such as a variety of performances (I did do some theatre a fair ways back in my past - and believe me, I would have LOVED to have had these back then!) Depending on how thick the makeup is - theatre makeup, I could see as working, but not working as effective/efficient as everyday makeup - will depend upon how effective it would be. I would say that for someone who wears makeup everyday, not tooooooo thick or heavy, mind you,  the way it works for me now just as a &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; facial cleanser would be about the same. It might be a tad different if one wears heavy(ier) makeup, but as a whole, I can still seeing just ONE cloth - which feels like it&#x27;s a HUGE cloth at times (especially when one does a nice, slow sweep over the face with the entire hand in circular/wave-like movements! ^_^)bit finicky (at least, on my package it was), I don&#x27;t have any HUGE issues with the facial wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the wipes go a LONG way, in that I can use 1 wipe to do a nice, slow, thorough &amp;#34;sweep&amp;#34; of my face and neck, and there is quite a bit that is picked up, more than what I did notice. Additionally, it would appear that one doesn&#x27;t need to use MUCH of the cloth, that (the old adage) &amp;#34;A little bit goes a long way,&amp;#34; is extremely applicable for these wipes. Now, would they function similarly/the same for makeup users? Well...yes and no. Now, granted, I&#x27;ve just said I&#x27;m not one to normally wear makeup, but for those SPECIAL occasions, I will, and afterwards, I would not like to use umpteen cloths/wipes and/or x number of bottles of makeup remover - well, maybe not to that extreme, but I say that to make a point, that the less of something I can use, thus making it last longer, the more I&#x27;m going to WANT to use it. Thus, for balls, weddings, and other events that might require makeup, such as a variety of performances (I did do some theatre a fair ways back in my past - and believe me, I would have LOVED to have had these back then!)

            <li> I rated Vitamin C Infused Facial Cleansing Wipes a 4 star because I wasn&#x27;t able to smell a scent of orange.  I do like that you can use these to cleanse your face, eyebrows, eye lids and lips.  I have other brands that state to keep them away from your eyes and I don&#x27;t like going to bed with mascara on my eye lids.  These come 33 to a package and the wipes are quite big which I also like.  I am going to order the Pomegranate Infused Facial Wipes.</li>
            <li> They were able to take off a majority of my makeup and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I have relatively sensitive skin and my skin didn&#x27;t become irritated.&lt;br /&gt;If you love the citrus smell, you&#x27;ll love these!</li>
            <li> These work well as basic facial cleansing wipes, but don&#x27;t expect complete makeup removal. I could get all of the foundation off, but as for my eye makeup? It took off the shadow, but not the mascara and little of the eyeliner. Please note: I do not use waterproof, so if you do use waterproof, this will never take it off. My extremely cheap store brand wipes work way better than this for makeup removal. Just know what your needs are. If you&#x27;re just cleaning your face, this works, but not for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> This will likely be one of the few reviews this product receives from a man.  I have not used these to remove makeup because I don&#x27;t wear any.  My skin tends toward the oily side though, which is its chief problem.  I also use Breath-Right strips to enable me to breath at night, and they leave a sticky residue on my nose that is hard to get off.  These wipes have worked well both on the glue residue and the oil, without leaving my skin dry and tight like cheaper astringents I&#x27;ve tried before.  Those harsher astringents actually make the oiliness problem worse because the drying effect stimulates the skin to produce MORE oil to compensate.  These wipes don&#x27;t set off that response, so I end up with clearer skin for longer.  They also smell good, which helps me wake up in the morning. :)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice medium to large size&lt;br /&gt;Nice citrus smell&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove waterproof mascara&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove waterproof sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get anything except superficial dirt off your face you will have to wash either before or after using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was to buy these I would use them as an after cleanser for the smell and skin  softener but not as a cleanser, even though a cleanser is what they are marketed to be used as a cleanser. I had to rub so hard to remove a light coating of waterproof mascara eyelashes came out and mascara was still present.</li>
            <li> These seem to work pretty well as makeup removers. I&#x27;ve used them on everyday makeup, as well as on full face paint, and they powered through all of it. The extra orangey-smell is nice too. I&#x27;m not sure how much good the &amp;#34;vitamin C&amp;#34; part is doing me. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. So I&#x27;m not sure if these are any better than regular face wipes. But they do feel lovely!</li>
            <li> These are really nice cleansing wipes. They have a fresh citrus smell and have not dried out at all in the packaging. The don&#x27;t take off makeup quite as well as some other wipes I have used, but they work pretty well. I just use two instead of one.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face well with the added benefit of vitamin c which has been a proven anti - aging ingredient</li>
            <li> The scent of these wipes was very light and pleasant but they were not moist enough to clean my skin.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend to review, so here is here thoughts on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was the wonderful citrus scent of the thick and large wipes. I used them and they took all of my makeup off within a couple swipes. No more rubbing my eyes until they are red and swollen. Just a couple passes and all of the makeup was off. The best part, my eyes were not watering from the cleaner getting into them. It never fails; any makeup remover wipe I have ever used has caused my eyes to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and they cleaned up the rest of my face. My face was left clean, fresh, and moisturized. No more super dry spots that get oily within the hour. As of the time of this review, a package of 33 wipes was $5. That is a great price compared to other cleaners on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite makeup remove. I will definitely be buying these again. This is one face cleanser that you HAVE to add to your regiment.</li>
            <li> These wipes removed most of my makeup without being abrasive or drying.  But if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for there are cheaper options out there.  The main selling point is the Vitamin C; however, the packaging doesn&#x27;t indicate how much Vitamin C is actually in the wipes.  I assume that the company would want to make that known if it was a significant amount.  The wipes have a pleasant orange citrus smell.  The packaging leaves something to be desired though.  The peel and stick closure loses it&#x27;s stickiness when about half the wipes are left.</li>
            <li> These are fairly gentle cleansing wipes. Compared to the Noxema wipes, these wipes don&#x27;t feel as abrasive, and they don&#x27;t leave a lingering tingle the way. Noxema wipes do. Still, they do a fair job of cleansing (they seem a little less effective, but not much). The slight citrus scent is also pleasant.</li>
            <li> These wipes are very convenient when on the go, pleasant to use and reasonably priced. I can&#x27;t attest to how well they remove makeup, but they do make my skin feel clean without the need for rinsing.</li>
            <li> These wipes are very moist, pleasantly citrus scented, and seem to cleanse my face effectively.  I probably would rate them more highly were it not that my wife finds them ineffectual in removing mascara, a problem cited by a number of other reviewers.  As this may represent a serious shortcoming for many potential users, I feel compelled to give them a so-so rating.</li>
            <li> (Review for yellow, citrus packet) I was really surprised that these clean the way they do. The &#x27;wipes&#x27; are thin sheets, with no bumps to offer any scrubbing action. I was very skeptical but it does work. A single sheet can clean my oily face, heavy foundation and eye liner. And as advertised, no rinsing required. It doesn&#x27;t leave skin too dry the way most cleansers do. Love the light, citrus scent. The packet reseals itself once opened, so a great option to take on trips.</li>
            <li> These are really nice and perfectly moisturized.  Very easy to use regularly. Each towelette lasts a nice time for a full facial cleansing.  They stay cool, moist, and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non astringent, no-burn, not greasy.  Very gentle and soothing. Not harsh.  lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Towelettes are substantial, and appear to be high quality. Do not fall apart during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sensitivity or facial out break developed as a result of using these towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good choice.  Will get again .</li>
            <li> I really like facial wipes as I am sometimes too lazy to get up and wash my face. I like that this one has vitamin c as I like what it does for my skin. Unfortunately I found this to be very drying. Maybe it would be okay for someone with oily skin. On the plus side it does have a very invigorating citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife after reading about them, and she has been very pleased with these. I now have to keep supply on hand.</li>
