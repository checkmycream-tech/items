            <li> Price a bit high compared to other sellers</li>
            <li> Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t go well with my hair wash routine since i wash it every other day, by the next day of not being washed it makes my hair oily.</li>
            <li> My hair started to feel dry ...</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry and unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it is the same one my hair stylist uses, because my hair do not feel the same.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Both bottles I received had broken tops on them making it impossible to use the product effectively.  </li>
            <li> Pumps were broken, which appears to be typical based on other reviews, I solved problem by switching them out for simple bottle caps from other pharmacy bought products used in the past.</li>
            <li> Delivery was speedy and items were well package which means pumps were broken prior to being shipped.</li>
            <li> I just prefer not to wash my hair everyday, but i still use it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they were sent out broken or broke in the shopping.  </li>
            <li> pump on conditioner was broken.  </li>
            <li> It is a FAKE product.</li>
            <li> Either way I was very disappointed with what I received.</li>

            <li> I love this brand and have been using it for a long time now. I bought these by mistake thinking I was buying the 64 oz bottle - yes, the size was stated clearly, but I made a mistake -. Price a bit high compared to other sellers</li>
            <li> Great shampoo &amp; conditioner. Hope to buy this again here.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great, but the packaging that this came in seemed like it was packaged for another country and not the quality I am used to... The actual shampoo and conditioner seem authentic.</li>
            <li> So far product seems to be working well. Smells good, and appears to be slowly improving my hair. Pumps were broken, which appears to be typical based on other reviews, I solved problem by switching them out for simple bottle caps from other pharmacy bought products used in the past. If pump is the only reason these are so affordable, I will gladly continue to purchase. Delivery was speedy and items were well package which means pumps were broken prior to being shipped. Hope this product will deliver good results in ling term use.</li>
            <li> My hair started to feel dry ...not sure if it is the same one my hair stylist uses, because my hair do not feel the same.</li>
            <li> Very drying. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t see a huge difference in my hair for the price I paid for the shampoo/conditioner. I also didn&#x27;t care for the pump system on the bottles.</li>
            <li> They smell amazing !!!&lt;br /&gt;Live the conditioner but the shampo is too drying for my hair... And the pump on the shampo is not working properly but I manage...</li>
            <li> Both bottles I received had broken tops on them making it impossible to use the product effectively.  I am not sure if they were sent out broken or broke in the shopping.  Either way I was very disappointed with what I received.</li>

Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t go well with my hair wash routine since i wash it every other day, by the next day of not being washed it makes my hair oily.

            <li> Awesome shampoo and conditioner! I use s small amount of conditioner as my hair has a very fine texture. I use about a quarter size amount for my shoulder length hair. Sometimes I can skip conditioner, the shampoo is that rich! Love the scent!</li>
