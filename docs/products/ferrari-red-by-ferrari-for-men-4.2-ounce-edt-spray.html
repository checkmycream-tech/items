            <li>I won&#x27;t say I love this perfume, but I surely like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I recommend it for its size, its definitely great price, visit the website of Amazon and Buy it now, do not waste time</li>
            <li>I ended up buying Cool water by Davidoff which is my favorite and kept on using it.</li>

            <li>The cologne itself has a unique smell,</li>
            <li>It pays to have this and the other kind.</li>
            <li>I suddenly realized why the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li>somewhat floral  and reminds you of freshness after a shower if that helps any haha.</li>
            <li>I thought that I had just gotten used to the smell but after asking several people it does fade quick.</li>

            <li>Ferrari Black is my favorite, but I realize that this is a personal preference and others will have a different opinion.</li>
            <li>This cologne is more of an office/professional scent in my opinion; it is subtle but still noticeable.</li>
            <li>Apparently I can&#x27;t get a refund or a replacement either because I get zero responce on my packaging feedback.</li>
            <li>The Ferrari scents are subtle however mildly strong if that makes any sense to you.</li>

            <li> I love the brand! Ferrari Black is my favorite, but I realize that this is a personal preference and others will have a different opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son for Christmas.  Pleaced the order on Monday and received it on Wednesday!!  Talk about quick service!  He loves it and is out to pick up all the girls now!!</li>
            <li> excellent product I love, I recommend it for its size, its definitely great price, visit the website of Amazon and Buy it now, do not waste time</li>
            <li> I purchased this online cos the price was very low compared to retail malls but when I received it, it smelled different than I remember. I ended up buying Cool water by Davidoff which is my favorite and kept on using it. Last week I went to the mall to buy perfume after finishing cool water and wanted to try some new brand and there I saw this same Ferrari perfume and it smelled like I remembered. I suddenly realized why the price was so cheap. It was certainly a fake one that I received. Its been a while that I purchased this one so I wont expect to get my money back But writing a review to warn future customers.</li>
            <li> My husband and I like d scent of this cologne spray...I will recommend this to friends, ideal gift to husbands...</li>
            <li> my husband love it the ferrari smell  in he  friend every time my husband he tell me buy for my friend</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I love this perfume, but I surely like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended for casual wear, like the office or hanging out with the guys.</li>
            <li> The Ferrari scents are subtle however mildly strong if that makes any sense to you. My complaint is not with the product but whomever is responsible for packing and shipping. There IS a difference between the Ferrari scents and the Scuderia Ferrari. I specifically order Ferrari and 60% of the time receive Scuderia. My advice is to order the Ferrari and check on it after the order is received and before shipped (obviously).</li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume is through citric Ferrary, producing a smooth and long lasting fragrance. It pays to have this and the other kind.</li>
            <li> For a good price this product is advisable. A persistent aroma has dry and bitters. Also he is important to give as a present for not much price. He would buy it again without a doubt. Jose</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend and he loved it as well. The price was perfect and afforadable as well.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered Eau de toilet over Amazon. Ferrari Red was amoungst them. When I got the package the box was not sealed and the perfume was leaking. I wanted to send it back but because it is flamable I could not. Apparently I can&#x27;t get a refund or a replacement either because I get zero responce on my packaging feedback. I am really disappointed in this transaction.[[ASIN:B0017LXT9K Ferrari Red by Ferrari for Men - 4.2 Ounce EDT Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with Ferrari. just the distributor cut me short there</li>
            <li> Delicious smell it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and its soft, i gave it to my 13 year old nephew and he uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> excelente 100% recomendado</li>
            <li> This cologne is more of an office/professional scent in my opinion; it is subtle but still noticeable. The cologne itself has a unique smell, somewhat floral  and reminds you of freshness after a shower if that helps any haha. I have received several compliments from women while wearing it. I admit that in the morning I spray my wrists/clothes 2-3 times and it disappears within just a few hours. I thought that I had just gotten used to the smell but after asking several people it does fade quick. I&#x27;d recommend to someone who would wear this to a white collar job/formal gatherings etc. on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband and he love it, good price and we like the fragrance ,less expensive than any store,i will recomended for mens who like to smell great.</li>
