            <li> This is the first shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have my hair feeling rough when u rinse it out.</li>
            <li> It has also addressed the extremely dry parts of my hair which are generally the sides and the back.</li>
            <li> As a user and lover of other Mizani products I decided to completely switch over and only use this brand.</li>
            <li> It laters very well, and is thick and creamy.</li>

            <li> I like the shampoo; it smells good and really cleans my hair. My only complaint is it leaves my hair a little dry. I deep condition with the therm a smooth conditioner afterwards which is excellent and adds moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li> Mizani is one of the best professional grade product lines for African-American hair.   My stylist uses this product regularly along with other products from the Mizani line when I go in for an appointment.  I use Mizani on my own when I need to shampoo my hair and it&#x27;s the best. It leaves hair clean, but not stripped of essential oils and works as a great clarifier.   I usually use it before and after I do a hot-oil treatment every two weeks or so. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, lasts me about a year between purchases and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. My hair is so soft as if I had used an expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair very tangled and matted.  It took me the longest I ever had to in my life to comb out my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Mizani, always worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo for damaged hair.  I relax my hair 4 times a year and need a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.  This shampoo seem to be moisturizing.  Someone with fine hair would find it too heavy.</li>
            <li> A great treatment for my winter-dried hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  It cleanses the hair wonderfully and it leaves your hair refreshed and smelling good.  Thanks Mizani and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just love the Mizani products!  It makes your hair feels so nice and soft.  I have started using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and her hair looks great!  Nice and Healthy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft. I love this product and will recommend. I will be buying more and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> I am happy I was able to purchase this product at the price that I paid.  This is wonderful shopping with Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have my hair feeling rough when u rinse it out. It has also addressed the extremely dry parts of my hair which are generally the sides and the back. And this is only after one use. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well for African-American relaxed hair and human hair weaves. This product locks in moisture and gives hair body. Other shampoo products tend to give African-American hair volume but strip out its moisture when doing so. This is perfect for women who live in humid or dry areas where the weather can really rip the moisture out of your hair. My only complaint is that the conditioner that goes with this seems to weigh the hair down a bit so your style might lose some of it&#x27;s body but it still keeps hair looking full and healthy.</li>
            <li> As a user and lover of other Mizani products I decided to completely switch over and only use this brand. BIG BMISTAKE. After I washed my hair with this product (i used it for an entire month just to make sure it was not a fluke) my hair felt stripped dry and brittle. It was EXTREMELY tangled anhd matted, the worst it has ever been in my life and I lost so much hair combing (gently with a wide toothed comb) all of the knots out. I then switched back to Motions shampoo and my hair came out silky and smooth. Throughout my stiling process I lost a whopping 5 hairs. I&#x27;m not saying this shampoo is bad in general, but it is bad for me andvbi will NEVER be usingvbit again. Plus it smells bad. I know that probably doesn&#x27;t bother most people but I want to have a smell that I like in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and this shampoo is perfect for it. The package arrived on time and was undamaged. Thank you for offering this product.</li>
            <li> I order this product all the time.  It is a good price and the best product for my hair.  It leaves my hair soft and it keeps it looking very healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo! My hair stays silky &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo as a follow up to the Puriphying Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one much better. I used it first on my scalp only, then rinsed, and washed a second time focusing on scalp again, and then squeezing the excess onto my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt clean but not stripped! I was pretty impressed. It laters very well, and is thick and creamy. I will definitely repurchase this shampoo. It does what it claims. I will wash with it once a week.</li>
