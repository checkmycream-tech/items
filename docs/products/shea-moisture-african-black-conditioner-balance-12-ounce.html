            <li>Shea moisture has almost &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; the seb Derm and my hair is soft and looks the best it has in years.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner by far is the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>And it smells really good too, very fresh.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t just rely on that side label to tell me if it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find any of my favorite hair shampoos or conditioners</li>
            <li>and I love this conditioner as well as two SM shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I found the Jamaican formula at Ulta and bought it immediately because it was a clarifying formula that was safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I love all the SM products I use.  </li>
            <li>I have used this conditioner for about 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>In love with this and the ABS Masque.</li>
            <li>but I love this as a conditioning layer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner for seborrheic dermatitis or dry itchy scalp that I have found.  </li>
            <li>styler, even though this works fine as a styler, I like the Hibiscus Style Milk and Curl Enhancing Smoothie better</li>
            <li>It has a sickly strong bubblegum smell when you use it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair</li>
            <li>hair is fine</li>
            <li>My scalp condition has improved tremendously!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>However, it is available at Target for $9.99.  </li>
            <li>Works great when left in for a while and the rinsed.</li>
            <li>me a good hair day nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at getting out tangles and making it soft.</li>
            <li>Available at most box stores in the ethnic hair section for some odd reason because it is great for all hair.  </li>
            <li>The SM shampoos and conditioners I use, along with several really good styling products, give me a good hair day nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich you don&#x27;t need to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous sulfate free conditioners and this by far is the best..</li>
            <li>My husband uses it and it gets his oily hair extremely clean and makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li>two years I used baking soda and vinegar / castile soap and vinegar to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way this conditioner moisturizes my natural hair, makes my curls more defined, and allows me to comb through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li>Its just ok i don,t really care to reorder</li>
            <li>and I found this to be true.</li>
            <li>but I wanted a cheaper option since I wash once a week and didn&#x27;t want to go through my product so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about ingredients in beauty products, and this passed the test.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TL;DR:&lt;br /&gt;Works SUPER WELL for dandruff</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good, although I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li>I love that its all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>My hair was the most soft and detangled and moisturized it had ever been after using a &amp;#34;regular conditioner.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have had braids or natural hair for many years</li>
            <li>Not only are my scalp flakes gone but my hair also smells great and is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Had to do a lot of experimenting to find the right amount for my hair as if you use too much it can get super oily and greasy.</li>
            <li>This made my hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I use it pre-shampoo, rub it into my scalp, let it sit for a bit, use my favorite silicone free shampoo, a different high protein conditioner, followed by just a tiny bit more of this balancing conditioner, and some gel and a curl activating cream.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use another styling cream on top, sometimes I use this by itself as a conditioner only wash n&#x27; go.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple uses and it does exactly what the label says it will do.</li>
            <li>conditioner moisturized my type 4c hair so well, and I didn&#x27;t even need that much!</li>
            <li>This has helped so much!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was worried that it may be too rich but it rinsed out well and left my hair in good condition without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I understand that raw shampoo, while still sulfate free, is an entirely different animal and that it takes several uses before you get the best results</li>
            <li>I mostly use my own concoctions to do all of my natural hair maintenance, but when I too lazy to make a new batch (which is rare)</li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy patronizing a small family owned business, especially one that makes such excellent products.  </li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy patronizing a small family owned business, especially one that makes such excellent products.  </li>
            <li>This formula completely removes it and leaves my hair full of bounce.  </li>
            <li>I usually leave my protective styles in for a month and my hair still smells as good as it did after I washed it.</li>
            <li>The balancing conditioner is probably the lightest SM conditioner so those with fine hair would definitely benefit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(4a, low porosity, fine, dense hair)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a great conditioner to use along with the black african soap shampoo.</li>
            <li>This conditioner, after the first use, left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>My hair really likes the balancing conditioner, which I leave on for about 15 minutes while I&#x27;m finishing my shower.  </li>
            <li>I never knew there was such a thing as a buildup removing sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore and detangling is soo much easier.</li>
            <li>This really soothes the scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair holds styles better when wet instead of damp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it detangles my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My scalp felt tingly and nice after use and it&#x27;s not as heavy as the Style Milk.</li>
            <li>It works best at 15 mins, but due to my porosity levels I have to rinse it completely out if I leave-in for 15 mins because my hair has basically dried</li>
            <li>I have fine 3a curls that are weighed down very easily, but also a very dry flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>I know most conditioners are a little too much to put on the scalp, but that&#x27;s the whole point of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Make sure all are in the Black Soap</li>
            <li>My favorite detangler for my African American curls.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the balancing conditioner and all the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the balancing conditioner and all the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned.  </li>
            <li>If u have type 4c hair like me I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff for bad</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for natural hair girls!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this bottle has the most discusting smell!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair (but a lot of it) down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to comb through my hair but after using this product I can comb through my hair with ease and it&#x27;s very little shedding.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was a little thick but besides that these products work great.</li>
            <li>As you can imagine, it&#x27;s hard to find a product with enough moisture to keep my scalp happy, but not so much that my curls go limp and droopy.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of styling products plus hairspray and therefore my hair is frequently quite sticky.  </li>
            <li>I am a complete convert.  </li>
            <li>And SM products do not contain silicone, for those who are sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>SM products are sold at Ulta, Walgreens, CVS and Target for about $11 each and are frequently on sale.  </li>
            <li>SM products are sold at Ulta, Walgreens, CVS and Target for about $11 each and are frequently on sale.  </li>
            <li>It doe snot make my hair soft at all.  </li>
            <li>It completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li>It gave my curls definition and bounce plus my hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li>But I recently found out that Walgreens and Target offer this product at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair got really soft  </li>
            <li>My hair was so soft once i washed it out.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for something that would keep the flakes and itching in control but not destroy my hair</li>
            <li>My favorite Shea Moisture products are from the The Raw Butter line, and I had never bothered to really try anything else from their other hair care lines.</li>
            <li>The Shea Moisture African Black Soap Conditioner works just fine on my hair.</li>
            <li>I always deep conditioner after rinsing out the regular conditioner, but after using this I don&#x27;t think I really needed to.</li>
            <li>No fancy Selsun Blue or T-Gel ever fixed my problems like this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the raw shea butter shampoo the most frequently and every third or fourth time, I use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil buildup removing formula.  </li>
            <li>Most regular conditioners make my seb Derm worse and the itching unbearable.  </li>
            <li>My hair feel so much healthier and fuller, with less hair loss.</li>
            <li>really like the smell, but if you&#x27;re not used to how African black soap smells</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair was the most soft and detangled and moisturized it had ever been after using a &amp;#34;regular conditioner.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have had braids or natural hair for many years</li>
            <li> Not only are my scalp flakes gone but my hair also smells great and is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Had to do a lot of experimenting to find the right amount for my hair as if you use too much it can get super oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> I use it pre-shampoo, rub it into my scalp, let it sit for a bit, use my favorite silicone free shampoo, a different high protein conditioner, followed by just a tiny bit more of this balancing conditioner, and some gel and a curl activating cream.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use another styling cream on top, sometimes I use this by itself as a conditioner only wash n&#x27; go.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I love the multiple uses and it does exactly what the label says it will do.</li>
            <li> conditioner moisturized my type 4c hair so well, and I didn&#x27;t even need that much!</li>
            <li> This has helped so much!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was worried that it may be too rich but it rinsed out well and left my hair in good condition without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I understand that raw shampoo, while still sulfate free, is an entirely different animal and that it takes several uses before you get the best results</li>
            <li> I mostly use my own concoctions to do all of my natural hair maintenance, but when I too lazy to make a new batch (which is rare)</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy patronizing a small family owned business, especially one that makes such excellent products.  </li>

            <li> This formula completely removes it and leaves my hair full of bounce.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave my protective styles in for a month and my hair still smells as good as it did after I washed it.</li>
            <li> The balancing conditioner is probably the lightest SM conditioner so those with fine hair would definitely benefit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(4a, low porosity, fine, dense hair)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great conditioner to use along with the black african soap shampoo.</li>
            <li> This conditioner, after the first use, left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My hair really likes the balancing conditioner, which I leave on for about 15 minutes while I&#x27;m finishing my shower.  </li>
            <li> I never knew there was such a thing as a buildup removing sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore and detangling is soo much easier.</li>
            <li> This really soothes the scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair holds styles better when wet instead of damp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it detangles my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My scalp felt tingly and nice after use and it&#x27;s not as heavy as the Style Milk.</li>
            <li> It works best at 15 mins, but due to my porosity levels I have to rinse it completely out if I leave-in for 15 mins because my hair has basically dried</li>
            <li> I have fine 3a curls that are weighed down very easily, but also a very dry flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> I know most conditioners are a little too much to put on the scalp, but that&#x27;s the whole point of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Make sure all are in the Black Soap</li>
            <li> My favorite detangler for my African American curls.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the balancing conditioner and all the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the balancing conditioner and all the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned.  </li>
            <li> If u have type 4c hair like me I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for bad</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for natural hair girls!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this bottle has the most discusting smell!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (but a lot of it) down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to comb through my hair but after using this product I can comb through my hair with ease and it&#x27;s very little shedding.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was a little thick but besides that these products work great.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine, it&#x27;s hard to find a product with enough moisture to keep my scalp happy, but not so much that my curls go limp and droopy.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of styling products plus hairspray and therefore my hair is frequently quite sticky.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete convert.  </li>
            <li> And SM products do not contain silicone, for those who are sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> SM products are sold at Ulta, Walgreens, CVS and Target for about $11 each and are frequently on sale.  </li>

            <li> It completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li> It gave my curls definition and bounce plus my hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li> But I recently found out that Walgreens and Target offer this product at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair got really soft  </li>
            <li> My hair was so soft once i washed it out.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for something that would keep the flakes and itching in control but not destroy my hair</li>
            <li> My favorite Shea Moisture products are from the The Raw Butter line, and I had never bothered to really try anything else from their other hair care lines.</li>
            <li> The Shea Moisture African Black Soap Conditioner works just fine on my hair.</li>
            <li> I always deep conditioner after rinsing out the regular conditioner, but after using this I don&#x27;t think I really needed to.</li>
            <li> No fancy Selsun Blue or T-Gel ever fixed my problems like this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the raw shea butter shampoo the most frequently and every third or fourth time, I use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil buildup removing formula.  </li>
            <li> Most regular conditioners make my seb Derm worse and the itching unbearable.  </li>
            <li> My hair feel so much healthier and fuller, with less hair loss.</li>
            <li> really like the smell, but if you&#x27;re not used to how African black soap smells</li>
            <li> It is a little pricier than other conditioners but worth it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> However, some reviewers have stated that SM products left their hair extremely tangled or matted.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Made my scalp itch and dryer than it already was</li>
            <li> Works really good for my oily hair type.</li>
            <li> Its just ok i don,t really care to reorder</li>
            <li> I purchased the conditioner at Walgreens while on vacation with family. It&#x27;s between $10-$11 at both Target and Walgreens. I WILL NOT use my families beauty products/toiletries. I just prefer not to use harsh chemicals on my body. Shea Moisture brand does not formulate their products with a whole list of bad chemicals. They list down the side of all of their products that they DO NOT contain the mainstream baddies. I also don&#x27;t just rely on that side label to tell me if it&#x27;s safe. I look at the ingredients too and I can&#x27;t find anything harmful in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it was a must for me to stop and pick up the product brands I like. They were out of stock of the [[ASIN:B0038TVHGG Shea Moisture Organic Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo]] &amp; [[ASIN:B0038TYTI4 Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative conditioner - 12 oz.]] So I went with [[ASIN:B0089N6YA0 Shea Moisture ORGANIC African Black Soap Balancing Conditioner [SEALED]]] instead and some [[ASIN:B0038TXGL0 Shea Moisture ORGANIC Coconut &amp; Hibicus Curl &amp; Shine Shampoo]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair feel squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like banana life savers and that&#x27;s good for me because when I ate life savers, the tropical ones were my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine but I have a lot of it and it&#x27;s long. It goes all the way down to my butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about 12 squirts of this conditioner and work it through my hair after washing. I do a lot of yard work so when I come in with matted hair, twigs and leaves in my hair and bug bites, this conditioner works into my hair like silk and helps me to get through all of the knots. It soothes the bug bites as it rinses from my hair. I don&#x27;t fully rinse it all out either. I leave some of it in and it acts as a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t been able to find any of my favorite hair shampoos or conditioners then I would have just purchase baking soda as the shampoo and vinegar for the conditioner and would have just mixed each one separately with water and used the baking soda paste as the hair wash and the diluted vinegar as the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I have Caucasian hair and I love this conditioner as well as two SM shampoos.  I use the raw shea butter shampoo the most frequently and every third or fourth time, I use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil buildup removing formula.  My hair really likes the balancing conditioner, which I leave on for about 15 minutes while I&#x27;m finishing my shower.  I discovered SM raw shampoo after reading the online reviews.  Several of the reviewers had Caucasian hair and were raving about this formula.  I understand that raw shampoo, while still sulfate free, is an entirely different animal and that it takes several uses before you get the best results and I found this to be true. But once my hair adjusted to it, the results were impressive.  In the drugstore, SM products are in the section devoted to African American hair care, so I never gave them a glance.  I found the Jamaican formula at Ulta and bought it immediately because it was a clarifying formula that was safe for color treated hair.  I never knew there was such a thing as a buildup removing sulfate free shampoo. And it&#x27;s fantastic.  I use a lot of styling products plus hairspray and therefore my hair is frequently quite sticky.  This formula completely removes it and leaves my hair full of bounce.  I also use the 10 in 1 mask as well as the raw shea butter mask for about an hour using a heat cap.  The  balancing conditioner never weighs my hair down or makes it look greasy.  For those with oily hair or dandruff, the African Black Soap shampoo works wonders.  My husband uses it and it gets his oily hair extremely clean and makes it shiny.  The balancing conditioner is probably the lightest SM conditioner so those with fine hair would definitely benefit.  And it smells really good too, very fresh.  I love all the SM products I use.  I am a complete convert.  And SM products do not contain silicone, for those who are sensitive to it.  The SM shampoos and conditioners I use, along with several really good styling products, give me a good hair day nearly every day.  I will not go back to what I was using before.  However, some reviewers have stated that SM products left their hair extremely tangled or matted.  My hair is very long and I have not had that experience.  On the contrary; the conditioners have plenty of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; for detangling. However,  I do thoroughly brush my hair out before I shampoo, which can help such a situation.  SM products are sold at Ulta, Walgreens, CVS and Target for about $11 each and are frequently on sale.  However, none of these stores carry the entire line of products, which is disappointing.  Amazon definitely has a larger range of SM items including the body care line.  I truly agree with the bulk of the reviewers that this hair care line is really amazing.  I particularly enjoy patronizing a small family owned business, especially one that makes such excellent products.  I highly recommend the balancing conditioner and all the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned.  Try them!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!e me a good hair day nearly every day.

            <li> I mostly use my own concoctions to do all of my natural hair maintenance, but when I too lazy to make a new batch (which is rare) I use this product line. I&#x27;m 4a-c combination and it works great for my combination.</li>
            <li> This is one of my holy grail hair products. I have fine 3a curls that are weighed down very easily, but also a very dry flaky scalp. As you can imagine, it&#x27;s hard to find a product with enough moisture to keep my scalp happy, but not so much that my curls go limp and droopy. The balancing conditioner does exactly that, it makes my hair happy AND my scalp happy. I use it pre-shampoo, rub it into my scalp, let it sit for a bit, use my favorite silicone free shampoo, a different high protein conditioner, followed by just a tiny bit more of this balancing conditioner, and some gel and a curl activating cream. I&#x27;ve finally found my routine for perfect, bouncy, shiny curls that are on top of a happy, dandruff free scalp!</li>
            <li> Good healing ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for about 2 years and love it. Unfortunately this bottle has the most discusting smell!! I honestly can&#x27;t use it without then having to shampoo again to rid my hair of the smell! Don&#x27;t know why this bottle smells different but it does and I am too late to return the product as I didn&#x27;t open and start using it u til this week! Waste of $15 bucks as I will ha e to toss it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell but this works as a great pre-shampoo. I massage it into my scalp and let it sit for about 30 minutes. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch anymore and detangling is soo much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black. curly coliy hair. I bought this and my hair didn&#x27;t like. My hair likes plain old raw African black soap. But I was having issues with some type of skin condition on my legs and thighs. I don&#x27;t even know what it was. I started using this conditioner  like a lotion and it went away never to be seen again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Left my locs with a shine and fullness that I was missing. I highly recommend this product for natural hair girls!</li>
            <li> Used this along with my medicated shampoo. Didn&#x27;t see where it made a difference though, but smells great. Will keep using it as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have become a regular user of several Shea Moisture products.  I love that its all natural ingredients.  The balancing conditioner resolved my itchy scalp problems and my hair justs reacts so well to it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I have terrible scalp enzyme, and without this it would itch like crazy. This really soothes the scalp. My hair feel so much healthier and fuller, with less hair loss. Use it at least 3 times a week. It&#x27;s so rich you don&#x27;t need to use it. Either use it as a pre-wash hair mask or after shampoo conditioner. Just leave in for at least 10 min before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference if I use this product.  It doe snot make my hair soft at all.  It does not lather even a bit; maybe because we have hard water :(</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for seborrheic dermatitis or dry itchy scalp that I have found.  I have searched high and low for something that would keep the flakes and itching in control but not destroy my hair and this product is it.  Most regular conditioners make my seb Derm worse and the itching unbearable.  Medicated shampoos and conditioners keep the seb Derm in check but made my hair like straw.  Shea moisture has almost &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; the seb Derm and my hair is soft and looks the best it has in years.  Even got rid of the redness and flakes in my eyebrows and around nose.  It is a little pricier than other conditioners but worth it.  shop around for best price.  Available at most box stores in the ethnic hair section for some odd reason because it is great for all hair.  A little goes a long way.  There is a slight odor when applying due to the tea tree oil I think but it dissipates after drying and leaves a vanilla like scent that my hubby loves.  Also agree that the pump does not work great.  Too thick.</li>
            <li> In love with this and the ABS Masque. This conditioner, after the first use, left my hair feeling clean. I co-washed with the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Shine and Curl Conditioner. I used this afterwards as a 15 min leave-in and rinsed. My curls popped so hard I didn&#x27;t know what to do. It completely changed my hair. By change I mean it enhanced each of my the coils. My scalp felt tingly and nice after use and it&#x27;s not as heavy as the Style Milk. I used this as a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. leave-in without rinse out, with wonderful results. Sometimes I use another styling cream on top, sometimes I use this by itself as a conditioner only wash n&#x27; go.&lt;br /&gt;2. leave-in and rinse out, the instructions state to leave-in for 5-15 mins for a condition treatment. It works best at 15 mins, but due to my porosity levels I have to rinse it completely out if I leave-in for 15 mins because my hair has basically dried and it will not work for me when I go to style it. My hair holds styles better when wet instead of damp.&lt;br /&gt;3. Pre-poo, did a good job but I wanted a cheaper option since I wash once a week and didn&#x27;t want to go through my product so quickly. For me, sticking with Olive Oil as an overnight pre-poo worked better.&lt;br /&gt;4. styler, even though this works fine as a styler, I like the Hibiscus Style Milk and Curl Enhancing Smoothie better but I love this as a conditioning layer.&lt;br /&gt;5. LCO method, for me water is my liquid and I will use this as the cream and seal with Olive Oil. It kept my hair moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my best hair buys of the year. I love the multiple uses and it does exactly what the label says it will do. I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4a, low porosity, fine, dense hair)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great conditioner to use along with the black african soap shampoo. Moisturizes deep without leaving a residue and also helps rinse away the shampoo from my locs.Since purchasing this product I have used the Shea Moisture African Black Balancing Conditioner as my main hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I brought this today at Sallys beauty store along with the shampoo. The shampoo was a little thick but besides that these products work great. I&#x27;ve tried numerous sulfate free conditioners and this by far is the best..It gave my curls definition and bounce plus my hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner and my hair felt dry like a straw. There is no way ill buy this again. I am very disappointed with the product. Do not purchase if you want moisture.</li>
            <li> My favorite detangler for my African American curls. It does not work as a leave-in, styler or deep conditioner. It is extremely light and creamy but what it does do in terms if detangling is incredible. I love this stuff. For me it does one function but it does it well!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is great because we&#x27;ve used it before.  However, the product came without the pump piece.  We use this product for our kids and the pump aspect makes it convenient and less messy.  So I&#x27;m definitly bummed that it came without the pump piece.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve never been able to comb through my hair but after using this product I can comb through my hair with ease and it&#x27;s very little shedding. I usually leave my protective styles in for a month and my hair still smells as good as it did after I washed it. If u have type 4c hair like me I highly recommend this product. My hair is now longer, thicker, and fuller then it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works great for my psoriasis on the scalp.  I use the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent conditioner. The first time I used it I was worried that it may be too rich but it rinsed out well and left my hair in good condition without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve used plenty of salon hair products and I&#x27;d say this is as good as the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee as a detangler &amp; it smells like greatness.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. But I recently found out that Walgreens and Target offer this product at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for both conditioning and balancing your scalp. However, it is available at Target for $9.99.  Don&#x27;t pay an inflated price.</li>
            <li> I only use one or two pumps of the conditioner on my hair. It&#x27;s good at getting out tangles and making it soft. Had to do a lot of experimenting to find the right amount for my hair as if you use too much it can get super oily and greasy. Overall pretty good, although I don&#x27;t care for the smell. It has a sickly strong bubblegum smell when you use it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> The Shea Moisture African Black Soap Conditioner works just fine on my hair. I have kinky curly 4 b/c hair and this smells awesome and it detangles my hair really well. The reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it seems to not moisturize it as well as I want yet it does the job I think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner as a leave-in and it works wonderfully.  It is so moisturiizing, and leaves my curls poping and shiny.  Never, would have thought of leaving this in my hair due to my low-porosity hair, but, it works great.  No residue or flakes.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for this conditioner&#x27;s counterpart shampoo, but here&#x27;s my conditioner review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. Like, LIFECHANGING amazing. If you are thinking between either the shampoo or the conditioner, I&#x27;d pick the conditioner. That being said, if you&#x27;re suffering with dandruff it&#x27;s best to get both.&lt;br /&gt;For two years I used baking soda and vinegar / castile soap and vinegar to clean my hair. After having that WORSEN my already bad dandruff, I did some research and chose this stuff. I&#x27;m super picky about ingredients in beauty products, and this passed the test. Willow bark, tea tree, salicylic acid. Awesome stuff for bad scalps.&lt;br /&gt;I leave the shampoo on for a couple minutes and then leave this stuff on for 5 minutes. I know most conditioners are a little too much to put on the scalp, but that&#x27;s the whole point of this stuff. Put it alllll over your hair. And use a lot. I have to use a lot of the product to get the result I&#x27;m looking for. I have fine hair (but a lot of it) down to my shoulders. And I use at least 6 pumps for my desired coverage.&lt;br /&gt;If the application feels a little tingly or burn-y, it&#x27;s probably doing its job. If it hurts a lot, discontinue use.&lt;br /&gt;After about a month, this stuff has SERIOUSLY cleared my scalp. Like nothing else. No fancy Selsun Blue or T-Gel ever fixed my problems like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just starting out, I recommend getting this with the shampoo, the Intensive Scalp Elixir (if you itch at your scalp between washes) and the Hair Masque. Make sure all are in the Black Soap line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR:&lt;br /&gt;Works SUPER WELL for dandruff&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Kind of expensive for such a small bottle&lt;br /&gt;You use a lot per wash&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell, but if you&#x27;re not used to how African black soap smells it might take some getting used to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is a 12/10</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner plus smell is awesome  my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair got really soft  def ll order more !!</li>
            <li> My favorite Shea Moisture products are from the The Raw Butter line, and I had never bothered to really try anything else from their other hair care lines. What caught my eye about the African Black Soap line was that it says that it helps with dry itchy scalp and clears up psoriasis. I can tell you from using the Purification Masque from this line, that it does everything that it says. My scalp condition has improved tremendously! I decided that I wanted to try the conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner moisturized my type 4c hair so well, and I didn&#x27;t even need that much! I always deep conditioner after rinsing out the regular conditioner, but after using this I don&#x27;t think I really needed to. My hair was the most soft and detangled and moisturized it had ever been after using a &amp;#34;regular conditioner.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing find for me. I have had braids or natural hair for many years and I have tried many products.  This made my hair soft and easy to manage.  I went to get my hair braided after washing with Black African Soap and Shea Moisture and the lady who does my hair wanted to know what products I had used.  This softs which helps with breaking down the packiness and it detangles.</li>
            <li> Works great when left in for a while and the rinsed.</li>
            <li> I love this Conditioners, it has great slip and it has a great smell. My hair was so soft once i washed it out. I was looking for a great detangleing conditioner and I found it!!</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and have tried just about every product on the market. This conditioner by far is the best product I&#x27;ve used. Not only are my scalp flakes gone but my hair also smells great and is soft and manageable. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It tangled my hair I am very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way this conditioner moisturizes my natural hair, makes my curls more defined, and allows me to comb through my hair with ease. I&#x27;ve seen m. ore growth and thickness since using this product</li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from a dry, flaky scalp.  This has helped so much! We love Shea moisture products anyway, use the soaps &amp; lotions, but I am very impressed with this line of shampoo and conditioner. I use it, and my hair is shiny, and not weighed down. Love it.</li>
