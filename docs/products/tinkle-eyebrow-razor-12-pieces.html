            <li>Glad I found these!</li>

            <li>I love these to shave my peach fuzz off my face!</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>These are great razors, the genuine product.</li>
            <li>I like these and will continue to use them but find that I get a kind of razor burn with them...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great service!  </li>
            <li>The real tinkle razors are awesome.</li>
            <li>I got my mom &amp; aunt some of these because they are so nice....</li>
            <li>REAL Tinkle razors are so amazing!!</li>
            <li>Works great to when you want a quick fix to stray hairs and don&#x27;t have time to pluck or wax.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great to get rid of some of that super light/blonde hair around your jawbone.  </li>
            <li>Use them for full face shaving, love em!!</li>
            <li>Cut at an angle, it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very, very easy to do, but youtube</li>
            <li>these are the best so far</li>
            <li>The eyebrow razors are perfect for removing peach fuzz on my face and unwanted hair near my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>use them for the very fine hair on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>Love love love these razors!</li>
            <li>But, they are a good quality for disposable eyebrow razors and I also really enjoy that I got a bundle of so many</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about taking one of these to my face.</li>
            <li>and I really am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Just ease up on it :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold the razor the correct way for a non-irrational dermaplane.</li>
            <li>I thought that these would be easier to use and more efficient than a razor to use on my face,since it is just peach fuzz like hair.</li>
            <li>apply your favorite moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better quality razors out there, but I like these.</li>
            <li>works better than the kai brand</li>
            <li>They mostly just scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought these might be a great time saver, but I don&#x27;t really care for them.</li>
            <li>I Love these for Dermaplaining my face.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>the more it seems you may cut yourself.</li>
            <li>I will probably use these all eventually, but I&#x27;m not as in love with them as a thought.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, I don&#x27;t feel like a man when I shave my face with these</li>
            <li>My derm told me that more hair makes it easier for dirt to get stuck in pores, and cause acne.</li>
            <li>There are no words to describe how much I love these things.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more satisfying than scraping away peach fuzz off your face.</li>
            <li>Perfect for use over a larger area.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gotten friends hooked on these as well :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup looks better and stays on longer.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>much sharper and a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>I watched a video about using these on your face, found the size to be very useful!</li>
            <li>but I get a clean, nice shape from it.</li>
            <li>Can be reused many times before becoming dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Yes, You have to keep it up, but it&#x27;s really faster than anything else that I was doing before, and it&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li>Facial shaving is great and light and the length of them help make more defined arches in the brow area.</li>
            <li>Easy to use: these razors are super easy to use and do not require any shaving cream :)</li>
            <li>Look up Michelle Money&#x27;s youtube on these, hilarious, but true.</li>
            <li>When those hairs are gone, your face is a very smooth surface, and it reflects light back very cleanly and brightly.</li>
            <li>Razors were packaged fine.  </li>
            <li>these seem to work fine, I just break out whenever I use them to shave the peach fuzz on my face so probably not going to use them anymore.</li>
            <li>Great for all the fine blonde baby hairs around my eyebrows!!</li>
            <li>I own REAL tinkle eyebrow razors &amp; these</li>
            <li>They are flimsy &amp; tinkle razors aren&#x27;t &amp; they tear your hair like cheap, cheap razors do.</li>
            <li>but overall they are a great razor.</li>
            <li>I use it once a month and keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li>Used them with more success on my chin.</li>
            <li>As Ive been consulted that laser hair removal doesn&#x27;t work on light hair</li>
            <li>These are great, use soap or shaving cream, if you are using for facial peach fuzz or hair.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because, even if you can&#x27;t see the hairs, they must somehow scatter the light that hits your face or something.</li>
            <li>Authentic packaging has a trademark on the bottom right hand corner that says DORCO, these dont have that marking.</li>
            <li>The price was right for how many that I purchased.</li>
            <li>They are oaky but not near as good as a razor and more time consuming.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I checked, and yes I did get the original and not the fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wanted to say that while I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, I did indeed get the original trademarked &amp;#34;DORCO&amp;#34; Tinkle razors with this order, not the knock-offs that seem so prevalent out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try them, a la Michelle Money.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase these after I watched the Michelle Money youtube video</li>
            <li>and they the perfect razor for my small peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>since I started, my acne has reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these since they don&#x27;t sell them around here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried electric facial hair trimmers, a disposable razor and dipilitories to remove troublesome hair on my chin (post-menopausal problem shared by many women) and non worked as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>skin is as clean as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>These do what they say they&#x27;ll do and worked out just great for me.......with a light hand, and being careful.  </li>
            <li>Too large, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered so many at once.</li>
            <li>They work great and are big enough to cover more!</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful earrings and very well made will definitely turn my friends onto these!</li>
            <li>But sticking to noxema because their razor is more reasonably sized.</li>
            <li>You might get skin irritation if you go over the spot so many times but just don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>Anyway, after getting it done professionally they told me I could do upkeep with these handy razors at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these, they work so much bettter than the ones from the store.</li>
            <li>and they last a fair amount of time as well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;;ve purchased these before at a local Drug store and these are much sharper and a great value.</li>
            <li>This product has been great to clean up the little fuzzy hairs I have on my face.</li>
            <li>Great little tool for &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This product is well worth the price</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have only used this once or twice.</li>
            <li>I bought extras because I knew that my coworkers and adult daughter would love these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sharp, good quality.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blades do not start right at the uppermost part</li>
            <li>but I am positive they are knockoffs!</li>
            <li>esthetician used one on my brows and it was super fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>but I prefer Noxzemas version better because they are smaller and easier to use.</li>
            <li>So smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the price is better and they work well enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>If I use the same one too many times I break out.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely terrified that I&#x27;m going to saw off my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>So much better than the ones you can get in the local stores!!</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s better than shaving your face with a regular razor though, which I have never done.</li>
            <li>This is my best kept beauty secret!</li>
            <li>You have much more precision than with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>they are exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>These are 10 times better than what I have used from my local drug store.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I use them pretty consistently</li>
            <li>It is cheap, sharp &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and soft after using.</li>
            <li>It removes unwanted hair and leaves my clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I got these because of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>The razor head is way too large.</li>
            <li>These work fine for eyebrow shaping, but I had bought them for &amp;#34;facial planing&amp;#34; which I had seen on TV and after I bought them I realized that facial planing is NOT something I want to do.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to make a mistake and harder to grasp the right hairs do to the fact that you go towards hair growth instead of against.</li>
            <li>Really like.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>can see a lot of hair that they don&#x27;t shave off, and it&#x27;s really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>work really well to exfoliate, but I find that FT Shiseido razor is gentler for exfoliating compare to these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily the price is SO cheap and they do wonders for my face, so the benefits outweigh the price big time.</li>
            <li>but these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>But the ones I got in the 12-pack seem to be the real deal</li>
            <li>Dull...Don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>Worked really well and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin.</li>
            <li>Love these… just be careful to use them correctly.</li>
            <li>Much sharper.</li>
            <li>I like that I can get multi-packs for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>so I do not have to worry about using the brand that&#x27;s available to me locally.</li>
            <li>I use these on my whole face to help exfoliate, remove &#x27;peachy&#x27; fuzz and create a youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>These eyebrow razors works very well.</li>
            <li>I really just tried them out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have that much space to work with.</li>
            <li>Very easy to get the hang of &#x27;dermaplanning&#x27; with these little razors.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp, cuts through those stubby black hairs easily without any tugging.</li>
            <li>Makes my dead skin sloth off quickly, and the after results leave my skin feeling as smooth as a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an unusual amount of facial hair for a woman, just tiny fuzz as I assume most of us have.</li>
            <li>It also does a decent job on the peach fuzz as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure these are not authentic Tinkle razors.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as high quality as the ones I have purchased at the beauty store.</li>
            <li>They came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Use on clean, dry skin...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I found that using these really irritated the skin around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They are precise and do not get dull quickly.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have any stores near by that sell them, this is a simple and quick way to get them.  </li>
            <li>Open them right away, and request a return and refund if they&#x27;re not the originals.  </li>
            <li>A little too large to comfortably use under eyebrows, as the razor head is close to 1 1/2 inches in size.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and sharp.</li>
            <li>does a fantastic job with blonde facial hair and shaping eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and last a long time</li>
            <li>As far as the mustache thing, swipe, swipe, gone!</li>
            <li>first went to a dermatologist and a medical esthetician to get what is called dermaplaning.</li>
            <li>The blade is huge like a inch and a half.</li>
            <li>so I feel fine about disposing of them after a few uses.</li>
            <li>The originals have a smooth handle, while the fakes feel a little bit textured.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to save a little money and time spent at the salon.</li>
            <li>Quick service and product was what I expected!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for microplaning but a little too wide for eyebrows unless you&#x27;re really careful.</li>
            <li>Completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have a battery operated tiny shaver that works much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they were a day early.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products like them and they didn&#x27;t work and weren&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and I never shaved with a normal shaver in fear of it growing back thicker.</li>
            <li>I ordered a 3-pack from a different seller a few months prior, and the product was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This is a great little beauty secret I&#x27;m sharing with all my friends.</li>
            <li>I would just be careful and make sure you watch a video or read how to use them properly because they are sharp and can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Must be used like a straight razor, so be careful.</li>
            <li>especially under and around brows, upper lip and cheeks near the ears, I just use this and zip, zip, zip, it&#x27;s gone with no redness!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razors I received are dull and rough, also I noticed differences between authentic Tinkle razor packaging and this packaging.</li>
            <li>I use this on my sideburns where I normally would wax them, and I get absolutely NO ingrown</li>
            <li>As if they have been stores in a hot warehouse and the glue holding them together has been dried up.</li>
            <li>You really have to move the razor down at an angle to cut anything and the deeper the angle,</li>
            <li>Also found it really hard to actually get a useful angle on the eyebrows.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use this razor for shaving all over my face and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price-- nice to stock up on!!</li>
            <li> For that, I was using an epilator, which didn&#x27;t do a great job</li>
            <li> I use them along my jawline, and it&#x27;s great how exfoliating it is.</li>
            <li> These razors are great-</li>
            <li> I got these to help take care of some unwanted chin hairs - which they work great on - as well as eyebrow hairs (and no pain - unlike plucking).</li>

            <li> Glad I found these!</li>
            <li> I use once or twice a week and love it!</li>
            <li> Love these things!  </li>
            <li> I love these to shave my peach fuzz off my face!</li>
            <li> I love these!  </li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> These are great razors, the genuine product.</li>
            <li> I like these and will continue to use them but find that I get a kind of razor burn with them...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great service!  </li>
            <li> The real tinkle razors are awesome.</li>
            <li> I got my mom &amp; aunt some of these because they are so nice....</li>
            <li> REAL Tinkle razors are so amazing!!</li>
            <li> Works great to when you want a quick fix to stray hairs and don&#x27;t have time to pluck or wax.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great to get rid of some of that super light/blonde hair around your jawbone.  </li>
            <li> Use them for full face shaving, love em!!</li>
            <li> Cut at an angle, it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very easy to do, but youtube</li>
            <li> these are the best so far</li>
            <li> The eyebrow razors are perfect for removing peach fuzz on my face and unwanted hair near my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> use them for the very fine hair on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> Love love love these razors!</li>
            <li> But, they are a good quality for disposable eyebrow razors and I also really enjoy that I got a bundle of so many</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about taking one of these to my face.</li>
            <li> and I really am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Just ease up on it :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold the razor the correct way for a non-irrational dermaplane.</li>
            <li> I thought that these would be easier to use and more efficient than a razor to use on my face,since it is just peach fuzz like hair.</li>
            <li> apply your favorite moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better quality razors out there, but I like these.</li>
            <li> works better than the kai brand</li>
            <li> They mostly just scratch the skin.  </li>
            <li> I thought these might be a great time saver, but I don&#x27;t really care for them.</li>
            <li> I Love these for Dermaplaining my face.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> the more it seems you may cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I will probably use these all eventually, but I&#x27;m not as in love with them as a thought.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, I don&#x27;t feel like a man when I shave my face with these</li>
            <li> My derm told me that more hair makes it easier for dirt to get stuck in pores, and cause acne.</li>
            <li> There are no words to describe how much I love these things.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more satisfying than scraping away peach fuzz off your face.</li>
            <li> Perfect for use over a larger area.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gotten friends hooked on these as well :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup looks better and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> much sharper and a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE these.  </li>
            <li> I watched a video about using these on your face, found the size to be very useful!</li>
            <li> but I get a clean, nice shape from it.</li>
            <li> Can be reused many times before becoming dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Yes, You have to keep it up, but it&#x27;s really faster than anything else that I was doing before, and it&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li> Facial shaving is great and light and the length of them help make more defined arches in the brow area.</li>
            <li> Easy to use: these razors are super easy to use and do not require any shaving cream :)</li>
            <li> Look up Michelle Money&#x27;s youtube on these, hilarious, but true.</li>
            <li> When those hairs are gone, your face is a very smooth surface, and it reflects light back very cleanly and brightly.</li>
            <li> Razors were packaged fine.  </li>
            <li> these seem to work fine, I just break out whenever I use them to shave the peach fuzz on my face so probably not going to use them anymore.</li>
            <li> Great for all the fine blonde baby hairs around my eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> I own REAL tinkle eyebrow razors &amp; these</li>
            <li> They are flimsy &amp; tinkle razors aren&#x27;t &amp; they tear your hair like cheap, cheap razors do.</li>
            <li> but overall they are a great razor.</li>
            <li> I use it once a month and keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li> Used them with more success on my chin.</li>
            <li> As Ive been consulted that laser hair removal doesn&#x27;t work on light hair</li>
            <li> These are great, use soap or shaving cream, if you are using for facial peach fuzz or hair.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because, even if you can&#x27;t see the hairs, they must somehow scatter the light that hits your face or something.</li>
            <li> Authentic packaging has a trademark on the bottom right hand corner that says DORCO, these dont have that marking.</li>
            <li> The price was right for how many that I purchased.</li>
            <li> They are oaky but not near as good as a razor and more time consuming.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I checked, and yes I did get the original and not the fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that while I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, I did indeed get the original trademarked &amp;#34;DORCO&amp;#34; Tinkle razors with this order, not the knock-offs that seem so prevalent out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try them, a la Michelle Money.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase these after I watched the Michelle Money youtube video</li>
            <li> and they the perfect razor for my small peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> since I started, my acne has reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these since they don&#x27;t sell them around here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric facial hair trimmers, a disposable razor and dipilitories to remove troublesome hair on my chin (post-menopausal problem shared by many women) and non worked as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> skin is as clean as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> These do what they say they&#x27;ll do and worked out just great for me.......with a light hand, and being careful.  </li>
            <li> Too large, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered so many at once.</li>
            <li> They work great and are big enough to cover more!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful earrings and very well made will definitely turn my friends onto these!</li>
            <li> But sticking to noxema because their razor is more reasonably sized.</li>
            <li> You might get skin irritation if you go over the spot so many times but just don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after getting it done professionally they told me I could do upkeep with these handy razors at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these, they work so much bettter than the ones from the store.</li>
            <li> and they last a fair amount of time as well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;;ve purchased these before at a local Drug store and these are much sharper and a great value.</li>
            <li> This product has been great to clean up the little fuzzy hairs I have on my face.</li>
            <li> Great little tool for &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This product is well worth the price</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have only used this once or twice.</li>
            <li> I bought extras because I knew that my coworkers and adult daughter would love these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp, good quality.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blades do not start right at the uppermost part</li>
            <li> but I am positive they are knockoffs!</li>
            <li> esthetician used one on my brows and it was super fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> but I prefer Noxzemas version better because they are smaller and easier to use.</li>
            <li> So smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the price is better and they work well enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> If I use the same one too many times I break out.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely terrified that I&#x27;m going to saw off my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> So much better than the ones you can get in the local stores!!</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s better than shaving your face with a regular razor though, which I have never done.</li>
            <li> This is my best kept beauty secret!</li>
            <li> You have much more precision than with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> they are exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> These are 10 times better than what I have used from my local drug store.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I use them pretty consistently</li>
            <li> It is cheap, sharp &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean and soft after using.</li>
            <li> It removes unwanted hair and leaves my clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I got these because of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> The razor head is way too large.</li>
            <li> These work fine for eyebrow shaping, but I had bought them for &amp;#34;facial planing&amp;#34; which I had seen on TV and after I bought them I realized that facial planing is NOT something I want to do.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to make a mistake and harder to grasp the right hairs do to the fact that you go towards hair growth instead of against.</li>
            <li> Really like.</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> can see a lot of hair that they don&#x27;t shave off, and it&#x27;s really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> work really well to exfoliate, but I find that FT Shiseido razor is gentler for exfoliating compare to these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily the price is SO cheap and they do wonders for my face, so the benefits outweigh the price big time.</li>
            <li> but these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> But the ones I got in the 12-pack seem to be the real deal</li>
            <li> Dull...Don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> These work really well</li>
            <li> Worked really well and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin.</li>
            <li> Love these… just be careful to use them correctly.</li>
            <li> Much sharper.</li>
            <li> I like that I can get multi-packs for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> so I do not have to worry about using the brand that&#x27;s available to me locally.</li>
            <li> I use these on my whole face to help exfoliate, remove &#x27;peachy&#x27; fuzz and create a youthful glow.  </li>
            <li> These eyebrow razors works very well.</li>
            <li> I really just tried them out of curiosity.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have that much space to work with.</li>
            <li> Very easy to get the hang of &#x27;dermaplanning&#x27; with these little razors.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp, cuts through those stubby black hairs easily without any tugging.</li>
            <li> Makes my dead skin sloth off quickly, and the after results leave my skin feeling as smooth as a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an unusual amount of facial hair for a woman, just tiny fuzz as I assume most of us have.</li>
            <li> It also does a decent job on the peach fuzz as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these are not authentic Tinkle razors.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as high quality as the ones I have purchased at the beauty store.</li>
            <li> They came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Use on clean, dry skin...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I found that using these really irritated the skin around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They are precise and do not get dull quickly.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have any stores near by that sell them, this is a simple and quick way to get them.  </li>
            <li> Open them right away, and request a return and refund if they&#x27;re not the originals.  </li>
            <li> A little too large to comfortably use under eyebrows, as the razor head is close to 1 1/2 inches in size.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and sharp.</li>
            <li> does a fantastic job with blonde facial hair and shaping eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and last a long time</li>
            <li> As far as the mustache thing, swipe, swipe, gone!</li>
            <li> first went to a dermatologist and a medical esthetician to get what is called dermaplaning.</li>
            <li> The blade is huge like a inch and a half.</li>
            <li> so I feel fine about disposing of them after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The originals have a smooth handle, while the fakes feel a little bit textured.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to save a little money and time spent at the salon.</li>
            <li> Quick service and product was what I expected!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for microplaning but a little too wide for eyebrows unless you&#x27;re really careful.</li>
            <li> Completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have a battery operated tiny shaver that works much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they were a day early.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products like them and they didn&#x27;t work and weren&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and I never shaved with a normal shaver in fear of it growing back thicker.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 3-pack from a different seller a few months prior, and the product was fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This is a great little beauty secret I&#x27;m sharing with all my friends.</li>
            <li> I would just be careful and make sure you watch a video or read how to use them properly because they are sharp and can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Must be used like a straight razor, so be careful.</li>
            <li> especially under and around brows, upper lip and cheeks near the ears, I just use this and zip, zip, zip, it&#x27;s gone with no redness!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razors I received are dull and rough, also I noticed differences between authentic Tinkle razor packaging and this packaging.</li>
            <li> I use this on my sideburns where I normally would wax them, and I get absolutely NO ingrown</li>
            <li> As if they have been stores in a hot warehouse and the glue holding them together has been dried up.</li>
            <li> You really have to move the razor down at an angle to cut anything and the deeper the angle,</li>
            <li> Also found it really hard to actually get a useful angle on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m either not doing it right, or the blades are too dull.</li>
            <li> Very handy for removing peach fuzz for smoother makeup....and much less expensive than the ones being sold on TV!</li>
            <li> I ordered a single 3-pack of these previously, and the quality of those was much lower</li>
            <li> I tend to use these once and toss because they do not stay very sharp, but they are not made to be very sharp in the first place.</li>
            <li> Also last for a long time, haven&#x27;t had to replace one yet after a few months of near daily use.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because each razor doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried as I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have only a few facial hairs (upper lip), and used them for this purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same idea as microdermabrasian (minus the hair removal part).</li>
            <li> I tried to pick the small piece of sharp plastic off and they whole thing came apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Dull/not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Also, this helps get rid of the dry skin that also contributes to clogged pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried them in the past and found them to be very sharp and worked very well.</li>
            <li> If you have long lashes like me, it&#x27;s even harder.</li>
            <li> While they did leave my skin a little rosy afterwards, there were no long term irritation or effects.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to push too hard because when I first started using these I would get little burn marks.</li>
            <li> It even removes dry skin from your face!</li>
            <li> its hard to get at really small areas and really shape your eyebrows without nicking in another area because the razor is so big.</li>
            <li> Let me back up a little bit though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using these to actually shape my eyebrows, but for dermaplaning and shaving other small spots (my big toes get hairy, weird right?)</li>
            <li> NOT MUCH TOO</li>
            <li> its also a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Super red and painful.</li>
            <li> As far as shaping goes this is not a good tool to use on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> As I read other reviews, I did watch Michelle Money&#x27;s video on Youtube before purchasing these.</li>
            <li> - I have seen other reviews mention some knock-offs.</li>
            <li> they are really sharp.  </li>
            <li> be careful!</li>
            <li> no more embarrassing facial hair for me!!</li>
            <li> I tried one as soon as I received my order, and found them to be very rough on my face</li>
            <li> ( you are supposed to be able to use this with the growth rather than against parentheses) ended up cutting myself because the blades are so dull and was trying to see if I could make them work.</li>
            <li> These razors are dull, nothing like the other tinkle eyebrow razors I purchased from Amazon earlier which were lighter in color and didn&#x27;t have the brand name written at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, accidentally removed part of my eyebrow as I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as sharp as it is.</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> Basically its shaving your small white hairs, and getting rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> They are extremely flimsy!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and work well to remove hair...</li>
            <li> That previous purchase linked to this seller, however.  </li>
            <li> Totally different packaging and are not good quality at all.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of practice</li>
            <li> I thought the razor would be a little sharper.</li>
            <li> It costs less than waxing and hurts less!</li>
            <li> take time with this product have a few cuts from it.</li>
            <li> The razor part is excessively large and that makes it very difficult to get close to the brow line.</li>
            <li> Impossible to cut yourself with and as gentle as a razor can be on your face.</li>
            <li> Not very good, a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> no, its physiologically impossible for your white/clear hairs to grow back any other color or any other thickness!</li>
            <li> Blades seem a little dull.</li>
            <li> Order ahead of time as shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> at first.&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses I found that they became quite dull and don&#x27;t shave as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use the Noxzema eyebrow razors, but I decided to try these since they&#x27;re cheaper.</li>
            <li> Also - shaving your face is dumb, I already have to shave every other part of my body, I&#x27;ll leave the face shaving to the men.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them for my actual eyebrows as I am afraid I will mess them up....</li>
            <li> I seriously want to be buried with one of these little razors.</li>
            <li> and they just seem dull</li>
            <li> Completely dull and won&#x27;t remove any peach fuzz at all.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product, and the razors are incredibly dull.</li>
            <li> gets dull like a disposable shaving razor found at store after uses.</li>
            <li> Its really annoying to have to filter through what is real and what is not..</li>
            <li> There are subtle, but visible differences in the design.  </li>
            <li> When you use these razor it doesn&#x27;t make the facial hair grow bad thicker .</li>
            <li> These are complete crap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them as eyebrow trimmers (hardly have any eyebrows as it is!)</li>
            <li> rather disappointed because I thought 1 razor would last me a month, but I&#x27;ve already used three</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ashamed to say that Im not sharing this beauty secret with my friends.</li>
            <li> The fakes are of exceptionally poor quality, and don&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li> They are not so scary as the scapel I see being used on YouTube.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!</li>
            <li> These are terrible, so dull.</li>
            <li> ur eyebrows are crazy and ur in a rush these are heaven sent!</li>
            <li> but I am totally disappointed because they don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of a mustache thing, nothing terrible, but I have to do something about it.</li>
            <li> I also use them on my husband&#x27;s out of control ear hair (it is horrible), and his unibrow.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these razors!!  Must be used like a straight razor, so be careful.</li>
            <li> The blade is huge like a inch and a half. It is cheaper. But sticking to noxema because their razor is more reasonably sized.</li>
            <li> The packages were already opened three looked used I threw away. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like these eyebrow razors but I prefer Noxzemas version better because they are smaller and easier to use.</li>
            <li> Not very good, a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Third time to order. Really like. Does not cause any stubbly hair to grow.</li>
            <li> Love these! I use them for my peach fuzz on my face!</li>
            <li> I like these and will continue to use them but find that I get a kind of razor burn with them...not in the sense of red bumps but definitely find a lotion or aloe gel that is soothing to the skin to use afterward and avoid facial toners for a day or two. I use an apple cider vinegar toner and it stings after using this but if I use a soothing lotion and avoid the toner for a day I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Noxzema eyebrow razors, but I decided to try these since they&#x27;re cheaper. That was a mistake. The razor part is excessively large and that makes it very difficult to get close to the brow line. Also, the blades do not start right at the uppermost part so you have to angle it properly to get even close to trimming the target area.</li>
            <li> BEST razors to shave your face. The perfect &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; to beautiful makeup application. So smooth, and soft. I do need to throw them away after two uses.</li>
            <li> So in love with these! So easy to use and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> KNOCK OFFS!! I own REAL tinkle eyebrow razors &amp; these are 100% knock offs!! They are flimsy &amp; tinkle razors aren&#x27;t &amp; they tear your hair like cheap, cheap razors do.</li>
            <li> These are complete crap. These are a knock off. Totally different packaging and are not good quality at all. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> GOOD. NOT MUCH TOO SAY</li>
            <li> I checked, and yes I did get the original and not the fake.&lt;br /&gt;These are great! They are very sharp and work well to remove hair...at first.&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses I found that they became quite dull and don&#x27;t shave as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rather disappointed because I thought 1 razor would last me a month, but I&#x27;ve already used three and they just seem dull now.&lt;br /&gt;I can see a lot of hair that they don&#x27;t shave off, and it&#x27;s really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;They work really well to exfoliate, but I find that FT Shiseido razor is gentler for exfoliating compare to these.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the price is SO cheap and they do wonders for my face, so the benefits outweigh the price big time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about taking one of these to my face. As I read other reviews, I did watch Michelle Money&#x27;s video on Youtube before purchasing these. I have a bit of a mustache thing, nothing terrible, but I have to do something about it. I was tweezing before I purchased these razors. I also have some facial peach fuzz, which I just can not stand. For that, I was using an epilator, which didn&#x27;t do a great job and I found that I was breaking out from using the epilator. I took the plunge and tried this and I really am glad that I did. As far as the mustache thing, swipe, swipe, gone! Completely gone. Yes it grows back, but it doesn&#x27;t grow back any different (like a man mustache.....). It also does a decent job on the peach fuzz as well. Yes, You have to keep it up, but it&#x27;s really faster than anything else that I was doing before, and it&#x27;s more effective. I&#x27;m hooked. I bought the larger pack</li>
            <li> I used them on myself and before i do others make up!&lt;br /&gt;If ur eyebrows are crazy and ur in a rush these are heaven sent! I also use them on my upper lip!&lt;br /&gt;  https://www.facebook.com/ThaliaDoesMakeUp</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that while I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, I did indeed get the original trademarked &amp;#34;DORCO&amp;#34; Tinkle razors with this order, not the knock-offs that seem so prevalent out there. This was the #1 concern I had with ordering Tinkle razors but these are the real deal. I&#x27;m excited to try them, a la Michelle Money. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to use: these razors are super easy to use and do not require any shaving cream :) Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;2. Can be used anywhere. I like to use these on my upper thighs since I only grow peach fuzz in that area and I never shaved with a normal shaver in fear of it growing back thicker. These razors have NOT caused any hair to grow back thicker.&lt;br /&gt;3. I use this on my sideburns where I normally would wax them, and I get absolutely NO ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. You have to be careful not to push too hard because when I first started using these I would get little burn marks. Just ease up on it :)&lt;br /&gt;2. DO NOT use on eyebrows. As far as shaping goes this is not a good tool to use on your eyebrows. It is really easy to make a mistake and harder to grasp the right hairs do to the fact that you go towards hair growth instead of against.</li>
            <li> Excatly what I was hoping for. Very easy to get the hang of &#x27;dermaplanning&#x27; with these little razors. They are not so scary as the scapel I see being used on YouTube. Make sure you hold the razor the correct way for a non-irrational dermaplane.</li>
            <li> I thought that these would be easier to use and more efficient than a razor to use on my face,since it is just peach fuzz like hair. But these are no as some of the reviewers have said. I find them more difficult to get use to and they do not cut as close to the skin. They are oaky but not near as good as a razor and more time consuming.</li>
            <li> Very handy for removing peach fuzz for smoother makeup....and much less expensive than the ones being sold on TV!</li>
            <li> i wish I had believed these reviews here. I bought these after reading a blog about face shaving. I used to get it done at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and it is awesome. It was called dermaplaning. Well. These suck. They fall apart. As if they have been stores in a hot warehouse and the glue holding them together has been dried up.</li>
            <li> best ones. no longer found in store</li>
            <li> Works so well! Cut at an angle, it&#x27;s very easy. You might get skin irritation if you go over the spot so many times but just don&#x27;t apply too much pressure. Takes a little bit of practice but I get a clean, nice shape from it.</li>
            <li> These are great razors, the genuine product. I use them along my jawline, and it&#x27;s great how exfoliating it is. They are nice and sharp, cuts through those stubby black hairs easily without any tugging. I ordered a single 3-pack of these previously, and the quality of those was much lower - I have seen other reviews mention some knock-offs. But the ones I got in the 12-pack seem to be the real deal and I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE! Buyer beware!&lt;br /&gt;The REAL Tinkle razors are so amazing!!</li>
            <li> Found a recommendation on YouTube to try these &#x27;razors&#x27; tor remove any and all facial hair and decided to give them a try.  These are superb!  I&#x27;ve tried electric facial hair trimmers, a disposable razor and dipilitories to remove troublesome hair on my chin (post-menopausal problem shared by many women) and non worked as well as I would have liked.  The &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; eyebrow razors work beautifully--not only on my chin hair, but on my upper lip, cheek fuzz, etc.  Hold at a 45 degree angle to your skin and take short strokes in the direction of the hair growth and voila!  skin is as clean as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Use on clean, dry skin...apply your favorite moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as high quality as the ones I have purchased at the beauty store. Nonetheless, the price is better and they work well enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Use them for full face shaving, love em!! Great for exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Saw this on you tube for &amp;#34;dermaplaning&amp;#34; and thought I&#x27;d try it. I love, love, love this product. My skin feels amazing and looks so good. I&#x27;m ashamed to say that Im not sharing this beauty secret with my friends. Order ahead of time as shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> Dull...Don&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after watching a video from a beauty expert.  They came highly recommended.  I use them for the peach fuzz on the sides of my face and neck.  They are so easy to use.  Sharp enough. I use each one about 3 times, then throw it out.  If I use the same one too many times I break out.  They are perfect for removing the light layer of fuzz.  I have not used them on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> Works good. Bought because of a commercial on our local news.</li>
            <li> I have only a few facial hairs (upper lip), and used them for this purpose. Worked very well!</li>
            <li> I use this razor for shaving all over my face and it works beautifully. I&#x27;m sure there are better quality razors out there, but I like these. Impossible to cut yourself with and as gentle as a razor can be on your face.</li>
            <li> The razor head is way too large. I am absolutely terrified that I&#x27;m going to saw off my eyelashes! Ah! Not fun. But, they are a good quality for disposable eyebrow razors and I also really enjoy that I got a bundle of so many so I feel fine about disposing of them after a few uses.</li>
            <li> These razors are great- I use them for my facial hair- and anywhere else. A couple of them had the razor pop out of it- but overall they are a great razor.</li>
            <li> These work really well and I am glad I found them!  I have tried other products like them and they didn&#x27;t work and weren&#x27;t worth the price.  This product is well worth the price and I would buy them again</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my peach fuzz off my menopausal face. No stubble grows back and it does not grow back thicker it darker. I use it once a month and keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li> works better than the kai brand</li>
            <li> Great razors for a fair price.</li>
            <li> Dull/not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this 12-pack back in May 2015.  At that time, the seller was &amp;#34;beauty international&amp;#34;.  That previous purchase linked to this seller, however.  Buyer beware with these things!  I ordered a 3-pack from a different seller a few months prior, and the product was fantastic!  So good that I decided to buy a 12-pack.  When I opened these awhile after receiving, I could immediately see, and feel that they were different.  These counterfeit ones I received have a silver &amp;#34;Tinkle&amp;#34; printed on them, and not well I might add.  The good ones do not.  There are subtle, but visible differences in the design.  The originals have a smooth handle, while the fakes feel a little bit textured.  I recommend to anybody that uses these to beware of the fakes.  Open them right away, and request a return and refund if they&#x27;re not the originals.  The fakes are of exceptionally poor quality, and don&#x27;t work well at all.  They mostly just scratch the skin.  The fake is the top one in the photo.</li>
            <li> These razors are excellent!  Fast delivery and great service!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When you use these razor it doesn&#x27;t make the facial hair grow bad thicker . Convenient to carry I leave one in the car</li>
            <li> Quick service and product was what I expected!  will buy again!</li>
            <li> I thought these might be a great time saver, but I don&#x27;t really care for them. I have sensitive skin, and I found that using these really irritated the skin around my eyebrows. Super red and painful. Also found it really hard to actually get a useful angle on the eyebrows. Used them with more success on my chin.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price-- nice to stock up on!! Great for all the fine blonde baby hairs around my eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> Completely dull and won&#x27;t remove any peach fuzz at all. I got these because of all the positive reviews but I am totally disappointed because they don&#x27;t work at all. AT ALL. They must be knockoffs as another reviewer stated.</li>
            <li> A good size, and good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these are not authentic Tinkle razors. I have tried them in the past and found them to be very sharp and worked very well. I ordered these because they said Tinkle on the packaging. I was already duped when I accidentally ordered some &amp;#34;Twinkle&amp;#34; razors.&lt;br /&gt;The razors I received are dull and rough, also I noticed differences between authentic Tinkle razor packaging and this packaging. Authentic packaging has a trademark on the bottom right hand corner that says DORCO, these dont have that marking. Its really annoying to have to filter through what is real and what is not.. its also a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I Love these for Dermaplaining my face.  So much better than the ones you can get in the local stores!!</li>
            <li> I love these. They&#x27;re great for microplaning but a little too wide for eyebrows unless you&#x27;re really careful. Very sharp, accidentally removed part of my eyebrow as I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as sharp as it is. Also last for a long time, haven&#x27;t had to replace one yet after a few months of near daily use.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase these after I watched the Michelle Money youtube video (that&#x27;s why I bought the 12 pc instead of the 3pc). Honestly, I have only used this once or twice. I thought the razor would be a little sharper. You really have to move the razor down at an angle to cut anything and the deeper the angle, the more it seems you may cut yourself. I will probably use these all eventually, but I&#x27;m not as in love with them as a thought. I suppose it&#x27;s better than shaving your face with a regular razor though, which I have never done.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Worked just as described.</li>
            <li> Uh, I bought these to shave my face, because thats what a horde of YouTube beauty bloggers told me to do. I&#x27;m either not doing it right, or the blades are too dull. Also - shaving your face is dumb, I already have to shave every other part of my body, I&#x27;ll leave the face shaving to the men.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll use these to shave my knuckle hair? Or maybe to de-pill sweaters?</li>
            <li> Works great for dermaplaning!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love love love these razors! My husband even uses them!</li>
            <li> Great product ...very satisfied.</li>
            <li> On time, as promised.</li>
            <li> Works great to when you want a quick fix to stray hairs and don&#x27;t have time to pluck or wax.</li>
            <li> told my friends they have to get this.</li>
            <li> Great little tool for &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34;.  I saw it demonstrated on You-Tube and ordered this that day.</li>
            <li> Worked really well and doesn&#x27;t cut your skin. 4 stars because each razor doesn&#x27;t last very long. Will definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful earrings and very well made will definitely turn my friends onto these!</li>
            <li> Will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better, I don&#x27;t feel like a man when I shave my face with these and they the perfect razor for my small peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of it. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> I tried one as soon as I received my order, and found them to be very rough on my face&lt;br /&gt;which is why I tried them. I was going to use them when I traveled, but did not line the&lt;br /&gt;way they felt on my face. I have a battery operated tiny shaver that works much better.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> wish the blades were sharper or had a buffer. But it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I bought extras because I knew that my coworkers and adult daughter would love these.&lt;br /&gt;My esthetician used one on my brows and it was super fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;No more tweezers for me!</li>
            <li> I got these to help take care of some unwanted chin hairs - which they work great on - as well as eyebrow hairs (and no pain - unlike plucking). I also use them on my husband&#x27;s out of control ear hair (it is horrible), and his unibrow. Now that I have given you TMI about the hairy state of my marriage - go out and get these!</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product, and the razors are incredibly dull. The real tinkle razors are awesome.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow razor I have used, out of many brands.</li>
            <li> This is my best kept beauty secret! I don&#x27;t use these for my brows, but for my face! Let me back up a little bit though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first went to a dermatologist and a medical esthetician to get what is called dermaplaning. Basically its shaving your small white hairs, and getting rid of dead skin. It&#x27;s the same idea as microdermabrasian (minus the hair removal part). Anyway, after getting it done professionally they told me I could do upkeep with these handy razors at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started, my acne has reduced significantly. I didn&#x27;t realize it, but I had a lot of those facial hairs you THINK others don&#x27;t see. My derm told me that more hair makes it easier for dirt to get stuck in pores, and cause acne. Also, this helps get rid of the dry skin that also contributes to clogged pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My makeup also goes on flawlessly now! Please do a bit of research before you take one to your face. It&#x27;s very, very easy to do, but youtube some videos first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, its physiologically impossible for your white/clear hairs to grow back any other color or any other thickness! I&#x27;ve done this for two years now, and its been a life changer!</li>
            <li> As a man, I use these to trim my beard line on my face (not on my neck). They work great. You have much more precision than with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> they are really sharp.  be careful!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using these to actually shape my eyebrows, but for dermaplaning and shaving other small spots (my big toes get hairy, weird right?) they are exactly what I need.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> These razors are dull, nothing like the other tinkle eyebrow razors I purchased from Amazon earlier which were lighter in color and didn&#x27;t have the brand name written at the bottom.</li>
            <li> There are no words to describe how much I love these things. I seriously want to be buried with one of these little razors. There is nothing more satisfying than scraping away peach fuzz off your face. It costs less than waxing and hurts less! I got my mom &amp; aunt some of these because they are so nice....no more embarrassing facial hair for me!!</li>
            <li> Love these… just be careful to use them correctly.</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase, recommend!</li>
            <li> This product has been great to clean up the little fuzzy hairs I have on my face. My face feels clean and soft after using. Super easy to use. However, this isn&#x27;t something you would use to shape your brows. This is a great little beauty secret I&#x27;m sharing with all my friends.</li>
            <li> Good buy great price.Facial shaving is great and light and the length of them help make more defined arches in the brow area.</li>
            <li> These are 10 times better than what I have used from my local drug store. Much sharper. Actually work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you could cut butter with these!</li>
            <li> Good quality, great deal. A little too large to comfortably use under eyebrows, as the razor head is close to 1 1/2 inches in size. If you have long lashes like me, it&#x27;s even harder. Perfect for use over a larger area.</li>
            <li> Love em, work perfect for all over face</li>
            <li> tried a couple different these are the best so far</li>
            <li> Great deal.  Sharp, good quality.  I was excited to get these since they don&#x27;t sell them around here and they were a day early.</li>
            <li> Razors were packaged fine.  No issues.  Prompt service.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Love these! They work great and are big enough to cover more!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of blonde face fuzz that just bugs me.  Instead of &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;waxing&amp;#34; my face. especially under and around brows, upper lip and cheeks near the ears, I just use this and zip, zip, zip, it&#x27;s gone with no redness!</li>
            <li> these products do the job though i wish the razor area was a tad bit smaller. its hard to get at really small areas and really shape your eyebrows without nicking in another area because the razor is so big. but overall, can&#x27;t beat for the price as i use this to touch up after i pluck with tweezers</li>
            <li> I watched a video about using these on your face, found the size to be very useful!</li>
            <li> 1 razor lasts one whole face shave or a few eyebrow trims. gets dull like a disposable shaving razor found at store after uses. take time with this product have a few cuts from it. does a fantastic job with blonde facial hair and shaping eyebrows. hair grows back faster than plucking eyebrows. A must for women with lighter hair. As Ive been consulted that laser hair removal doesn&#x27;t work on light hair</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have any stores near by that sell them, this is a simple and quick way to get them.  I like that I can get multi-packs for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love these, they work so much bettter than the ones from the store.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow razors are some of the best I have tried. They are precise and do not get dull quickly. I buy them in bulk so I do not have to worry about using the brand that&#x27;s available to me locally.</li>
            <li> These are a great value! The eyebrow razors are perfect for removing peach fuzz on my face and unwanted hair near my eyebrows. I tend to use these once and toss because they do not stay very sharp, but they are not made to be very sharp in the first place. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Love these.  The price was right for how many that I purchased.</li>
            <li> I purchased Tinkle razors from amazon before and they are truly amazing!  These say Tinkle but I am positive they are knockoffs! They are extremely flimsy! The plastic holding the razor is not cut properly on any of my 12. It leads to lots of cuts.  I tried to pick the small piece of sharp plastic off and they whole thing came apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I will purchase this 12 pack!</li>
            <li> These are great, use soap or shaving cream, if you are using for facial peach fuzz or hair. These can cut you, so take your time when using but work excellently.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for my peach fuzz. I was a little worried as I have extremely sensitive skin. While they did leave my skin a little rosy afterwards, there were no long term irritation or effects. Glad I found these!</li>
            <li> These do what they say they&#x27;ll do and worked out just great for me.......with a light hand, and being careful.  Can be reused many times before becoming dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are terrible, so dull. Don&#x27;t even bother ordering</li>
            <li> I use these on my whole face to help exfoliate, remove &#x27;peachy&#x27; fuzz and create a youthful glow.  I use once or twice a week and love it!</li>
            <li> Love these things!  Ran across this dermaplane at home device on YouTube, and have been hooked every since.  It is cheap, sharp &amp; easy to use.  Makes my dead skin sloth off quickly, and the after results leave my skin feeling as smooth as a babies bottom.  I&#x27;ve already gotten friends hooked on these as well :)</li>
            <li> I love these to shave my peach fuzz off my face!</li>
            <li> Do NOT work. I patiently tried different angles both with and against the hair growth. ( you are supposed to be able to use this with the growth rather than against parentheses) ended up cutting myself because the blades are so dull and was trying to see if I could make them work.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow razors works very well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and it&#x27;s legit</li>
            <li> Great price. Comfortable to use and sharp. Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I dabble in cosmetology photography and since using this product I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup looks better and stays on longer. It even removes dry skin from your face! Great razor and derma tool.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Blades seem a little dull.</li>
            <li> Very good product, works great. Very happy</li>
            <li> These are really great. I don&#x27;t use them for my actual eyebrows as I am afraid I will mess them up.... I am not that coordinated!&lt;br /&gt;I use them for the very fine hair on the rest of my face. I don&#x27;t have an unusual amount of facial hair for a woman, just tiny fuzz as I assume most of us have. I really just tried them out of curiosity. But I did suddenly get compliments on my skin. I think it&#x27;s because, even if you can&#x27;t see the hairs, they must somehow scatter the light that hits your face or something. When those hairs are gone, your face is a very smooth surface, and it reflects light back very cleanly and brightly. It makes your skin seem somehow healthier and younger.</li>
            <li> I really like these. They work great and are very easy to use. I use them pretty consistently and they last a fair amount of time as well. It&#x27;s a nice way to save a little money and time spent at the salon. I would just be careful and make sure you watch a video or read how to use them properly because they are sharp and can cut you if you&#x27;re not careful. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Too large, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered so many at once. These are great for a guy with a unibrow but I don&#x27;t have that much space to work with. I prefer another brand that sounds similar.</li>
            <li> I received what I purchased.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li> Love them! Easy to use and last a long time</li>
            <li> much sharper and a great deal.  i&#x27;;ve purchased these before at a local Drug store and these are much sharper and a great value.</li>
            <li> these seem to work fine, I just break out whenever I use them to shave the peach fuzz on my face so probably not going to use them anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this! It removes unwanted hair and leaves my clean and soft. I use it for facial hair as well and I cannot recommend it enough. All I can say is google Michelle Money shaving.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these.  I don&#x27;t use them as eyebrow trimmers (hardly have any eyebrows as it is!) but it&#x27;s great to get rid of some of that super light/blonde hair around your jawbone.  Look up Michelle Money&#x27;s youtube on these, hilarious, but true.</li>
            <li> These work fine for eyebrow shaping, but I had bought them for &amp;#34;facial planing&amp;#34; which I had seen on TV and after I bought them I realized that facial planing is NOT something I want to do.  LOL  If you want the razors for eyebrow shaping they&#x27;re really great.</li>
            <li> Works well on the face.</li>
