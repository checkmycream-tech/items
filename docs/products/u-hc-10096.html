    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for years and it&#x27;s wonderful to get it by mail rather than seek out a location to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for people who have problems with their hair falling out.</li>
            <li>I think the product is great.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The Nioxin systems seem to work the best for me and I have tried many products for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Good price for this size of a bottle.</li>
            <li>And the nice thing about Nioxin products is that if don&#x27;t stop using them, or skip days (say, you forget products because you&#x27;re out of town)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner now.</li>
            <li>Worked much better than my expectations.</li>
            <li>product works pretty good</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product would be good for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have thinning and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using nioxin system 2 since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner as part of the Nioxin 3 part system for my fine, thinning hair.</li>
            <li>After trying this method, I have to say that I have noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was always fine, but never thin.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>I find Joico KPak conditioners to be good for everyday, and Aussie 3 minute miracle or even heavier hair masks once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>After I dye my hair it is important to switch to system 4 for color preservation and have the same volume effect.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I have previously used other Nioxin products, NOT sold by this company, but by Wella with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is not very moisturizing, so what I do is rub it into my scalp and the first inch or so of my hair, then use a very moisturizing conditioner on my ends and working up to the rest of my hair (my hair falls right by my shoulders).</li>
            <li>It no longer tangles, and does seem fuller near the roots where I apply this product.</li>
            <li>- my point is that I find the Nioxin conditioner and other products to work better than any other hair growing/thickener on the market, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>This system makes my hair feel thicker without becoming sticky, stiff or heavy.  </li>

            <li> - my point is that I find the Nioxin conditioner and other products to work better than any other hair growing/thickener on the market, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> This system makes my hair feel thicker without becoming sticky, stiff or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair lifeless and very flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading through other reviews, I saw where one lady used this conditioner only on her roots, and another conditioner on the rest of her hair.</li>
            <li> , your hair doesn&#x27;t suddenly start falling out, unlike some other hair regrowth products.</li>
            <li> I will not live with out this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a half a year definitely made my hair stronger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> After using Nioxin for a few months, I can definitely see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> I never use oil treatments - they just weight down my hair for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically have dry thin hair (without this product) and my hair feels fuller and is definitely softer after using it.</li>
            <li> my hair still falls out a lot but have noticed a little difference</li>
            <li> mean to be an advertisement for other products</li>
            <li> Had thinning hair due to medication, seems to be working well to at least slow the hair loss a bit.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it will improve hair growth though.</li>
            <li> My hair came back very thin in spots, after having chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for at least 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, probably because I have thyroid issues.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin products for years and it&#x27;s wonderful to get it by mail rather than seek out a location to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I have thinning and fine hair.  This system makes my hair feel thicker without becoming sticky, stiff or heavy.  It has also helped me solve my problem of an unruly cowlick!</li>
            <li> bought for thinning hair. product works pretty good my hair still falls out a lot but have noticed a little difference</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, probably because I have thyroid issues. My hair is chemically treated, so I decided to give this conditioner a try. I have previously used other Nioxin products, NOT sold by this company, but by Wella with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading through other reviews, I saw where one lady used this conditioner only on her roots, and another conditioner on the rest of her hair. After trying this method, I have to say that I have noticed a huge difference in my hair. It no longer tangles, and does seem fuller near the roots where I apply this product. Now after several months of using this product in this manner I can see a much bigger difference between the days I apply this product and the days I don&#x27;t. I LOVE this conditioner now. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using nioxin system 2 since I have fine hair. It does decrease hair loss overtime. Not sure it will improve hair growth though. After I dye my hair it is important to switch to system 4 for color preservation and have the same volume effect.</li>
            <li> Working well.  Had thinning hair due to medication, seems to be working well to at least slow the hair loss a bit.  Worked much better than my expectations.</li>
            <li> I will not live with out this product. Wonderful on my hair.</li>
            <li> Good price for this size of a bottle. Have been using this product for a half a year definitely made my hair stronger.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time or money. So no appreciable difference in growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> Made my hair lifeless and very flat. I was really hoping this product would be good for my hair. Quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin systems seem to work the best for me and I have tried many products for thinning hair.  I have been using Nioxin for at least 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for people who have problems with their hair falling out. Along with the shampoo and conditioning spray, it will help regrow the hair you lost.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner as part of the Nioxin 3 part system for my fine, thinning hair. It is not very moisturizing, so what I do is rub it into my scalp and the first inch or so of my hair, then use a very moisturizing conditioner on my ends and working up to the rest of my hair (my hair falls right by my shoulders).

And the nice thing about Nioxin products is that if don&#x27;t stop using them, or skip days (say, you forget products because you&#x27;re out of town), your hair doesn&#x27;t suddenly start falling out, unlike some other hair regrowth products.</li>
            <li> It really works. Shipped on tiime.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look thicker without drying it out.  My hair feels soft and looks healthy.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since October or November and have seen a noticeable difference in the thickness of my hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think the product is great. Have been using it for several years now. Decreases my hair loss during dieting</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  I typically have dry thin hair (without this product) and my hair feels fuller and is definitely softer after using it.</li>
            <li> My hair came back very thin in spots, after having chemotherapy.  My hair was always fine, but never thin.  After using Nioxin for a few months, I can definitely see a difference.  It&#x27;s not drastic, but it&#x27;s definitely beginning to come in thicker.</li>
