            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>but once used a bit requires more force&lt;</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>I also love the darker shade for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>It looks so good and is easy to do when I’m doing a full eye look.</li>
            <li>and this keeps my brows looking natural and beautiful</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use light stokes and build up according to your shade.</li>
            <li>Love this brow bar, the color is perfect, not too dark or light.</li>
            <li>Yes, it did not come with instructions but it doesn&#x27;t bug me, easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a brown shade that is more cool tone, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t be precise.</li>
            <li>well, even when I use a light hand...</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a great product and affordable.</li>
            <li>This is the best brow bar I have ever tried I have been using this everyday since I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous palette for your brows.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency and it lasts the whole day ... unless you rub it off.</li>
            <li>While it may be a flat brown, it looks great as a contour shade vs bronzers that sometimes look terracotta.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use and how natural looking.</li>
            <li>I received a quick refund which earned their stars from me.</li>
            <li>Plus the shades are limited but its a good quality also.</li>
            <li>Amazing product definitely a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li>With the Brow Bar they look more natural and not over done at all.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li>You should buy your own brush though because this one is to big</li>
            <li>Easy to use, stays on all day, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>This was the first product I tried along with the whitening pen.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I like the product but the dark shade</li>
            <li>I actually love the product, but the wax doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, so it has to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>But when I got it, it was easy to put on, it actually saved me time on my brows.</li>
            <li>Color is very realistic.</li>
            <li>My eye brows are super light..and this really makes my face look complete.</li>
            <li>With the Anastasia brow kit I had to wet my eyebrow brush in order for it to look better.</li>
            <li>and I really like it for that too.  </li>
            <li>Can do so much with this to contour features</li>
            <li>The colors are just fit and te wax really holds it in place all day long!</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I mix the first two colors because I found mixing them gives me the right shade instead of being too light or too dark, and then the gel really helps keep everything in place all night long.</li>
            <li>It gives your eyebrows a very natural look.</li>
            <li>, Ive tried it on the brows and it ok, not the best but definitely not the worst</li>
            <li>The gel makes my brows so soft and the browns are very natural.</li>
            <li>Makes your brows look so natural.</li>
            <li>This pricey product came promptly in a plastic baggie without any instructions, with no ingredient list(which is important for me with a gluten allergy), and with a brush that is not adequate to work with the wax and barely does for the powders.  </li>
            <li>The case is hard to open and close, other than that a good product.</li>
            <li>I sent it back pronto and am using a $3 pencil until I can get my old standby product, Indelible Brow.  </li>
            <li>The blonde set worked for me which pleasantly surprised me because I have &amp;#34;Mexican&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It cut down time I spend on my make up and looks natural as I don&#x27;t like to wear too much make up.</li>

            <li> This might work well for some people as the other reviews said, but it was a complete bust for me.  </li>
            <li> It has a natural look finish and matches dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> And it last a long time.</li>

            <li> Will not use any other brow items.</li>

            <li> Wish the dark brown was a bit darker but</li>
            <li> brow is dark and this did not go with it</li>
            <li> I use the lighter brown for shading and the dark brown for shaping.</li>
            <li> I have been using basic brown shadows to fill in my brows before but this item keeps everything compacted into one small case!</li>
            <li> the wax almost everyday with a brow pencil (Anastasia Beverly hills&lt;br /&gt;in ash brown).</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for brows and eyeshadow!!</li>
            <li> The wax is a bit weird and makes my eyebrows look greasy</li>
            <li> I got this after a You Tube video tutorial and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> its Not :(&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great with some practice!</li>
            <li> Love this brow bar, the color is perfect, not too dark or light. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> Its good. I mostly use it for the wax. I use a pencil brow instead and then apply the wax with the applicator. I mostly use the two brow colors as eye shadow.  The case is hard to open and close, other than that a good product.</li>
            <li> This pricey product came promptly in a plastic baggie without any instructions, with no ingredient list(which is important for me with a gluten allergy), and with a brush that is not adequate to work with the wax and barely does for the powders.  I sent it back pronto and am using a $3 pencil until I can get my old standby product, Indelible Brow.  This might work well for some people as the other reviews said, but it was a complete bust for me.  I received a quick refund which earned their stars from me.</li>
            <li> Returned it. The color was too red.</li>
            <li> Wish the dark brown was a bit darker but this truly is remarkable it has transformed my look.  My friend thats a blonde can&#x27;t wait to get one too.</li>
            <li> Great browns can be used as eyeshadows &amp; light contouring also. However I gave it four stars because I wish the brush was firmer.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a girl who posts videos of makeup tutorials. I have always used the Anastasia brow kits and have been for years. When I heard this girl swear by it I said what the heck, let me give a shot. WOW!! This product is definitely amazing. With the Anastasia brow kit I had to wet my eyebrow brush in order for it to look better. With this Brow Bar To Go I don&#x27;t need to do that. I use it just the way it is and use the gel to set the brows in place. I have always gotten great compliments on my eyebrows, but I felt they always looked to over done. With the Brow Bar they look more natural and not over done at all. Amazing product definitely a repeat buyer. :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this. I love the wax that comes with it to help your brows stay in place and I feel it helps the color stay on better. I seen this product on a lot of make up tutorial videos so I figured I should try it out myself and it&#x27;s so worth the money. And it last a long time. You can even use these colors for mat eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Saw this recommended on YouTube. I love how easy it is to use and how natural looking. I&#x27;m blonde and use the lighter shade. Cannot go a day without it!</li>
            <li> Mmm it was ok but not I was hoping for I think anastasia brow kit is way better oh well</li>
            <li> I thought it will be my brow color but its Not :(&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I gave 3 asa rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brow is dark and this did not go with it</li>
            <li> I Loveeeee this product! I follow carli bybel on YouTube and she recommended this and it works great . You should buy your own brush though because this one is to big and you can&#x27;t be precise.</li>
            <li> I learned about this company on YouTube. This was the first product I tried along with the whitening pen. This is the easiest brow product I have ever used and it stays on all day. I used to carry it in my bag but I don&#x27;t need to because it stays on so good.</li>
            <li> Got it for her for a gift and she loves it. I have no personal experience w/ the product as I don&#x27;t play ball on that side of the fence.</li>
            <li> hear about brow bar to go via youtube and decided to give er a try...&lt;br /&gt;will be repurchasing for sure!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Not only is the Brow Bar to go great for brows, its great to use for matte eye shadows. It comes with a wax to lock your colors in place. There is a color for every hair color. A  must have product for any makeup collection.</li>
            <li> no instructions do you use it wet or dry and blonde has no color&lt;br /&gt;large cardboard package with only brow bar inside&lt;br /&gt;no invoice- no thank you for buying- no instruction</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have been using basic brown shadows to fill in my brows before but this item keeps everything compacted into one small case! The wax is great!</li>
            <li> Over plucked my brows when I was younger. Love this kit it makes it so easy to make them look perfect.  The colors are just fit and te wax really holds it in place all day long!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love. Will not use any other brow items. Makes your brows look so natural.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I like the product but the dark shade is a little&lt;br /&gt;too redish auburn for me.... It does not match my natural&lt;br /&gt;brow shade well, even when I use a light hand... I do&lt;br /&gt;use the wax almost everyday with a brow pencil (Anastasia Beverly hills&lt;br /&gt;in ash brown). I do use the powders as eyeshadow for the crease.</li>
            <li> It gives your eyebrows a very natural look. Just make sure you use light stokes and build up according to your shade. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this...I know it is for brows but I mostly use it to contour the nose...goes on great for that, Ive tried it on the brows and it ok, not the best but definitely not the worst, I dont want to discourage anyone from it b/c it is a nice product, but b/c Im a Pro MUA, Im always quite picky. As you can see I rated it 5 stars b/c it serves the purpose I use it for.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My eye brows are super light..and this really makes my face look complete. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  I initially bought it actually to contour because I like the shade of brown that is offered.  While it may be a flat brown, it looks great as a contour shade vs bronzers that sometimes look terracotta.  If you are looking for a brown shade that is more cool tone, this is the product for you.  I then started using this product for filling in my brows and I really like it for that too.  The wax is a bit weird and makes my eyebrows look greasy so I don&#x27;t wear it, but overall it&#x27;s a great product and affordable.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, its a perfect eyebrow shader making eyebrows looking very natural! I even use it as eye shadow and it works amazing. Definitely buying again once i run out! You wont regret it</li>
            <li> So easy to use! Yes, it did not come with instructions but it doesn&#x27;t bug me, easy to figure out. I also use it as shadow:) love it!</li>
            <li> What a great product. I use this almost every day. I have sparse brows and this keeps my brows looking natural and beautiful</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Loved the price, came within 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;Looks good on the eyebrows but once used a bit requires more force&lt;br /&gt;to get the color on the brush. Overall, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product. I guess you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> my brow bar to go kit is something I use almost daily. It’s great because when I want to have good looking eyebrows, this kit is wonderful for that. I mix the first two colors because I found mixing them gives me the right shade instead of being too light or too dark, and then the gel really helps keep everything in place all night long. I also love the darker shade for eyeshadow. So often when I’m on the run I’ll put either my Mac vanilla pigment on my lids or my L’Oreal tattoo pigment and then brush this brow shade in the crease and blend it all out. It looks so good and is easy to do when I’m doing a full eye look. I love this product and will surely re-order when I’m out!</li>
            <li> I love it! Very easy to use and lasts all day. I like how the wax helps keep the strays in place. Now, my brows are on point! 😃</li>
            <li> Love this little package -- perfect colors and the gel is great. The gel makes my brows so soft and the browns are very natural.</li>
            <li> Can do so much with this to contour features</li>
            <li> Not the best, but I am not completely disappointed either.. Its two shades of eyeshadow with a wax.. Nothing extravagant and the quality is equivalent to Loreal or Maybelline - Definitely not SEPHORA quality...</li>
            <li> This is the best brow bar I have ever tried I have been using this everyday since I got it in the mail. This is a must have for your make up collection!</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive but also lost my mybrows due to chemo.WORKS. GREAT. need to practice a little before getting it down completely</li>
            <li> I bought thia because i saw one youtube sensation using it but i think its lil pricy i mean one can get same pallete via drugstore in much cheaper. Plus the shades are limited but its a good quality also.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous palette for your brows.  It lasts all day and night!  This has become one of my staple cosmetics and a must have!</li>
            <li> Amazing color, easy to use.  I can&#x27;t say enough about brow bar.  I use it for my eyebrows, as an eyeshadow, and for all over contouring.</li>
            <li> Great stuff its worth the price!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, stays on all day, and looks natural. I got this after a You Tube video tutorial and was skeptical. But when I got it, it was easy to put on, it actually saved me time on my brows. It cut down time I spend on my make up and looks natural as I don&#x27;t like to wear too much make up. Overall, great product and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Great product... I use the lighter brown for shading and the dark brown for shaping. The wax is not tacky and delivers a nice hold.</li>
            <li> I loved the brow bar. It has a nice consistency and it lasts the whole day ... unless you rub it off. The blonde set worked for me which pleasantly surprised me because I have &amp;#34;Mexican&amp;#34; tan skin. I will definitely buy it again &amp;#60;3 TRY IT OUT GIRLS &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for brows and eyeshadow!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! It has a natural look finish and matches dark eyebrows. I truly recommend this to anyone wanting to shade theirfeyebrows</li>
            <li> Looks good! great for the price!</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I decided to purchase it after watching a make up tutorial. Let me tell you that I am really glad I did because it leaves my eyebrows looking flawless!</li>
            <li> Great color &amp; texture. Color is very realistic. Last well too. I am a brunette &amp; juggle my hair color among the various shades of brown.</li>
            <li> I actually love the product, but the wax doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, so it has to be reapplied. Also, the packaging broke but the product itself is great!!</li>
