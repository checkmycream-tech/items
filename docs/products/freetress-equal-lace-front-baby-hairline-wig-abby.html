            <li>It came quick in the mail.</li>

            <li>I can slip this unit on as easy as a baseball cap but look like i really took time to do my hair..</li>
            <li>Worth&#x27;s every cent.</li>
            <li>learning that wigs purchased sight-unseen rarely look like the stock photo...</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is full without being BIG hair, and is soft with a nice luster.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase synthetic lace wigs For the first time.</li>
            <li>I only like the two, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This hair is pretty.</li>
            <li>It is well made but I am not just a fan of Synthetic( my first).</li>
            <li>Since discovering lace front wigs, this is the first curly one I&#x27;ve come across that</li>
            <li>I live in a climate that is very hot and humid and my hair does not hold up well</li>

            <li>this is normal and certain fixes to remedy it.</li>
            <li>im going to order a few more and play with highlights.</li>
            <li>The curls are long lose spiral curls and the wig is layered, so it looks like you went for a nice cut and took the time to carefully curl your hair with a curling iron...even after sleeping on it!</li>
            <li>Its very soft, I will be ordering another one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very straight, but with enough texture and fullness</li>

            <li>they think I had a professionally done weave!</li>
            <li>I always order in my hair color, cut the lace very close, and push it back so you can see my natural hair line a bit.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how soft and curly it was.  </li>
            <li>Just like my hair when it is professionally styled.  </li>
            <li>Some people are surprised it&#x27;s a wig...</li>
            <li>Some people are surprised it&#x27;s a wig...</li>
            <li>or I want a new look without spending hundreds of dollars on a style that won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>OMG I finally wore Abby today at church, my First Lady came &amp; asked me how long did this take because she though it was a sew in.</li>
            <li>so I had it cut by a professional to shoulder length and that made a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty hair with very little work involved...</li>
            <li>He only problem is it does rat up in the back by the natural hairline, but if you are a lace front wearied you know</li>

            <li> I decided to purchase synthetic lace wigs For the first time. Not a real fan of synthetic hair, but the price of human units... well.. you know... LOL.. SO I order several. hoping that one of them would be okay. This unit Is MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED!!!! Out of several synthetic units order.. 6 to be exact.. I only like the two, and this one is my favorite. I like this unit so much.. im going to order a few more and play with highlights. I am seriously considering going all synthetic when going for the curly look. No Tangles, No fuss.. No Muss!!! I can slip this unit on as easy as a baseball cap but look like i really took time to do my hair.. This is sooooo wonderful!! Beautiful curls, the baby hair is perfect.. really no need to use adhesive which is extremly nice. Even though its synthetic... it doesnt look like the others.. IM SO IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li> Perfect on the go hair, I will be ordering two more when they come in stock again. He only problem is it does rat up in the back by the natural hairline, but if you are a lace front wearied you know this is normal and certain fixes to remedy it.</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR MAKE ME LOOK GOOD, YES I WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE MAYBE TWO MORE LOVE JUST SHAKING IT AND GO</li>
            <li> Since I bought this wig, I&#x27;ve been wearing it almost everyday.  I love it and will be purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> This hair is pretty. I got compliments everywhere I went with it. It Worth&#x27;s every cent. Would patronise this seller more.</li>
            <li> It is well made but I am not just a fan of Synthetic( my first). I gave it to friend, it looks good on her.</li>
            <li> Love this unit!  Doesn&#x27;t tangle nor has it frayed, despite the fact I&#x27;ve worn it to the club.  Time to order another in a different color.</li>
            <li> This wig is fun, soft, and simply beautiful.  It arrived quickly and packaged well.  I could not believe how soft and curly it was.  Just like my hair when it is professionally styled.  I live in a climate that is very hot and humid and my hair does not hold up well so I like to switch up hairdo&#x27;s.  It was a little long for me so I had it cut by a professional to shoulder length and that made a big difference.  It&#x27;s very classy, sheek, and fun all in one.  I&#x27;m not sure how it will maintain it&#x27;s curls after washing...but once again I don&#x27;t wear my wigs everyday just in between time when my hair needs a break or I want a new look without spending hundreds of dollars on a style that won&#x27;t last. This is a must buy in my opinion.  Thank you for introducing me to a great product.</li>

            <li> I get so many compliments on her. It came quick in the mail. If you are wondering if you should buy her buy her.</li>
            <li> My chemobuddies thought this was my own hair.  Thank you for the prompt delivery,  yall got a bald chemo-patient look real good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♡♥♡♥</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like advertised. Color wasn&#x27;t distributed properly &amp; very displeased with texture of the quality of the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair to wear on my vacation it was very easy to manage and maintained.&lt;br /&gt;it met my expectation</li>
            <li> The hair is nice and soft, and its really easy to maintain. Im more than happy with this lace front, especially the front part it fits well.</li>
            <li> I love it , and I am sure I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> OMG! This wig is gorgeous, I got so many compliments on it. I will buy from this seller again. Prompt shipment, and is better than the description.</li>
            <li> OMG I finally wore Abby today at church, my First Lady came &amp; asked me how long did this take because she though it was a sew in. My mister also think it is gorgeous on me. Its very soft, I will be ordering another one</li>
            <li> Since discovering lace front wigs, this is the first curly one I&#x27;ve come across that I can see maintaining its look for a few weeks. Other curly girls seem to tangle terribly after just a few days and quickly becoming matted beyond repair...even with good care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I have not kept this one well...no products to maintain it and I&#x27;ve been pulling it up/back with ties often, hanging it wherever I take it off, and even slept on it twice (with a bonnet). Even after all of that I can still run my fingers through it and there is little to no shedding or tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m learning that wigs purchased sight-unseen rarely look like the stock photo... I think this unit looks MUCH better in person. It is full without being BIG hair, and is soft with a nice luster. The curls are long lose spiral curls and the wig is layered, so it looks like you went for a nice cut and took the time to carefully curl your hair with a curling iron...even after sleeping on it! Very pretty hair with very little work involved...definitely worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the lace front...I always order in my hair color, cut the lace very close, and push it back so you can see my natural hair line a bit. I also do a small part and let the resulting bang hang over some of the lace area. This is just personal preference... I prefer to have my wigs look as authentically like the hair is growing out of my scalp as possible. If you want the complete coverage, I have tried that also and the baby hairline addition to the lace front looks a bit less obvious than the plain lace front wigs do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. If amazon can somehow manage to keep my color in stock for prime shipping (!!!), I will continue to buy this wig again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::UPDATE::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been well over a month (almost two) that I&#x27;ve been wearing this wig daily and it still looks great! In fact, I think it looks better than it did fresh and \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; out of the package. I&#x27;ve received TONS of compliments on the look of this wig, and have been told by many that if they didn&#x27;t know what my real hair looked like they wouldn&#x27;t think twice that this was my hair. Some people are surprised it&#x27;s a wig...they think I had a professionally done weave! I have yet to wash it, but even if it doesn&#x27;t do well when washed I feel I&#x27;ve gotten more than my $$ worth out of this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after purchasing a few of these units, wearing them for a couple of months, and tossing them (because I wasn&#x27;t going to be bothered with the meticulous process of washing a curly wig) I stumbled upon a you tube video of how to flat iron a curly girl. It&#x27;s simple, really... spray a section with water, comb with a paddle brush, then run the flat iron through a few times (of course at a temp less that 400 degrees). I tried it on this one and LOVE the result... It&#x27;s very straight, but with enough texture and fullness that&#x27;s it&#x27;s still convincing. This also means I can easily wash it, and I&#x27;m sure if I want to I can curl it to my liking. Another five stars for the Abby!!!esh and \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; out of the package.
