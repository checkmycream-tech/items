            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li>I found it best to use a light rotating motion</li>
            <li>That is also good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this appliance.</li>

            <li>Got this product for my birthday in October from the hubby and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it comes with all the attachments.</li>
            <li>My sister returned her Clarisonic Christmas gift because she liked this item better.  </li>
            <li>I am happy that I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li>This is the best one and is FAR better than Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>The large exfoliator works beautifully, as does the foot pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap design and quality.</li>
            <li>This brush has all the power you need to wash your face appropriately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay 4 times more for the \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but either I&#x27;m more used to it or it has softened with use.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon! :)</li>
            <li>-- I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed and very pleasantly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>, this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>, I do hope she has better luck with this one but for me??</li>
            <li>Still pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Excellent shipping service from the seller, US Advanced Healthcare (paid regular shipping).  </li>
            <li>Clean lines in the design!</li>
            <li>The machine is durable  and the pads are easy to enter change.</li>
            <li>, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>The old one had no name but the g-maher was a very suitable replacement</li>
            <li>brush has made a huge improvement to my skin.  </li>
            <li>The reviews sounded credible for this machine, but it didn&#x27;t work out for us.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made machine.</li>
            <li>Keep the pressure light and</li>
            <li>When the unit is switched on, I can feel a light buzzing in my hand from the motor but the brush heads do not pulsate like a sonic brush.  </li>
            <li>This seller, US Advanced Healthcare, sells replacement brush heads on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it came with Free Shipping</li>
            <li>I asked again and they both said my face is blemish free.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Dermatouch brush at TJ Maxx and ordered replacement brush heads that fit (pumice stone, sponge and body brush) from TEI Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this despite already owning the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Also, inexpensive Rite-Aid Renewal replacement brush heads fit it.</li>
            <li>For the 2 AA batteries to fit, you&#x27;d have to use a sledge hammer to put them in.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job cleansing your skin, I use it daily in the shower.</li>
            <li>Good so far.</li>
            <li>I bought the AcneFree facial cleansing system, and I use that when I clean my face with the g-maher and have had great results.  </li>
            <li>pretty much love it and use it every morning.</li>
            <li>And, my face feels so clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It has more power, and the batteries have lasted the whole 5 months.  </li>
            <li>I used this daily and have seen a good reduction in the calouses and still working on it.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to keep that youthful glow needs this waterproof brush and believe me you will not find a better price anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Returned for full refund.</li>
            <li>Have been using the other rotating one for over a month and thought it was doing a great job.</li>
            <li>, this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.e such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.</li>
            <li>a product junkie and love to try new products and gadgets</li>
            <li>If I get cleanser on the handle, I rinse the whole unit under running water then rest it on a towel to dry and haven&#x27;t experienced any leaking/waterproof issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The face and body cleansing kit is great.its great for everyday use and it does revive your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having it available, I trust your products 100% for satisfaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitively worth the money and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the hand held item is very quiet when used in the shower, that I like a lot.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the companies offered different textures of brush heads.</li>
            <li>She actually liked it too and recently ordered another g-maher</li>
            <li>I paid $20 more than this one that I bought one for my adult son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It works well and makes my face soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>and yep that&#x27;s right stopped working.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that has kept my face consistently clear for more than 5 months.  </li>
            <li>I used it with my favorite soap and after the first use my skin felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price, which is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>And the super soft gentle one that came with the Dermatouch brush feels great when my skin is sensitive such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.</li>
            <li>First -- full disclosure -- I&#x27;m a man and don&#x27;t normally buy these types of products.</li>
            <li>After using the vibrating one for the first time, I could see an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>For the same amount of money, I think the vibrating system does a better job.</li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly, was well packaged, and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what was described.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>The first one I replaced because it was dropped and stopped working.  </li>
            <li>This one is easy to use and I also like the large soft bristle brush for exfoliation on legs.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and soft after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this g-maher unit that I am still using it on a regular basis as the results have been very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have it tight and secure to keep water out than easy to remove and risk</li>
            <li>The brushes have two different technologies so its easy to justify the need to try both.</li>
            <li>I read people complain about it not working after just a few months and even though I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 months, I&#x27;ve experienced no problems.</li>
            <li>and they may have lasted 2 months and none of them had much power.</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my scarring from my acne fade.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my heels.</li>
            <li>Frabkly speaking it should not even have been priced $40 as similar products with rechargable batteries are available in the market.</li>
            <li>This cleaing brush works really well.</li>
            <li>and my skin clarity has really improved.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself some money and buy it here under \\&quot;g-maher\\&quot; as it is the same seller, US Advanced Healthcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>It rotates very well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loooove the g-maher Waterproof Rotateing Face and Body Cleansing Kit</li>
            <li>I bought this for my face and really like the brush.</li>
            <li>Have a real problem with my feet, calouses, splitting.</li>
            <li>The attachments are very flimsy and feel as though they are going to break or fall off the handle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So much so that I ordered two for my sisters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently opened package, used facial brush and body brush approximaely twice; therefore, can not give a fair review at this time; however, totally dissatisfied with pumice stone.</li>
            <li>I would love to try a slightly firmer one.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any less wrinkles or better skin texture, but I also do not use it every day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush heads on this particular model do not vibrate.  </li>
            <li>Using it once or twice a week with a mild exfoliation scrub will really wake up dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The outside packaging was just right.  </li>
            <li>Gets my face clean surprised me after the first use after I washed my makeup off with my previous routine.</li>
            <li>I said well I just a buy a new one my fault.  </li>
            <li>However, as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve developed acme on my nose, of all places.</li>
            <li>The picture here looks like it has a light blue middle</li>
            <li>I dropped the pumice and it broke off, but I successfully hot glued it back.  </li>
            <li>My face feels very clean afterwards but doesn&#x27;t have that raw, stripped feeling from over scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>The Dermatouch brush comes with a normal brush head (same one that is sold by TEI Spa and g maher) and a feathery soft gentle brush head.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used the large brush for my face and my skin feels like silk when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>Great value for a product that works the same way those expensive products do...  </li>
            <li>That was the primary reason why I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money on a Clarisonic as I probably would have used it only for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly clear skin.  </li>
            <li>You only have to go gentle over the face</li>
            <li>Machine used gently twice a day only.</li>
            <li>really helped to slide open</li>
            <li>and it arrived early.</li>
            <li>The body brush is too soft in my opinion and should be made firmer.</li>
            <li>The body brush is too soft in my opinion and should be made firmer.</li>
            <li>Returning it for partial refund along with shipping both ways will be nearly the same cost as the original purchase and shipping charges.</li>
            <li>I use it with a very small amount of scrub with the small soft brush and then after a good rinse I use the soft solid surface brush with my moisturizer to really let it sink in under the skin.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and a lot cheaper than the other one found in Macy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I have adult cystic acne on my chin and have been using this brush daily for 4 weeks</li>
            <li>and I have only used it on my face so far.  </li>
            <li>The first week I asked a few people if they noticed anything different with my skin without revealing that I was using a new product.  </li>
            <li>Also when I insert fresh batteries the unit rotates such as if I have nearly dead batteries in there.</li>
            <li>Really sets off the dark granite slab it sets on.</li>
            <li>The facial brush gets in the hard to clean places on my face (sides of nose), and does not irritate.  </li>
            <li>I did call Amazon to inform them of the missing application attachments and they [Amazon] provided me with the seller&#x27;s telephone number in order to resolve the matter first, which I did immediately.  </li>
            <li>I was disappointed in the seemingly wimpy face brush bristles at first but the rotating action helps make it more abrasive.</li>
            <li>that TEI Spa attempts to warn consumers that theirs is the \\&quot;one and only\\&quot; rotating face brush when this brush is actually sold by at least 3 companies as [[ASIN:B004NJ8WFO Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless]], [[ASIN:B004BASKAC g-maher Waterproof Rotating Face and Body Cleaning Kit]] and Dermatouch Skin Perfecting System.</li>
            <li>I did find that if I have used too much cleanser, the foam splashes a little as it is a spinning brush, but it is nothing to worry about as it is only 2 or 3 splashes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have been using the other rotating one for over a month and thought it was doing a great job.</li>
            <li> , this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.e such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.</li>
            <li> a product junkie and love to try new products and gadgets</li>
            <li> If I get cleanser on the handle, I rinse the whole unit under running water then rest it on a towel to dry and haven&#x27;t experienced any leaking/waterproof issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The face and body cleansing kit is great.its great for everyday use and it does revive your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having it available, I trust your products 100% for satisfaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitively worth the money and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the hand held item is very quiet when used in the shower, that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the companies offered different textures of brush heads.</li>
            <li> She actually liked it too and recently ordered another g-maher</li>
            <li> I paid $20 more than this one that I bought one for my adult son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It works well and makes my face soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> and yep that&#x27;s right stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that has kept my face consistently clear for more than 5 months.  </li>
            <li> I used it with my favorite soap and after the first use my skin felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price, which is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> And the super soft gentle one that came with the Dermatouch brush feels great when my skin is sensitive such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.</li>
            <li> First -- full disclosure -- I&#x27;m a man and don&#x27;t normally buy these types of products.</li>
            <li> After using the vibrating one for the first time, I could see an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> For the same amount of money, I think the vibrating system does a better job.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly, was well packaged, and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what was described.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> The first one I replaced because it was dropped and stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This one is easy to use and I also like the large soft bristle brush for exfoliation on legs.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and soft after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this g-maher unit that I am still using it on a regular basis as the results have been very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have it tight and secure to keep water out than easy to remove and risk</li>
            <li> The brushes have two different technologies so its easy to justify the need to try both.</li>
            <li> I read people complain about it not working after just a few months and even though I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 months, I&#x27;ve experienced no problems.</li>
            <li> and they may have lasted 2 months and none of them had much power.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my scarring from my acne fade.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my heels.</li>
            <li> Frabkly speaking it should not even have been priced $40 as similar products with rechargable batteries are available in the market.</li>
            <li> This cleaing brush works really well.</li>
            <li> and my skin clarity has really improved.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and buy it here under \\&quot;g-maher\\&quot; as it is the same seller, US Advanced Healthcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> It rotates very well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooove the g-maher Waterproof Rotateing Face and Body Cleansing Kit</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face and really like the brush.</li>
            <li> Have a real problem with my feet, calouses, splitting.</li>
            <li> The attachments are very flimsy and feel as though they are going to break or fall off the handle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So much so that I ordered two for my sisters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently opened package, used facial brush and body brush approximaely twice; therefore, can not give a fair review at this time; however, totally dissatisfied with pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I would love to try a slightly firmer one.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any less wrinkles or better skin texture, but I also do not use it every day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush heads on this particular model do not vibrate.  </li>
            <li> Using it once or twice a week with a mild exfoliation scrub will really wake up dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The outside packaging was just right.  </li>
            <li> Gets my face clean surprised me after the first use after I washed my makeup off with my previous routine.</li>
            <li> I said well I just a buy a new one my fault.  </li>
            <li> However, as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve developed acme on my nose, of all places.</li>
            <li> The picture here looks like it has a light blue middle</li>
            <li> I dropped the pumice and it broke off, but I successfully hot glued it back.  </li>
            <li> My face feels very clean afterwards but doesn&#x27;t have that raw, stripped feeling from over scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> The Dermatouch brush comes with a normal brush head (same one that is sold by TEI Spa and g maher) and a feathery soft gentle brush head.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used the large brush for my face and my skin feels like silk when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> Great value for a product that works the same way those expensive products do...  </li>
            <li> That was the primary reason why I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money on a Clarisonic as I probably would have used it only for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly clear skin.  </li>
            <li> You only have to go gentle over the face</li>
            <li> Machine used gently twice a day only.</li>
            <li> really helped to slide open</li>
            <li> and it arrived early.</li>
            <li> The body brush is too soft in my opinion and should be made firmer.</li>
            <li> The body brush is too soft in my opinion and should be made firmer.</li>
            <li> Returning it for partial refund along with shipping both ways will be nearly the same cost as the original purchase and shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I use it with a very small amount of scrub with the small soft brush and then after a good rinse I use the soft solid surface brush with my moisturizer to really let it sink in under the skin.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money and a lot cheaper than the other one found in Macy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I have adult cystic acne on my chin and have been using this brush daily for 4 weeks</li>
            <li> and I have only used it on my face so far.  </li>
            <li> The first week I asked a few people if they noticed anything different with my skin without revealing that I was using a new product.  </li>
            <li> Also when I insert fresh batteries the unit rotates such as if I have nearly dead batteries in there.</li>
            <li> Really sets off the dark granite slab it sets on.</li>
            <li> The facial brush gets in the hard to clean places on my face (sides of nose), and does not irritate.  </li>
            <li> I did call Amazon to inform them of the missing application attachments and they [Amazon] provided me with the seller&#x27;s telephone number in order to resolve the matter first, which I did immediately.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the seemingly wimpy face brush bristles at first but the rotating action helps make it more abrasive.</li>
            <li> that TEI Spa attempts to warn consumers that theirs is the \\&quot;one and only\\&quot; rotating face brush when this brush is actually sold by at least 3 companies as [[ASIN:B004NJ8WFO Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless]], [[ASIN:B004BASKAC g-maher Waterproof Rotating Face and Body Cleaning Kit]] and Dermatouch Skin Perfecting System.</li>
            <li> I did find that if I have used too much cleanser, the foam splashes a little as it is a spinning brush, but it is nothing to worry about as it is only 2 or 3 splashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting far less breakouts and the odd one or two zits now heal much faster.  </li>
            <li> so I tend to use something only for a few weeks before moving to something new.  </li>
            <li> Since using the small brush applicator for past 4 days however, my facial skin is so smooth and velvety</li>
            <li> my skin feels extra soft after a few uses.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, after opening both boxes, the attachments displayed thru the Amazon webpage (before purchasing same) were not the same in the box.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s, and have trouble with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the prices on other  similar items I decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I tried several of the little brushes from Walmart and various places like that</li>
            <li> Use it dry on some of the scratchy skin and then after showering too.</li>
            <li> The other attachments do not really work, not enough power.</li>
            <li> The second slid down my tub</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and a half and see constant improvement in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> but I have only used the small facial brush</li>
            <li> Initially I found the brush a little rough</li>
            <li> Machine stopped working, so carefully removed head to see what was the problem.</li>
            <li> The pumice stone and larger brush was missing.  </li>
            <li> The responses were not really.  </li>
            <li> I use the facial brush with an apricot crushed seed scrub to polish (grind) away dead skin cells about once a week.  </li>
            <li> This is common sense but don&#x27;t leave it in the same area on your face for too long.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> It is not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> Other plastic attachments were in their place.  </li>
            <li> so I suggest getting the brush from one of the other sellers.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin fresh without a tired dull appearance.</li>
            <li> Motor not powerful</li>
            <li> It is also not economical.</li>
            <li> , it has not broke down.</li>
            <li> (yes, I know the brush already rotates) but it seems to pull my skin less if I didn&#x27;t press down and hold it in one place.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles seem to be less noticeable and problem areas seem to be less problematic.</li>
            <li> Using less cleanser solved the problem.  </li>
            <li> It comes with 4 brushes but it&#x27;s not strong enough for the pumice stone or least for</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Dermatouch has non-existent customer service and does not respond to emails or live chat messages</li>
            <li> It is by no means water prof as the unit stops even if you use it with face creams and little water, forget use in shower.</li>
            <li> Maybe AA rechargeable batteries are a little bit wider ???</li>
            <li> We  wasted our money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is waste of money.</li>
            <li> So the attachments are waste for me.</li>
            <li> I see this seller also has a vibrating model on Amazon which was not available when I purchased this unit.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong machine.</li>
            <li> The rotations are not strong.</li>
            <li> Amazon also offered to refund a percentage of what I paid because of the missing application items if the seller is not able to replace the initially-advertised attachments.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the small brush.</li>
            <li> Usually, I deal with breakouts on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> This past weekend was the two week mark.  </li>
            <li> Compartment to small.</li>
            <li> She has used this machine slightly over 30 days, therefore we are stuck with a broken machine.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers I found the battery cover extremely difficult to remove</li>
            <li> Seriously, my face squeaks from being scrubbed so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Broken with in a month of uses</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give a bad mark as I never tried machine once my rechargeables did not fit.</li>
            <li> As the unit is so useless on face itself, I have not even used in on arms and legs as I feel I would be wasting my time.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get the cap off to insert batteries, but it helps to tie something thru the hole in the bottom (like a shoelace) and use that to pull the cap off.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that i will stay from g-maher products.</li>
            <li> VERY unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Piece o crap.</li>
            <li> The worst is you cannot use rechargable batteries in the unit.</li>

            <li> Great value for a product that works the same way those expensive products do...  my skin feels extra soft after a few uses. This is common sense but don&#x27;t leave it in the same area on your face for too long. 10-15 seconds on one area and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li> Broken with in a month of uses</li>
            <li> After seeing the prices on other  similar items I decided on this one.  Satiesfied with my purchase, it works just fine. You only have to go gentle over the face otherwise you end up red.</li>
            <li> First -- full disclosure -- I&#x27;m a man and don&#x27;t normally buy these types of products. However, as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve developed acme on my nose, of all places. I tried several of the little brushes from Walmart and various places like that and they may have lasted 2 months and none of them had much power. This brush has all the power you need to wash your face appropriately. I&#x27;m using the small brush. I know the package said the sponge is a \\&quot;facial sponge\\&quot; but i couldn&#x27;t tell that worked at all and i have no idea what the big brush is for. It comes with 4 brushes but it&#x27;s not strong enough for the pumice stone or least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitively worth the money and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I&#x27;ll update this review when it dies.</li>
            <li> My sister returned her Clarisonic Christmas gift because she liked this item better.  Told me to get one as soon as possible!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. The brush is the perfect texture, and it does a wonderful job of cleaning, and exfoliating my skin. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay 4 times more for the \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot;. Thank you for offering this product, and for the great price. I will be telling my sisters, and friends about it!</li>
            <li> Purchased the g-maher for teenager&#x27;s acne. Machine used gently twice a day only. Machine stopped working, so carefully removed head to see what was the problem. The wires broke off from the connectors, just snapped. She has used this machine slightly over 30 days, therefore we are stuck with a broken machine. Returning it for partial refund along with shipping both ways will be nearly the same cost as the original purchase and shipping charges. The reviews sounded credible for this machine, but it didn&#x27;t work out for us. We  wasted our money. Buyer Beware...Cheaply made machine. Look elsewhere for a reliable product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and soft after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product and the Arnica Facial Wash..</li>
            <li> I have a rotating brush cleaning kit from this same company, but was intrigued with the reviews for this vibrating one, so ordered it. Have been using the other rotating one for over a month and thought it was doing a great job. After using the vibrating one for the first time, I could see an immediate difference. I have been using it for about a week and a half and see constant improvement in the quality of my skin. Wrinkles seem to be less noticeable and problem areas seem to be less problematic. I am very pleased with this appliance. For the same amount of money, I think the vibrating system does a better job. g-Maher makes a great product.</li>
            <li> The face and body cleansing kit is great.its great for everyday use and it does revive your skin. I am extremely happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Got this product for my birthday in October from the hubby and I love it! I keep it in the shower and use it all the time. It has really helped with my scarring from my acne fade.  Well worth the money and a lot cheaper than the other one found in Macy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift and I have been told that it is doing its job.</li>
            <li> I recently opened package, used facial brush and body brush approximaely twice; therefore, can not give a fair review at this time; however, totally dissatisfied with pumice stone. It did absolutely nothing for my heels. Motor not powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  4/17/12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Device broke 2 days ago while in shower using largest brush on my thighs.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong machine. It is also not economical. I think amazon sells it at a reduced price of $40 while they claim it is a $120 product. Frabkly speaking it should not even have been priced $40 as similar products with rechargable batteries are available in the market. The rotations are not strong. The worst is you cannot use rechargable batteries in the unit. With 4AA&#x27;s required I prefer rechargable batteries. Also when I insert fresh batteries the unit rotates such as if I have nearly dead batteries in there. It is waste of money. As the unit is so useless on face itself, I have not even used in on arms and legs as I feel I would be wasting my time. So the attachments are waste for me. Also, the unit stopped suddenly after two uses and I was about to throw it again it rotated, I would not say worked, so it is still there in my bathroom. It is by no means water prof as the unit stops even if you use it with face creams and little water, forget use in shower. Very cheap design and quality. I am so disappointed that i will stay from g-maher products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am in my 40&#x27;s, and have trouble with adult acne.  This is the first product I have used that has kept my face consistently clear for more than 5 months.  I bought the AcneFree facial cleansing system, and I use that when I clean my face with the g-maher and have had great results.  I like the fact that the g-Maher takes 4 batteries, instead of just 2.  It has more power, and the batteries have lasted the whole 5 months.  Product arrived promptly, was well packaged, and exactly as advertised. I consider this a quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This cleaing brush works really well. Nice that it comes with all the attachments. Was nicely packaged too! Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I buy lot of online items. This is one of my best online purchase.  If you have one of this, you don&#x27;t have to spend money on your facial. I didn&#x27;t want to buy the $100-200 as a beginner, this $40 one worked great. I have this for 2 weeks now and I am very happy with my product. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gets my face clean surprised me after the first use after I washed my makeup off with my previous routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while and I love it! It&#x27;s like going to the spa for a facial. The machine is durable  and the pads are easy to enter change. A defining must have. A great investment.</li>
            <li> I read people complain about it not working after just a few months and even though I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 months, I&#x27;ve experienced no problems. I would suggest not leaving it in your shower all the time because that could contribute to it not working after a while.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping service from the seller, US Advanced Healthcare (paid regular shipping).  I ordered on a Friday and it was shipped the same day and I received it on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box came with 4 attachments but I have only used the small facial brush so I can&#x27;t comment on the other attachments.  Like the other reviewers I found the battery cover extremely difficult to remove but I used washing-up gloves and the rubber grip really helped to slide open the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has made a huge improvement to my skin.  I have adult cystic acne on my chin and have been using this brush daily for 4 weeks and my skin clarity has really improved.  I&#x27;m getting far less breakouts and the odd one or two zits now heal much faster.  My face feels very clean afterwards but doesn&#x27;t have that raw, stripped feeling from over scrubbing.  Initially I found the brush a little rough but either I&#x27;m more used to it or it has softened with use.  I did find that if I have used too much cleanser, the foam splashes a little as it is a spinning brush, but it is nothing to worry about as it is only 2 or 3 splashes.  Using less cleanser solved the problem.  I found it best to use a light rotating motion (yes, I know the brush already rotates) but it seems to pull my skin less if I didn&#x27;t press down and hold it in one place.  Keep the pressure light and moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $40 inc. shipping which is excellent value.  At the time of this review, this same seller also has this on Amazon under \\&quot;TEI Spa\\&quot; for $55, but it is the same product.  The picture here looks like it has a light blue middle but it is actually gray.  Save yourself some money and buy it here under \\&quot;g-maher\\&quot; as it is the same seller, US Advanced Healthcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/18/12&lt;br /&gt;I still love this brush and haven&#x27;t experienced the issues reported by some reviewers.  I use this about twice a week and use regular Duracell batteries and haven&#x27;t had to replace the batteries yet.  There has been no noticeable slowness in speed.  I have only used this at the sink, not in the shower.  If I get cleanser on the handle, I rinse the whole unit under running water then rest it on a towel to dry and haven&#x27;t experienced any leaking/waterproof issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a product junkie and love to try new products and gadgets so I tend to use something only for a few weeks before moving to something new.  That was the primary reason why I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money on a Clarisonic as I probably would have used it only for a few weeks.  I&#x27;m so pleased with this g-maher unit that I am still using it on a regular basis as the results have been very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads on this particular model do not vibrate.  When the unit is switched on, I can feel a light buzzing in my hand from the motor but the brush heads do not pulsate like a sonic brush.  This seller, US Advanced Healthcare, sells replacement brush heads on Amazon.  I see this seller also has a vibrating model on Amazon which was not available when I purchased this unit.</li>
            <li> I like this product. YOU must add 4 AA batteries to this product, in order for it work well. I like it over all, it has not broke down. That is also good. I like both brushes. Most importantly, the hand held item is very quiet when used in the shower, that I like a lot. It is not too big or too small. It rotates very well. Good so far. I also like that it came with Free Shipping and it arrived early. That was a shcoker, but very good! I am happy with the seller. Thank you Amazon! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered two of this product.  The outside packaging was just right.  On the other hand, after opening both boxes, the attachments displayed thru the Amazon webpage (before purchasing same) were not the same in the box.  The pumice stone and larger brush was missing.  Other plastic attachments were in their place.  Since using the small brush applicator for past 4 days however, my facial skin is so smooth and velvety -- I am so pleased.  I did call Amazon to inform them of the missing application attachments and they [Amazon] provided me with the seller&#x27;s telephone number in order to resolve the matter first, which I did immediately.  At this time, it has been a day since I&#x27;ve contacted the seller so I am waiting for their response.  Amazon also offered to refund a percentage of what I paid because of the missing application items if the seller is not able to replace the initially-advertised attachments.  By the way, Amazon does their best to satisfy their customers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loooove the g-maher Waterproof Rotateing Face and Body Cleansing Kit and I have only used it on my face so far.  I have fairly clear skin.  Usually, I deal with breakouts on my cheeks.  I have been using this item for two weeks.  The first week I asked a few people if they noticed anything different with my skin without revealing that I was using a new product.  The responses were not really.  This past weekend was the two week mark.  I asked again and they both said my face is blemish free.  Literally no breakouts!  I am amazed and very pleasantly satisfied.  I can&#x27;t wait for the effects when I begin to use it on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face and really like the brush. Have a real problem with my feet, calouses, splitting. I used this daily and have seen a good reduction in the calouses and still working on it. Use it dry on some of the scratchy skin and then after showering too.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for complexion care.  Using it once or twice a week with a mild exfoliation scrub will really wake up dry skin.  I use it with a very small amount of scrub with the small soft brush and then after a good rinse I use the soft solid surface brush with my moisturizer to really let it sink in under the skin.  I have used this type of product for years and my machine finally gave out after 10 yrs of use.  This one is easy to use and I also like the large soft bristle brush for exfoliation on legs.  Anyone who wants to keep that youthful glow needs this waterproof brush and believe me you will not find a better price anywhere.  It&#x27;s just amazing.  Thanks Amazon for having it available, I trust your products 100% for satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my face squeaks from being scrubbed so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny that TEI Spa attempts to warn consumers that theirs is the \\&quot;one and only\\&quot; rotating face brush when this brush is actually sold by at least 3 companies as [[ASIN:B004NJ8WFO Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless]], [[ASIN:B004BASKAC g-maher Waterproof Rotating Face and Body Cleaning Kit]] and Dermatouch Skin Perfecting System. They are all the same and the brush heads are interchangeable. The Dermatouch brush comes with a normal brush head (same one that is sold by TEI Spa and g maher) and a feathery soft gentle brush head. Unfortunately, Dermatouch has non-existent customer service and does not respond to emails or live chat messages so I suggest getting the brush from one of the other sellers. I bought the Dermatouch brush at TJ Maxx and ordered replacement brush heads that fit (pumice stone, sponge and body brush) from TEI Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this despite already owning the [[ASIN:B001SERK9G Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush]]. The brushes have two different technologies so its easy to justify the need to try both. The Pretika vibrates and this one spins. I was disappointed in the seemingly wimpy face brush bristles at first but the rotating action helps make it more abrasive. Only one speed but I think its perfect and wouldn&#x27;t want it any slower. I like that it is waterproof so I can use and leave in the shower. It was difficult to get the cap off to insert batteries, but it helps to tie something thru the hole in the bottom (like a shoelace) and use that to pull the cap off. I&#x27;d rather have it tight and secure to keep water out than easy to remove and risk having it ruined by water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much love it and use it every morning. It would be nice if the companies offered different textures of brush heads. I would love to try a slightly firmer one. And the super soft gentle one that came with the Dermatouch brush feels great when my skin is sensitive such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere. The body brush is too soft in my opinion and should be made firmer. The handle seems unnecessarily big but this is not a big deal. Compared to the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]], this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.e such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.

            <li> The unit is excellent as advertised.  I use the facial brush with an apricot crushed seed scrub to polish (grind) away dead skin cells about once a week.  It leaves my skin baby-soft and glowing,  I am 62 but I have no blemishes and this method keeps my skin fresh without a tired dull appearance. Also, inexpensive Rite-Aid Renewal replacement brush heads fit it.</li>
            <li> For the 2 AA batteries to fit, you&#x27;d have to use a sledge hammer to put them in. Compartment to small. Maybe AA rechargeable batteries are a little bit wider ??? Returned for full refund. I considered this a defect. I didn&#x27;t want to give a bad mark as I never tried machine once my rechargeables did not fit. AND YES, I\\&quot;M SURE THEY WERE AA SIZE - LOL.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what was described.  The large exfoliator works beautifully, as does the foot pumice stone.  The facial brush gets in the hard to clean places on my face (sides of nose), and does not irritate.  I would definitely recommend this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> VERY unhappy with this product. The attachments are very flimsy and feel as though they are going to break or fall off the handle. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job cleansing your skin, I use it daily in the shower. So far, I&#x27;ve only used the large brush for my face and my skin feels like silk when I&#x27;m finished. My your pores are refined. It&#x27;s well worth the price, which is very reasonable. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My skin is really different after using it; only on my face.  The other attachments do not really work, not enough power.</li>
            <li> pumice stone falls off</li>
            <li> Bought the g-maher waterproof rotating face and body cleaning kit in september 2011 after searching for replacement of a very similar product I had for&lt;br /&gt;I would guess 10 years. The old one had no name but the g-maher was a very suitable replacement and I was happy with it. So much so that I ordered two for my sisters.&lt;br /&gt;the one I bought in September no longer works and believe me I babied that thing. Mentioned to one sister that I was looking again for a replacement and discovered&lt;br /&gt;the one I gave her in december is no longer working either! She actually liked it too and recently ordered another g-maher, I do hope she has better luck with this one but for me??... the search continues....</li>
            <li> I looked at several facial cleaning systems and end up buying this one.  I am happy that I made the right choice.  I used it with my favorite soap and after the first use my skin felt so soft.  Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! And, my face feels so clean afterwards.  I have tried the pumice stones on my heals, but that has not been as productive, I may need to soak my feet a bit longer than just standing in the shower. I have not noticed any less wrinkles or better skin texture, but I also do not use it every day.  Still pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  The first one I replaced because it was dropped and stopped working.  I said well I just a buy a new one my fault.  The second slid down my tub and yep that&#x27;s right stopped working.  Piece o crap.</li>
            <li> Have used this type of electric brush for decades. This is the best one and is FAR better than Clarisonic.  I used every attachment except the foam.  I dropped the pumice and it broke off, but I successfully hot glued it back.  I paid $20 more than this one that I bought one for my adult son for Christmas.  Batteries last.  When it dies, I will buy another because it makes my skin feel wonderful and look lustrous.</li>
            <li> Really sets off the dark granite slab it sets on. Clean lines in the design!</li>
            <li> It works well and makes my face soft and smooth! I would recommend it for anyone!  It works well on my feet also!</li>
