            <li> Nice lipstick. Lasts a bit longer than expected. A bit more translucent than I was hoping for, but looks opaque when layered over a dark maroon color.</li>
            <li> Loved the night color it&#x27;s very smooth and creamy .no taste but doesn&#x27;t last long came off the first time I ate. I&#x27;m a Mac matte user and it lasts all day through eating and drinking so I&#x27;m not satisfied I thought it would last long.I wouldn&#x27;t buy again unless keisha has all day wear lipstick I don&#x27;t know about</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the worse black lipstick I have owned. I am just super picky. All in all though, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Slides on smooth and stays on long</li>
            <li> Loved how creamy this lipstick was, but really had to keep layering to get dark and wiped off on everything. Still made a good look!</li>
            <li> cheap lipstick, i needed to put a lot of layers of it to make it dark and bold. Didn&#x27;t seem any different form the cheap Halloween lipstick you buy at the store, its like fake kids makeup, horrible never again.</li>
            <li> It became before the expected delivery date which I love because it usually take two weeks...why? I really dont know since its in the U.S. but absolutely love the color and the texture. This is not my first time ordering from Ka&#x27;oir and I just love her products the only thing I dont like about them is how long it would usually take but I do plan on ordering the green lipstick and also I plan on doing a youtube video review later. All together very pleased with the product cant wait to order again!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, goes on like regular lipstick, stays on. Reapply as needed. All the other BLACK lipsticks I had read about on here, had at least a FEW bad reviews. This one was the ONLY one I could find that didn&#x27;t have any whatsoever.. And with the price, I was hesitant.. But, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> ive been looking for a black lipstick for a long time, now me i dont spend alot on lipsticks but for me this was worth it</li>
            <li> The best hands down the quality was great I love it !!!! I would recommend it to all my Dark lipstick lovers</li>

            <li> This Jet Black Lipstick was of poor quality. It required lots of effort to achieve a bold color (many layers, lots of lip lining)-- even then it was not long lasting. I was really expecting more after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is perfection, better than most.  I highly appreciate the quick service and the color is amazing.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> So soft and creamy! And the color is very bold, I love it! But make sure you&#x27;re not too shy for this color because it is an eye catcher!</li>

            <li> Very smooth .&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap or fake .&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and different.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting and looks very bold.&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick brings out your lips and makes you feel very pretty.</li>
