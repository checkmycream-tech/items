            <li>It fit &amp; worked just fine.</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These are the exact filters that came with our Vicks Humidifier.</li>
            <li>Amazon, dump the supplier of this cheap, rip-off imitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has lost my good</li>
            <li>then the original Kaz WF2 filter, the height is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to soak the filter and then carefully strecht it so it would fit in the humidifier.  </li>
            <li>and it is much shorter in diameter (close to 2 inches shorter)</li>
            <li>That is reserved for something that really deserves 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>price is decent.  </li>
            <li>(most likely micro-organisms starting to form) - so don&#x27;t.</li>

            <li>I live in the Forty Mile Desert in northern Nevada.  </li>
            <li>These are quality, ship fast, and last just about an entire month as advertised.</li>
            <li>I paid $10 at a big box store for a knock-off brand and it completely fell apart in 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I also had to smash it a little so that the water tank will fit tightly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I still have not received the item!!!!  How can I review it if I have not yet received it?????? I had to give it a one star because it would not let me give it a zero star!!!</li>
            <li> It fit right in and went to work. got it quickly too.</li>
            <li> These filters work great for my V3100 Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier.  Glad to be able to order them here on Amazon - convenient and price is decent.  The filters seem to last about 3months in our humidifier, which we use for our daughter (not daily, but often 2-3 weeks in a row every month or two).  It might last longer if we emptied out the water in the system when not in use.</li>
            <li> I have been using other filter sizes from Filters-Now and they all fitted perfectly in other humidifiers I have. This one was the first WF2 I bought from Filters-Now and it is much shorter in diameter (close to 2 inches shorter) then the original Kaz WF2 filter, the height is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to soak the filter and then carefully strecht it so it would fit in the humidifier.  I don&#x27;t know how efficient it will work and how long it will last. Next time I will look for another filter brand.</li>
            <li> Replacement filters are never as good as the ones that came with the product.  Why is that?  This one is about is good as its going to get</li>
            <li> These filters are useless, they neither fit the humidifier NOR are they designed to extended between the base and the fan cone. A total waste of my purchase money. Amazon, dump the supplier of this cheap, rip-off imitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has lost my good will  - I will NEVER buy through Amazon again!</li>
            <li> Fit my old machine great!!</li>
            <li> The replacement filter cam shortly after I ordered it.  It fit &amp; worked just fine. If one leav es the filter in the machine when not in use during the day, it starts to turn color (most likely micro-organisms starting to form) - so don&#x27;t. Take it out &amp; dry it during the day, if you use it at night only.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is a good functional replacement filter for the original and does a well especially at the price point offered,</li>
            <li> I find it hard to give 5 stars to a filter.  That is reserved for something that really deserves 5 stars.  That being said, it does the job.  I think they are a little pricey, however, considering that the humidifier cost less than $50 at Bed Bath and Beyond. Both, however, do the job.</li>
            <li> This was replacement filter for our Vick&#x27;s machine that we use for our son with allergies.  It has worked great and lasted a month before replacing again.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i needed.  I could not go shopping and found these online.  Not the best price but it does help to have them.</li>
            <li> Buy this instead of cheap filters. I paid $10 at a big box store for a knock-off brand and it completely fell apart in 24 hours. This is a good, sturdy filter.</li>
            <li> Fits just like the original!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly into my humidifier.</li>
            <li> Product as described and FAST shipment!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are the exact filters that came with our Vicks Humidifier. The cheaper replacements available are inferior and we had problems. These are quality, ship fast, and last just about an entire month as advertised. Won&#x27;t bother trying cut rate / cheaper filters again.</li>
            <li> seem to crust up quickly, but it is the required filter for my humidifier so I will just keep replacing. I even use filtered water?</li>
            <li> I live in the Forty Mile Desert in northern Nevada.  I keep the humidity up in the summer with swamp coolers, but I can&#x27;t run the coolers when it&#x27;s twelve degrees outside.&lt;br /&gt;Using the humidifier I can keep the indoors humidity as high as 30%&lt;br /&gt;I get these from Filters Now and the service is excellent.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find these filters in local stores so I had to order it.  It is a little bit larger than the space in my humidifier so it frays more every time I fill the water tank.  I also had to smash it a little so that the water tank will fit tightly.</li>
            <li> Arizona water is half copper and arsenic. Kidding but not really - this filter saves your humidifier from total Clog City.</li>
