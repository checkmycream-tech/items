            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this product and since it&#x27;s no longer available in salons, I love being able to buy it online.  </li>

            <li>I then run my hands through my hair making sure that it covers all my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work so great for TWA&#x27;s or longer natural hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for wet wrapping relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>It is light and it shines your hair without gluing it together.  </li>
            <li>so I could get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Atlas Supply chain is super fast in its delivery; overall happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>I have used this to make my grey hair look great and be managable for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>Not sticky to the touch like most stylers plus the ladies seem to like the feel and smell of it ;)</li>
            <li>Great for some hair, just not for mine when it&#x27;s too dry.</li>
            <li>I have found another product Shea Butter that I also love and it is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that I purchased this product to try and duplicate what she does when I am in between hair appointments.  </li>
            <li>Works great for super short natural hair (fades and tapered cuts).</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal since the smell is nice, and the product is non greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is full and very Shiney!  </li>
            <li>about 3 dollars cheaper than most places at 14$ currently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can see from other customer feedback I am not the only one to have experienced this.</li>
            <li>10/5/15-This is another notice about the paul mitchell pomade that I purchase, I really like the product, but cannot understand why aI have not receive another order or my refund.</li>
            <li>Not greasy if you don&#x27;t use too much and tames the flyaways for me.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re working out or on the go and sweat a bit it won&#x27;t really hold up to the pressure</li>
            <li>very drying, no curl  definition for my 3c - 4c hair texture.</li>
            <li>Just a dime-size amount defines my natural hair curl pattern much better than the same line&#x27;s &amp;#34;Twirl Around.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I tried to contact the seller, but was not able to on this product, or am I able to return it!</li>
            <li>The top was wet with product, and there was even hair on it!</li>
            <li>I am sending to P Mitchell in Beverly Hills as I live close by for them to confirm authenticity.</li>
            <li>I am retired now and the price just doesn&#x27;t work well on a fixed income.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist had recommended this product when I went natural, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Bottle seemed old and used.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile,when I recieved this product, it was in a plastic bag, and a considerable amount had leaked out of the product bottle.  </li>
            <li>I think that this product gives alot of volume and defintely shine my hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays moist, soft, curly and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>When I shook the bottle it was not full, I could hear the liquid sloshing around, which wouldnt happen if it was full.</li>
            <li>Strong hold without being too sticky or hard looking.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bottle arrived it is different to the picture on the ad which is certainly a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Finally I contacted the seller who told me that the product was new from the &amp;#34;shelve&amp;#34; of a salon.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Foaming Pomade allows me to style my natural hair but does not dry it out like mousse.  </li>
            <li>No other explanation provided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with naturally curly/coily hair and this product helps define my curls without overdrying.</li>
            <li>I use this for laying down my edges and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It has a black cap (unusual) and the graphics are unfamiliar although its white and fluid it smells different and doesnt foam.</li>
            <li>You need a little more than what is recommended if your hair is thick.</li>

            <li> You need a little more than what is recommended if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li> My co-worker put me on to this product, when my hair no longer decide to lay flat to my scalp once it started to get longer and fuller after therapy.</li>
            <li> The first issue is that my hair is not particularly curly, but is thick and wavy, with come curl at the ends and plenty of frizz.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it gave my hair curly definition whether it was wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a tack-like texture but definitely helps set whatever style you&#x27;re aiming for.</li>
            <li> The following days I may apply a little of the product if it is needed.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair look wet and moist</li>
            <li> Wet your hair in the morning, add the foam and style.</li>
            <li> then I squeeze out the excess water leaving my hair wet but not dripping wet</li>
            <li> (it is not damp but wet).</li>
            <li> I expected this since my stylist had told me this would happen until the product dried on my hair, so no big deal.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.  </li>
            <li> I ordered other things</li>
            <li> Not at all sticky like some of the other foams that you use when doing a roller wrap.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount of this on dry hair smooths the frizz and enhances the waves.</li>
            <li> Let air dry or use a diffuser it&#x27;s done!!!!</li>
            <li> It defines my curls but my hair is very  stiff when dry.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave flaky mess and isnt cement.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> I was really anxious to recieve this product, put very disappointment on how the item was sent to me.  </li>
            <li> BAD PACKING, ALL POMADE HAD LEAK OUT</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> BAD PACKING, ALL POMADE HAD LEAK OUT, I LOVE PAUL MITCHELL PRODUCTS, AND WOULD LIKE A REPLACEMENT OR REFUND. 10/5/15-This is another notice about the paul mitchell pomade that I purchase, I really like the product, but cannot understand why aI have not receive another order or my refund.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It did what it said it would do. It arrived as scheduled and as promised. I like it.</li>
            <li> So happy with the foaming pomade. Strong hold without being too sticky or hard looking.  Softer body with the control.  That&#x27;s what makes it ideal for my styling needs.  Atlas Supply chain is super fast in its delivery; overall happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it.  I have found another product Shea Butter that I also love and it is much cheaper.  I am going to have to let my Paul Mitchell Foaming Pomade go because of the price.  I am retired now and the price just doesn&#x27;t work well on a fixed income.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair look wet and moist</li>
            <li> My hair stylist had recommended this product when I went natural, so I decided to try it.  The first issue is that my hair is not particularly curly, but is thick and wavy, with come curl at the ends and plenty of frizz.  I applied this product and of course my hair turned white.  I expected this since my stylist had told me this would happen until the product dried on my hair, so no big deal.  However, I didn&#x27;t see that my hair looked any different before I used it, then it did after I use it.  This wouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal since the smell is nice, and the product is non greasy.  However, the problem occurred the next day.  I sprayed water on my hair so that I could detangle a bit before putting it into a puff, and my hair turned white all over again!  Therefore, my hair didn&#x27;t absorb the product in anyway, but the product just sort of coated my hair.  Sorry, but I don&#x27;t want my hair turning white a day or two after applying a product, so I am choosing not to use this again.</li>
            <li> It defines my curls but my hair is very  stiff when dry.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Bottle seemed old and used.</li>
            <li> This turns my 2-inch afro into a 1.5-inch head of shiny, super-duper defined coils and curls.  I simply wash, condition then apply the foaming pomade as directed.  On alternate days, I refresh with a moisturizer.  No way could I be more pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Great for some hair, just not for mine when it&#x27;s too dry. This pomade squirts out and foams when you rub it together. It has a little bit of a tack-like texture but definitely helps set whatever style you&#x27;re aiming for. You need a little more than what is recommended if your hair is thick. The price point makes me think twice about it, as my hair needs to have this product washed out after every use. If your hair is ok with product layering, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Just a dime-size amount defines my natural hair curl pattern much better than the same line&#x27;s &amp;#34;Twirl Around.&amp;#34;  It is my #1 product for&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Wash &amp; Go&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried to contact the seller, but was not able to on this product, or am I able to return it! Meanwhile,when I recieved this product, it was in a plastic bag, and a considerable amount had leaked out of the product bottle.  I was really anxious to recieve this product, put very disappointment on how the item was sent to me.  This web site does NOT allow me to return the item so I am considering  buying the product in the actual salon.  So buyers beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product and since it&#x27;s no longer available in salons, I love being able to buy it online.  I&#x27;m African American with naturally curly/coily hair and this product helps define my curls without overdrying. I use it every day.  A little goes a long way too.  I combine it with coconut oil and my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and thought I would try and save a couple of dollars by buying online. The plastic bottle arrived it is different to the picture on the ad which is certainly a new bottle. It has a black cap (unusual) and the graphics are unfamiliar although its white and fluid it smells different and doesnt foam. There is I think a date on the bottom and although I could be mistaken I believe the exp. date looks like 05. I am sending to P Mitchell in Beverly Hills as I live close by for them to confirm authenticity.</li>
            <li> If you are multi racial or have curly AA hair this stuff is awesome. Wet your hair in the morning, add the foam and style. Let air dry or use a diffuser it&#x27;s done!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product which appeared to be used. There wasn&#x27;t any outer packaging, which would indicate an unbroken seal. The top was wet with product, and there was even hair on it! When I shook the bottle it was not full, I could hear the liquid sloshing around, which wouldnt happen if it was full. Finally I contacted the seller who told me that the product was new from the &amp;#34;shelve&amp;#34; of a salon. No other explanation provided. I would never order from this &#x27;establishment&#x27; again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see from other customer feedback I am not the only one to have experienced this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I will buy a bigger size next time. Works great for super short natural hair (fades and tapered cuts). It doesn&#x27;t work so great for TWA&#x27;s or longer natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is light and it shines your hair without gluing it together.  I went to several stores and they were out.  The price was about the same as in stores. I ordered other things so I could get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Product is very good provides moisture and shine</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair.  Just a small amount of this on dry hair smooths the frizz and enhances the waves.</li>
            <li> It is not like most of the products I have bought. This product is not foaming pomade it dose not foam at all. I do not like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for wet wrapping relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Foaming Pomade allows me to style my natural hair but does not dry it out like mousse.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it gave my hair curly definition whether it was wet or dry.  It also gave my hair a shine.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, not sticky. I use this for laying down my edges and it works very well. I&#x27;m very impressed w/ this product. All it takes is a drop on the finger.</li>
            <li> I have used this to make my grey hair look great and be managable for over 20 years. i &#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this forever and probably always will.  Not greasy if you don&#x27;t use too much and tames the flyaways for me.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 8 years and it provides a shone and hold yet manageable for styling as well. I like top use it in junction with this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004GVBZL2cache&#x3D;389646043ad5a0aebb79cadb72b41ede&amp;pi&#x3D;SY200_QL40&amp;qid&#x3D;1407165841&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2#ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by itself it&#x27;s nice but lacks a strong hold so if you&#x27;re working out or on the go and sweat a bit it won&#x27;t really hold up to the pressure so i like to mix the two together for maximum results.  Not sticky to the touch like most stylers plus the ladies seem to like the feel and smell of it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s about 3 dollars cheaper than most places at 14$ currently. I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than about 18$ for it give or take a dollar.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and item as descibed</li>
            <li> very drying, no curl  definition for my 3c - 4c hair texture.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used. Doesnt leave flaky mess and isnt cement. perfect balance.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses this on my hair when I have my roller wrap done.  When I come from under the dryer and she combs out my wrap it is absolutely beautiful.  My hair is full and very Shiney!  I love it so much that I purchased this product to try and duplicate what she does when I am in between hair appointments.  I think that this product gives alot of volume and defintely shine my hair is soft and manageable.  Not at all sticky like some of the other foams that you use when doing a roller wrap.  Give it a try on your wrap I am sure you will agree that this product gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My co-worker put me on to this product, when my hair no longer decide to lay flat to my scalp once it started to get longer and fuller after therapy. I am of mixed raced with Hispanic ethnicity. This is how I use the product; I wash my hair, then apply conditioner, and rinse out the conditioner.. Once I have rinsed out the conditioner I comb my hair then I squeeze out the excess water leaving my hair wet but not dripping wet (it is not damp but wet). I put about a dime size amount to the palm of my hand (use your own judgement, the longer your hair is the more you will need) rub my palms together and it foams on the palm of my hands I then run my hands through my hair making sure that it covers all my hair. I finger comb my hair. My hair stays moist, soft, curly and shiny all day. The following days I may apply a little of the product if it is needed.</li>
