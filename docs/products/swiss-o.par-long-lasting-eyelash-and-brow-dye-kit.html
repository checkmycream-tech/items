            <li>Great &amp;#34;home use&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really great product</li>
            <li>I looked great all  day then put on my sleep mask to go to bed.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>this works just great.  </li>
            <li>The product is wonderful for gals like me who have very light lashes.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  </li>
            <li>I did not have good luck with this product.  </li>
            <li>Linda, the seller of this product, did a fabulous time at making her customer was happy!</li>
            <li>My wife says that the kit is as good as the professionals use and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and after reading some of the reviews on how to apply the product, I have this suggestion : Use a q-tip to apply the liquid primer, let it set for a good minute.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising how darker brows accent your eyes.</li>
            <li>this very easy to use and work great</li>
            <li>I am so happy and pleased with this product</li>
            <li>product is ideal for blonds, redheads, and light brunettes who want darker lashes.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time !</li>
            <li>and what it says about it and more!</li>
            <li>It stained the skin better than the lashes!</li>
            <li>Make sure to get those corner lashes!  </li>
            <li>Make sure to get those corner lashes!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I think this could work great for somebody that has extremely light lashes.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s wonderful and now I have beautiful dark brows (my eyes are noticeable).  </li>
            <li>very easy to use.</li>
            <li>intensity of color fades within week, but very easy to reapply</li>
            <li>Quick easy lasts, try it for yourself, I have very fair lashes, so it helps me, as I do not care for mascara.</li>
            <li>it works more like transitional mascara and lasts 4 days.</li>
            <li>But I think I will love it after repeated applications.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I achieved a more precise application that way the comb thing kind of scared me that close to my eye.</li>
            <li>Have tried others that were ok, but thought I&#x27;d give Swiss O-Par a shot.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel the customer should have more advice for protecting his/her skin from unwanted dying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Pleased Customer</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>so I kinda threw caution to the wind and got some of it in my eye, but if you&#x27;ve worn contacts before or gotten something stuck on your eye you&#x27;ve probably dealt with a lot more pain than that.</li>
            <li>-so I just bought an eyelash brush which worked a lot better.  </li>
            <li>So satisfying.</li>
            <li>Maybe if another person did the application it would work better but trying to do it yourself is joke.  </li>
            <li>Cheap product, bed result!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation from the product, but I also tend to keep it mostly on the ends of my lashes since that&#x27;s where I need darkening the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, applying some jojoba oil or eye cream to the skin underneath the lash leaves helps them stay on the skin well and protect you better.</li>
            <li>you can probably get more uses out of this.</li>
            <li>I have continued to use it on my eyebrows, and it is okay</li>
            <li>Get the slightly better ones, as they have more bristles.  </li>
            <li>This works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>That said, this is a quick, cost effective alternative to having your lashes tinted in a salon.</li>
            <li>Also the application process is easy, just be sure to style and trim your brows before you put on your dye.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the price is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, safe and very effective and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Per some other comments, I thinks that works best</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts longer than anything else.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow both written and pictorially.</li>
            <li>But easy to use kit.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is so easy</li>
            <li>Very simple to apply and the color has held beautifully.</li>
            <li>and it was nice at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and fast and I love it!</li>
            <li>but now they seem light brown again.</li>
            <li>but it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that the dye would help to bring out the light tips of my eyelashes</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend!! :)</li>
            <li>but well worth the effort!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product worth buying!</li>
            <li>The comb that you use to apply the dye isn&#x27;t user friendly either.</li>
            <li>After writing a review, the seller quickly responded with an apology and today at my doorstep was a FREE kit of the Swiss O-Par and attached</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t pop quite as much as a good professional dye job, but it&#x27;s a hassle to find the right aesthetician who will understand what I&#x27;m trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li>I am particularly delighted with the short processing time.</li>
            <li>I love when products don&#x27;t talk themselves up to what they really are.</li>
            <li>However, it appears based on the bottles of product that there is probably enough product for more than 12 (6x2) applications, so if you can purchase more lash leaves separately</li>
            <li>I was using dye lash which is cheaper and also works but not as quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly too</li>
            <li>I have dark brunette hair, but the ends of my eyelashes are colorless, so this product is great to darken ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did one eye at a time, first the bottom lashes, then the top, so I repeated the whole process four times.</li>
            <li>This is the REAL deal and so is their service!!</li>
            <li>, it was VERY brown on her naturally light lashes.</li>
            <li>Better yet, have it done professionally.</li>
            <li>Just have to tint more frequently.</li>
            <li>Between the oil and the tint, I now rarely wear mascara (but I still curl my eyelashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color will appear right away.  </li>
            <li>When you want it right than do it professionally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used eyelash/brow dye Tint color for decades and I love it because it is simple fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>sure your lashes are clean and dry before you</li>
            <li>I get better results using a few drops of cheap hair colour and a clean mascara wand.</li>
            <li>do not stay long but very easy to apply</li>
            <li>I also noted that it lasts for about 6 weeks as stated in the beginning, but as the product gets older, you need to apply it more frequently.</li>
            <li>To top it off, some product splattered on my white porcelain tub and made permanent stains.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>So, first realize that this is NOT going to make you look like you are wearing mascara.  </li>
            <li>rush the application and take your time to apply the step one gel first to all the lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used an at-home tinting kit.</li>
            <li>However, overall I&#x27;m glad I bought the product.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly how</li>
            <li>The first time was terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so mascara will still look better and will still be necessary for a &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Got some funny metallic component.  </li>
            <li>I first started using this when I lived in Prague,</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a 3 star is that what color I did get on was better than none at all.</li>
            <li>I used regular clean cotton swabs to apply the liquid, then applied the gel with a clean mascara spoolie instead of the comb that came with the kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While there are other tinting kits out there that are stronger thus the tint lasts longer, this formula is far better for sensitive skin and eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged one star because I think they should include more under-eye protection papers with the kit!</li>
            <li>It will fade from your skin in a couple days on its own, or you can try the removal tips in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on how you wash your face and how quickly your new lashes grow.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re pretty much invisible if I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>The first applications went really well</li>
            <li>A quick, not messy way to cut out a salon service.</li>
            <li>Certainly as promised.</li>
            <li>like especially how fast and easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>For those thinking of this for the first time, I highly recommend it (after shaping your brows with wax or whatever).</li>
            <li>*really* stung.  </li>
            <li>Does not work very well, would not recommend it</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>If you do the whole operation is finished, it takes awhile to rinse it out and get over the pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll do and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else with light eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and I would buy from this seller again but not this product.</li>
            <li>I finish by washing my eyebrows with a gentle sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li>: Do this when you&#x27;re not tired, are feeling focused, and don&#x27;t have anything distracting going on.</li>
            <li>Really did not seem to work.  </li>
            <li>Thinking my lashes are to sparse to really notice the effect.</li>
            <li>I cant really blame your product.</li>
            <li>I have blue eyes and blonde hair, but it turned out really nice.</li>
            <li>If you dab a little eye cream on the skin around your eyes before starting and keep a clean damp cotton swab handy for wiping off goofs, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry too much about rogue stains.</li>
            <li>I find I use less mascara after tinting because my very light colored lashes have color to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I truly love the simplicity and fast and lasting coloring it provides, so I will definitely continue using ...</li>
            <li>Because that is when you have lost enough eyelashes (on your natural eyelash growth cycle) that your new, natural eyelashes become more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Tint</li>
            <li>I get black lashes in 2 minutes and don&#x27;t have to wear mascara :)</li>
            <li>Use my first tiny brush, dipped in the bottle of solution 1, to THOROUGHLY brush through and wet all my lashes, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>Use my first tiny brush, dipped in the bottle of solution 1, to THOROUGHLY brush through and wet all my lashes, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>Not noticeable enough to be worth the time, energy and money of application.</li>
            <li>Wash my eyelids with SOAP (normal hand soap) to remove all skin oils and moisturizer from around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I received spilled over, only due to the nature of the product &amp; how it may leak, I wasn&#x27;t at first pleased with the initial bottle!  </li>
            <li>would give it 5 stars but wish it was a little darker black, other than that the products is wonderful.</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful though because you can easily color your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>ordered some inexpensive, disposable mascara brushes to apply this which works much better - especially when trying to get those tiny lashes on the inner and outer corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>It only took about ten minutes for the entire process. :)</li>
            <li>Apparently mine are darker than I thought because this didn&#x27;t seem to change them much.  </li>
            <li>It looks the same as when the salon mixes a color to match my hair exactly.</li>
            <li>I did get a little bit of the gel in one eye and it stung like a beast for maybe fifteen seconds, but I blinked it out easily and the redness went away about a minute after the stinging stopped.</li>
            <li>You can always apply a little at a time, and more later to fill in any spot you may miss.  </li>
            <li>It WILL make nearly invisible lashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid for professional lash tinting before and my at-home results with this product are comparable.</li>
            <li>bought my stuff at a professional and than you do it home.</li>
            <li>Just follow the directions and in less time than it takes to apply mascara you will have nice black lashes.  </li>
            <li>I left it on 1 minute the first time then 3 minutes the next time,  and my eye brows came out darker</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who is capable of dying/or not a professional.  </li>
            <li>Not thick enough so</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much product so it should last for several application.  </li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that the pads that are supposed to stay under your eyes (to protect your skin) don&#x27;t stay on, which means that your skin will get stained and it is hard to be precise with these paper pads sticking up and moving around every time you blink.  </li>
            <li>my eyebrows and lashes are almost white and this helps me look as young as I still feel, while not making me look like I&#x27;m trying!&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li>After having gotten my eyes nearly burnt out when I got my lashes tinted at a local salon-</li>
            <li>The results are not as if you go to a professional, but I do see a bit of tint, especially at the lash line and it does give my eyes a bit of a pop.</li>
            <li>Did not do anything but barely darken the tips.</li>
            <li>products in a manner similar to hair dye (DON&#x27;T USE HAIR DYE NEAR YOUR EYES) in that you are permanently changing the color of the eyelash hairs.  </li>
            <li>Well, it looked awfully strange to have such light eyebrows and lashes with such dark hair.  </li>
            <li>Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of Vaseline under my eye (top of cheekbone to just below the ends of my lower lashes) and above my eye (halfway up lid to my eyebrows).  </li>
            <li>Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of Vaseline under my eye (top of cheekbone to just below the ends of my lower lashes) and above my eye (halfway up lid to my eyebrows).  </li>
            <li>Smells a little funny and made my eyes sting a bit.</li>
            <li>I usually do just one eye at a time so that I have less going on and can be more focused on</li>
            <li>This is apparent because they only supply 12 lash leaves, not 24.</li>
            <li>I expect to get at least the full number of applications.n&#x27;t blot with anything, just gather your materials and wait for your eyelashes and eyes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>I expect to get at least the full number of applications.</li>
            <li>but as in the other reviews as they say it does work but dont expect that your eyelashes are gonna be super dark.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several months, and mostly use it for eyebrows due to the fact (the one negative I have found) that the applications are a bit runny.</li>
            <li>I wish the kit BLACK would not have too much brow dye tint.</li>
            <li>I did not give 5 stars, just because does not matter how long you fold a color on eyelashes, in 4, maximum 5 days it is washing out and getting back to natural color.</li>
            <li>You end up with black stain all around the skin on your upper and lower lashes that doesn&#x27;t come off for days, almost a week, really.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, I feel the customer should have more advice for protecting his/her skin from unwanted dying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Pleased Customer</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> so I kinda threw caution to the wind and got some of it in my eye, but if you&#x27;ve worn contacts before or gotten something stuck on your eye you&#x27;ve probably dealt with a lot more pain than that.</li>
            <li> -so I just bought an eyelash brush which worked a lot better.  </li>
            <li> So satisfying.</li>
            <li> Maybe if another person did the application it would work better but trying to do it yourself is joke.  </li>
            <li> Cheap product, bed result!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation from the product, but I also tend to keep it mostly on the ends of my lashes since that&#x27;s where I need darkening the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, applying some jojoba oil or eye cream to the skin underneath the lash leaves helps them stay on the skin well and protect you better.</li>
            <li> you can probably get more uses out of this.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use it on my eyebrows, and it is okay</li>
            <li> Get the slightly better ones, as they have more bristles.  </li>
            <li> This works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> That said, this is a quick, cost effective alternative to having your lashes tinted in a salon.</li>
            <li> Also the application process is easy, just be sure to style and trim your brows before you put on your dye.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the price is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, safe and very effective and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Per some other comments, I thinks that works best</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts longer than anything else.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow both written and pictorially.</li>
            <li> But easy to use kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is so easy</li>
            <li> Very simple to apply and the color has held beautifully.</li>
            <li> and it was nice at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and fast and I love it!</li>
            <li> but now they seem light brown again.</li>
            <li> but it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that the dye would help to bring out the light tips of my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> but well worth the effort!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product worth buying!</li>
            <li> The comb that you use to apply the dye isn&#x27;t user friendly either.</li>
            <li> After writing a review, the seller quickly responded with an apology and today at my doorstep was a FREE kit of the Swiss O-Par and attached</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t pop quite as much as a good professional dye job, but it&#x27;s a hassle to find the right aesthetician who will understand what I&#x27;m trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li> I am particularly delighted with the short processing time.</li>
            <li> I love when products don&#x27;t talk themselves up to what they really are.</li>
            <li> However, it appears based on the bottles of product that there is probably enough product for more than 12 (6x2) applications, so if you can purchase more lash leaves separately</li>
            <li> I was using dye lash which is cheaper and also works but not as quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly too</li>
            <li> I have dark brunette hair, but the ends of my eyelashes are colorless, so this product is great to darken ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did one eye at a time, first the bottom lashes, then the top, so I repeated the whole process four times.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL deal and so is their service!!</li>
            <li> , it was VERY brown on her naturally light lashes.</li>
            <li> Better yet, have it done professionally.</li>
            <li> Just have to tint more frequently.</li>
            <li> Between the oil and the tint, I now rarely wear mascara (but I still curl my eyelashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color will appear right away.  </li>
            <li> When you want it right than do it professionally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used eyelash/brow dye Tint color for decades and I love it because it is simple fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> sure your lashes are clean and dry before you</li>
            <li> I get better results using a few drops of cheap hair colour and a clean mascara wand.</li>
            <li> do not stay long but very easy to apply</li>
            <li> I also noted that it lasts for about 6 weeks as stated in the beginning, but as the product gets older, you need to apply it more frequently.</li>
            <li> To top it off, some product splattered on my white porcelain tub and made permanent stains.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> So, first realize that this is NOT going to make you look like you are wearing mascara.  </li>
            <li> rush the application and take your time to apply the step one gel first to all the lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used an at-home tinting kit.</li>
            <li> However, overall I&#x27;m glad I bought the product.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly how</li>
            <li> The first time was terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so mascara will still look better and will still be necessary for a &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Got some funny metallic component.  </li>
            <li> I first started using this when I lived in Prague,</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 3 star is that what color I did get on was better than none at all.</li>
            <li> I used regular clean cotton swabs to apply the liquid, then applied the gel with a clean mascara spoolie instead of the comb that came with the kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While there are other tinting kits out there that are stronger thus the tint lasts longer, this formula is far better for sensitive skin and eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged one star because I think they should include more under-eye protection papers with the kit!</li>
            <li> It will fade from your skin in a couple days on its own, or you can try the removal tips in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on how you wash your face and how quickly your new lashes grow.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re pretty much invisible if I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> The first applications went really well</li>
            <li> A quick, not messy way to cut out a salon service.</li>
            <li> Certainly as promised.</li>
            <li> like especially how fast and easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> For those thinking of this for the first time, I highly recommend it (after shaping your brows with wax or whatever).</li>
            <li> *really* stung.  </li>
            <li> Does not work very well, would not recommend it</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> If you do the whole operation is finished, it takes awhile to rinse it out and get over the pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do and was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else with light eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and I would buy from this seller again but not this product.</li>
            <li> I finish by washing my eyebrows with a gentle sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> : Do this when you&#x27;re not tired, are feeling focused, and don&#x27;t have anything distracting going on.</li>
            <li> Really did not seem to work.  </li>
            <li> Thinking my lashes are to sparse to really notice the effect.</li>
            <li> I cant really blame your product.</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and blonde hair, but it turned out really nice.</li>
            <li> If you dab a little eye cream on the skin around your eyes before starting and keep a clean damp cotton swab handy for wiping off goofs, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry too much about rogue stains.</li>
            <li> I find I use less mascara after tinting because my very light colored lashes have color to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I truly love the simplicity and fast and lasting coloring it provides, so I will definitely continue using ...</li>
            <li> Because that is when you have lost enough eyelashes (on your natural eyelash growth cycle) that your new, natural eyelashes become more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Tint</li>
            <li> I get black lashes in 2 minutes and don&#x27;t have to wear mascara :)</li>
            <li> Use my first tiny brush, dipped in the bottle of solution 1, to THOROUGHLY brush through and wet all my lashes, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> Use my first tiny brush, dipped in the bottle of solution 1, to THOROUGHLY brush through and wet all my lashes, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> Not noticeable enough to be worth the time, energy and money of application.</li>
            <li> Wash my eyelids with SOAP (normal hand soap) to remove all skin oils and moisturizer from around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle I received spilled over, only due to the nature of the product &amp; how it may leak, I wasn&#x27;t at first pleased with the initial bottle!  </li>
            <li> would give it 5 stars but wish it was a little darker black, other than that the products is wonderful.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful though because you can easily color your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> ordered some inexpensive, disposable mascara brushes to apply this which works much better - especially when trying to get those tiny lashes on the inner and outer corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> It only took about ten minutes for the entire process. :)</li>
            <li> Apparently mine are darker than I thought because this didn&#x27;t seem to change them much.  </li>
            <li> It looks the same as when the salon mixes a color to match my hair exactly.</li>
            <li> I did get a little bit of the gel in one eye and it stung like a beast for maybe fifteen seconds, but I blinked it out easily and the redness went away about a minute after the stinging stopped.</li>
            <li> You can always apply a little at a time, and more later to fill in any spot you may miss.  </li>
            <li> It WILL make nearly invisible lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for professional lash tinting before and my at-home results with this product are comparable.</li>
            <li> bought my stuff at a professional and than you do it home.</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions and in less time than it takes to apply mascara you will have nice black lashes.  </li>
            <li> I left it on 1 minute the first time then 3 minutes the next time,  and my eye brows came out darker</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who is capable of dying/or not a professional.  </li>
            <li> Not thick enough so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much product so it should last for several application.  </li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that the pads that are supposed to stay under your eyes (to protect your skin) don&#x27;t stay on, which means that your skin will get stained and it is hard to be precise with these paper pads sticking up and moving around every time you blink.  </li>
            <li> my eyebrows and lashes are almost white and this helps me look as young as I still feel, while not making me look like I&#x27;m trying!&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> After having gotten my eyes nearly burnt out when I got my lashes tinted at a local salon-</li>
            <li> The results are not as if you go to a professional, but I do see a bit of tint, especially at the lash line and it does give my eyes a bit of a pop.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything but barely darken the tips.</li>
            <li> products in a manner similar to hair dye (DON&#x27;T USE HAIR DYE NEAR YOUR EYES) in that you are permanently changing the color of the eyelash hairs.  </li>
            <li> Well, it looked awfully strange to have such light eyebrows and lashes with such dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of Vaseline under my eye (top of cheekbone to just below the ends of my lower lashes) and above my eye (halfway up lid to my eyebrows).  </li>
            <li> Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of Vaseline under my eye (top of cheekbone to just below the ends of my lower lashes) and above my eye (halfway up lid to my eyebrows).  </li>
            <li> Smells a little funny and made my eyes sting a bit.</li>
            <li> I usually do just one eye at a time so that I have less going on and can be more focused on</li>
            <li> This is apparent because they only supply 12 lash leaves, not 24.</li>
            <li> I expect to get at least the full number of applications.n&#x27;t blot with anything, just gather your materials and wait for your eyelashes and eyes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> I expect to get at least the full number of applications.</li>
            <li> but as in the other reviews as they say it does work but dont expect that your eyelashes are gonna be super dark.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several months, and mostly use it for eyebrows due to the fact (the one negative I have found) that the applications are a bit runny.</li>
            <li> I wish the kit BLACK would not have too much brow dye tint.</li>
            <li> I did not give 5 stars, just because does not matter how long you fold a color on eyelashes, in 4, maximum 5 days it is washing out and getting back to natural color.</li>
            <li> You end up with black stain all around the skin on your upper and lower lashes that doesn&#x27;t come off for days, almost a week, really.</li>
            <li> I have not used the applicator comb given, preferring to use a cleaned and sanitized mascara brush instead due to the fact it holds the product better than the comb as it is so thin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this periodically over several months now to dye my eyebrows back to their natural black color.</li>
            <li> aware that when they say \\&quot;12 Applications\\&quot;, they really mean 6 total applications, x2 for each eye.</li>
            <li> Well use , as long as possible .</li>
            <li> , it seems, so this will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> When I am super careful and am conscious of every move I&#x27;m making, I don&#x27;t have any problems, but if I make one wrong move I sometimes get a smudge.</li>
            <li> As my  hair isn&#x27;t going grey, at my age (58)</li>
            <li> I learned from my mistake and used Vaseline along the lash long.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t get the dye on your skin you don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the fact that it does not last as long as it states.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I woke with two big black blotches over my eyes that took days to wear off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is white too due to skin problem since I have been 12.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, if you have short lashes, this will give you short, dark lashes!  </li>
            <li> The application of liquid and gel was difficult and messy, and I wasn&#x27;t able to color just my lashes without also getting some on my skin.  </li>
            <li> but, you would expect the box to be a little bigger for 12 applications</li>
            <li> I have pale blonde eyelashes and have tried various dyes that never quite took them to black.  </li>
            <li> Then, carefully apply the tint.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> scanned through the instructions without reading carefully and did not wash my eyebrows immediately afterward.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> Minimal darkening.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use two of those tiny round brushes that are meant to replace dental floss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the other lash dying product that I tried, &amp;#34;Hard Candy,&amp;#34; which I also bought through Amazon -</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, dyeing your lashes will not, cannot thicken or lengthen them like mascara does.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Use a dye that comes in capsules that you blend with the peroxide and apply, together, but be very careful and follow directions and DON&#x27;T get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> I mean just a dab the size of a dot you can barely see.  </li>
            <li> I have dark lashes anyway</li>
            <li> Makes lashes dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to about every 3-4 weeks, but as I said, I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now.</li>
            <li> also, as suggested by other users, using a magnifying mirror to apply it helps a bunch!  </li>
            <li> It was also hard to brush the gel through my lower lashes using the little comb because those lashes are so short.  </li>
            <li> Have been using both black and brown for years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the black shade.</li>
            <li> I was still done in less than fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> I ordered black and received brown but was immediately sent the correct color with return postage.</li>
            <li> but once I rinsed them off with just water alone and woke up the next day they were still late again don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I bought it in black, which I thought would be too dark for me since I&#x27;m really pale</li>
            <li> I could see a little bit of my eyelashes turning black</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair and use black.</li>
            <li> This order replaced my previous one that finally dried up after almost a year.</li>
            <li> applied gel with those little gum cleaner brushes as another user recommended</li>
            <li> The little paper skinguards won&#x27;t stay in place.  </li>
            <li> have found that I don&#x27;t like the little paper guards that protect the skin.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t care for cotton swabs (which leave fuzzies everywhere) or the little comb that is included.  </li>
            <li> so maybe if I give it another application in a few days</li>
            <li> This stuff made them jet black and lasts forever!  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to use on the eyelashes and messy for the brows</li>
            <li> Also very messy to use.</li>
            <li> this stuff is crap I left to go on forever and a day it only lasted a couple hours didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> It was a bit hard to use</li>
            <li> I have used other eyelash color before, and i had read in other reviews that this product did not irritate your eyes, they were wrong!</li>
            <li> Now, wait at least sixty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Now, wait at least sixty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Then apply just a (very small) dab of the gel via toothpick....</li>
            <li> Using all the aids they suggest, you will still get dye all around your eyes, and it is impossible to get off quickly enough.</li>
            <li> (they went from brown to black) and it wasn&#x27;t terribly complicated to use, but it IS a little scary that it&#x27;s permanent on skin.</li>
            <li> Worse product I ever tried.</li>
            <li> If you get sloppy with step one and get any on your skin, if the gel tint touches it, you will have stains on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will darken them but not in a dramatic way.</li>
            <li> It does work, just know it wont be dramatic.</li>
            <li> Very hard to apply with glasses on!</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply by yourself.  </li>
            <li> After considering if I would go blind or not, tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to work, but lashes are very thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve used eyelash tints before, I knew the weird little comb thingy that comes with the kit is awkward and basically worthless if you don&#x27;t want to get the tint all over your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you want longer, stronger eyelashes, apply a thin layer of castor oil to the base of your eyelashes every night before sleeping.  </li>
            <li> So potentially bad for your eyes</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get to the lower lashes in the outer corner because of the bad comb design.</li>
            <li> Apply lotion so that your skin doesn&#x27;t hate you for stripping away all its oils and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply lotion so that your skin doesn&#x27;t hate you for stripping away all its oils and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible time getting it on my lower lashes using the protective strip.</li>

            <li> I did not have good luck with this product.  The biggest problem is that the pads that are supposed to stay under your eyes (to protect your skin) don&#x27;t stay on, which means that your skin will get stained and it is hard to be precise with these paper pads sticking up and moving around every time you blink.  The application of liquid and gel was difficult and messy, and I wasn&#x27;t able to color just my lashes without also getting some on my skin.  It was also hard to brush the gel through my lower lashes using the little comb because those lashes are so short.  Finally, I some got in my eyes and it *really* stung.  To top it off, some product splattered on my white porcelain tub and made permanent stains.  I&#x27;ll stick with the other lash dying product that I tried, &amp;#34;Hard Candy,&amp;#34; which I also bought through Amazon - it works more like transitional mascara and lasts 4 days.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says. I have used it for several months, and mostly use it for eyebrows due to the fact (the one negative I have found) that the applications are a bit runny. I have not used the applicator comb given, preferring to use a cleaned and sanitized mascara brush instead due to the fact it holds the product better than the comb as it is so thin. I also noted that it lasts for about 6 weeks as stated in the beginning, but as the product gets older, you need to apply it more frequently. I&#x27;m down to about every 3-4 weeks, but as I said, I&#x27;ve had it for awhile now. I like how it works immediately, and doesn&#x27;t look &#x60;painted&#x27; on like eyebrow pencils. As my  hair isn&#x27;t going grey, at my age (58) my eyebrows and lashes are almost white and this helps me look as young as I still feel, while not making me look like I&#x27;m trying!&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> Does not work very well, would not recommend it</li>
            <li> Exellent product!  Easy to use and lasts longer than anything else.  I have white eye lashes on one eye and part of my left brow is white too due to skin problem since I have been 12.  Swiss O Par takes care of my problem immediately.  Also, I am allergic to a lot of tints, and Swiss O Par does not cause any redness to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had no irritation, no problems. It works pretty well. You will need another application after... I&#x27;d say a couple weeks. I guess it depends on how you wash your face and how quickly your new lashes grow. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. The only down side is the fact that it does not last as long as it states.  I will use again because of the results.  Best for eyebrows.  Eyelashes are more difficult to tint, however with practice you can make it work.</li>
            <li> do not stay long but very easy to apply</li>
            <li> But I think I will love it after repeated applications. applied gel with those little gum cleaner brushes as another user recommended and I felt like I achieved a more precise application that way the comb thing kind of scared me that close to my eye.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Period!!!!</li>
            <li> All I need , with your product , is all I use for make up . Most of the time ! Well use , as long as possible .</li>
            <li> Use this on my lashes, and the brown on my brows.  Easy to use, safe and very effective and natural looking. Have been using both black and brown for years.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Have tried others that were ok, but thought I&#x27;d give Swiss O-Par a shot.  It works really well.  Very simple to apply and the color has held beautifully.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this kit to dye lashes. Using all the aids they suggest, you will still get dye all around your eyes, and it is impossible to get off quickly enough. You end up with black stain all around the skin on your upper and lower lashes that doesn&#x27;t come off for days, almost a week, really. Use a dye that comes in capsules that you blend with the peroxide and apply, together, but be very careful and follow directions and DON&#x27;T get it in your eye. If you do the whole operation is finished, it takes awhile to rinse it out and get over the pain. Better yet, have it done professionally.</li>
            <li> I tinted my lashes about two weeks ago and it already needs to be done again. I have dark lashes anyway and it was nice at first but now they seem light brown again. I tinted my friends lashes too and she has red hair, it was VERY brown on her naturally light lashes. I ordered the black shade. It&#x27;ll do and was a reasonable price. Just have to tint more frequently.</li>
            <li> After having gotten my eyes nearly burnt out when I got my lashes tinted at a local salon- I was a bit concerned about this product but it is fantastic.  Just follow the directions and in less time than it takes to apply mascara you will have nice black lashes.  Keep in mind- it does not look like thick/plush mascara after it has been applied but rather just gives them color.  The product is wonderful for gals like me who have very light lashes.  I would HIGHLY recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> So, first realize that this is NOT going to make you look like you are wearing mascara.  It WILL make nearly invisible lashes darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;ve used eyelash tints before, I knew the weird little comb thingy that comes with the kit is awkward and basically worthless if you don&#x27;t want to get the tint all over your skin!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some inexpensive, disposable mascara brushes to apply this which works much better - especially when trying to get those tiny lashes on the inner and outer corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your lashes are clean and dry before you start!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suggest doing both eyes at once!  One eye at a time works best  and, if you have longer hair, put a head band on to keep from getting this stuff in your bangs and hair that may fall forward when you do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t rush the application and take your time to apply the step one gel first to all the lashes.  I do 2 coats.  Then, carefully apply the tint.  The color will appear right away.  If you get sloppy with step one and get any on your skin, if the gel tint touches it, you will have stains on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much product so it should last for several application.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the color lasts about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you have short lashes, this will give you short, dark lashes!  It&#x27;s great to have some color when you go without make up.  I find I use less mascara after tinting because my very light colored lashes have color to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are other tinting kits out there that are stronger thus the tint lasts longer, this formula is far better for sensitive skin and eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged one star because I think they should include more under-eye protection papers with the kit!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used an at-home tinting kit. The instructions are easy to follow both written and pictorially. However, I feel the customer should have more advice for protecting his/her skin from unwanted dying. I learned from my mistake and used Vaseline along the lash long. Results were satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Linda, the seller of this product, did a fabulous time at making her customer was happy! The first bottle I received spilled over, only due to the nature of the product &amp; how it may leak, I wasn&#x27;t at first pleased with the initial bottle!  After writing a review, the seller quickly responded with an apology and today at my doorstep was a FREE kit of the Swiss O-Par and attached was the kindest letter apologizing for the manufac. problems!  I am so happy and pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is capable of dying/or not a professional.  This is the REAL deal and so is their service!! Linda, you have made me day!!! Thank you times a million&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-One Pleased Customer :)  So happpppppyyyyyy</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde eyelashes (A bit lighter than my eyebrows) so they&#x27;re pretty much invisible if I&#x27;m not wearing mascara. They look great now! It was a lot easier to apply than I thought and I got it on my eyelids, but it didn&#x27;t stain them. The first applications went really well so I kinda threw caution to the wind and got some of it in my eye, but if you&#x27;ve worn contacts before or gotten something stuck on your eye you&#x27;ve probably dealt with a lot more pain than that. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else with light eyelashes. I bought it in black, which I thought would be too dark for me since I&#x27;m really pale an I have blue eyes and blonde hair, but it turned out really nice. So I&#x27;m happy with that decision. I&#x27;m not wearing any mascara or makeup in the picture, and I did two applications on each eye. It only took about ten minutes for the entire process. :)</li>
            <li> Did not like this.  The tint did not work at all on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;home use&amp;#34; product!  The applicator is a fancy looking q-tip-so I just bought an eyelash brush which worked a lot better.  I had to apply two applications, and the vapors stung my eyes for a couple seconds.  However, overall I&#x27;m glad I bought the product.  I noticed a difference after the second application.</li>
            <li> would give it 5 stars but wish it was a little darker black, other than that the products is wonderful. last about 2 1/2 months. will buy again...</li>
            <li> I think this could work great for somebody that has extremely light lashes.  Apparently mine are darker than I thought because this didn&#x27;t seem to change them much.  I was hoping that the dye would help to bring out the light tips of my eyelashes but it didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, dyeing your lashes will not, cannot thicken or lengthen them like mascara does. All it can do is darken what you&#x27;ve already got. That said, this is a quick, cost effective alternative to having your lashes tinted in a salon. I&#x27;ve paid for professional lash tinting before and my at-home results with this product are comparable. I have been using Latisse for about two months and while my lashes are noticeably longer, they are too blonde to show up without makeup. This product helps a lot. I used regular clean cotton swabs to apply the liquid, then applied the gel with a clean mascara spoolie instead of the comb that came with the kit. Personal preference. I started out with the shield papers under my eyes, but I ended up throwing them away and proceeding without them. If you dab a little eye cream on the skin around your eyes before starting and keep a clean damp cotton swab handy for wiping off goofs, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry too much about rogue stains. I did get a little bit of the gel in one eye and it stung like a beast for maybe fifteen seconds, but I blinked it out easily and the redness went away about a minute after the stinging stopped. It didn&#x27;t prevent me from finishing the job or affect my results, so I still think this deserves five stars. I am particularly delighted with the short processing time. I did one eye at a time, first the bottom lashes, then the top, so I repeated the whole process four times. I was still done in less than fifteen minutes. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Since I bought it again it must have worked, and it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like especially how fast and easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> I love when products don&#x27;t talk themselves up to what they really are. This is exactly how and what it says about it and more! So satisfying. It&#x27;s easy and fast and I love it! I get black lashes in 2 minutes and don&#x27;t have to wear mascara :)</li>
            <li> Really great product but, you would expect the box to be a little bigger for 12 applications it&#x27;s really tiny.</li>
            <li> The little paper skinguards won&#x27;t stay in place.  Maybe if another person did the application it would work better but trying to do it yourself is joke.  Also very messy to use. I tried several times and never saw a difference in my lashes or brows.  Delivery was fast and I would buy from this seller again but not this product.</li>
            <li> Quick easy lasts, try it for yourself, I have very fair lashes, so it helps me, as I do not care for mascara.</li>
            <li> It came in 2 weeks before the date stated. It does seem to work, but lashes are very thin so maybe if I give it another application in a few days</li>
            <li> Worse product I ever tried. It Causes irritation with no result on hair. The spot on a skin was colored extremely good thought !!!! Won&#x27;t  buy it again. Cheap product, bed result!</li>
            <li> I have been using this periodically over several months now to dye my eyebrows back to their natural black color. The first time was terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scanned through the instructions without reading carefully and did not wash my eyebrows immediately afterward. I looked great all  day then put on my sleep mask to go to bed. The next morning I woke with two big black blotches over my eyes that took days to wear off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I finish by washing my eyebrows with a gentle sulfate-free shampoo. The whole procedure only takes a few minutes and lasts for weeks. I use the disposable eyelash mascara brush to apply the gel. Per some other comments, I thinks that works best</li>
            <li> This works pretty good.  I have blonde hair, eyelashes and eyebrows but recently decided to dye my hair brown.  Well, it looked awfully strange to have such light eyebrows and lashes with such dark hair.  I&#x27;ve been using eye pencil and mascara, but there are just some days I didn&#x27;t want to take the time to put make up on.  So I ordered this.  It does work, but remember, It only darkens your lashes, it does not make them longer so mascara will still look better and will still be necessary for a &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; look.  I wish it had lasted several weeks.  It seemed to only last about a week.</li>
            <li> This lash tint kit did work to tint my eyelashes (they went from brown to black) and it wasn&#x27;t terribly complicated to use, but it IS a little scary that it&#x27;s permanent on skin. Be careful! When I am super careful and am conscious of every move I&#x27;m making, I don&#x27;t have any problems, but if I make one wrong move I sometimes get a smudge. I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation from the product, but I also tend to keep it mostly on the ends of my lashes since that&#x27;s where I need darkening the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Do this when you&#x27;re not tired, are feeling focused, and don&#x27;t have anything distracting going on. Also, applying some jojoba oil or eye cream to the skin underneath the lash leaves helps them stay on the skin well and protect you better. I usually do just one eye at a time so that I have less going on and can be more focused on each eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that when they say \\&quot;12 Applications\\&quot;, they really mean 6 total applications, x2 for each eye. This is apparent because they only supply 12 lash leaves, not 24. However, it appears based on the bottles of product that there is probably enough product for more than 12 (6x2) applications, so if you can purchase more lash leaves separately you can probably get more uses out of this.</li>
            <li> When you want it right than do it professionally.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my stuff at a professional and than you do it home.</li>
            <li> I have used this multiple times to get used to the application.  I gave up using it on my lashes because it just does not make that big of a difference.  I have continued to use it on my eyebrows, and it is okay but I would not spend the money on it next time.  I get better results using a few drops of cheap hair colour and a clean mascara wand.</li>
            <li> I wish the kit BLACK would not have too much brow dye tint.</li>
            <li> I did not give 5 stars, just because does not matter how long you fold a color on eyelashes, in 4, maximum 5 days it is washing out and getting back to natural color. But easy to use kit.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply by yourself.  The results are not as if you go to a professional, but I do see a bit of tint, especially at the lash line and it does give my eyes a bit of a pop.</li>
            <li> This stuff works but as in the other reviews as they say it does work but dont expect that your eyelashes are gonna be super dark. It will darken them but not in a dramatic way. Plus it will help out if you put some vasoline on bottem below bottem eye lashes so the skin protecting paper sticks and doesn&#x27;t slide around and the tint doesnt stain your skin. It does work, just know it wont be dramatic.</li>
            <li> I have never used this type of product before. This one works well. I had a terrible time getting it on my lower lashes using the protective strip. As long as you don&#x27;t get the dye on your skin you don&#x27;t need it. I ordered black and received brown but was immediately sent the correct color with return postage. Very happy with the customer service.</li>
            <li> Got some funny metallic component.  I don&#x27;t trust it. After considering if I would go blind or not, tried it anyway.  Followed instructions carefully.  Really did not seem to work.  So potentially bad for your eyes AND doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have pale blonde eyelashes and have tried various dyes that never quite took them to black.  This stuff made them jet black and lasts forever!  It was a bit hard to use but well worth the effort!  I don&#x27;t have to use mascara at all now.  Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Received the product that was open .. Cotton pads were all in color, package was damaged also, all the bottles were not sealed. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice and it didn&#x27;t work--save your money</li>
            <li> I have used other eyelash color before, and i had read in other reviews that this product did not irritate your eyes, they were wrong! I couldn&#x27;t even stand it when I held it up to my nose, let alone my eye!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Makes lashes dark. Lasts! I was using dye lash which is cheaper and also works but not as quickly. It was a splurge but I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Arrived quickly too</li>
            <li> finally i can see my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> My wife says that the kit is as good as the professionals use and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Minimal darkening. Thinking my lashes are to sparse to really notice the effect. Not thick enough so I cant really blame your product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and after reading some of the reviews on how to apply the product, I have this suggestion : Use a q-tip to apply the liquid primer, let it set for a good minute.  Then apply just a (very small) dab of the gel via toothpick....I mean just a dab the size of a dot you can barely see.  also, as suggested by other users, using a magnifying mirror to apply it helps a bunch!  I also use the same approach on the eyelashes....lots of primer, and &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; a 1/4 inch of gel on the tip of the toothpick and stroke it on like it&#x27;s a mascara brush.You can always apply a little at a time, and more later to fill in any spot you may miss.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I first started using this when I lived in Prague, Czech Republic to dye my graying eyebrows.  I refuse to dye my hair but eyebrows are different and this works just great.  You do have to be careful though because you can easily color your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I have used eyelash/brow dye Tint color for decades and I love it because it is simple fast and easy to use. I never used this brand but I truly love the simplicity and fast and lasting coloring it provides, so I will definitely continue using ...</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I left it on 1 minute the first time then 3 minutes the next time,  and my eye brows came out darker, it&#x27;s wonderful and now I have beautiful dark brows (my eyes are noticeable).  Also the application process is easy, just be sure to style and trim your brows before you put on your dye.  Yes I would recommend this product if you want eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is so easy even a make up adverse person can do it!</li>
            <li> Certainly as promised. You can Play with different applicators to find what works for you.</li>
            <li> very easy to use. covers well. intensity of color fades within week, but very easy to reapply</li>
            <li> Did not do anything but barely darken the tips. Lasted maybe a week. Not noticeable enough to be worth the time, energy and money of application.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the price is outstanding.  The color doesn&#x27;t pop quite as much as a good professional dye job, but it&#x27;s a hassle to find the right aesthetician who will understand what I&#x27;m trying to achieve.  Sometimes, it&#x27;s just easier to do it yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m saving $400 a year and I don&#x27;t even have to leave my house.  It&#x27;s a product worth buying!</li>
            <li> This order replaced my previous one that finally dried up after almost a year. (I believe the directions say to pitch it before that). A quick, not messy way to cut out a salon service. (Does stain any surface it touches). For those thinking of this for the first time, I highly recommend it (after shaping your brows with wax or whatever). While you may look a tiny bit like Groucho Marx for an hour or so, if you use it at night, you&#x27;ll look terrific in the morning. It&#x27;s surprising how darker brows accent your eyes. I have very dark brown hair and use black. It looks the same as when the salon mixes a color to match my hair exactly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  Good Seller/Fast Shipper!  Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> Smells a little funny and made my eyes sting a bit. Just not fore me, so I gave it 2 my sister.</li>
            <li> this very easy to use and work great i even did the edge of my hair line on my gray  it covered the gray in my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have to have glasses for anything up close including applying this! Very hard to apply with glasses on! So, it didn&#x27;t work out too well for me. My husband attempted to apply it for me and even with the skin protector paper under my eye, he still got it on my skin! It stained the skin better than the lashes! The comb that you use to apply the dye isn&#x27;t user friendly either. I couldn&#x27;t get to the lower lashes in the outer corner because of the bad comb design. The only reason I gave it a 3 star is that what color I did get on was better than none at all.</li>
            <li> I found it hard to use on the eyelashes and messy for the brows</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and easy to use.  I only have to re-tint my eyelashes every six weeks, it seems, so this will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those unfamiliar with eyelash tinting, here&#x27;s how it works:&lt;br /&gt;You are dying your eyelashes the color of the &amp;#34;tint.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Tint products in a manner similar to hair dye (DON&#x27;T USE HAIR DYE NEAR YOUR EYES) in that you are permanently changing the color of the eyelash hairs.  Why does it only last around a month?  Because that is when you have lost enough eyelashes (on your natural eyelash growth cycle) that your new, natural eyelashes become more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Tint products do not thicken your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Tint products not make your eyelashes longer.&lt;br /&gt;Like hair dye, this can temporarily discolor your skin.  It will fade from your skin in a couple days on its own, or you can try the removal tips in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is ideal for blonds, redheads, and light brunettes who want darker lashes.  I have dark brunette hair, but the ends of my eyelashes are colorless, so this product is great to darken ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want longer, stronger eyelashes, apply a thin layer of castor oil to the base of your eyelashes every night before sleeping.  Between the oil and the tint, I now rarely wear mascara (but I still curl my eyelashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I don&#x27;t like the little paper guards that protect the skin.  They don&#x27;t stay in place well.  I also don&#x27;t care for cotton swabs (which leave fuzzies everywhere) or the little comb that is included.  I prefer to use two of those tiny round brushes that are meant to replace dental floss.  Get the slightly better ones, as they have more bristles.  (ETA 2015/08/10 - The dental brush idea was something I saw in another review ages ago.  I can&#x27;t remember who posted it, but they have my thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is this:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash my eyelids with SOAP (normal hand soap) to remove all skin oils and moisturizer from around my eyes.  Don&#x27;t blot with anything, just gather your materials and wait for your eyelashes and eyes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of Vaseline under my eye (top of cheekbone to just below the ends of my lower lashes) and above my eye (halfway up lid to my eyebrows).  Don&#x27;t get any on your eyelashes, or it will prevent them from being dyed.&lt;br /&gt;3) Use my first tiny brush, dipped in the bottle of solution 1, to THOROUGHLY brush through and wet all my lashes, top and bottom.  Make sure to get those corner lashes!  Now, wait at least sixty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;4) Squeeze the tiniest bead of gel from the tube of solution 2, then run the second brush across it.  Brush the gel THOROUGHLY through each part of each eyelash.  Wherever the two solutions touch, you will see color develop.  If you get a combination of the two solutions on your skin, it will stain.  The directions say you can wash it off now, but I wait sixty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;5) Blot your eye with a damp tissue, then wash your face with soap again.  Your eyelashes are dyed.  Apply lotion so that your skin doesn&#x27;t hate you for stripping away all its oils and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA 2015/08/10 - I have used this set five times or so, and there is no sign of it running low or drying out.  I expect to get at least the full number of applications.n&#x27;t blot with anything, just gather your materials and wait for your eyelashes and eyes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of Vaseline under my eye (top of cheekbone to just below the ends of my lower lashes) and above my eye (halfway up lid to my eyebrows).  Don&#x27;t get any on your eyelashes, or it will prevent them from being dyed.&lt;br /&gt;3) Use my first tiny brush, dipped in the bottle of solution 1, to THOROUGHLY brush through and wet all my lashes, top and bottom.

The directions say you can wash it off now, but I wait sixty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;5) Blot your eye with a damp tissue, then wash your face with soap again.  Your eyelashes are dyed.  Apply lotion so that your skin doesn&#x27;t hate you for stripping away all its oils and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA 2015/08/10 - I have used this set five times or so, and there is no sign of it running low or drying out.  I expect to get at least the full number of applications.</li>
            <li> this stuff is crap I left to go on forever and a day it only lasted a couple hours didn&#x27;t work..the longer I left it on of course I could see a little bit of my eyelashes turning black but once I rinsed them off with just water alone and woke up the next day they were still late again don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
