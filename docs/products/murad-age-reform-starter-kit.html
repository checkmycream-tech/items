            <li>The moisture this product delivers is great!  </li>
            <li>Perfect starter kit</li>
            <li>Suppose to be good for aging skin, well, if you like a ton of acne with your aging skin then this is for you!  </li>
            <li>However, I will say that they are great.  </li>

            <li>Good price and buy.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working good.  </li>
            <li>but it does have a good housekeeping certificate.  </li>
            <li>The products are awesome, I love the day cream the most.</li>
            <li>I love all these products!</li>
            <li>I have kind of combination skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be spending this kind of money on this product again.</li>
            <li>Nice looking kit in terms of size and presentation.</li>
            <li>Murad has a great line of products to keep skin fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many skin care lines but Murad is the best for me by far, I do not have many visible signs of aging yet</li>
            <li>Love Murad products and often do facials using them.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I keep re-purchasing this and love it.</li>
            <li>I tried this product, but I like the resurgence line much better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product</li>
            <li>I bought this not expecting it to work, like most things...</li>
            <li>Used this product for 3 months, just love it, but it becomes too costly buying every month, which is $40 a month.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my face look and feel.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product with an even better price tag when you buy it via Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I went through it very quickly</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my sister, and she liked it very much.</li>
            <li>The product I have purchased has been great and worked out as expected or better.  </li>
            <li>I honestly could see a difference pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>She is beautiful, but every little thing helps :)</li>
            <li>Discontinued using it when I was bright red in the morning.</li>
            <li>My mom has good skin (52yrs) and just wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>First time I used this product I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother trying this if  you have sensitive skin even though it is claimed to be ok for that.</li>
            <li>it with the Resurgence if you are older and have more mature skin.</li>
            <li>I am definitely buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought, needs better item description.</li>
            <li>You only olive once so you might as well enjoy it!</li>
            <li>The first week I thought my face felt smother, but no visible results.  </li>
            <li>Love Murad products but the items in this kit will last you maybe two weeks.</li>
            <li>So far it seems like this is a good product, but am not even half way through some of the items.</li>
            <li>Nothing is going to give anyone airbrushed model&#x27;s complexions but in the real world, the difference is visible and radiant.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any changes with this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a much cheaper name brand product that works wonders.  </li>
            <li>and it looks like they are starting to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>Her pores did get smaller and skin does look fairly smooth.  </li>
            <li>might buy this product again, but will highly consider an alternative product for that price.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product,  I wish the bottles were just a little bigger.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face so soft.</li>
            <li>Hey, I don&#x27;t look any younger but not any older either.</li>
            <li>I suggest a sunblock for extra protection depending where you live.</li>
            <li>I think the fact that he is a Dermatologist is a big plus, the products really seem to improve not only the overall appearance of the skin but the texture and clarity.</li>
            <li>Pricey but well worth spending the little extra to pamper yourself.  </li>
            <li>These products made such an immediate improvement that I bought the full size of the Glyco Friming Complex and will be buying the others once the tiral sizes run low.</li>

            <li> would buy again and recommend to other old people</li>
            <li> I alternate with other Murad products because I still occasionally break out as well.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t see fast results and feel the product its too small and didn&#x27;t really last 1 months even though she was being very careful of the amount she would apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> These products do not really appeal to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching over to and using the Murad products over the past few months, so the items in this kit aren&#x27;t new to me.  </li>
            <li> the picture online is a little deceiving.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it here because it&#x27;s a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Too heavy feeling for my skin.</li>
            <li> The product works, you need to give it a few weeks,  and I have received compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the Murad Skin Renewal system because I needed the small version of everything for travel.  </li>
            <li> They are very small.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> but, after telling my doctor of this, Murad was just giving me a bunch of crap!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product,  I wish the bottles were just a little bigger.  I went through it very quickly but I guess it is a tester. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Hey, I don&#x27;t look any younger but not any older either. I think&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and recommend to other old people</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my Esthetician. Too heavy feeling for my skin.</li>
            <li> Good price and buy. Love Murad products and often do facials using them.</li>
            <li> I love all these products! Perfect size for travelling!</li>
            <li> Like it. It makes your face so soft.</li>
            <li> Need a magnifying glass to read the instructions and that is with my glasses on.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for myself to try out some of the murad products.  I feel like the exfoliator in this package should have been a little bigger.  the picture online is a little deceiving.  The products are awesome, I love the day cream the most.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin care lines but Murad is the best for me by far, I do not have many visible signs of aging yet but these products are awesome for those wanting to be proactive before they begin to see problems. I alternate with other Murad products because I still occasionally break out as well. I think the fact that he is a Dermatologist is a big plus, the products really seem to improve not only the overall appearance of the skin but the texture and clarity. Again, I have tried multiple lines but always come back to Murad and I have not been disappointed. Nothing is going to give anyone airbrushed model&#x27;s complexions but in the real world, the difference is visible and radiant.</li>
            <li> The product works, you need to give it a few weeks,  and I have received compliments on my skin. I am definitely buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I keep re-purchasing this and love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Skin feels hydrated again!</li>
            <li> I have used the Murad products before, could not afford them until I saw it on Amazon.com. I like the moisture in this product, it stays with you. When you purchase these products from Murad you are required to purchase every month. I will purchase this product again on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The product I have purchased has been great and worked out as expected or better.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> So far it seems like this is a good product, but am not even half way through some of the items.</li>
            <li> Murad has a great line of products to keep skin fresh and healthy. I tried this product, but I like the resurgence line much better. However, I will order Murad again, maybe not this one but &amp;#34;Resurgence&amp;#34; definitely!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, needs better item description.</li>
            <li> I bought the Murad Skin Renewal system because I needed the small version of everything for travel.  I&#x27;ve been switching over to and using the Murad products over the past few months, so the items in this kit aren&#x27;t new to me.  However, I will say that they are great.  I have kind of combination skin and I&#x27;m approaching the big 4-0.  This line works great for helping regain some of that youthful appearance.  Overall a great product with an even better price tag when you buy it via Amazon!  I definitely reccommend it!</li>
            <li> Pricey but well worth spending the little extra to pamper yourself.  You only olive once so you might as well enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my sister&#x27;s 50th birthday.  She is beautiful, but every little thing helps :)</li>
            <li> First time I used this product I noticed a difference! I ordered it here because it&#x27;s a little cheaper. I really love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product, I am 61 and was a sun worshiper in my youth.  I really don&#x27;t see any changes with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using a much cheaper name brand product that works wonders.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be spending this kind of money on this product again.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working good.  I have some deep lines are my mouth and it looks like they are starting to smooth out.  I am also using the illumask and I believe it is helping.</li>
            <li> Used for about two weeks.  The first week I thought my face felt smother, but no visible results.  Then it started to burn my skin at night and morning.  Discontinued using it when I was bright red in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this not expecting it to work, like most things...but it does have a good housekeeping certificate.  I honestly could see a difference pretty quickly.  My skin looks smoother and healthier.  Noticeable difference after a week.</li>
            <li> Used this product for 3 months, just love it, but it becomes too costly buying every month, which is $40 a month.</li>
            <li> Love Murad products but the items in this kit will last you maybe two weeks. They are very small.</li>
            <li> I love this product and great price through amazon!</li>
            <li> These products do not really appeal to me.  The texture and smell of some of the lotions in this kit seemed off.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve read others say they received fakes but I don&#x27;t think I have. Non greasy,  wishnfull size wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li> Great size for trial and travel.  Cleans and hydrates my skin well.  I suggest a sunblock for extra protection depending where you live.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected since I had previously ordered the same</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister, and she liked it very much. Nice looking kit in terms of size and presentation.</li>
            <li> I like this product but this seems to be geared for a little younger skin.  I am guessing if you don&#x27;t have many&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles this would be the perfect product..  The moisture this product delivers is great!  But I would say&lt;br /&gt;use it with the Resurgence if you are older and have more mature skin.</li>
            <li> These products made such an immediate improvement that I bought the full size of the Glyco Friming Complex and will be buying the others once the tiral sizes run low.</li>
            <li> Suppose to be good for aging skin, well, if you like a ton of acne with your aging skin then this is for you!  Had to switch to another skin care line after using for 5 weeks with nothing but daily break-outs!  Was told just a purging period by Murad but, after telling my doctor of this, Murad was just giving me a bunch of crap!  Don&#x27;t bother trying this if  you have sensitive skin even though it is claimed to be ok for that.</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect starter kit</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face look and feel. Smells great. I have used several of the items from Murad. This is the only brand I use, day and night.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom.  My mom has good skin (52yrs) and just wanted to try something different. Her pores did get smaller and skin does look fairly smooth.  She didn&#x27;t see fast results and feel the product its too small and didn&#x27;t really last 1 months even though she was being very careful of the amount she would apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might buy this product again, but will highly consider an alternative product for that price.</li>
