    <ol>
            <li>and they were the BEST for adding color to hair.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest for the price.</li>
            <li>awesome stuff though.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a boost and had heard good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Great price on the shampoo I love.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>i love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>more and more color would come out!</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to get something you used to have to buy from a salon on line.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Aveda had more diversity of color</li>
            <li>I love the lather and this is so far the best smelling among the Aveda shampoos I have use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better product than Aveda, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>With the Tressa shampoo, I&#x27;m able to keep my auburn hair fresh and bright between colorings.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>A 33.8 oz bottle lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>use this and the matching conditioner most every day.</li>
            <li>I am glad to pay it though as I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The best red shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used are Artec, but Loreal bought the company and discontinued the colored shampoos (they&#x27;re available on ebay but are cost prohibitive).  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful but the color payoff isn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably fine for people with a dye job.</li>
            <li>The pigment in it does not seem to stick to any kind of material, really.</li>
            <li>After all, hair always looks refreshed, and the color looks more intense and interesting, after showering.</li>
            <li>and they are now bright red...</li>
            <li>This has a fruity, sweet sent.</li>
            <li>and after one use it looks way more vibrant.</li>
            <li>They work great together to keep my red hair vibrant and not muddy.</li>
            <li>Brightens up warm red hair color.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a substitute for the wonderful L&#x27;Oreal Marigold shampoo and conditioner, alas no longer made.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair clean and this one also tones down the gray with a reddish sheen that blends with my own color.</li>
            <li>As far as its cleaning function, the shampoo is fine.</li>
            <li>I think the color is great but hard to get through my hair evenly</li>
            <li>I could not keep it from fading so fast until I found this conditioner!</li>
            <li>Tressa is sulfate free and leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it keeps the red in my hair longer.</li>
            <li>i think it might be able to stain white clothes, towels ect.</li>
            <li>I like it enough to order more.  </li>
            <li>However, for the first time in my life, I&#x27;m having what I think is an allergic reaction on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Using these on a regular weekly schedule has helped my red hair to keep its bright color and shine as well as prolong the time I need between visits to the salon.</li>
            <li>This madder root shampoo doesn&#x27;t really do what the Artec shampoos did</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Tangles really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle to my hair and leaves it looking fresh and alive.  </li>
            <li>first off i am a vegan so this company is a favorite of mine since they only use plant materials and i have red hair.</li>
            <li>Sadly, L&#x27;Oreal has seen fit to discontinue this amazing product</li>
            <li>which if you have red hair you know that it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I have never colored my hair before, but now that I&#x27;m 46 my formerly vibrant copper-red hair is fading.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, dry hair and this shampoo left it smooth, soft, smelling nice, and redder than before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the shampoo, but not the conditioner.</li>
            <li>In the salon the price is a bit high.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight cherry fragrance, produces a low-average amount of lather, rinses off easily, does not seem to be too drying, and does not seem to irritate too much.</li>
            <li>Consequently, red color treated hair needs a supplement to keep the color fresh.  </li>
            <li>but you do have to leave it in longer than normally.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the color is not natural looking, but rather a bright pinkish-red!</li>
            <li>It certainly does not stick to brown or white hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need anywhere near as much of this shampoo as I need of regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>and I find myself adrift without a replacement for the shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for nearly EIGHT years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice that this shampoo added any red tones to my auburn hair.  </li>
            <li>Leave the shampoo on for at least 10 minutes or shampoo twice for more intensity.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I have a suspicion that the people who see it &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; their natural color may be perceiving an illusory correlation.</li>
            <li>Red is the most difficult color to keep in the hair because the red color molecules are huge and therefore don&#x27;t completely penetrate the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the subtle reds help hid my unsightly roots.  </li>
            <li>My biggest complaint about red dye is it fades so fast, making it necessary to return to the salon sooner than I&#x27;d like (and costing me more than I&#x27;d like).  </li>
            <li>My hair has a natural red tone to it and this shampoo helps blend the highlights with my natural color.  </li>
            <li>The description suggests that it should work for people with red or auburn hair, and I want to be clear that I have not tried it on naturally red or auburn hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural blonde highlights in the front, especially when I&#x27;ve been in the sun...</li>
            <li>So...it does work, and only with one washing/conditioning, but don&#x27;t use it if you want to revive your natural red hair.</li>
            <li>I have dyed my hair red for my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed tiny, itchy red bumps all along my neck and face at my hairline.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair feeling clean other than gunky like several other shampoos.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;Length: Long.</li>
            <li> I did find that the shampoo does leave it feeling a bit dry, but I can counter-act the dryness if I use a half and half mix of this product with my normal one.</li>
            <li> It did not dye my scalp or dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair extremely dry and lightens it to a dried out fried looking blonde color.</li>
            <li> i would be careful</li>
            <li> I spent the money.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a huge bottle of the (expensive) shampoo that I can&#x27;t even use!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers reported it being streaky and dying things pink.</li>
            <li> The conditioner on the other hand does dye things pink and is a bit streaky.</li>
            <li> My review is limited by the way in which I have been using the shampoo, but it is hard for me to imagine this product actually working.</li>
            <li> It lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will have to discontinue use of this shampoo and conditioner and go back to my old type.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping Aveda had the solution to my problem, but sadly, they do not.</li>
            <li> :  Soft thin hair strands and lots of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair hangs all the way down my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over wash my hair when I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> after i use it people usually ask me if i have done my hair again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> For the past 5+ years, I&#x27;ve been going to Aveda salons to get my hair dyed.  </li>
            <li> My hair was looking really dull and faded</li>
            <li> Drys my hair out and even with the conditioner it makes my hair hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I used to use this shampoo years ago and the quality is so much worse.</li>
            <li> I will finish the bottle, because it was expensive</li>
            <li> Am sorry</li>
            <li> I just hope it washes out soon. :(</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is nice to be able to get something you used to have to buy from a salon on line.</li>
            <li> I used this product in between having my hair highlighted at the salon.  My hair has a natural red tone to it and this shampoo helps blend the highlights with my natural color.  I love the way the subtle reds help hid my unsightly roots.  I did find that the shampoo does leave it feeling a bit dry, but I can counter-act the dryness if I use a half and half mix of this product with my normal one.</li>
            <li> This product is an orange-red, not a blue-red tone.  I use a blue-red hair color and this gave my hair a yellow-ish tinge for which I did not care.  It would be nice if Aveda had more diversity of color offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I formerly used ARTec (later L&#x27;Oreal Professionnel) color depositing shampoos/conditioners and they were the BEST for adding color to hair. Sadly, L&#x27;Oreal has seen fit to discontinue this amazing product and I find myself adrift without a replacement for the shampoo I&#x27;ve been using for nearly EIGHT years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping Aveda had the solution to my problem, but sadly, they do not.</li>
            <li> Great price on the shampoo I love.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I recently dyed my hair red and every wash more and more color would come out! I could not keep it from fading so fast until I found this conditioner! It is amazing. My hair was looking really dull and faded and after one use it looks way more vibrant. I definitely recommend to anyone who has dyed red hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice that this shampoo added any red tones to my auburn hair.  It smells wonderful but the color payoff isn&#x27;t what I expected.  Red is the most difficult color to keep in the hair because the red color molecules are huge and therefore don&#x27;t completely penetrate the hair shaft.  Consequently, red color treated hair needs a supplement to keep the color fresh.  The best red shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used are Artec, but Loreal bought the company and discontinued the colored shampoos (they&#x27;re available on ebay but are cost prohibitive).  This madder root shampoo doesn&#x27;t really do what the Artec shampoos did and I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference since I started using it.  I will finish the bottle, because it was expensive and I happen to like the fragrance, but I won&#x27;t repurchase it.  I recommend Tressa Watercolors red shampoos instead.  They definitely add red tones and there are several reds to choose from.  Leave the shampoo on for at least 10 minutes or shampoo twice for more intensity.  Tressa is sulfate free and leaves hair soft and shiny.  It&#x27;s a much better product than Aveda, in my opinion.  With the Tressa shampoo, I&#x27;m able to keep my auburn hair fresh and bright between colorings.  I simply have not noticed any difference at all with the Aveda Madder Root shampoo.  A waste of money.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over wash my hair when I use it everyday.  The scent is aromatherapy all in itself!</li>
            <li> Not the greatest for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it keeps the red in my hair longer.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff! this kills two birds with one stone. first off i am a vegan so this company is a favorite of mine since they only use plant materials and i have red hair. which if you have red hair you know that it fades quickly. both the conditioner and shampoo all deposit red in your hair. after i use it people usually ask me if i have done my hair again. i would be careful i think it might be able to stain white clothes, towels ect. but you do have to leave it in longer than normally. awesome stuff though.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner set. They work great together to keep my red hair vibrant and not muddy. Using these on a regular weekly schedule has helped my red hair to keep its bright color and shine as well as prolong the time I need between visits to the salon.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shampoo 20 years ago and have used it ever since.  It is gentle to my hair and leaves it looking fresh and alive.  A 33.8 oz bottle lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair out and even with the conditioner it makes my hair hard to manage. I think the color is great but hard to get through my hair evenly</li>
            <li> Brightens up warm red hair color. I love the smell. This has a fruity, sweet sent. It did not dye my scalp or dry my hair out. I did wear gloves when applying it. It lathers extremely well. I didn&#x27;t need anywhere near as much of this shampoo as I need of regular shampoos. I like it enough to order more.  I have fine, thick, dry hair and this shampoo left it smooth, soft, smelling nice, and redder than before. Other reviewers reported it being streaky and dying things pink. I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all with the shampoo. The conditioner on the other hand does dye things pink and is a bit streaky. I highly recommend the shampoo, but not the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead. I have never colored my hair before, but now that I&#x27;m 46 my formerly vibrant copper-red hair is fading. I wanted to give it a boost and had heard good things about this product. Unfortunately, the color is not natural looking, but rather a bright pinkish-red! I have natural blonde highlights in the front, especially when I&#x27;ve been in the sun...and they are now bright red...NOT the color of real red hair. So...it does work, and only with one washing/conditioning, but don&#x27;t use it if you want to revive your natural red hair. It&#x27;s probably fine for people with a dye job. I just hope it washes out soon. :(</li>
            <li> What can I say about a shampoo?  It gets my hair clean and this one also tones down the gray with a reddish sheen that blends with my own color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> Awful. Makes your hair clown-colored. Was looking for a substitute for the wonderful L&#x27;Oreal Marigold shampoo and conditioner, alas no longer made. Am sorry I spent the money.</li>
            <li> My review is limited by the way in which I have been using the shampoo, but it is hard for me to imagine this product actually working. The pigment in it does not seem to stick to any kind of material, really. It certainly does not stick to brown or white hair. The description suggests that it should work for people with red or auburn hair, and I want to be clear that I have not tried it on naturally red or auburn hair. Nevertheless, I have a suspicion that the people who see it &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; their natural color may be perceiving an illusory correlation. After all, hair always looks refreshed, and the color looks more intense and interesting, after showering. As far as its cleaning function, the shampoo is fine. It has a slight cherry fragrance, produces a low-average amount of lather, rinses off easily, does not seem to be too drying, and does not seem to irritate too much.</li>
            <li> I used to use this shampoo years ago and the quality is so much worse. I am not sure why. It makes my hair extremely dry and lightens it to a dried out fried looking blonde color. Also it makes my scalp itch terribly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Aveda&#x27;s products have declined in quality a lot since about 2000 and I don&#x27;t plan on buying their hair care products anymore.</li>
            <li> A bit about myself first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: Naturally red with blonde highlights.&lt;br /&gt;Type:  Soft thin hair strands and lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;Length: Long. My hair hangs all the way down my back.&lt;br /&gt;Styling Tools: None&lt;br /&gt;Tangles: Tangles really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this and the matching conditioner most every day. I love the lather and this is so far the best smelling among the Aveda shampoos I have use.  This leaves my hair feeling clean other than gunky like several other shampoos.  As I don&#x27;t cut my hair but once or twice a year, I tend to spend the hair cut money on shampoo and conditioner.  In the salon the price is a bit high.  I am glad to pay it though as I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair red for my entire adult life.  For the past 5+ years, I&#x27;ve been going to Aveda salons to get my hair dyed.  My biggest complaint about red dye is it fades so fast, making it necessary to return to the salon sooner than I&#x27;d like (and costing me more than I&#x27;d like).  At my last visit, my stylist recommended this Aveda madder root shampoo and accompanying conditioner.  I actually really like how it is keeping my hair redder longer than usual.  However, for the first time in my life, I&#x27;m having what I think is an allergic reaction on my skin.  I&#x27;ve developed tiny, itchy red bumps all along my neck and face at my hairline.  Unfortunately, I will have to discontinue use of this shampoo and conditioner and go back to my old type.  Now, I have a huge bottle of the (expensive) shampoo that I can&#x27;t even use!</li>
