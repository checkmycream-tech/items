    <ol>
            <li>Best one I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Awesome price too.</li>
            <li>It does look great!.</li>
            <li>Although, the &#x27;plumping&#x27; is the best I have found in lip plumpers</li>
            <li>The Angelina color goes well with my skin completion and very fair.</li>
            <li>The color Angelina is a beautiful color once u get it on.</li>
            <li>I had also purchased this product in Scarlet - which is a great color.</li>
            <li>Looks good on lips but doesn&#x27;t plump them.</li>
            <li>this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>the plumping effect is just as good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also a really good lip gloss.</li>
            <li>However, I love a product!</li>
            <li>I just wanted something to warm up my lips and get the circulation going.  </li>
            <li>My daughters keep stealing it, so I ordered them some of their own.</li>
            <li>but the tingeling is nice.</li>
            <li>but it has a nice shimmery translucent color.</li>
            <li>I will buy the product again as the price is great and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>This product shipped very fast and came in impeccable condition.</li>
            <li>but I love the color</li>
            <li>and this one burns the most.</li>
            <li>and I love the tingle.</li>
            <li>I wear this every night out, and I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sexy but not too \\&quot;out there\\&quot; lip color.</li>
            <li>perfect color and last for awhile on the lips</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and add it to my orders often.</li>
            <li>I love this gloss.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>ok... I didn&#x27;t notice any change in using this product...</li>
            <li>Over I love it as a gloss</li>
            <li>I really love the way this looks with the color of it and all.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just ok</li>
            <li>It looks great, tingles nicely, and doesn&#x27;t taste gross or anything.</li>
            <li>I love how this product leaves a light gold shimmery color on your lips.</li>
            <li>It works really good, although I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t plump as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- easy to apply</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty inexpensive, and I thought it did a nice job for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>a reliable and cheap lip gloss</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to a lighter color for daytime use, but this turned out a bit too light for me.</li>
            <li>If you want a kick out of stinging lip gloss, it&#x27;s kind of funny for the first minute or two.  </li>
            <li>Gives great shine, doesn&#x27;t dry your lips</li>
            <li>Overall this product is amazing though :)</li>
            <li>i already have full lips</li>
            <li>I have full lips</li>
            <li>It is super shiny, with just a tint of color (the gold looks great over lip stain, but alone is a little Ziggy Stardust, however, the pink looks great over a stain or alone)</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty gold tone however.</li>
            <li>Glossy and pretty!</li>
            <li>Great little lip plumper.</li>
            <li>nice sheer color</li>
            <li>Gives my lips a golden sheen</li>
            <li>Its ok for day use over another color or alone for a natural look.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>--just the right amount of sheen to highlight the lips.  </li>
            <li>I usually just apply another color over it though and it looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- pretty color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a color like this for years and finally found it :)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This product also lacks the funny smell and taste that a lot of plumpers and glosses have.</li>
            <li>at first it burns</li>
            <li>the color is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but I was looking fir something to mak my top lip bigger</li>
            <li>The color is pretty, but almost too much shine if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>I really wish this was a matte formula</li>
            <li>It Up Lip Plumper Angelina on top of NYX peekaboo pink lip liner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- didn&#x27;t plump my lips at all, even though the whole time I figured all that pain would amount to something</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this gloss for the money.</li>
            <li>so i cant really tell if it plumps all that much</li>
            <li>Very nude in color.</li>
            <li>Does have a tingly sensation but doesn&#x27;t really plump lips.</li>
            <li>and it really didn&#x27;t do the job for me so that being said I wont get that brand</li>
            <li>Other than that small problem this is an amazing product. :)</li>
            <li>My new go to gloss</li>
            <li>This is a new staple that will be added permanently to my makeup kit.  </li>
            <li>But they both are new to the world of lip plumping</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll definitely feel your lips tingling within the first minute of using it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even experience the familiar tingle with other lip plumpers.  </li>
            <li>I still like some other brands better and will go back to them</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this as a lip gloss, and that is exactly what you get for the price.</li>
            <li>Just really not a lip plumper not even super glossy.</li>
            <li>I like the color, but it&#x27;s a little pale and doesn&#x27;t look very good against average skin tone (I bet if you&#x27;re really pale, or tanned you&#x27;d look better in it).  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this arrived in a package of three...</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised by that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very metallic (silver) and with my dark complection, really stands out.</li>
            <li>Its a bare shimmering beige.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t think those exist also, its a bit of a frost so do not apply too much or your lips look a little weird</li>
            <li>No long term lasting effect.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It gives me a the look I want to achieve, a natural lip with a little extra pout.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- a little tacky, so you might need to put clear gloss over it</li>
            <li> it starts a few seconds after application and offers a sting--</li>
            <li> I gave the other two to my teen daughters</li>
            <li> So for me personally, I just use it as any other lip gloss I have...</li>
            <li> Also the applicator is kinda dry when u put the gloss on.</li>
            <li> which is amazing because i usually hate lip gloss because of that reason.</li>
            <li> Not really a plumper.</li>
            <li> Not to wet or sticky</li>
            <li> this is mor ethan i expected.</li>
            <li> Having used other plumpers before, the burn doesn&#x27;t bother me, but this gloss does have some &#x27;heat&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of NYX lip plumping gloss works well just not as much as other product that I have bought.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not tremendous and doesn&#x27;t plump at all if you want</li>
            <li> The plump is also not a great as some other I have tried, but the plumping is visible and last for a while.</li>
            <li> it plumped my lips a little..</li>
            <li> ,it did a little plumping on my lips.i did like the color</li>
            <li> What a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have average size lips, but they are always so pale!  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t increase circulation despite the tingling, so my lips stayed just as pale</li>
            <li> My only criticism would be that although it  is very subtle plumping your lips, it burns ALOT i have used a lot of lip plumper s</li>
            <li> Its quite sticky :/</li>
            <li> and I use Victoria&#x27;s secret lip plumper</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it gave all of the feeling of pumping blood, without results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just not really happy with this at all!!</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before I got it, and read how it has a horrible extreme burn, but I didn&#x27;t think so at all.</li>
            <li> but it is not as bad as some I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- stings like crazy!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> nice sheer color and yes I feel it working.. My new go to gloss</li>
            <li> Makes my lips tingle but I love the color</li>
            <li> Not really a plumper. I really wish this was a matte formula but I honestly don&#x27;t think those exist also, its a bit of a frost so do not apply too much or your lips look a little weird</li>
            <li> I love how this product leaves a light gold shimmery color on your lips. This product shipped very fast and came in impeccable condition. My only criticism would be that although it  is very subtle plumping your lips, it burns ALOT i have used a lot of lip plumper s and this one burns the most. Other than that small problem this is an amazing product. :)</li>
            <li> Gives my lips a golden sheen and I love the tingle. I wear this every night out, and I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sexy but not too \\&quot;out there\\&quot; lip color.</li>
            <li> perfect color and last for awhile on the lips it plumped my lips a little..</li>
            <li> I like to use NYX Plump It Up Lip Plumper Angelina on top of NYX peekaboo pink lip liner. It gives me a the look I want to achieve, a natural lip with a little extra pout.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for big, puffy, Angelina lips like this product&#x27;s name hints at.  I just wanted something to warm up my lips and get the circulation going.  I have average size lips, but they are always so pale!  I was hoping this lipgloss would stimulate them and get the blood flowing.  Unfortunately, it gave all of the feeling of pumping blood, without results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- pretty color&lt;br /&gt;- easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- you&#x27;ll definitely feel your lips tingling within the first minute of using it&lt;br /&gt;- might work for others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- a little tacky, so you might need to put clear gloss over it&lt;br /&gt;- stings like crazy!  like you rubbed a habanero pepper over your lips!!!  ouch!&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t plump my lips at all, even though the whole time I figured all that pain would amount to something&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t increase circulation despite the tingling, so my lips stayed just as pale&lt;br /&gt;- continues to sting, even after you wipe off the gloss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this product didn&#x27;t work for me.  If you want a kick out of stinging lip gloss, it&#x27;s kind of funny for the first minute or two.  Then you realize it just hurts and you got no reward.  I like the color, but it&#x27;s a little pale and doesn&#x27;t look very good against average skin tone (I bet if you&#x27;re really pale, or tanned you&#x27;d look better in it).  It didn&#x27;t plump...at all.  Guess the search continues.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and add it to my orders often.</li>
            <li> Gives great shine, doesn&#x27;t dry your lips</li>
            <li> Looks good on lips but doesn&#x27;t plump them.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss.  Best one I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Not to wet or sticky--just the right amount of sheen to highlight the lips.  My daughters keep stealing it, so I ordered them some of their own. This is a new staple that will be added permanently to my makeup kit.  Awesome price too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Super fast delivery and pretty cheap. I&#x27;ve been looking for a color like this for years and finally found it :)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this arrived in a package of three... I didn&#x27;t need three, but ok... I didn&#x27;t notice any change in using this product... I didn&#x27;t even experience the familiar tingle with other lip plumpers.  The color is pretty, but almost too much shine if that makes sense.  I gave the other two to my teen daughters and they like the color, shine and noticed the tingle.  But they both are new to the world of lip plumping ;) so I wasn&#x27;t surprised by that.  So for me personally, I just use it as any other lip gloss I have...</li>
            <li> Great little lip plumper. I still like some other brands better and will go back to them</li>
            <li> Glossy and pretty! Like the color alot. However, it does wear off, but reapply, reapply. It does look great!. thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty inexpensive, and I thought it did a nice job for what I paid for it. It looks great, tingles nicely, and doesn&#x27;t taste gross or anything. Although it&#x27;s not tremendous and doesn&#x27;t plump at all if you want a reliable and cheap lip gloss this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I really like this gloss for the money. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; like some plumpers I&#x27;ve tried and the plumping effect is just as good. Having used other plumpers before, the burn doesn&#x27;t bother me, but this gloss does have some &#x27;heat&#x27;. The only thing I might do differently is the color. It&#x27;s very metallic (silver) and with my dark complection, really stands out. I usually just apply another color over it though and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t plump my lips at all. It is a very pretty gold tone however. I would only recommend this as a lip gloss, and that is exactly what you get for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a lip gloss junky; I will try anything so I have found a lot of duds! However, I love a product! It is super shiny, with just a tint of color (the gold looks great over lip stain, but alone is a little Ziggy Stardust, however, the pink looks great over a stain or alone) While it is shiny, it is not sticky like a lot of glosses or plumpers. This product also lacks the funny smell and taste that a lot of plumpers and glosses have. Now, the burn is a factor here-- it starts a few seconds after application and offers a sting-- but it is not as bad as some I have tried. The plump is also not a great as some other I have tried, but the plumping is visible and last for a while. Over I love it as a gloss and it is a passable plumper (hence the 4 stars, instead of 5). I will buy the product again as the price is great and the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> at first it burns it feels like its working but it actually didn&#x27;t work at all , it doesnt even look nicee the color</li>
            <li> this is mor ethan i expected. the color is exactly what i wanted. and its not sticky at ALL. which is amazing because i usually hate lip gloss because of that reason. i already have full lips so i cant really tell if it plumps all that much but the tingeling is nice.</li>
            <li> I had also purchased this product in Scarlet - which is a great color. I was looking forward to a lighter color for daytime use, but this turned out a bit too light for me. Although, the &#x27;plumping&#x27; is the best I have found in lip plumpers</li>
            <li> Its quite sticky :/ but it has a nice shimmery translucent color.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of NYX lip plumping gloss works well just not as much as other product that I have bought. The Angelina color goes well with my skin completion and very fair.</li>
            <li> I actually did notice that my lips were getting bigger and it&#x27;s also a really good lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Lip plumping no. Not a thing!! Also the applicator is kinda dry when u put the gloss on. It took several times to get the product on my lips. The color Angelina is a beautiful color once u get it on. Lip plumping no. I have full lips and I use Victoria&#x27;s secret lip plumper and I get a shiny fuller looking lip Also Fusion lip plumper works. Just really not a lip plumper not even super glossy. Its ok for day use over another color or alone for a natural look. Its a bare shimmering beige. Just not really happy with this at all!! What a waste of money</li>
            <li> Works for about ten minutes and then does nothing. No long term lasting effect. Doesn&#x27;t work well with lipstick as it makes your lips feel oily.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this looks with the color of it and all. It works really good, although I gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t plump as much as I would like. I had read the reviews before I got it, and read how it has a horrible extreme burn, but I didn&#x27;t think so at all. Overall this product is amazing though :)</li>
            <li> Very nude in color. Does have a tingly sensation but doesn&#x27;t really plump lips. Overall it&#x27;s okay. Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just ok,it did a little plumping on my lips.i did like the color and how it went on but I was looking fir something to mak my top lip bigger and it really didn&#x27;t do the job for me so that being said I wont get that brand again.you get what you pay for.</li>
