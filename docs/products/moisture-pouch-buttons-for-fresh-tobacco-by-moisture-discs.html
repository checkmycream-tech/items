            <li>B00326GR9W Moisture Pouch Buttons for Fresh Tobacco]] Stay green and happy!</li>
            <li>At first I thought that these pouches don&#x27;t really work, however after couple months of usage I can happily say they really keep the tobacco moisturized.</li>
            <li>These moist buttons are very effective in keeping my tobacco moist over a very long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I use roughly two ounce jars, &amp; one each works great, just like a humidor.</li>
            <li>Also, if possible, go to a good drugstore and buy a gallon of demineralized water -- it has no impurities that could flavor or clog up the works.</li>
            <li>so I got 10 more of these handy humidifiers have never had to deal with dry tobacco since</li>
            <li>I received the 5 pouch buttons I ordered quickly</li>
            <li>A couple minutes in water, and it soaks up what it needs, just put it in your bag or pouch, and the results are tremendous.</li>
            <li>I had mild expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Once the leaf is fresh, one moisturizer is usually enough for a good bag.</li>
            <li>These buttons are fantastic for keep your tobacco fresh and just the right amount of moisture in the pouch.</li>
            <li>but since i&#x27;m new at this pipe smoking buisness i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out..</li>
            <li>I soaked these in Britta water over night and put these in the most arid tobacco I have and within two days it was fresh as new.</li>
            <li>These little buttons are great.</li>
            <li>Keeps my tobacco as fresh as the day I opened the pack without over moistening the tobacco.</li>
            <li>nice for evening zip lock humidity or short pipe moisture fix.</li>
            <li>but I want my tobacco to be fresh when I go to smoke.</li>
            <li>Keeping pouch tobacco fresh has been a problem.</li>
            <li>I like how they&#x27;re simple and effective.</li>
            <li>My tobacco seems to be staying fresh.</li>
            <li>My smoke is as fresh as the day I opened the tin.</li>
            <li>Just drop into water to activate them, then drop into your tobabcco to keep it fresh and moist.</li>
            <li>Products such as this are difficult to find, so I was very pleased to see these offered through Amazon, and at a great price!</li>
            <li>I put them in my tobacco pouch overnight and in the morning my tobacco is just right.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used as yet but will be just right for the job.  </li>
            <li>pretty handle and useful</li>
            <li>The dregs in my bag now remain as fresh as when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>: I love these buttons so much, I&#x27;ve reordered them as a stocking stuffer for my adult son.</li>
            <li>and they work very well and pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Even briefer refreshing is necessary when refilling your jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more later for backup.</li>
            <li>My tobacco stays as moist as when it was first purchased.</li>
            <li>I may have given a higher rating but there were no instructions included with the pouches.</li>
            <li>Here is a link in case you&#x27;re ready to buy them right now:</li>
            <li>Adding these with the leather tobacco pouch that I use has really made the tobacco last as long as I need it to in great shape.</li>
            <li>Also works well by velcroing into a Witz Dry Safe to keep RYO ready mades fresh.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for keeping my different tobaccos from drying out and a lot cheaper than what the other shops wanted for them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are reasonably effective at their function but absolutely not worth the price given their flimsy construction.</li>
            <li>In a day or two, your dried out tobacco is good as new!</li>
            <li>If you know what these little discs are used for, you&#x27;ll enjoy the fact that AMZN makes them easy to find.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re just going for maintenance, use one, unless you have an exceptionally large pouch or humidor.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to relax and burn some fine English blend.</li>
            <li>If you refresh them with water regularly they are fine.  </li>
            <li>These are nice little pieces of smoking equipment, but the jury is still out on these.</li>
            <li>They are a little smaller than I suspected but still work great</li>
            <li>I love my American Spirit tobacco but it can dry out pretty quickly after opening the package.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this product works for tobbaco products, it worked better than expected for storage of medinal herbs, et.,</li>
            <li>each is too much.  </li>
            <li>These worked really well to re-hydrate some of my tobaccos.</li>
            <li>Works even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know why some recommend to soak them for hours.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey perhaps, but these work very well.</li>
            <li>at a real affordable price....thanx.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>they work really well.</li>
            <li>I tried a humidity pouch, but didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Always have them ready for him to use.</li>
            <li>So yeah, there is some maintenance on your part, but the result is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>It does not create too much humidity and does not &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These do the trick and they are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>These little things keep it moist and do a great job of refreshing leaf that&#x27;s been dry for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price better than on other sites.  </li>
            <li>Simply drop them in a glass of clean water.</li>
            <li>I recieved these and although they are small they work very well in my cotainer and keep my tobacco nice and moist.</li>
            <li>But man o man, the quality of fresh, slightly moist leaf is so much better than those old \\&quot;toaster</li>
            <li>Keeps the tobacco sweet &amp; at proper humidity for about a week before re-soaking.</li>
            <li>Short &amp; sweet</li>
            <li>And check them every couple days, because the leaf will soak up a huge amount of water if it&#x27;s really dry.</li>
            <li>&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The perfect solution for the pipe smoker with several tins of tobacco open at the same time, never have it dried out again.</li>
            <li>Now I keep a smaller amount in a handy decorative container  in which I&#x27;ve placed two of the buttons, keeping the other three in the shipping bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to smoke my pipe more in the winter months, so I have unfinished tins of tobacco laying around getting dried out.</li>
            <li>They definitely do the job to keep your tobacco as fresh as it can be.</li>
            <li>These definitely help keep your smokes in a fresh, moist</li>
            <li>This works MUCH better than plain sponges.</li>
            <li>Simple but effective little buttons.</li>
            <li>Also, most people say that you need to check the pouches to ensure they don&#x27;t dry out, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to determine if they are dry.</li>
            <li>These little things are great and don&#x27;t leave any residual taste like you would get by putting a small piece of lemon peel in the pouch.</li>
            <li>These cool little buttons have really done the trick in terms of keeping things moist and not drying out.</li>
            <li>These little humidifiers work just fine in my mobile tobacco pouch...</li>
            <li>Tobacco always dries out, and I enjoy a little moister smoke.  </li>
            <li>These pouch buttons fall apart completely with no effort.</li>
            <li>They do what they are supposed to without causing over wetness or early drying of the tobacco in my tins and pouches.</li>
            <li>Completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I like the Moisture Pouch Buttons so much that I purchased a second set.</li>
            <li>I am not entirely sure how long to soak these for, or how long they are good for in a sealed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My experience is that it takes a couple or even 3 of them to freshen up very dry leaf when you first put them in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways this is a very decent product and I will continue to use till they no longer work since all you have to do is soak in water, dry it and put it in your stuff.  </li>
            <li>tobacco burns hot and bitter, Nuff Said.</li>
            <li>However, they don&#x27;t stay moist very long, so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>They seem to dry up fast.</li>
            <li>then I put it in jar with my herbal medicine and when I came back in the morning the herbs were fresh and easier to smoke (harder to grind though).</li>
            <li>I am familiar with these from the past</li>
            <li>These buttons are not very large but they are very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have had the metal halves separate on several of the buttons, however with a little super glue the problem was solved.</li>
            <li>They work, and surely beats placing apple slices or damp paper towels into my tobacco...which I&#x27;ve always kept in the heavy zip lock bag it comes in, which allowed me to roll it tight</li>
            <li>if you wanna keep your stuff moist n tasty not dry</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong and its nice to open my tin and find my tobacco still moist.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s work -- it may take as long as a week to freshen the whole amount of dry leaf.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a sense of when these are full, but with a little trial and error, and some [[ASIN:B0040OEB6G Xikar Humidifier Solution]], these have really helped me extend the life of my pipe tobacco, by keeping one of these buttons in my tins.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does go dry eventually, depending on how dry the leaf was to begin with, and how much leaf you put a moisture pouch into.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just soak in water for a few minutes, wipe the excess off the surface and put one in the pouch everyday.</li>

            <li> B00326GR9W Moisture Pouch Buttons for Fresh Tobacco]] Stay green and happy!</li>
            <li> At first I thought that these pouches don&#x27;t really work, however after couple months of usage I can happily say they really keep the tobacco moisturized.</li>
            <li> These moist buttons are very effective in keeping my tobacco moist over a very long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I use roughly two ounce jars, &amp; one each works great, just like a humidor.</li>
            <li> Also, if possible, go to a good drugstore and buy a gallon of demineralized water -- it has no impurities that could flavor or clog up the works.</li>
            <li> so I got 10 more of these handy humidifiers have never had to deal with dry tobacco since</li>
            <li> I received the 5 pouch buttons I ordered quickly</li>
            <li> A couple minutes in water, and it soaks up what it needs, just put it in your bag or pouch, and the results are tremendous.</li>
            <li> I had mild expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Once the leaf is fresh, one moisturizer is usually enough for a good bag.</li>
            <li> These buttons are fantastic for keep your tobacco fresh and just the right amount of moisture in the pouch.</li>
            <li> but since i&#x27;m new at this pipe smoking buisness i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out..</li>
            <li> I soaked these in Britta water over night and put these in the most arid tobacco I have and within two days it was fresh as new.</li>
            <li> These little buttons are great.</li>
            <li> Keeps my tobacco as fresh as the day I opened the pack without over moistening the tobacco.</li>
            <li> nice for evening zip lock humidity or short pipe moisture fix.</li>
            <li> but I want my tobacco to be fresh when I go to smoke.</li>
            <li> Keeping pouch tobacco fresh has been a problem.</li>
            <li> I like how they&#x27;re simple and effective.</li>
            <li> My tobacco seems to be staying fresh.</li>
            <li> My smoke is as fresh as the day I opened the tin.</li>
            <li> Just drop into water to activate them, then drop into your tobabcco to keep it fresh and moist.</li>
            <li> Products such as this are difficult to find, so I was very pleased to see these offered through Amazon, and at a great price!</li>
            <li> I put them in my tobacco pouch overnight and in the morning my tobacco is just right.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used as yet but will be just right for the job.  </li>
            <li> pretty handle and useful</li>
            <li> The dregs in my bag now remain as fresh as when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> : I love these buttons so much, I&#x27;ve reordered them as a stocking stuffer for my adult son.</li>
            <li> and they work very well and pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Even briefer refreshing is necessary when refilling your jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more later for backup.</li>
            <li> My tobacco stays as moist as when it was first purchased.</li>
            <li> I may have given a higher rating but there were no instructions included with the pouches.</li>
            <li> Here is a link in case you&#x27;re ready to buy them right now:</li>
            <li> Adding these with the leather tobacco pouch that I use has really made the tobacco last as long as I need it to in great shape.</li>
            <li> Also works well by velcroing into a Witz Dry Safe to keep RYO ready mades fresh.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for keeping my different tobaccos from drying out and a lot cheaper than what the other shops wanted for them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are reasonably effective at their function but absolutely not worth the price given their flimsy construction.</li>
            <li> In a day or two, your dried out tobacco is good as new!</li>
            <li> If you know what these little discs are used for, you&#x27;ll enjoy the fact that AMZN makes them easy to find.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re just going for maintenance, use one, unless you have an exceptionally large pouch or humidor.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to relax and burn some fine English blend.</li>
            <li> If you refresh them with water regularly they are fine.  </li>
            <li> These are nice little pieces of smoking equipment, but the jury is still out on these.</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than I suspected but still work great</li>
            <li> I love my American Spirit tobacco but it can dry out pretty quickly after opening the package.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product works for tobbaco products, it worked better than expected for storage of medinal herbs, et.,</li>
            <li> each is too much.  </li>
            <li> These worked really well to re-hydrate some of my tobaccos.</li>
            <li> Works even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know why some recommend to soak them for hours.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey perhaps, but these work very well.</li>
            <li> at a real affordable price....thanx.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> they work really well.</li>
            <li> I tried a humidity pouch, but didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Always have them ready for him to use.</li>
            <li> So yeah, there is some maintenance on your part, but the result is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> It does not create too much humidity and does not &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These do the trick and they are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> These little things keep it moist and do a great job of refreshing leaf that&#x27;s been dry for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price better than on other sites.  </li>
            <li> Simply drop them in a glass of clean water.</li>
            <li> I recieved these and although they are small they work very well in my cotainer and keep my tobacco nice and moist.</li>
            <li> But man o man, the quality of fresh, slightly moist leaf is so much better than those old \\&quot;toaster</li>
            <li> Keeps the tobacco sweet &amp; at proper humidity for about a week before re-soaking.</li>
            <li> Short &amp; sweet</li>
            <li> And check them every couple days, because the leaf will soak up a huge amount of water if it&#x27;s really dry.</li>
            <li> &gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for the pipe smoker with several tins of tobacco open at the same time, never have it dried out again.</li>
            <li> Now I keep a smaller amount in a handy decorative container  in which I&#x27;ve placed two of the buttons, keeping the other three in the shipping bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to smoke my pipe more in the winter months, so I have unfinished tins of tobacco laying around getting dried out.</li>
            <li> They definitely do the job to keep your tobacco as fresh as it can be.</li>
            <li> These definitely help keep your smokes in a fresh, moist</li>
            <li> This works MUCH better than plain sponges.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective little buttons.</li>
            <li> Also, most people say that you need to check the pouches to ensure they don&#x27;t dry out, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to determine if they are dry.</li>
            <li> These little things are great and don&#x27;t leave any residual taste like you would get by putting a small piece of lemon peel in the pouch.</li>
            <li> These cool little buttons have really done the trick in terms of keeping things moist and not drying out.</li>
            <li> These little humidifiers work just fine in my mobile tobacco pouch...</li>
            <li> Tobacco always dries out, and I enjoy a little moister smoke.  </li>
            <li> These pouch buttons fall apart completely with no effort.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to without causing over wetness or early drying of the tobacco in my tins and pouches.</li>
            <li> Completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I like the Moisture Pouch Buttons so much that I purchased a second set.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure how long to soak these for, or how long they are good for in a sealed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My experience is that it takes a couple or even 3 of them to freshen up very dry leaf when you first put them in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways this is a very decent product and I will continue to use till they no longer work since all you have to do is soak in water, dry it and put it in your stuff.  </li>
            <li> tobacco burns hot and bitter, Nuff Said.</li>
            <li> However, they don&#x27;t stay moist very long, so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> They seem to dry up fast.</li>
            <li> then I put it in jar with my herbal medicine and when I came back in the morning the herbs were fresh and easier to smoke (harder to grind though).</li>
            <li> I am familiar with these from the past</li>
            <li> These buttons are not very large but they are very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had the metal halves separate on several of the buttons, however with a little super glue the problem was solved.</li>
            <li> They work, and surely beats placing apple slices or damp paper towels into my tobacco...which I&#x27;ve always kept in the heavy zip lock bag it comes in, which allowed me to roll it tight</li>
            <li> if you wanna keep your stuff moist n tasty not dry</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong and its nice to open my tin and find my tobacco still moist.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s work -- it may take as long as a week to freshen the whole amount of dry leaf.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a sense of when these are full, but with a little trial and error, and some [[ASIN:B0040OEB6G Xikar Humidifier Solution]], these have really helped me extend the life of my pipe tobacco, by keeping one of these buttons in my tins.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does go dry eventually, depending on how dry the leaf was to begin with, and how much leaf you put a moisture pouch into.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just soak in water for a few minutes, wipe the excess off the surface and put one in the pouch everyday.</li>
            <li> It keeps everything fresh as new and prevents a bunch of dusty, dry herbs.</li>
            <li> Make sure you soak them for at least 30 minutes and in a small container that only gets opened once a day or so, they&#x27;ll keep things humid for about a week in my use.</li>
            <li> I have two that came that separate which isn&#x27;t a big deal since I have my tobacco in a can sitting flat</li>
            <li> I did the same with some extremely dry medical cannabis, with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;You have to wet them in cool water at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Essentially for people keeping their tobacco or herbs for long periods of time (or getting them from vendors who did so).</li>
            <li> and I suspect I could easily pull the other four in half given how soft and thin the metal cases are.</li>
            <li> I soak them in a small bowl of water for about a half an hour, dry with a paper towel and use two for a small bag, or more for a larger bag.  </li>
            <li> placed two in a plastic bag with some very dry tobacco and in a few days the tobacco became soft and moist again...</li>
            <li> The only issue is that they can come apart, other than this</li>
            <li> If tobacco gets dry I soak them and throw one in tobacco.</li>
            <li> Then dry them off &amp; place them in your tobacco jar, toward the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tobacco user, so my leaf often gets dry between uses.  </li>
            <li> I put one in a pouch of Bugler that was so dry it was being reduced to powder when handled.</li>
            <li> so you have to keep an eye on them if your don&#x27;t want to dry out your stash.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was quite dry.</li>
            <li> The leaves were dry and crispy.  </li>
            <li> The longest I have gone is about 3 weeks but as long as they are kept wet</li>
            <li> but if I were new to them they would be a waste of money however they do work as described if you soak them in water for a few hours, dry the case and place them in saleable container with your tobacco.</li>
            <li> Wait a little while and put them back in the tobacco can.</li>
            <li> I rotate mine in my humidor, Like the other reviews say they do dry out</li>
            <li> These preserve the freshness of pipe tobacco after you open the tin and before it gets all dried out.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes is largely enough.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> &#x27;refresh&#x27; them every few days by soaking them in water and throwing them back in the mason jar.</li>
            <li> Only had in my tobacco for a few hours.</li>
            <li> was soaking them early on (distilled water only), but then started squirting water into them with a thin nozzle bottle.</li>
            <li> Add one or two a 50g tin to keep moist works well, sometimes a little too well and have to dry my tobacco out for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> I personally think they&#x27;re a little too small to use in a humidor alone</li>
            <li> the past, whenever I was finishing off a bag, I&#x27;d find the tobacco getting so dry</li>
            <li> No more to dry and crumbly tobacco for my husband.</li>
            <li> After about half a day the tobacco was moist and handleable again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These little moisture buttons work like a charm for what I use them for.</li>
            <li> These little gems will give you lots of smoking pleasure.  </li>
            <li> so I need something that would keep a little moisture in there.  </li>
            <li> ...let sit on a towel for a few minutes and it&#x27;s RTG.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I have been out of town for a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> I got a few of these</li>
            <li> I just let a few drops of water absorb into the button</li>
            <li> You do have to resoak them every few days</li>
            <li> The buttons are made of two pieces of thin metal, with one &#x27;snugly&#x27; resting within the other, and the clay disc in the center.</li>
            <li> At least they don&#x27;t kill tobacco like some other methods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every gadget, device, pouch, and weird humidity controllers on the market -- and this one is one of the few that actually works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Love these little buttons!</li>
            <li> but I keep a small cup of distilled water and just rotate mine out about once a week.</li>
            <li> There are not many choices I have seen for this type of product.</li>
            <li> : banana peels (about a 1&amp;#34;x1&amp;#34; piece) works wonders for small pouches if you have nothing else around.  </li>
            <li> Being that they&#x27;re small</li>
            <li> I was immediately disappointed upon opening the package, these buttons are clearly of a very low build quality and made with the cheapest possible materials.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well they work.</li>
            <li> (they are a small package.)</li>
            <li> I usually have about five tins of tobacco at a time</li>
            <li> it almost turns to a powder, making it near impossible to roll.</li>
            <li> All five buttons came with a sticky pad affixed to one side, which annoyed me as they blocked half of the vents in the cases and could not be removed without leaving a residue that made tobacco clog up one side of the button when I placed it in my pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m having a hard time making them work...</li>
            <li> and it lasted at least a week until I ran out of tabaccy.</li>
            <li> I took out the moisture button and shook it, the disc on the inside moved around indicating that it was at least dryer than when I put it in.  </li>
            <li> Moisture Buttons are about the size of a quarter in diameter, and three quarters thick; with a wafer of clay in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re starting from completely dry nasty leaf, use two to three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> put these in about an inch of distilled water for three minutes, if you want you can soak them in rum or whiskey, but the clay may react poorly with the alcohol.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend, family, and I, always hate how the tobacco smells when it gets too dry.  </li>
            <li> But, if you smoke like a chimney, you probably finish a tin of tobacco way before it goes stale.</li>
            <li> And just as bad for you as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its awful.  </li>
            <li> (I use distilled-the tap water here is nasty) for a minute or so</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> pretty handle and useful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product works for tobbaco products, it worked better than expected for storage of medinal herbs, et., etc.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hambone</li>
            <li> I rotate mine in my humidor, Like the other reviews say they do dry out but I keep a small cup of distilled water and just rotate mine out about once a week. The longest I have gone is about 3 weeks but as long as they are kept wet they are a great product. They look bigger than they are in the picture, about the size of a quarter. A++++</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Received as promise.</li>
            <li> These little humidifiers work just fine in my mobile tobacco pouch...Last about two weeks before I soak them again.  The tobacco is maintained just the way i like it to be.</li>
            <li> good product for the money</li>
            <li> These work perfect!! Great deal &amp; fast shipping! Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> I put 3 of these in a gallon tobacco jar for my RYO tobacco. Keeps the tobacco sweet &amp; at proper humidity for about a week before re-soaking. Recommend using distilled water to extend the disc life, but at this price, one can keep several bags on hand. Also works well by velcroing into a Witz Dry Safe to keep RYO ready mades fresh.</li>
            <li> I love my American Spirit tobacco but it can dry out pretty quickly after opening the package. These little things are great and don&#x27;t leave any residual taste like you would get by putting a small piece of lemon peel in the pouch.</li>
            <li> A must for any pipe smoker!  Keep your tobacco fresh and moist!  Great for those bulk purchases or the pouch you keep in your vehicle...</li>
            <li> I received the 5 pouch buttons I ordered quickly but I feel $2.00 each is too much.  It probably cost 10 cents each to manufacture.  I bought these at my local cigar store for 99 cents each but did not want to make the drive.</li>
            <li> Works great reusable and very easy to use. I keep them with me.  If tobacco gets dry I soak them and throw one in tobacco. How easy is that. They arrived early and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Tobacco always dries out, and I enjoy a little moister smoke.  A couple minutes in water, and it soaks up what it needs, just put it in your bag or pouch, and the results are tremendous.</li>
            <li> Works just like I wanted. They are a little smaller than I suspected but still work great</li>
            <li> These Moisture Pouch Tobacco Buttons may look plain, but they do a marvelous job in keeping your pipe tobacco moist. Mine arrived just fine, no fancy packaging. Simply place them in the sink or small container with water for 20 seconds or so for the first time. Then dry them off &amp; place them in your tobacco jar, toward the bottom. Even briefer refreshing is necessary when refilling your jar. I use roughly two ounce jars, &amp; one each works great, just like a humidor. Nice to have &amp; improves the taste. Recommended.</li>
            <li> working great , fast shipping</li>
            <li> These pouch buttons fall apart completely with no effort. The two halves of the pouch aren&#x27;t sized properly to stick together or crimped in any way. I have to use a pair of pliers to crimp each pouch all the way around. Do not buy these pouches expecting to use them out of the box. I would have returned if I wasn&#x27;t in immediate need of them.</li>
            <li> On time &amp; they did what they were supposed to.</li>
            <li> Short &amp; sweet: I love these buttons so much, I&#x27;ve reordered them as a stocking stuffer for my adult son. They work, and surely beats placing apple slices or damp paper towels into my tobacco...which I&#x27;ve always kept in the heavy zip lock bag it comes in, which allowed me to roll it tight so air can escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, whenever I was finishing off a bag, I&#x27;d find the tobacco getting so dry it almost turns to a powder, making it near impossible to roll. Well, not this time. The dregs in my bag now remain as fresh as when I first opened it. Now I keep a smaller amount in a handy decorative container  in which I&#x27;ve placed two of the buttons, keeping the other three in the shipping bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these little buttons!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping my pipe tobacco moist.  Very handy to have and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Got my item and they gave me a free tobacco sample! Will definitely buy from this seller again. Can&#x27;t wait to relax and burn some fine English blend.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to without causing over wetness or early drying of the tobacco in my tins and pouches.</li>
            <li> Soak in water then shake off excess. Place in container. Your tobacco seems to gain in flavor as the moisture increases.</li>
            <li> These worked really well to re-hydrate some of my tobaccos.</li>
            <li> I like them. They&#x27;re great for keeping my different tobaccos from drying out and a lot cheaper than what the other shops wanted for them.</li>
            <li> These preserve the freshness of pipe tobacco after you open the tin and before it gets all dried out. But, if you smoke like a chimney, you probably finish a tin of tobacco way before it goes stale. I tend to smoke my pipe more in the winter months, so I have unfinished tins of tobacco laying around getting dried out. Just soak one of these buttons in water for a moment and then place it in the tin with the tobacco. In a day or two, your dried out tobacco is good as new! And just as bad for you as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sell for anywhere between $1 and $5 each in pipe &amp; cigar stores.</li>
            <li> These moist buttons are very effective in keeping my tobacco moist over a very long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> works great I put one in each of my tins</li>
            <li> Works even better than I expected. A few of these can keep a whole can of American Spirit from drying our for days. Once in a while I fish them out and put them in Distilled water. Takes a couple minutes. I&#x27;ll buy more later for backup.</li>
            <li> There are not many choices I have seen for this type of product. This works MUCH better than plain sponges.</li>
            <li> These buttons are not very large but they are very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I placed two in a plastic bag with some very dry tobacco and in a few days the tobacco became soft and moist again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come by bags of two so since there are 5, one comes with an open plastic package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really know why some recommend to soak them for hours. Just a few minutes is largely enough. The inside is not cotton but clay in mine.</li>
            <li> Bought these to help keep tobacco moist and they work well.  I soak them in a small bowl of water for about a half an hour, dry with a paper towel and use two for a small bag, or more for a larger bag.  Have to &#x27;re-soak about every ten days or so.</li>
            <li> these things work great. I put them in my tobacco pouch overnight and in the morning my tobacco is just right.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used as yet but will be just right for the job.  Price better than on other sites.  Should last a lifetime for me.</li>
            <li> Keeps my tobacco as fresh as the day I opened the pack without over moistening the tobacco.</li>
            <li> We read several sites with instructions on how to use these, and after a week of having them in our jar we started seeing mold on our product. Completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tobacco user, so my leaf often gets dry between uses.  My girlfriend, family, and I, always hate how the tobacco smells when it gets too dry.  Its awful.  These little things keep it moist and do a great job of refreshing leaf that&#x27;s been dry for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just going for maintenance, use one, unless you have an exceptionally large pouch or humidor.  If you&#x27;re starting from completely dry nasty leaf, use two to three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak them in water for about a minute, drop them in your pouch and give it a good shake.  Then just wait a few days and your leaf will be delicious and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip if you&#x27;re in a pinch: banana peels (about a 1&amp;#34;x1&amp;#34; piece) works wonders for small pouches if you have nothing else around.  And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> These little moisture buttons work like a charm for what I use them for. Being that they&#x27;re small I use them in my travel cigar case which holds 10 sticks nicely. I personally think they&#x27;re a little too small to use in a humidor alone &amp; I don&#x27;t intend on experimenting with my cigars.</li>
            <li> Moisture Buttons are about the size of a quarter in diameter, and three quarters thick; with a wafer of clay in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;I put these in about an inch of distilled water for three minutes, if you want you can soak them in rum or whiskey, but the clay may react poorly with the alcohol.  Placed in a two(2) Oz. poly bag of tobacco, your tobacco will be at the correct moisture for a week.&lt;br /&gt;Dry tobacco burns hot and bitter, Nuff Said.</li>
            <li> These little gems will give you lots of smoking pleasure.  The instructions say to soak them in water to keep your tobacco moist - but I soak them in brandy and it is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;They will keep a pouch carried in your pocket at work nice and moist for a week or more with only about a 1/2 hr soak in just a splash of brandy.  I prefer peach.</li>
            <li> These are good item to keep moisture for your fresh tobacco for longtime. I refer to everybody.That is it !</li>
            <li> The only use information was on the web site where I saw this item. I am familiar with these from the past but if I were new to them they would be a waste of money however they do work as described if you soak them in water for a few hours, dry the case and place them in saleable container with your tobacco.</li>
            <li> These buttons are of good quality and reasonably priced.  They definitely do the job to keep your tobacco as fresh as it can be.</li>
            <li> Products such as this are difficult to find, so I was very pleased to see these offered through Amazon, and at a great price! I will say the product is cheaply made. The buttons are made of two pieces of thin metal, with one &#x27;snugly&#x27; resting within the other, and the clay disc in the center. I have had the metal halves separate on several of the buttons, however with a little super glue the problem was solved. Regardless of this issue, all of the buttons have functioned effectively and offer a great way to keep my rolling tobacco fresh.</li>
            <li> Can be used a couple of times for short durations...nice for evening zip lock humidity or short pipe moisture fix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a sense of when these are full, but with a little trial and error, and some [[ASIN:B0040OEB6G Xikar Humidifier Solution]], these have really helped me extend the life of my pipe tobacco, by keeping one of these buttons in my tins.</li>
            <li> If you know what these little discs are used for, you&#x27;ll enjoy the fact that AMZN makes them easy to find.  I remember using these back in the 70s!</li>
            <li> If you refresh them with water regularly they are fine.  However, they don&#x27;t stay moist very long, so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Did the job!!! What more can you ask for???</li>
            <li> At first I thought that these pouches don&#x27;t really work, however after couple months of usage I can happily say they really keep the tobacco moisturized. Simply drop them in a glass of clean water. Wait a little while and put them back in the tobacco can.</li>
            <li> Essentially for people keeping their tobacco or herbs for long periods of time (or getting them from vendors who did so). It keeps everything fresh as new and prevents a bunch of dusty, dry herbs. One note of caution is to not rewet them too often or keep it too close to your herbs as they can sometimes cause mold.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey perhaps, but these work very well. I put one in a pouch of Bugler that was so dry it was being reduced to powder when handled. After about half a day the tobacco was moist and handleable again.&lt;br /&gt; I did the same with some extremely dry medical cannabis, with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;I sacrificed one to get a look at the material inside. They appear to have a white clay-like substance. (see my photo)&lt;br /&gt;I was soaking them early on (distilled water only), but then started squirting water into them with a thin nozzle bottle. I see now that they will hold much more water if soaked as directed.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> well i cant say enough about how well these work. i thought id seen it all then i saw these. well for the price i figured whats to lose? SUPER HAPPY i took a chance on these. if you wanna keep your stuff moist n tasty not dry n harsh this is the best thing out there.</li>
            <li> These work pretty good</li>
            <li> These things work pretty good....IF....you remember to re-fill them.  They dont last forever so you have to keep an eye on them if your don&#x27;t want to dry out your stash.</li>
            <li> Seem to be helping problem.</li>
            <li> i will use these just as soon as i start the pouch i also ordered with it,.....but there are five of these and i received them promptly....at a real affordable price....thanx.</li>
            <li> great girft for pipe smokers</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. Larger than they looked in the picture.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective little buttons. My tobacco stays as moist as when it was first purchased. The only issue is that they can come apart, other than this they do what they are advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Uncle loved the buttons for his pouches.</li>
            <li> item as advertised and works well for RYO</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for the pipe smoker with several tins of tobacco open at the same time, never have it dried out again.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do, i.e., keep tobacco from drying out. I only soak them for about 15 minutes and that appears to be enough.</li>
            <li> They seem to work. Have to use a lot of them for 16oz. bag of tobacco.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t fully understand what they do except for the fact that.  It keeps the tabaco moist so for that it does a good job.</li>
            <li> works as well as the ones my tobacconist was selling for five bucks a pop.  I cant complain, should get more soon</li>
            <li> I had mild expectations for this product. After about a week of use, I&#x27;m a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t smoke every day but I want my tobacco to be fresh when I go to smoke. These definitely help keep your smokes in a fresh, moist state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just &#x27;refresh&#x27; them every few days by soaking them in water and throwing them back in the mason jar. Great product, great price. Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> They work perfect for small pouches or containers. Wetted mine and it lasted at least a week until I ran out of tabaccy.</li>
            <li> does a good job of keeping my pipe tobacco moist and doesn&#x27;t take up much room. i just ordered four more of them</li>
            <li> I soak them in 100 proof Cap&#x27;n Morgans rum.&lt;br /&gt;Works fantasticaly.</li>
            <li> Ok, i understand the concept but i&#x27;m having a hard time making them work... it has nothing to do with the quality but the access to water when i needed to refill them.. but since i&#x27;m new at this pipe smoking buisness i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out..thanks</li>
            <li> Add one or two a 50g tin to keep moist works well, sometimes a little too well and have to dry my tobacco out for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with those practical pouch buttons for fresh pipe tobacco.I even use it in my wooden pipe tobacco wooden cases.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had ordered some pipe tobacco. When it arrived it was quite dry. I put the tobacco in a sealed container along with 2 moisture pouch buttons. In a couple of days the tobacco was moist and aromatic again.</li>
            <li> These work great for keeping your tobacco from drying out in your pouch.</li>
            <li> I soaked these in Britta water over night and put these in the most arid tobacco I have and within two days it was fresh as new.</li>
            <li> these moisture buttons have changed everything. I only smoke one or two cigs a day. Keeping pouch tobacco fresh has been a problem. My American Spirit pouch talks about these moisture buttons. I thought, why not try them ? Adding these with the leather tobacco pouch that I use has really made the tobacco last as long as I need it to in great shape. good product.&lt;br /&gt;wow ! they work really well. Keep tobacco at a perfect moisture. Have to re-wet them about every 10 days or so.</li>
            <li> Since the smoke shop, along with others in the area do not stock these I hit AZ and guess what? Keeping the Stokkebye Danish Export nice and moist. Easy to use, just place in a cup of water (I use distilled-the tap water here is nasty) for a minute or so...let sit on a towel for a few minutes and it&#x27;s RTG.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, will make another purchase when these guys wear out. Whenever that is!</li>
            <li> I use little tupperware containers for my tobacco, and one of these will keep it perfectly moist for weeks. Make sure you soak them for at least 30 minutes and in a small container that only gets opened once a day or so, they&#x27;ll keep things humid for about a week in my use.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Great product.  Helps me roll that &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; store bought cigarette.</li>
            <li> I like how they&#x27;re simple and effective. Soak them in cool water for an hour, and they&#x27;ll keep tobacco moist for a week or more.</li>
            <li> These cool little buttons have really done the trick in terms of keeping things moist and not drying out. Cheap, easy, effective.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure how long to soak these for, or how long they are good for in a sealed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I soaked them overnight, and then threw them in my blend.  I have been out of town for a few weeks, so I am looking forward to opening the bag when I get home to see the state of my leaf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping these do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/21/14:  So, I have been out of town for about 5 weeks, came home, opened up my blend and it&#x27;s nice and moist.  I took out the moisture button and shook it, the disc on the inside moved around indicating that it was at least dryer than when I put it in.  So, I would say that these things have spared me from buying an oz. or two every time I come home.</li>
            <li> Got them, and all they did was make my tobacco stick to them, and they didn&#x27;t moisturize anything that they weren&#x27;t in contact with. They have dust from whatever is inside them to retain moisture, and you can taste it in your smoke. Bottom line: would not buy again/recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> These little buttons are great. Only had in my tobacco for a few hours. My tobacco taste much better. Even put one in my already rolled cig tin. I tried a humidity pouch, but didn&#x27;t really work. Love these buttons!</li>
            <li> I tried soaking the buttons overnight, and storing in various containers.  I didn&#x27;t feel like they worked at all. The leaves were dry and crispy.  Total ripoff.</li>
            <li> I was immediately disappointed upon opening the package, these buttons are clearly of a very low build quality and made with the cheapest possible materials. One of the five came apart the moment I picked it up and I suspect I could easily pull the other four in half given how soft and thin the metal cases are. All five buttons came with a sticky pad affixed to one side, which annoyed me as they blocked half of the vents in the cases and could not be removed without leaving a residue that made tobacco clog up one side of the button when I placed it in my pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are reasonably effective at their function but absolutely not worth the price given their flimsy construction.</li>
            <li> Keeps cigar and pipe tobacco nice and moist.</li>
            <li> Made a great stocking stuffer for my hubby.  These are perfect for the pipe smoker.  Five stars for this product!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the speed at which I received this and it works wonders for my pipe tobacco my initial order was not enough so I got 10 more of these handy humidifiers have never had to deal with dry tobacco since</li>
            <li> These are nice little pieces of smoking equipment, but the jury is still out on these. I&#x27;m not sure how well they work. At least they don&#x27;t kill tobacco like some other methods.</li>
            <li> These items work great. They were shipped and to my door very quickly (they are a small package.) You can use these for your pipe tobacco, a humidor, etc.</li>
            <li> this works great! I I got a few of these and they work very well and pretty quickly. I just let a few drops of water absorb into the button then I put it in jar with my herbal medicine and when I came back in the morning the herbs were fresh and easier to smoke (harder to grind though).</li>
            <li> These buttons are fantastic for keep your tobacco fresh and just the right amount of moisture in the pouch. No more to dry and crumbly tobacco for my husband. Easy to use, just soak in water for a few minutes, wipe the excess off the surface and put one in the pouch everyday. Always have them ready for him to use.</li>
            <li> The moisture pouch buttons seem to work as advertised. My tobacco seems to be staying fresh. I may have given a higher rating but there were no instructions included with the pouches. So I had to rely on info obtained from reviews on Amazon. Also, most people say that you need to check the pouches to ensure they don&#x27;t dry out, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to determine if they are dry. So I put them in water every couple days just to be sure.</li>
            <li> Keeps my pipe tobacco nice and moist in the jar. Makes sure my fixings are moist in my pocket. Give them a good rinse before using them to get rid of the ceramic dust that comes in the pouch</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> I recieved these and although they are small they work very well in my cotainer and keep my tobacco nice and moist. You do have to resoak them every few days but thats the same wit any humidifier you use;</li>
            <li> This produce keeps or re-hydrates your tobacco back to where it needs to be&lt;br /&gt;for either cigarets or pipe tobacco</li>
            <li> I like the Moisture Pouch Buttons so much that I purchased a second set. My smoke is as fresh as the day I opened the tin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every gadget, device, pouch, and weird humidity controllers on the market -- and this one is one of the few that actually works! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does go dry eventually, depending on how dry the leaf was to begin with, and how much leaf you put a moisture pouch into. My experience is that it takes a couple or even 3 of them to freshen up very dry leaf when you first put them in. And check them every couple days, because the leaf will soak up a huge amount of water if it&#x27;s really dry. But man o man, the quality of fresh, slightly moist leaf is so much better than those old \\&quot;toaster crumbs\\&quot; you may be used to. Once the leaf is fresh, one moisturizer is usually enough for a good bag. Factors to remember are: Check the water in the moisturizers and be sure to keep them filled. Also, if possible, go to a good drugstore and buy a gallon of demineralized water -- it has no impurities that could flavor or clog up the works. Let the moisturizer do it&#x27;s work -- it may take as long as a week to freshen the whole amount of dry leaf. So yeah, there is some maintenance on your part, but the result is very pleasing. I use them all the time -- they last forever. Here is a link in case you&#x27;re ready to buy them right now: [[ASIN:B00326GR9W Moisture Pouch Buttons for Fresh Tobacco]] Stay green and happy!</li>
            <li> I have only used 1 of the set of 5 to add humidity to tobacco bags.  Works great when the tobacco dries out.  It does not create too much humidity and does not &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;You have to wet them in cool water at least once a day. They seem to dry up fast.</li>
            <li> Great! They work so well I&#x27;ve been giving them out as presents.</li>
            <li> I usually have about five tins of tobacco at a time so I need something that would keep a little moisture in there.  These do the trick and they are very inexpensive.  You just have to check them since they really don&#x27;t retain moisture very good.  For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong and its nice to open my tin and find my tobacco still moist.  I have two that came that separate which isn&#x27;t a big deal since I have my tobacco in a can sitting flat but you might have a problem if you are using a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways this is a very decent product and I will continue to use till they no longer work since all you have to do is soak in water, dry it and put it in your stuff.  Good product and a great price.</li>
            <li> You get 5 of the moisture buttons when you order. Just drop into water to activate them, then drop into your tobabcco to keep it fresh and moist.</li>
