            <li>Great Prduct.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a way to hold a cochlear implant in place.</li>
            <li>So I ordered these because top stick is overpriced on Amazon, and they&#x27;re awesome!!</li>
            <li>Good buy anytime  </li>
            <li>Good hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I have just started wearing lace wigs and the mini tape is amazing.</li>
            <li>Also the amazing thing about the mini strips is that.</li>
            <li>Super sticky-much better than top stick and a perfect size.</li>
            <li>it works great peels right no problems at all</li>
            <li>I love these tapes.  </li>
            <li>Okay for holding doll wigs on hairless dolls.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>very satisfied and thanks for this follow......</li>
            <li>So they are free from oil.</li>
            <li>They hold securely and are reliable.  </li>
            <li>Great product for that extra hold</li>
            <li>They provide a secure hold and do not irritate her skin or hurt when she removes the wig (though she has no hair on her head to pull).</li>
            <li>I always used clips to secure the piece</li>
            <li>but now that my hairline is thin/nonexistent, I use this tape to secure the piece at the front.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and holds very well.and is easier to remove than most</li>
            <li>Tape is not the original.</li>
            <li>So far, these have offered the best adhesive option for daily wear.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they work great.</li>
            <li>The only thing you have to make sure your hands are clean and no oil on them.</li>
            <li>I really like these and hope they keep making them!</li>
            <li>This product works, for me, exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>They are small and good for use in corner areas.</li>
            <li>You can use the mini strip for the part that lifts and go another week with out re-applying the whole wig.     </li>
            <li>Sticks very well indeed.  </li>
            <li>fast mailing service.  </li>
            <li>and so I can&#x27;t really blame the rash on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside (reason for four stars and not five) is that in bright light the strips do shine enough that they are slightly detectable through the lace of the hair piece.</li>
            <li>Been able to use the same piece of tape multiple times.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to adhesives</li>
            <li>As good as what I was purchasing at my salon--only at less than half the price---</li>
            <li>We use these to keep my active 8-yr old daughter&#x27;s full wig on.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I developed a rash where the tape touched my skin.</li>
            <li>: If you have sensitive skin like me, I recommend looking for something hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Pro-Flex mini adhesive tapes, are great, easy to handle, you don&#x27;t have to size them and waste the product by cutting into smaller pieces.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I really have to say, if you&#x27;re not living in some remote area where these things can&#x27;t be bought, just go to the store.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it as much as other super tape, not very strong!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is the strongest double-stick tape, no more cutting into strips.  Does not irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li> the strongest tape out there</li>
            <li> So I ordered these because top stick is overpriced on Amazon, and they&#x27;re awesome!! Super sticky-much better than top stick and a perfect size. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As good as what I was purchasing at my salon--only at less than half the price---</li>
            <li> Tape is not the original.Does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that these strips were so small, they are holding so far for week.</li>
            <li> Pro-Flex mini adhesive tapes, are great, easy to handle, you don&#x27;t have to size them and waste the product by cutting into smaller pieces.  Good buy anytime  Thank you</li>
            <li> I give this product five stars. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have just started wearing lace wigs and the mini tape is amazing. I apply it around my hairline and it never lifts. The only thing you have to make sure your hands are clean and no oil on them. I wash my hands and then wipe them with alcohol. So they are free from oil. Then I apply my wig. With this process your application will last about 3-4 weeks. Also the amazing thing about the mini strips is that. If you wear the wig past 4 weeks and it lifts. You can use the mini strip for the part that lifts and go another week with out re-applying the whole wig.     Laticia Marie</li>
            <li> I love these tapes.  They hold securely and are reliable.  They are small and good for use in corner areas.</li>
            <li> it is what its made for perfect i will buy this product again it works great peels right no problems at all</li>
            <li> Stay away. Waste of dollars. Impossible to stay on. Does not stick to anything except the hair itself which is harmful.</li>
            <li> Okay for holding doll wigs on hairless dolls.</li>
            <li> Wish they were water proof.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it as much as other super tape, not very strong!</li>
            <li> Great product for that extra hold</li>
            <li> Holds well though if doing a lot exercise plan on changing weekly as some come undone. Overall I like the performance and ease of use</li>
            <li> Excelent, item was a expected</li>
            <li> I really like these and hope they keep making them!</li>
            <li> Great Prduct.  Sticks very well indeed.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The shipping service was excruciating. It took about 2 weeks for this to come into the mail. Hey, seller, you should try to get in on this Amazon Prime deal. Other than the painful shipping wait, the product is what&#x27;s advertised. The product is okay/neutral. I personally did not like using the tape, so I went and bought glue from the store. I know, failure upon my behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have to say, if you&#x27;re not living in some remote area where these things can&#x27;t be bought, just go to the store. Shipping took way longer than advertised.(first world problems)</li>
            <li> This product works, for me, exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and holds very well.and is easier to remove than most</li>
            <li> It works great as a way to hold a cochlear implant in place. Been able to use the same piece of tape multiple times. Only thing is some pieces last line than others</li>
            <li> We use these to keep my active 8-yr old daughter&#x27;s full wig on. We put one piece at the front and one at the back and remove each night. They provide a secure hold and do not irritate her skin or hurt when she removes the wig (though she has no hair on her head to pull). So far, these have offered the best adhesive option for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Did the job.  convenient paxkaging.  fast mailing service.  very satisfied and thanks for this follow......Jack</li>
            <li> I have Trichotillomania, and I have been wearing a human hair lace closure as a hairpiece for a while now. I always used clips to secure the piece but now that my hairline is thin/nonexistent, I use this tape to secure the piece at the front. There is only a slight odor, nothing detectable. The only downside (reason for four stars and not five) is that in bright light the strips do shine enough that they are slightly detectable through the lace of the hair piece. In addition, this is not the strongest tape I have found. LaceFx has a bit of a stronger hold. However, I use them for all day use, and then remove at night before bed. Often, I can use the strips for two days without replacing. They are easy to apply and remove. Remove them simply by pulling one end, and then the entire strip comes off in one piece. If you are on the fence, definitely order. I use three side by side for my hairline, and I clip the rest of the piece in. The only time they don&#x27;t hold like at all is while you&#x27;re sweating. If this is your only form of attachment for a piece, don&#x27;t go sweating up a storm in the gym, or find another form of attachment to use while working out. Other than that, they work great. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I developed a rash where the tape touched my skin. I am very sensitive to adhesives and so I can&#x27;t really blame the rash on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you have sensitive skin like me, I recommend looking for something hypoallergenic.</li>
