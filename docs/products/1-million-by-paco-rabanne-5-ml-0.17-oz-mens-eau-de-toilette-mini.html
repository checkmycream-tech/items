            <li>I went with my gut feeling that this cologne would be just right</li>

            <li>The size is small great for in the car if you wanna freshin up and cant stop home or if you just wanna see what its like.</li>
            <li>super fast delivery</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>I had purchased a larger size of this cologne and recieved many compliments from the ladies on it.  </li>
            <li>did not cover my expectations, to sweet  to be a masculine cologne in my opinion</li>
            <li>Smell nice but the size is not worth the prize.  </li>
            <li>Delivery fast.</li>
            <li>I would probably buy it at a much lower price</li>
            <li>Where&#x27;s the spicy musk undertone to tip the scales away from it coming across as a really feminine smell?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, small flask though</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying in smaller size.</li>
            <li>I have already bought four a d I normally do like men&#x27;s fragrances</li>
            <li>I bought this smaller size so when you hit the clubs, you can stay fresh for the ladies.</li>
            <li>The price is not cheap but it&#x27;s well worth the money, especially if you want that unique enchanting smell.  </li>
            <li>I was sold a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; marked not for retail sale.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a review that says that the ladies go wild over it.</li>
            <li>not a everyday wear.</li>
            <li>no regrets</li>

            <li> mean, really? ...</li>
            <li> Like all other colognes that do not last long on me.</li>
            <li> But I plan on buying a bigger bottle down the road.</li>
            <li> It looks bigger in the picture I should say, and also the box came like a little damaged.</li>
            <li> I wear a different cologne everyday so this is one I like to wear when I want to feel like a millionaire.</li>

            <li> the size was small, i will need the big jumbo size.</li>
            <li> the bottle is really small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time not believing that was not a misinterpretation, ...or maybe they were hungry for some vanilla-flavored cupcakes?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the tiny bottle, it has no spray nozzle so that makes it very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> hope i gets cheaper because its still way expensive</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for its size.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t&#x27; so expensive</li>
            <li> Ladies go crazy asking, &amp;#34;what are you wearing?!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wrong with it!</li>
            <li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> with a predominantly overpowering base of vanilla?</li>

            <li> tiny smell was a Lil off</li>
            <li> However, If you&#x27;re on a budget just by Cuba brand cologne Cuba royal. It smells just like this. I know, because I own both!</li>
            <li> my husband had been wanting to try this cologne. this was a nice way to try it without having to spend a fortune. both enjoy and now will purchase a full size.</li>
            <li> we purchased the little one for traveling - and it is truly a great smelling mens cologne which we&#x27;d read about then ordered a tester on - then this purchase.  Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is hypnotic. My boyfriend wears it all the time and i just love it on him. &#x3D;) thanks!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, small flask though, im gonna have to buy a bigger flask!&lt;br /&gt;I hope i gets cheaper because its still way expensive</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for its size.  Very disappointed with the tiny bottle, it has no spray nozzle so that makes it very hard to use.  For $20 dollars more, you can buy a 1.7 oz bottle and get the real thing.</li>

            <li> I wear a different cologne everyday so this is one I like to wear when I want to feel like a millionaire. LOl... Its just the right fragrance for guys.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this smells WONDERFUL. Wasn&#x27;t&#x27; so expensive an dad I could afford to buy larger size. It is definitely worth trying in smaller size. Warning-it is addictive. I have already bought four a d I normally do like men&#x27;s fragrances</li>
            <li> This is a great smell,ill buy this again,u only need two sprays &amp;your out the door,I told a lot of people about it.</li>
            <li> Delivery fast. Good product smells good</li>

            <li> Good stuff, but bottle is TINY/kinda pricey. But I plan on buying a bigger bottle down the road. I just wanted a tester, and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> I was sold a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; marked not for retail sale.</li>
            <li> A great unisex scent. My man OR I can wear this. Love the fragrance. The bottle is awesome too!</li>
            <li> Smell nice but the size is not worth the prize.  I would probably buy it at a much lower price</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell very nice, haven&#x27;t got chance to spray on but it&#x27;s does smell good!</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say about this product. Just going to fit in some extra words to be able to place the review.</li>
            <li> It looks bigger in the picture I should say, and also the box came like a little damaged. I bought this for my boyfriend. It looks cute, but it can be used like what? twice?</li>
            <li> Very nice product and they loved it!</li>
            <li> it smells great. it has a nice clean smell to it. the bottle is really small i recommend getting the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled a fragrance better than this! It has spicy &amp; sweet notes which makes it perfect for the winter season. This cologne lasts about 6-8 hours when I apply on my skin but overall it is a monster cologne. You can&#x27;t wrong with it!</li>
            <li> First off... super fast delivery so that&#x27;s why the three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars for the cologne. It smells good but is this for men?&lt;br /&gt;I mean, really? ...with a predominantly overpowering base of vanilla? Where&#x27;s the spicy musk undertone to tip the scales away from it coming across as a really feminine smell?&lt;br /&gt;Is it for man&#x27;s man or more for a, uh well... notsomanly man&#x27;s man? I&#x27;m not here to judge either of those preferences, but I swear that it reminds me of an ex-GF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a review that says that the ladies go wild over it. I&#x27;m having a hard time not believing that was not a misinterpretation, ...or maybe they were hungry for some vanilla-flavored cupcakes?&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s the key to this cologne... Smell like really sweet baked goodies and the ladies have no choice but to flock towards you, b/c who doesn&#x27;t like vanilla cupcakes?</li>
            <li> Non traditional man scent, but not girly either. Ladies go crazy asking, &amp;#34;what are you wearing?!&amp;#34; Its a really unique scent.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a larger size of this cologne and recieved many compliments from the ladies on it.  I bought this smaller size so when you hit the clubs, you can stay fresh for the ladies.</li>
            <li> this is the best cologne i have ever used unique scent long lasting would recommend to all guys that love women</li>
            <li> Like all other colognes that do not last long on me. But the smell is really nice. not a everyday wear. wish i could give 5 star</li>
            <li> I just received my order today and let me tell you I&#x27;m not dissappointed.  This cologne smells great, better than great, exceptional.  I finally found a cologne that smells awsome and I found it by Paco Rabanne, 1 Million.  The price is not cheap but it&#x27;s well worth the money, especially if you want that unique enchanting smell.  It&#x27;s not easy buying a cologne on the internet, especially when you are not able to smell them prior to making the choice and purchase.  I went with my gut feeling that this cologne would be just right and yes I was right.  I recommend you take the risk and go for it, you won&#x27;t be dissappointed in your purchase.</li>
            <li> He smells so good with it on,.. no regrets</li>
