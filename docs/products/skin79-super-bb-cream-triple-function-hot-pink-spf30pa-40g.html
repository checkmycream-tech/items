            <li>, I have been considering this product after figuring out that this BB cream would be best for me (affordability wise, and compatible with my skin type)</li>
            <li>When it comes out of the pump it looks a bit beige toned, but it blends beautifully into the skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the ease of using this product in the morning and how it had the perfect coverage.</li>
            <li>#34;your skin is so beautiful, what are you using?&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>

            <li>but both products are great.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s all I need for great coverage</li>
            <li>It covers great and you need</li>
            <li>but it is great for people who have redness on their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and agh I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>It feels great going on and does even out skin tone, however the color just did not work for me.  </li>

            <li>It covers great.  </li>

            <li>but this bb cream is so amazing!</li>
            <li>and I must say, this BB cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>This BB cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>And it feels amazing!</li>
            <li>Having read so many wonderful reviews, decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li>I wish everyone could try this and see how awesome it is! :)</li>
            <li>I can wear this by itself when I&#x27;m having a good skin day and when my skin isn&#x27;t so great, I just add a touch of concealer.</li>
            <li>Good price for a great product.</li>
            <li>Best foundation I ever used love it</li>
            <li>Love it, awesome seller.</li>
            <li>This was authentic and made my fair skin look flawless.  </li>
            <li>REAL REAL REAL!!!!</li>
            <li>The container is a beautiful pump that keeps the bb balm protected from bacteria and it pumps out slowly in a nice amount.</li>
            <li>I loved the sample.</li>
            <li>I loved BB cream, except for that.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t look good.  </li>
            <li>So keep in mind, if you have combination skin or otherwise, it&#x27;s just good to moisturize your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>but I mix it with my tinted moisturizer or foundation and Voila good to go.</li>
            <li>Received the BB Cream and loved the container it came in, but did not like the formula itself.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with some hyper pigmentation and acne scars.</li>
            <li>It is good but not compatible with my skin</li>
            <li>She loved it since it did what it said.</li>
            <li>It is good</li>
            <li>The color matches me well and my mom wanted to know what I was using on my face because it looked so good.</li>
            <li>I expect to purchase another BB product that does list ingredients, Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF42 PA+++, available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This worked fairly well for those minimalist days.</li>
            <li>My mom asked me about it because she noticed my skin looked really nice, and I had her try some, and she thought it was great, too, and she hates wearing make-up.</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The logo rubbed easitly off the container and the product remained fairly gray on my skin even after oxidizing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading all good reviews here.</li>
            <li>i have used missha M perfect BB cream in 23, and that one is my skin tone, so if you are a 23 in missha this will be a tad light, but going out at night it won&#x27;t be noticeable.</li>
            <li>This evened out my skin tone perfectly, but didn&#x27;t cover a zit on my chin or some light circles under my eyes, so I needed concealer.</li>
            <li>tone(this would not be good for darker skin),</li>
            <li>It looked good</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; and it was fairly pricey.  </li>
            <li>Price is a good company.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the product or just a good month for me</li>
            <li>Nongreasy good coverage.</li>
            <li>and this fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>product itself...is good.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for light to medium skin tones.</li>
            <li>I bought it after all the good reviews I read on here.  </li>
            <li>I loved this and used it for about two weeks...</li>
            <li>This is good for people with oily skin like me</li>
            <li>good, bought couple times</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Amount is good in this container.</li>
            <li>Should remove with a good cleanser, I use Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox Effect.  </li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a good BB cream because I wanted one from Korea</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth the money! :D</li>
            <li>Super awesome!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed by that because 1.</li>
            <li>Super excited!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It has great coverage and you don&#x27;t need more than a pump for you face.</li>
            <li>lol :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product before, it is great once blended on the skin:)</li>
            <li>The coverage is great; lighter than a foundation, but more coverage than a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very pleased with this seller.</li>
            <li>wonderfully, when I put it on it did have a grey look but within about 10 minutes it looked perfect, I&#x27;m stunned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall at the moment, I am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase :).  </li>
            <li>They sell truly authentic SKIN79 product&#x27;s for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So with a million good reviews and youtube videos I thought this would be amazing.</li>
            <li>I have a very fair completion, so I can&#x27;t say it would work as well for some one with a more golden skin tone, but for me it has been a great go to product.</li>
            <li>It has a very light feeling and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>All I do is dust a bit of powder on top and voila!  </li>
            <li>and i surely say it does wonders!</li>
            <li>I want my skin to be able to breathe!</li>
            <li>And the coverage for me personally is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>And the packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li>But I decided to trust my sender, pinkgelee, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did!</li>
            <li>I first tried the Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover Cream in 21.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I saw that someone said that user TOKTOK sells authentic products, and I can verify that they do!</li>

            <li>the sample was fine, got 3 great uses out of it, a lil does go along way.</li>
            <li>I must say that this product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The product is light, so you can&#x27;t feel it which is great.</li>
            <li>BB cream did amazing on my latina</li>

            <li>The fact that it has an SPF 25 sunscreen in it is also amazing.</li>

            <li>It evens out my skin color and gives a nice finish to my skin.</li>
            <li>Well....I really wasnt impressed.</li>
            <li>(I will be honest</li>
            <li>The consistency was nice though but just not for me.</li>
            <li>I was, and still am, thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice in between look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I need some kind of powder on mu face ..</li>
            <li>I decided to try it on my face, and I&#x27;m loving the feel of it</li>
            <li>It kind of got in the way.</li>
            <li>This came in so handy.</li>
            <li>It was also good, had maybe a better coverage</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream because it covers so nicely and gives a good shine to my cheeks and face.</li>
            <li>and it works really nice.  </li>

            <li>but this BB cream is a great makeup if you want to look natural yet polished and have your face feel incredible during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled that I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>but I still would not use this product on its own without foundation over it and a setting powder.</li>
            <li>I put it on and it has really nice coverage.</li>
            <li>she says its nice to her skin and asked me about where she could buy it.</li>
            <li>The sample blush is nice too, just sparingly.</li>
            <li>you want to buy this as an easy-apply sunscreen/moisturizer or something, it will be nice.</li>
            <li>And yes, the color seems off and kind of grayish, but it blends right into my skin tone (very fair skinned), and I never have to worry about the dreaded makeup line around my chin.  </li>
            <li>They also included 4 free samples which was very nice.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this BB cream on amazon since I&#x27;veheard many people can get fakes but this one was authentic and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to apply, just like a tinted moisturizer, and it makes my skin look nice and</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super smooth and flawless complexion.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good things about this, I love it!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and the skin looks bright after applying it.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very securely and safely, I liked that there was a mini sample of another product and</li>
            <li>The BB cream is light and yet covers fairly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;t light weight yet has good coverage, it smooths my skin and makes me look pore-less, and it mattifies my oily skin.</li>
            <li>The pay-off will be great, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how natural yet picture perfect the product turned out on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was fun and great to try out if it works for my skin.</li>
            <li>I do love the feel but not everyone in my office liked how it felt on.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best BB cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good size--it could easily fit in your purse</li>
            <li>Most importantly this product feels so nice on my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice quality, and the shipping was SO FAST!!</li>
            <li>If you have very fair skin and are looking for clean coverage that looks natural, this product is a great choice.</li>
            <li>How easy!</li>
            <li>I love love love B.B. Cream!</li>
            <li>love love love this product by skin79!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be buying more of this stuff, hopefully will be able to trade up my foundation! :-)</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>The cream is amazingly smooth and like lotion, and much thinner than Missha Perfect Cover Cream.  </li>
            <li>Even more surprising, it feels light and the sunscreen does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>like the packaging and the color of the BB cream is suitable for most people.</li>
            <li>The seller was great first of all.</li>
            <li>first couple of uses were as great as the sample...</li>
            <li>I found out about this product through my Korean friend and it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s as good as a medium to full coverage foundation</li>
            <li>This goes really well with her skin, gives her a clean flawless complexion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light, i don&#x27;t feel it caking on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to putting on some VERY LIGHT moisturizer on and allowing it to absorb before applying the BB cream.</li>
            <li>Does not look like makeup but makes me look very smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>The BB cream had good coverage and at first I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was good, quick, packaged well.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy to review this product with positive feedback, saying that it is indeed a legit product.</li>
            <li>Seoul Glamour included two free samples and a cute book mark in my package!</li>
            <li>Provides amazing coverage, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and blends wonderfully with any skin tone.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and light but with great coverage.</li>
            <li>Its a good product and the bottle is super cute.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to BB creams, this is a good start!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin looks very smooth and flawless, especially in photos :)</li>
            <li>Love it didn&#x27;t break my skin</li>
            <li>I like it with bronzer on top.  </li>
            <li>Lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an alternative to foundation, something more lightweight for the summer, so I decided to try BB cream.</li>
            <li>I am able to use it as a foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this BB Cream</li>
            <li>I just love those.</li>
            <li>I researched these some before buying and I am pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>As for the product, it was okay.  </li>
            <li>just okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>1st time to try BB cream and really love it with a dusting of finishing powder.</li>
            <li>Love it, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which a lot of products do.</li>
            <li>is the latest issue I&#x27;m dealing with)</li>
            <li>Obviously most of us don&#x27;t buy it because of the packaging but it is always a plus.</li>
            <li>but I am really pleased with the product</li>
            <li>I thought I was paying more cash for more product</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m not gonna lie</li>
            <li>Anyway, then it&#x27;s smooth and light feeling, no cake look, and it really just looks like I had superb skin to start with.  </li>
            <li>I really love the pump.  </li>
            <li>I might just buy a couple more to stock up. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my BB cream for a month now and my skin looks better than ever</li>
            <li>Well the  ox is authentic and it does ship from Korea</li>
            <li>I believe it was an authentic product.  </li>
            <li>However, I started noticing that it was making my skin break out and that I was having to use more and more of the product to cover up my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it is ok and it works</li>
            <li>But then again, I&#x27;m more in the warmer tone and have a lighter face than the rest of my body but have a tan complexion.  </li>
            <li>i would be ordering more and recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li>The BB cream is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>They sent a cute letter thanking customers, you know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it out fully tomorrow, but I can tell i&#x27;m going to love it.</li>
            <li>If I forget to put this on under my foundation I start over!! :)</li>
            <li>The item I recieved IS authentic, so if are worried about authenticity, I think you should just give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It feels okay, not oily or anything.  </li>
            <li>for the product itself, I love it.</li>
            <li>Good product and worth a try though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did my skin loves it</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite BB Cream, after using it for a month, my blemishes went away.</li>
            <li>They do not work as well as SKIN79 BB Cream. :)</li>
            <li>then i pumped some out and thought there is NO WAY my skin is going to be able to breathe through this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Even with shipping it is still cheaper than many store brands.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s authentic</li>
            <li>My favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to order more but have not received the product.</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>But, overall...I like it :) About 3 stars for now.</li>
            <li>Then I started mixing Mac foundation with a BB Cream from Garnier, which was ok</li>
            <li>I may update this review at a later time to elaborate on how well the product has done, but for now I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>(most helpful I&#x27;ve found is the review by Sugar Reviews on Wordpress) and also used RedLaser app the scan the barcode.</li>
            <li>I really love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I love using this on days</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be throw off when you get it by the color, it adapts to your skin tone, which is awesome because that means more people can use the same product.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>best formulation out of all the ones i see in American cosmetic lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all cakey or streaky, like I experience with most foundations.</li>
            <li>Have I mentioned I love this stuff?</li>
            <li>There were more than the said amount in the description.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat that! :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better for your skin than foundation.</li>
            <li>which most of the time bb creams do.</li>
            <li>also still put on a layer of moisturizer on top of this even if it does say that it&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>it looks to be authentic</li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>this bbcream is the best that I´ve trying before, I´m very white and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I really do love it.</li>
            <li>It provides medium coverage, some acne scars still visible but a LOT better than without.</li>
            <li>, it just makes me love my Skin79 so much more.</li>
            <li>I have to say Im really satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was not for sure if this bb cream was legit or not.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many combinations of products over the years; cream/liquid/powder/mineral foundation, foundation with primer/moisturizer/mattifying creams, etc.</li>
            <li>and it is better than any combination of products I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT: I read that blotting bb cream on will yield the most even look.</li>
            <li>Coverage was OK.</li>
            <li>: The seller is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>Some videos are better than others</li>
            <li>The seller is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I feel it works better than any almay, nutrogena,</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff and plan to reorder when I finish this jar.  </li>
            <li>better about putting something on my skin that is helping to make it better.</li>
            <li>it magically turns into your skin color.</li>
            <li>but I love wearing this.</li>
            <li>It controls the oil on my skin better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I picked this one and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It made my blotchy, red skin, even toned and flawless...</li>
            <li>So glad to see it&#x27;s eligible for Amazon Prime now,</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>..blends out perfect for my yellow under tones...</li>
            <li>mostly this, mascara and a bit of color on the lips</li>
            <li>the product is authentic.</li>
            <li>i will surely buy more products from them.</li>
            <li>Yaaaay! :)</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this BB cream a lot!</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s even</li>
            <li>I think that anyone who wants great looking skin should try this out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use.</li>
            <li>My favorite BB cream brand.  </li>
            <li>Smooth bb cream ever!</li>
            <li>It controls oil well and stays matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that many of my acne scars are fading in color.</li>
            <li>I will give more feedback as I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I also don&#x27;t ever use foundation or concealer.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone looked much better with this cream since it evens out my face.  </li>
            <li>My sister plans on trying Missha since they have more skin color</li>
            <li>I really love this BB CREAM because it  helps even out my skin tone before I apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>We both use and love this product which adjusts to match both our skin tones and have both noticed fewer breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It does not make me break out, which most products do.</li>
            <li>This is the genuine article!</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels and looks.</li>
            <li>and it was 100 % authentic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work for some,  </li>
            <li>: Whether or not this product is authentic, I have no idea, but my skin didn&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
            <li>while on and made my skin look better when off.  </li>
            <li>I looked more &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Has really cute packaging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to try BB creams but haven&#x27;t been impressed by American varieties.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it without any issues and find that it works best layered with a primer, then powder and finally the BB cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin any more oilier nor does it tend to fade or wipe off as I have to blot during the day.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best bb cream!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face look.</li>
            <li>I love it and it lasts all day for me.</li>
            <li>and i am glad.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the genuine product!</li>
            <li>It made my already glowing skin even better.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look and feel better even after taking it off.</li>
            <li>and I love its color and coverage.</li>
            <li>Cute packaging.  </li>
            <li>When I spray tan I add a squirt of a darker foundation to blend better with the tone.</li>
            <li>Many have tried, but nobody can imitate the perfection of this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I have been stopped on the street so many times (and this at age 50) with the question of what I use that I can&#x27;t ever think of changing.</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not too sure about</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this to anyone looking for a good foundation with good coverage, and something that&#x27;s overall good for the skin!</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the product, was really excited about the fact that it had sunscreen in it and might be an alternative to foundation on weekends.  </li>
            <li>Also It has a light to medium coverage, pretty great coverage for a bb cream.</li>
            <li>This bb cream is great in my opinion, it provides decent coverage without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>May be great for normal to oil skin.</li>
            <li>It covers imperfections pretty good, but my face looked like i just took a oil bath.</li>
            <li>well it took a good three or four pumps to get product out for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is pretty good considering.    </li>
            <li>I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t match my fair skin well, but it really does!</li>
            <li>But anyways, this is the first BB cream that I&#x27;ve tried since I heard a lot of good things about it.</li>
            <li>It provides a beautiful, natural finish that is neither too dewy or too matte.</li>
            <li>Also i wore it today and it really is great, matches my nc20-25 skin fine and seems to work on my oily combo skin really well.</li>
            <li>so I am glad it does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>A couple of ways you can tell is if the BB logo and the skin 79 logo rubs off easily, also there should be a sticker at the top.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how easy it is to apply, the color coverage.</li>
            <li>and I got it very quickly, along with the samples and a cute card thanking me.  </li>
            <li>However, how quickly it blends, depends on how warm your skin is at application.</li>
            <li>I have only tried 3 types of BB cream and this one seems to be the best fit for my oily/uneven skin.</li>
            <li>For coverage, I would say that it probably has light to sheer medium coverage, so if you want something that is between a tinted moisturizer and a foundation, than this is perfect!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have to set it with a powder, but since it doesn&#x27;t exactly match my perfect skin tone, I lightly dust some powder over my face.</li>
            <li>It works fine on me, but I would like something that has more coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this BB Cream for about 2 weeks now, and so far I have gotten great results.</li>
            <li>But, I can always use more, and pile it up on my face for a more flawless coverage, and it won&#x27;t feel heavy on my face, cakey, or anything.</li>
            <li>I have tried a wide range of creams designed for oily skin and this held up the best.</li>
            <li>BB Pink, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>Its like a one size fit most.</li>
            <li>The package came with two free samples and an adorable bookmark.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks great and it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>Pink Gelee has the original product!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for a month and so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve gotten more tan in the summer, it looks a tad light, but nevertheless it still works.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better BB creams readily available in the United States.  </li>
            <li>Lots of natural beneficial nutrients, and a great skin</li>
            <li>would really recommend this product if you are fair</li>
            <li>Its very thick/and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>It works very well for fair skin tones.</li>
            <li>I kept hearing about how if you really want a good BB cream, you need to get a Korean one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coverage is good and really conceals my sun spots</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pleasant surprise for a fair, sensitive skinned American over 40 to find a Korean BB cream is a great option!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works real well on my fairly tan</li>
            <li>specially who you buy it from!</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Interested in trying some more!</li>
            <li>, i dont even get that with full coverage foundation!</li>
            <li>This product is full coverage and DEFINITLY covers the fine lines on your face with an airbrushed look!</li>
            <li>I received this very quickly.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly and I did not have any problems with the seller.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I liked it better than any of the foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, but it didn&#x27;t blend very well to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I also suggest you order this from seoulglamour; I got this delivered very quickly considering it came from South Korea; it could have been delivered by May 13 and be on time, but it came today...</li>
            <li>If you break out easily it will be a hit-or-miss.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and blends well.  </li>
            <li>+ Easy to apply, non-greasy feeling</li>
            <li>Overall a great product :)</li>
            <li>I really love how this cream not only looks great, but I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that the SPF factor is a strong plus though.</li>
            <li>Thank you seoulglamour for an amazing experience and thank you for the incredibly fast shipping!</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I&#x27;d like to comment on how amazing seoulglamour is.</li>
            <li>It kind of feels like lotion before it dries when you first apply.  </li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone perfectly and diminishes my dark post acne marks.  </li>
            <li>first thing i did was to make sure it was authentic...</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying from a authentic website like pretty and cute or sasa.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with black heads, and this product helps me cover it perfectly.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a darker tinted moisturizer, and it does just fine.</li>
            <li>I have year-round dry skin that becomes incredibly parched during the winter.</li>
            <li>It goes on really easily and will stay on all day if I put a light lotion on underneath.</li>
            <li>I am caucasion with light skin but tan easily in the summer.</li>
            <li>Unlike Laura Mercier, they do not settle in the fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>and they both were fine.</li>
            <li>It has a super cute packaging &amp; I like the feeling of it on my face.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and oxidies quickly to my skin tone, it doesn&#x27;t create that cakey look either if you need more coverage.</li>
            <li>The coverage is adequate, and you can layer it on for more if you want.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream is also definately 100 percent authentic, and ships very fast from Korea!</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite :) would purchase again!</li>
            <li>I just add a bit of light blush after applying and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>packaging is very cute and highly \\&quot;spottable\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>so my review won&#x27;t be that accurate</li>
            <li>This is a huge component for me because 1) I have acne prone/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as a primer and overall maintains my skin oily free throughout the day.</li>
            <li>However, the color of this BB creme is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li>B.B. Cream has been such a great beauty product to have because it&#x27;s so versatile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and blends into your skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream does not feel heavy or oily - though it works better if your own skin is a bit oily/combination; using a good moisturizer before it is good for better application.&lt;br /&gt;Covers way better than a tinted moisturizer or at some parts of the face covers better than a concealer/foundation ( ...for me at least (: ).&lt;br /&gt;Conceals</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and even included a nice thank you note.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth investing into and trying it out. :)</li>
            <li>I was worried because I&#x27;m cheap and wanted to buy from amazon, but no fear!&lt;br /&gt;  2.)  </li>
            <li>Was a bit too light for my medium -tan complexion</li>
            <li>So if this is still too light for you, you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
            <li>but it feels as light as tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It also has amazing oil control so much</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied, and it was well worth the 20 day</li>
            <li>(: The seller (seoulglamour) included two free samples.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smooth out lines either.  </li>
            <li>how comfortable it is to wear.</li>
            <li>Nice finish and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>It was a fantastic item.</li>
            <li>Amazing value, the formula works really well if you have oily skin because it helps absorb some of the oil that collects during the day.</li>
            <li>It’s light and not cakey.</li>
            <li>If I had blemish FREE skin, this  would be my go-to with some blush for some color.   </li>
            <li>I did some research, and the product I got was definitely genuine which is something that I worried about.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this bb cream</li>
            <li>I was worried that this product would be too light for my skin -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo cheap compared to all of the brands it surpasses.</li>
            <li>Not as great as foundation, but on the same level as a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And did I mention it doesn&#x27;t look like I have a layer of foundation on...very important to</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is light and blends well, but the foundation aspect is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li>after hearing about how great this product is i finally purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be way too light for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Though the coverage is rather light, but it does even out your skin tone and covers any redness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to realize that this is still MAKEUP</li>
            <li>however I did not receive the free sample as shown I will continue to use this product to see if the results are as advertised</li>
            <li>I’m of Irish/German descent and have fairly light olive skin</li>
            <li>The containers that say “Wrinkle Free” are distributed by SKIN79 North America.</li>
            <li>but if you just give it a minute or 2, it blends smooth and will match to skin tone.</li>
            <li>It too light for my light-medium face</li>
            <li>The finish/texture this gives me is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think for the price it is a great product.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased from SeoulGlamour on Amazon and the product appears to be authentic and fresh (date of manufacture June 2012).</li>
            <li>shipping was free, and 2.</li>
            <li>The BB cream also has a light, flowery sort of fragrance.</li>
            <li>so I put Revlon Colorstay powder over it in Light</li>
            <li>I just received mine and after research, I deem it to be genuine.</li>
            <li>Its oil control makes it a comfortable wear in the summer.</li>
            <li>was that it&#x27;s a bit too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because I can add however much</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, never cracks or gets cakey, and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>indications of a genuine bottle:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>It also has SPF which is important to me.</li>
            <li>im very hapy that she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>Use alone for light coverage, with a concealer for medium.  </li>
            <li>The service was fantastic.</li>
            <li>) flowery smell like it should be, and smooth creamy texture and not chunky</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not too light</li>
            <li>It is perfect for light coverage everyday since I don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of make-up at work.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brand and this cream!</li>
            <li>It surprisingly looked natural on me.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, and I even received more samples than I expected.</li>
            <li>--I&#x27;m simply excited about the product as well as how quickly the seller shipped my items!)</li>
            <li>It has great staying power ( I live in a hot, humid climate) and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>First time my skin was fairly warm, and it blended in quickly.</li>
            <li>And I can gladly say as of right now</li>
            <li>The added benefits sound nice and may possibly be true but I have not seen a great change in my skin over the few times that I have worn them.</li>
            <li>Then I got a sample of Skin79 Triple Function pink label and loved it!  </li>
            <li>BB Triple Function Hot pink BB cream SPF25/PA++ 40g) seems genuine too, which is perfect!</li>
            <li>I really liked the all-in-one usefulness of this product, and I think it would be great for people who normally put on multiple products in the morning.</li>
            <li>but I think it looks pretty good, there isn&#x27;t too much difference between my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Covers up the skin really well and does a pretty good job at clearing some blemishes too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, Skin79 Hot Pink BB cream is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried a variety of Korean BB creams, including Missha, Heynature, Lioele, and Skinfood.)</li>
            <li>It really did live up to all my expectations and I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It was light and absorbed easily into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old with very fair skin with many red, brown and tan discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Amazon said it would arrive between March 23 and April 17, and I got it more than a week before the first date...</li>
            <li>but I was just really excited about getting this BB cream</li>
            <li>this was my first BB Cream ever purchased and it blends with my skin flawlessly, love it.</li>
            <li>but it takes mine no more than 15 minutes to oxidize and match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>original box and all.</li>
            <li>(original</li>
            <li>I use a bit of concealor on small spots and then fix with mineral powder and my skin looks a feels great!</li>
            <li>My makeup routine has significantly simplified with this product.</li>
            <li>So excited about this product.</li>
            <li>For the price it is really worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll always check for authenticity with every purchase, but with amazon backing everything I buy, I feel pretty safe.</li>
            <li>I am fair and this product worked fine with my skin tone, evening it out and making a mid coverage layer for makeup application.</li>
            <li>my skin looks great all day long and my makeup stays put through the day!</li>
            <li>My skin is fair and overall acne free.</li>
            <li>Gives the face coverage with a clean look.</li>
            <li>I watched YouTube videos, ready reviews, etc and decided to give the Pink bottle a try since it was the one that seemed to be best for Acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Also I think it looks a lot better and more natural during the day with the sunlight.</li>
            <li>This one is best for normal skin but can work for anyone as long as you set with powder.</li>
            <li>Powder and blush are applicable but optional; this cream looks very natural on its own.</li>
            <li>Feels great, looks great, and offers just the right amount of sunscreen (the highest you should typically go is 35 SPF, and this product is 25).</li>
            <li>But if you have oily skin like myself, I&#x27;m almost positive you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pale, and my daughter is olive, but it is perfect for both of us.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I ordered another right away from her.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my sister and on her first application you could quickly see a brighter more healthy/natural glow.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone is medium olive right now (I tan easily, and has just begun to lighten with coming of winter).</li>
            <li>Extremely relieved that it is the real thing and completely happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Favorite new foundation!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This goes on lightweight but has great coverage- dark spots, scars and fine lines and all.  </li>
            <li>The color is a little intimidating because it is so light, but it I found that blends nicely with your own skin color once it is massaged in to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product does appear grayish when first applied to skin, however after a few minutes, it oxidizes and matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>the Pink Label BB cream by Skin79 seems great.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, i was worried about fakes etc, and if you want to find out more about dif fakes there are a ton of youtubes out there to help you see the difference.</li>
            <li>used it all over my face and my most worry-some place is my T-zone which is very oily compared to the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Especially because I was told this product was good for combination skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good company to buy from.  </li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Sweet.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and did some online research, only to find that the date on the bottom is the date of manufacture and the product is good for three years from that date.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived way, way earlier than the anticipated date in good condition.</li>
            <li>Love the product, and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It also had the real deal authentic sticker on it as well, mine wasn&#x27;t a brand X rip off.</li>
            <li>Have tried it before in a sample pack that i ordered from a different seller and loved it</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this well over 3 times because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>it just looks natural on its own.</li>
            <li>I purchased this full size 40g from two sellers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and AUTHENTIC product.</li>
            <li>only recommend this product if you already have moderately good skin.</li>
            <li>I was VERY nervous about receiving an authentic cream after reading some of the horror stories</li>
            <li>this blends well and gives a nice natural look while treating skin.</li>
            <li>MY skin type: fair, acne prone, combination,&lt;br /&gt;Age: mid 20s</li>
            <li>It is definitely made for people with fair skin though.</li>
            <li>I knocked off one star because I wish it had controlled oil a bit better (I still had to powder) and really did nothing to help my purplish undereye circles.</li>
            <li>If you want medium to full coverage look for something else, use this primer or apply concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used professional quality makeup for years and this stuff has been a nice reprieve price wise.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>It has never broken me out, and if fact has made my skin look better over time.</li>
            <li>I love all BB Cream really</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>American brands are better described as tinted moisturizers at best, certainly not foundation coverage.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 18, but have always had prominent veins on my face), and I swear have had less break outs, acne wise.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that I feel the bottle does not smell as strong as the samples for some reason, and I really liked the smell of the sample.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t apply this to your face like foundation and you only need a very small amount applied in a patting motion, finish with a dash of mineral powder after its set and voila, gorgeous flawless skin for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I make sure there are not any marks that need touching up, I set with my bare minerals (fairly medium as I have pretty light skin and am red headed, so I want to cover freckles too) and then with the mineral veil.</li>
            <li>Other reviews said that the color was kind of greyish but oxidized to their skin color...which I didn&#x27;t believe could be true but it is!!  </li>
            <li>sister, on the other hand, wasn&#x27;t too happy with the skin79.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup, but this is really easy to apply, and I mainly like it because it&#x27;s easy to blend with fingers (unlike most liquid foundations).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike other sunscreens, this BB cream has a light, pleasant scent, and does not \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; the skin.</li>
            <li>I tried the drugstore brand (G_____) before this and while I liked the luminosity of it, it was greasy, orangey, smelled SUPER strong, and it would be absorbed into my pores and gross after ~4-6 hours.  </li>
            <li>The youtube video was MORE helpful, since it is the most recent.</li>
            <li>It had a date on the bottom of September 9, 2011, which I quickly assumed was an expiration date.  </li>
            <li>You can most definitely dust a translucent powder atop this BB Cream for a more matte look.</li>
            <li>The product (SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>shipping was quick considering it was from South Korea to North Carolina, US.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with my purchase and will continue to repurchase again in the future.  </li>
            <li>it oxidizes fairly quickly, but I just wish it doubled as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked through a whole lot of different BB creams before settling on this one, and it ended up being a great choice.</li>
            <li>Super+</li>
            <li>for Super+</li>
            <li>price is soooooo much better than most American BB creams (clinique, benefit, etc).</li>
            <li>When i received this product (which arrived really quickly)</li>
            <li>With Skin79&#x27;s Super+</li>
            <li>This BB cream leaves your skin super moisturized, glowing (NO GLITTER OR SHIMMER.</li>
            <li>I just applied SKIN 79 Super+</li>
            <li>It does appear gray coming out of the bottle but quickly adapts to my skin color (which has lighter and darker areas).</li>
            <li>Or if you have dry/combination skin I would suggest VIP Gold Super</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li>B004R5E12M SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on ordering a bb cream, I HIGHLY recommend this seller. :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all my friend and I love this product..</li>
            <li>am extremely pleased with both the seller and the product and highly recommend both.</li>
            <li>It also has a very natural appearance and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, so it didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing makeup at all!</li>
            <li>If you are anything other than light or fair, it will now work well for you.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t very sure if I would like it or not, especially because of my oily skin.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell and fits my skin tone pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two free samples, which I don&#x27;t really care for...but is a bonus!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very pleased to find that BB creams such as this one can accommodate the lightest of skins.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it isn&#x27;t oil free and that&#x27;s because the oils in this cream is part of the skincare component.</li>
            <li>The product comes out of the container a grayish color, however, within a few minutes it adjusted beautifully to my skin.</li>
            <li>Works with my pale, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing is that it&#x27;s authentic - or well, is a very fine replica (...which I doubt, haha).</li>
            <li>The hyper pigmentation is slightly less noticeable and the texture of the scars has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>And the product is super fresh Feb 2012.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Vurea and item came very quickly and is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I like the dispenser because it makes it really easy to measure how much you&#x27;re using, versus sticking your finger into a jar or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my pores were stretched out even more while using this cream, making them more visible.  </li>
            <li>I really like it though!!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed in a bb cream!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!  </li>
            <li>The best BB cream I have ever bought, I usually buy American BB creams and they never match my skin, I am very fair with pink undertones, and this jewel covers imperfections and it does not cake up, looks like I don&#x27;t have any makeup on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super flawless coverage, which is something I like because I like to go for the \\&quot;natural beauty\\</li>
            <li>While the color is a *little* too light for my skin, a tiny bit of my normal foundation on top blends it in perfectly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much at a time and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>This BB cream gives very good coverage, but keep in mind that that means it finishes quite thick and matte.</li>
            <li>Great packaging, the authenticity sticker was there, along with a few sample products (I&#x27;ve yet to try them).</li>
            <li>(I will be doing another review in my YouTube Channel: BeautyByRenata or Renataps88) in about a week but as soon as I opened the package I tested it on my hands and face, it feels really light and kinda of fresh and has a really really light scent (I am really sensitive for scents)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have oil control and the color, since there isn&#x27;t really a color to choose from, was too light for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light coverage, and it&#x27;s really to apply and use, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li>For now going Back to TooFaced nude glow as that gives nice and more natural skin tone, faded sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li>this is a great product for the price, my face feels healthier after using this product for a few days.</li>
            <li>After trying the Skin79 BB Cream Miniature Mini Kit, I picked the bright pink to purchase full-size.</li>
            <li>Like any make up, its a layer on top of your face, but this by far is the most natural looking cover I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and it was a success.</li>
            <li>made my skin soft, smooth and not oily or shiny at all  on top of that it blended in very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The fragrance for me is nice, something I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting on daily.</li>
            <li>it means its worth reading.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I then found out about Skin79&#x27;s brand... and how the pink label was good for people with combination skin (like mine).  </li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a foundation type of cream to try, then it&#x27;s definately worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I am keeping it till it comes in useful.</li>
            <li>It gives me a fresh, even look without appearing \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; with foundation.</li>
            <li>and I use it sometimes too on my more mature skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to believe the hype with this BB cream, but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>far, I have not been able to find a list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>The look is so natural, that I may have to start using this daily because it is great.</li>
            <li>I have a medium skin tone (Neutrogena 70, \\&quot;Fresh Beige,\\</li>
            <li>SIMPLY FRESH LOOKING, DEWY, SEMI-MATTE/SATIN SKIN).</li>
            <li>It evens out your skin tone and gives you a fresh look.</li>
            <li>My skin is freckled, fair, with pink tones.  </li>
            <li>One criticism I have is that I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s enough as a moisturizer on its own.</li>
            <li>Skin79 has incorporated many natural ingredients into this product.</li>
            <li>Seeing the price, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this on bare skin or after a full routine and it has great lasting power without clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li>It gives far better coverage than a tinted moisturizer, brightens and evens out skin tone, and has some oil control properties.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that Hot Pink is an amazing first BB cream, especially considering the great price.</li>
            <li>(I know the VIP Gold is known for being better for coverage) and more whitening on my skin, but I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These BB creams are best applied in thin layers.</li>
            <li>This is a solid product that produces good results keeping your skin clear and light.</li>
            <li>It is authentic as far as I can</li>
            <li>It is authentic as far as I can</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does look grayish when freshly applied but will adjust to your skin tone after five minutes or so.</li>
            <li>It sets well without having to use a powder on top of it (but if you want more coverage than it offers, feel free to use a powder with it obviously).</li>
            <li>means, it doesn&#x27;t make me more pale), but it feels like putting on a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands, but I really don&#x27;t see the need - the price is great</li>
            <li>Other then that, overall very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li>luckily, this stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I had good results starting with a small amount then patting on more in areas where I needed more coverage.</li>
            <li>but I feel very confident after researching how to tell a fake from an authentic that I received an authentic cream, from the box to the authenticity sticker, to the consistentancy of the cream</li>
            <li>Anyways, after concluding that the products were legitimate, I jumped right into application.</li>
            <li>And it never settles in to the right color for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right out of the dispenser.</li>
            <li>The color blends into my skin right away as well.</li>
            <li>and i put it right on.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I am skeptic about the review on here as to whether they are true or if the product will work the same for me.</li>
            <li>This was the first one I&#x27;ve tried, and 4-5 brands later, I still can&#x27;t reproduce some of the things I really liked about this cream.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and give high points to the seller who sent it quickly and was fast to respond to my inquiry.</li>
            <li>If you are new to BB creams or are just wanting something different, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>less is more :)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me on a full makeup day.</li>
            <li>Makeup Forever, Stila, Bare Minerals, Neutrogena, Bobbi Brown, Pur Minerals, Laura Mercier and Estee Lauder (as well as so many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years).</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin has generally gotten a lot better since I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the Skin79 Triple Function bb cream which barely gave me coverage and looked greasy/</li>
            <li>First off- the delivery and service of this seller was good: very prompt, I received my cream within just a few days of ordering, it arrived in good condition and there&#x27;s an authenticity seal on the back, so no worries about fakes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hispanic and my skin tone isn&#x27;t fair but nor is it dark, yet this doesn&#x27;t change the color or anything.</li>
            <li>The main issue with buying this BB cream is that its popularity resulted in a variety of Chinese knock-offs, some of which look very convincing.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned ordering, because it&#x27;s made for Asian skin tones and I&#x27;m practically albino, but it matches to my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is authentic BB cream and comes with a little sample of some more bb cream.</li>
            <li>best thing about this product is that I only use a little and it evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase and I cannot wait to see if it does actually reduce the appearance in dark spots as others have said they noticed!</li>
            <li>it smells good and its not oily on my face its really smooth and i look natural on it unlike other products.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look AND feel better, both instantly, and over-time as I wear it more, I will break out less and my skin just looks brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>Soooooo glad I came across this and will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li>Wow, that is incredibly fast shipping and the product is genuine!</li>
            <li>This is def worth the shot, since the price is similar to most comparable foundations.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I got a real one.</li>
            <li>I got it super fast</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair with cool undertones, and I have been frustrated for years that most makeup lines available in the U.S. don&#x27;t even carry a color light enough for my skin, and are predominantly yellow-toned.</li>
            <li>It make my face very clear and light.</li>
            <li>It is very naturally looking also light weight.</li>
            <li>Long-lasting and helps very much with evening your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I wasn&#x27;t surprise because it was very cheap.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel that it covered very much of anything on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A grey colored liquid, smells very strongly of sunscreen, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to my skin except make my makeup heavier</li>
            <li>I put a little powder on over it and am good to go.</li>
            <li>Well mine is real!</li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the future!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered my bottle and today is the first day I used it</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for almost a week, and I&#x27;m noticing more blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li>:) I will definitely be repurchasing, and stocking up!</li>
            <li>This is my first BB Cream</li>
            <li>Plus I apply my Studio Fix or Mineralize Skin Finish Natural (NC20 and Light Plus) over with a kabuki blush and it evens out everything.</li>
            <li>I started to buy the smaller trial size because its cheaper and you get more products for just a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>it matches mine pretty close, and I no longer have the sticky feeling you feel when first applying.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you test not on your face at first (obviously)</li>
            <li>so 10 business days is pretty</li>
            <li>First off if you receive a BB cream from seoulglamour check</li>
            <li>considering it was coming straight from Korea!</li>
            <li>i would like to give credit to the seller of this bb cream because it is authentic and they totally gained my trust.</li>
            <li>(I was pretty sure everyone knew how big that was.)</li>
            <li>My friend send me this product from Korea and I bought this one here to use for the first time....</li>
            <li>garnier bb cream thanks!  </li>
            <li>It feels like I didn&#x27;t really put anything on my face at all!</li>
            <li>I really hope you found this review helpful!</li>
            <li>I really liked the pink packaging, bubble wrap, and there were even two samples included.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much SeoulGlamour!</li>
            <li>All the free gifts promised were properly enclosed and the ordered product nicely packets with personal notes.</li>
            <li>The fact that this is my first review ever....</li>
            <li>I think it is pretty versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels more \\&quot;free\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t actually feel like I&#x27;m wearing any make up.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty oily and I thought - this product is for me ..</li>
            <li>First of allit is oily andheavy on the face - the rest are details for me but .. promissed color on the face</li>
            <li>bb triple function not gonna last 3 hours thats for sure</li>
            <li>I was iffy about the product being an authentic skin79 product, but it came with the authenticity label and was properly sealed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using, doesn&#x27;t seem to offer more.</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I first learned of the product by a friend who let me try hers.</li>
            <li>This cream stays on my face through most of my 10-hour workday, which I definitely appreciate!  </li>
            <li>All in all, I love this product and definitely would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and have re-ordered more.</li>
            <li>so I have olive skin but get pretty tan during the summer.</li>
            <li>At first, I was worried because I thought the color didn&#x27;t match me, but after about 5 minutes it started to get closer to my skin color.</li>
            <li>I find that when I reapply makeup later in the day/night the bb cream looks even better, don&#x27;t know exactly what that means</li>
            <li>a first</li>
            <li>It lasts whole day and i still feel fresh.</li>
            <li>the gold is easier to apply in my opinion, at first the gold seemed warmer</li>
            <li>a product actually make my skin tone look more even.</li>
            <li>Try the sample pack first if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
            <li>Thanks, SeoulGlamour!</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to assure anyone considering purchasing this</li>
            <li>&#x3D;*)</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it looks grayish.</li>
            <li>first BB here</li>
            <li>All the hype about BB creams and I needed to know if it was really a miracle product!</li>
            <li>the coverage is exactly where you want it that way.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first bb cream I tried was smashbox</li>
            <li>OK now to the full size hot pink...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, and it is my first time with this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>The graying effect is there, but not terribly noticeable; especially after I do my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the VIP gold sample first just to see what a BB cream was like</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using any type of bb cream.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried the bb cream, I used moisturizer</li>
            <li>Next day, I used it without moisturizer and it was much better for me.  </li>
            <li>I really love it and definitely plan on repurchasing either this one or the Gold one next time. :-))</li>
            <li>I like it because he is gently and fresh my face skin when i go my work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, even though I&#x27;ve watched a bunch of youtube videos and read a bunch of product reviews, I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after hearing all the buzz on BB creams, and that Asian versions are better then the ones you can buy here in the U.S.</li>
            <li>First time user</li>
            <li>so was reluctant to try at first.  </li>
            <li>of now at first impression</li>
            <li>it looked ashy at first, but the BB cream blended into my skin tone.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time BB cream buyer, then I suggest you give this one a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I have tried</li>
            <li>Its not a fake.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what it was supposed to be</li>
            <li>Good coverage, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the four bb cream sample set and from that, selected the Super+ Hot Pink bb cream as my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was scared of getting scammed, the price seemed too good to be true, but it&#x27;s surely not!</li>
            <li>Might be good if you want lighten out your skin tone, but I&#x27;m already pale and I don&#x27;t want to look any paler.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using this as a standalone product because the color is very light almost greyish when applied, however it does oxidize and change to a more normal color after a few mins</li>
            <li>Super+ is targated as &amp;#34;all normal skin, SPF protection, whitening feature, sebum control, and wrinkle improvement&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Even though it oxidizes to fit your true skin color, it&#x27;s still a little to light for tanner skin.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It covers great, does look a little gray when it first goes on, but once it&#x27;s blended it looks like my natural skin tone (</li>
            <li>This is my first B.B Cream and I must say what a positive surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I received my hot pink BB cream from Seoulglamour today, and I&#x27;m super excited!</li>
            <li>can apply this with your fingers, but I use a dense flat top brush for a fuller coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the cream is less watery than other bb creams (compared to missha&#x27;s perfect cover blahblah bb cream)</li>
            <li>As you may know, a big issue with buying such products is authenticity - I am pleased to say I received the genuine product :) (&amp;#34;Sold by Constant Connection and Fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;) Received sample, as advertised, but have yet to try.</li>
            <li>but whenever I get this from a new seller, I always subject the packaging to intense scrutiny to make sure it&#x27;s an authentic product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute and pink, there was much bubble wrap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, you can use more for problem areas that are more difficult to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i thought wow nice big bottle</li>
            <li>Good product, it&#x27;s my 3rd bottle, well, the 2nd one was a gift to my cousin who also loves it.  </li>
            <li>Intense Classic or Super Perfection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to wear this BB cream without moisturizer and with only applying loose powder over top.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I now use some jojoba or coconut oil with a good moisturizer with this, and I have a good feeling that the excessive moisture will not be necessary for me in the summer.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a foundation alternative for cosplay and special occasions, because I always break out with foundation and have sensitive skin, but you know, I might just use it forever.  </li>
            <li>I thought the color would be too light and the coverage too sheer, but this turns out just right.  </li>
            <li>ordered this because of all the positive review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear even under the Boston dry winter weathers.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin on my cheeks, so I apply a very light moisturizer to those areas under the BB</li>
            <li>, the shipping was pretty fast from Korea, I ordered it on March 11,2012 (Sunday) and it arrive March 23,2012 (Friday).</li>
            <li>My skin gets pretty oily during the day, so it&#x27;s really all I need in the morning after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>of the first things that catches anyone&#x27;s attention is the adorable dispenser that the Hot Pink BB creams in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light--it has the consistency of lotion and doesn&#x27;t do much to cover blemishes or anything.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look more dry than without it.  </li>
            <li>So if you have dry skin, I&#x27;d recommend to just use a heavier moisturizer underneath (perhaps one for night time) and it will will work- better than any tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This particular company has so many to choose from that it took literally days to decide on which one was for me, especially since I had never used a BB cream before and didn&#x27;t know that much about them or this company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink is definitely more of a tinted moisturizer than a replacement for foundation.</li>
            <li>Feels super soft.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly re-purchase this</li>
            <li>I have large pores on and around my nose and every liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried makes me break out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Another thing I love is that it only took 8 days to send it here in New York.</li>
            <li>the grey undertone sometimes complained about, interior bottle removes easily from outer pink shell containing the appropriately raised and reflective lettering, appropriate hole opening at the dispenser, and shell shaped tab on top.</li>
            <li>I rarely feel compelled to write a product review, however, I simply had to do so concerning the Skin 79 Super+</li>
            <li>skin tone is fairly even, but very sensitive and prone to redness in a few areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to lose my summer tan, so the balm color was fine.</li>
            <li>This BB cream blended very well and is neutral and sheer enough that it could work with most light to medium skin tones, and for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>I know who have tested it is pretty decent,</li>
            <li>This product matches my skin tone pretty well and provides decent coverage for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pale (my shade is porcelain in most foundations and concealers)</li>
            <li>Goes on really light with almost a weird green tint but quickly evens out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>All you need is a little bit of this and some powder for an amazing look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I was a little hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;ve heard of people receiving fakes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and leaves my skin looking dewy and really pretty!</li>
            <li>/&gt;so far, KATIE THE BABE seller is legit (to the extent of my knowledge) and you also get a pretty large amount of sample creams!</li>
            <li>so I spent about a week researching before I settled on this particular BB cream as it seemed good for normal to oily skin as well as sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>and she said that she has received more positive feedback regarding this product than any other.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again but not for some time as the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Deliver fast.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to this pink BB cream until I find another one that works better.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase skin 79 pink bb cream.</li>
            <li>it saves sooo much time in the mornings as it acts as your moisturizer, primer, and foundation.</li>
            <li>Really Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am really picky with my foundations, tinted moistorizers and etc.</li>
            <li>but REALLY</li>
            <li>then it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase a BB Cream because I am really focused on improving my skin and this BB Cream has Wrinkle Improvement, SPF 25, works as a moisturizer, sebum control and whitening</li>
            <li>really Hope this review is helpful for you</li>
            <li>I was also very worried if it would be a legitimate product.  </li>
            <li>really does seem like a keeper miracle product to me.  </li>
            <li>I was very worried about the authenticity of this cream and reading horror stories of people getting fakes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>seller, seoulglamour, ships the real deal.</li>
            <li>Real vs. Fake\\&quot; to confirm the authenticity.</li>
            <li>It is real.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>Shipping for this was also incredibly fast in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and delivery, and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>i would break out one pimple if i didn&#x27;t wash my face after wearing foundation for 4 hours straight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much blemishes to cover tho, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much for coverage.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenses a bit too much product for me.</li>
            <li>Whenever I put on foundation or tinted moisturizer, I always end up looking either very orange, or ghost like because I can never find a share that matches my skin.  </li>
            <li>The color is much lighter than what I thought but after applying powder, it blends well.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer than it</li>
            <li>cream looks very gray when dispensed</li>
            <li>It arrived in about 1 1/2 weeks in a cute pink package</li>
            <li>I had the travel size, so there wasn&#x27;t much.    </li>
            <li>I didnt use it very often.</li>
            <li>I was really needing a bb cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to order from Pink Gelee.  </li>
            <li>The bottle from Pink Gelee comes in an authentic box.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, if your bottle does not have a sticker, it is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and have light skin already.  </li>
            <li>The BB Cream doesn&#x27;t seem to cover up much at all.  </li>
            <li>I was very hestitant on purchasing on amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to get a dupe.</li>
            <li>It just looks neat, fresh, and natural without setting with powder.</li>
            <li>coverage is nothing to rave about, and I don&#x27;t really like the consistency of the product</li>
            <li>The real skin79 brand will have a sticker of authenticity on the foundation bottle.</li>
            <li>Unborn babies, infants, and children are especially sensitive to the effects of mercury and lead.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much since I have been using this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light coverage but gives you that extra brightening glowing quality on your face.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY evens out my skin tone (which is really what &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal and made it all the way from Hong Kong within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed.</li>
            <li>It feels lightweight and breathable when applied and stays on really well even without a primer.</li>
            <li>It also blended very well despite my inexperience in how to &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li>If you are really tan, it might not work without some bronzer.</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t need too much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, this is my 3rd bottle!</li>
            <li>That being said, I can see how this would work really well on oily/acne-prone</li>
            <li>I dont know how much of the product is</li>
            <li>but I had that cream so much</li>
            <li>and it feels much lighter than a foundation on my skin.</li>
            <li>I looked up videos, and searched on how to know if your bb cream was indeed real.</li>
            <li>It is completely real.</li>
            <li>bb cream cream is really gentile on your skin.</li>
            <li>: I have a medium skin tone, more olive/yellow than pink.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin that was being exacerbated by mineral makeup</li>
            <li>: I waited a whole month before writing this review so that I could comment on how my skin reacts to it over time.</li>
            <li>, I literally go a whole day without applying additional powder.</li>
            <li>The VIP Gold sample also worked very well</li>
            <li>Also really grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came on time, it was the real thing</li>
            <li>If you have light skin, this will only make you look paler when applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is my first day wearing it, I will be sure to update after my trip in a few weeks to share how it held up in hot weather.</li>
            <li>This went on smoothly over my regular skin are regimen.  </li>
            <li>They got the same look, it looked too light for them and it should not have been.  </li>
            <li>My sister uses this product  more than I do, I always get the gold not the pink.</li>
            <li>Still I would have much preferred receiving the real product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a before, but there is one close up of my face where you can really see my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need too much coverage and</li>
            <li>-The seller(neverprice) has the real product</li>
            <li>I have a very oily t-zone, and combination skin</li>
            <li>I figure if you&#x27;re gonna spend the money, buy it from a place that&#x27;s guaranteeing the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This product worked really well on me.</li>
            <li>But after my skin cleared up from acne, I didn&#x27;t need as much coverage</li>
            <li>This product does have a very gray effect on my skin if I over-apply.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from Pink Gelee and yes, it is authentic.  </li>
            <li>I really like it for my eyes as well.  </li>
            <li>I think she wants that lighter-white powder finish</li>
            <li>and I found that this product made me look very skinny.</li>
            <li>and it was real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy and leaves my skin nourished without being too shiny.</li>
            <li>purchasing this product, I was very concerned about its authenticity, as this 40g bottle was much cheaper on Amazon than on Skin79&#x27;s official website.</li>
            <li>If you want a BB cream to act like a foundation you really need to consider South Korean brands.</li>
            <li>Also, when it starts running out, you can get the tube out of the pink outer casing, twist the top off and scoop out the remaining cream.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry this is the real BB</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is really greyish but it blends with your skin color well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was much quicker than I had anticipated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy it</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>This lasts all day and is reasonably price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very oily but this keeps me from getting shiny.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much.</li>
            <li>and I really like how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s is the real thing.</li>
            <li>the only complaint I have is that I didn&#x27;t get a gold sample I got a sample of the bb cleanser, but I did use that and liked it so that&#x27;s ok , though I wanted to try the gold one to see if its better than the pink.</li>
            <li>Skin79 seemed to stand above most in ratings for sensitive skin types and in decreasing the appearance of post acne scarring.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice dewy, polished look without looking greasy, and works for several different skin types and tones.  </li>
            <li>The cream itself is pretty thick for me, but I LOVE the product!</li>
            <li>It does smell good compared to other American BB cream however.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s authentic based on other&#x27;s review on YouTube.</li>
            <li>The texture of both BB creams to me was somewhere between a rich tinted moisturizer and sunscreen without the gross oily feeling.</li>
            <li>While most other signs of authenticity are here, there is no corresponding expiration date/manufacture number on the bottom of</li>
            <li>/&gt;She on the other hand loves it (she has more oily skin than I do)</li>
            <li>I have stayed away from some other sellers whose products do appear to differ from what should be authentic, and sell at lower prices.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend this to dark or even tan skin tones because it is a very light color.</li>
            <li>I am Mexican, Sicilian and French with light medium skin (I wear fairly medium in the Bare Essentials line) and it turned my skin grey.  </li>
            <li>but so far this product works fine for me now just that it is a little too light for me unlike the one my friend sent to me</li>
            <li>Everyone was so surprised and copied down the name so they can get their own.</li>
            <li>it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much, but for my occasional red spots and blackheads it does just fine!</li>
            <li>oddly enough I do like the Garnier roll on undereye concealer or the Revlon Photo Ready concealer over the Mac concealer which looks a little too bright and unnatural).</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a darker colored foundation and it fit my color a little better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really love this product because it makes my face appear less oily throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li>I just got this super fast only took 2 weeks maybe to get here to the States.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the VIP Gold BB Cream to those of you who have more mature or dry skin.</li>
            <li>i think, if my mind isn&#x27;t playing tricks on me, there is a slight scent like perfume, very light, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>looks grey on my skin , I am light olive .</li>
            <li>and I look naturally beautiful instead of fake and over done.</li>
            <li>I want full coverage in a foundation, but nothing that looks cakey or powdery and definitely nothing that makes my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, if I use it as concealer on days when I don&#x27;t want to wear full makeup, it doesn&#x27;t look obviously spotty on my face.</li>
            <li>A full pump isn&#x27;t necessary, in my opinion, and would be wasting product.</li>
            <li>I am mixed race (Korean and white) in my mid-20&#x27;s with naturally oily skin while my best friend is a very white German/Irish girl in her 30&#x27;s with combination skin that can get dry in places.  </li>
            <li>This is good for someone who has clear skin and wants to have light coverage witih SPF and correct slight uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Less than one full pump from the bottle is more than enough for me!</li>
            <li>I can not feel or see any evidence of it having been applied aside from the evened skin tone and most blemishes hidden.</li>
            <li>(more color for summer because I tan, less in winter because I get lighter).</li>
            <li>(both spots became slightly darker and more gray after sitting in a drawer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(both spots became slightly darker and more gray after sitting in a drawer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My main channel (renataps88) is in portuguese</li>
            <li>Just super excited to get this cream for half the price!</li>
            <li>I have been receiving a lot of compliments because my skin looks so natural and smooth even when I&#x27;m not wearing the BB cream, so it definitely works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover acne 100% but does a decent job.</li>
            <li>It does cost more than my current foundation, so I will probably just stick with Revlon in the future.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts when I purchased this product, as there&#x27;s a lot of brew-ha-ha surrounding this particular company&#x27;s BB creams.</li>
            <li>I think the concept of having make-up and skincare in one is a clever idea.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t give up on BB creams, I still think they are a clever concept.</li>
            <li>I will not be able to use this product alone for complete coverage at this point but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li>but it seems to do a decent job of adjusting.</li>
            <li>For only 10 dollars and free shipping, I got a 40 dollar BB cream and a cute little card with a sample!</li>
            <li>This color is a little too light for me right now.</li>
            <li>(super awesome, there&#x27;s at least 5-6 samples in this little ziploc bag that comes with the hot pink bb cream!!!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went on very pale on my medium toned skin, however after blending it really adapts to your natural skin tone and the end result is a really clear, bright looking skin tone.</li>
            <li>This goes on a little chalky, but as it warms up to your skin temp, it is perfect and it only takes just a little pump or two to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this no matter if your skin is clear or imperfect!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a Hot pink BB cream from the seller seoulglamour who claimed that it was authentic.</li>
            <li>Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus BB Cream Triple Functions 40g + Missha Sample [Misc.]]]</li>
            <li>As for the seller, seoulglamour, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing from Seoulglamour.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but the coloring was just not for me.  </li>
            <li>Made of high quality ingredients</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I am so excited with the packaging, it is so cute, the bottle is really small, I was expecting to be the size of a pop can and its the same height as my MAC Studio Fix foundation</li>
            <li>All I use is a little mineral powder on top of it</li>
            <li>I thought I was just adding a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>As for the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; (which others assure me does not mean &#x27;bleaching&#x27;)</li>
            <li>After MUCH research on products I found that a BB cream was the way I wanted to go, and after even more research I found that for sensitive skin all directions pointed to an Asian or Korean BB cream rather than the new American creams.</li>
            <li>BB Cream to the large end of my foundation brush and began to apply from the inside (closer to my nose) first to the outside (towards my ears)..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on any effects it has on improving your skin, but I enjoy the coverage and the SPF factor is good, and will go a long way as only a tiny bit of product is needed for quite a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I am around a natural to medium beige and it blends in very well.</li>
            <li>I has not broken me out so far either.</li>
            <li>Purchased this after much research online for something my daughter could wear with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>everyone ask me my face it so soft and lightly thanks</li>
            <li>It has a very matte finish and my face feels really soft and velvety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>PA++ 40g (Autheticity Label &amp; Perforations with Free VIP Gold Sample!!!)]]&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product through Pink Gelee via Amazon.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t really improved anything, so for now it&#x27;s 4/5.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this tinted moisturizer and it causes my face to break out in places I normally don&#x27;t have acne.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ll mention a few more things.</li>
            <li>Actually I don&#x27;t use it that much, but whenever I do, it never fails to satisfy me.</li>
            <li>normal skin w/ oily T-zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use that but decided to try from this company \\&quot;Seoul</li>
            <li>Glamour\\&quot; NEVER AGAIN, don&#x27;t waste your money, if you order the cream you&#x27;re better off gettin from another seller</li>
            <li>It has a dewy finish and i have normal skin so by the end of the day my skin does tend to look a bit shiny.</li>
            <li>The container is generously sized to last A LONG TIME which I love.</li>
            <li>I of course remove it at night before my normal skin routine, but I can wear this every day with no skin problems.</li>
            <li>So disappointed since it really did make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>than I normally do.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great skin care product to begin with for girls in their late teens or early to mid 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is it is better than that heavy chunky garnier bb cream.</li>
            <li>As of right now, I wake up with smaller and fewer new acne, when before I was waking up to new pimples that were pretty large and in charge on almost a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this BB cream, it&#x27;s has much more coverage than my previous one (Garnier) and actually comes out a bit like a clay mask.</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or dry), the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m actually wearing anything on my face, but still makes it look so much better.  </li>
            <li>This product does an amazing job with a small bit of concealer for under eye circles and im out the door!</li>
            <li>(There were even two free samples, one of the same pink one and one of the VIP Gold version.)After watching comparison videos of the real and fake product, I was so happy to find that it was the real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with it covering dark under eye circles, pores or small blemishes, and my skin is really getting better and more clear with every use.</li>
            <li>Super thick, a little goes a long way, great coverage and does a really good job toning down the different colors on the face and evening out skiing tone.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but compared to the drugstore bb creams I&#x27;ve tried, this is hands down the best one so far.</li>
            <li>makeup.&amp;#34; For the first hour or so after application, upon closer look, it appeared slightly cakey, but this quickly disappeared and now I feel like there is nothing on my face.</li>
            <li>Plus, this was all I ordered, and got 3 free samples, two of them Missha, the other the vip gold Skin79.  </li>
            <li>Minimal coverage, takes significant layering to cover flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It is new afterall,so just be patient.  </li>
            <li>I live in Texas</li>
            <li>Their product isn&#x27;t worth it, the package was off, the product was way to bright and dry, what a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li>But then again, it arrives so quickly that I wouldn&#x27;t be without this BB cream for very long.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product because, as a fellow Asian with a lighter skin complexion, this product really brightens up my face and evens out the skin tone.</li>
            <li>(Speaking of that, there are a few \\&quot;Real vs Fake\\&quot; BB cream videos available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also true that when you first apply this coverage, it looks a bit greyish but that fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Have not tried dept store US BB creams yet, but likely will not if the Asian products are available</li>
            <li>The last two sellers I&#x27;ve bought from (SeoulGlamour and Pink Gelee) both had 100% authentic products.</li>
            <li>First off Hot Pink</li>
            <li>The product is fairly thick (which is probably why it has such good coverage)</li>
            <li>its thick and even on my fair skin looks ghostly white.</li>
            <li>However, do not expect major coverage without using so much that it makes you greasy or break out.</li>
            <li>I have very clear skin</li>
            <li>It makes the skin look very natural and blends into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have only started using this product but seems very promising</li>
            <li>Just to clear up a misnomer, the only difference between Hot Pink Skin79 pump containers that contain the wording “Wrinkle Free” or “Wrinkle Improvement” are, those that say “Wrinkle Improvement” are manufactured by Wizcoz Co., the makers of SKIN79 in South Korea.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin)  </li>
            <li>It feels very natural on the skin, and is everything that I heard about this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am recovering from a severe allergic reaction to another cosmetic.</li>
            <li>only warning I have is that a full pump of this product is more than enough for three heavy applications.</li>
            <li>It smooths on nicely (a little goes a long way) and has higher coverage than many bb creams out there.  </li>
            <li>and I think because of the light grey tone that it will look better if you have a pink undertone opposed to my yellow undertone but for me the light grey tone is not a huge deal and doesn&#x27;t look so evident.</li>
            <li>I bought this from seoulglamor and it&#x27;s definitely the real product!</li>
            <li>This is the second bb cream brand that I&#x27;m using (my first was Dr Jart water fuse bb cream), and although skin 79 gives better coverage, I&#x27;m not sure if it helped with my oily skin(which</li>
            <li>wow, this ended up a lot longer than I intended!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for in BB Creams after researching various ones.</li>
            <li>it is hot outside</li>
            <li>it just wasent a pretty color against my skin.(im med white w/freckles)So it should have worked from my understanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several people and anyone interested in this product should purchase it.</li>
            <li>balm is the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually minimizes the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>Overall it did exactly what I was looking for which was something to conceal redness and create a smoother/even looking skin surface.</li>
            <li>No one has ever said, Wow!</li>
            <li>No one has ever said, Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely purchasing more bb cream and other products from this seller..</li>
            <li>I just received this today and first thing I did was try it on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>Definitely might feel a little like a sunscreen when your rubbing it on your face, and the color may seem initially a little ashy, but when the product meets your face, the warmth and pigments of the BB simply melt into your skin and the color matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this even more than my expensive MAC studio fix fluid.</li>
            <li>The product is pale upon first application but adjusted to my skin tone quickly.</li>
            <li>I usually blot it on, lightly over my whole face</li>
            <li>so I typically use a light moisturizer under it.</li>
            <li>stuff is pretty much what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to unbox the babies in fear of getting shipped a fraud, but with all the research and videos I&#x27;ve watched to educate myself on what a real skin79 pink label and vip gold edition should look like I had no trouble coming to the conclusion that both these products were the real deal!</li>
            <li>so I took it to work and let some of my less tan (more white) friends try it.</li>
            <li>so it more or less matched my skin (yellow undertones and all!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big make-up person, but Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB cream hit the right nerve.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to wear this all day long without breakouts, sweating it off, or any other issues.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need a large amount to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smoothly and can be a little greasy after wearing all day.</li>
            <li>My face is naturally a little whiter than my neck, which is slightly more yellow (I&#x27;m Korean)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna use other product,, I&#x27;m stay skin79 super BB</li>
            <li>highly recommend this hot pink for people with combination/oily skin like me..</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone; however, those with dry skin may want to purchase the other Skin79 Gold version because it&#x27;s more moisturizing and has a thicker formula.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream came only 2 days after I purchased it, packaged carefully and thoughtfully, even containing a thank-you note.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than buying it from the actual site.</li>
            <li>Within seconds to a minute it completely abosorbed well.</li>
            <li>The cream covers my old acne scars and has been lightening them since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li>It has taken nearly 2 weeks to clear up, and I still have redness from the breakouts to deal with.  </li>
            <li>I like a natural look, and this looks like I didn&#x27;t even put any make up on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sanitary, and not messy.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is sensitive to it or</li>
            <li>So I had a choice to either order from the actual skin79 website and get the real deal or purchase from a website like this and risk getting a fraud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian, Cambodian to be specific, but I am fairly light, but not ivory enough to get away with wearing just the BB cream.</li>
            <li>at least 11 days before the \\&quot;deadline.\\&quot;  that&#x27;s better than some of the shipping services I got from sellers inside the country.</li>
            <li>tried the Skin79 BB Cream twice so far.  </li>
            <li>I do not see much benefit since it doesn&#x27;t cover my blemishes and looks almost sheer.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on  drugstore brands like Maybelline BB Cream, Revlon BB Cream, etc.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hide it completely.</li>
            <li>The pump is very hygienic (nothing goes back in).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to blend much near my neck..</li>
            <li>\\&quot;mountain\\&quot; colored powders all look natural with this BB</li>
            <li>The one I purchased from a Korean seller arrived later, but seems to be the real product.</li>
            <li>I just received this product yesterday, so I can&#x27;t attest to the long term effects, but here are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt; - LOOKS grey at first...</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>In my twenties I had a natural rosy glow.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look natural and luminescent; never caked on.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely the real product, it passes ALL authenticity tests.</li>
            <li>Also, I could never apply it anywhere near my eyes (burns)</li>
            <li>Wow, I was nervous about buying this for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, and didn&#x27;t get any adverse reaction (but you should always test a product on your wrist 24h before putting it on your face).</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth...looks really natural.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural beige.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, so it may not affect all people this way, but I thought I should mention it In the review.</li>
            <li>wanted an alternative light tinted moisturizer with spf that did not feel heavy.</li>
            <li>As far as BB creams go, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>So to tell if it is real, It should have a perforated line on the back of the box.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when i put it on and it made my pores completely invisible</li>
            <li>The bottle was even shaped differently than real makeup.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how well I ended up liking this product.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural looking foundation, this is perfecto</li>
            <li>While the packaging of the fakes might look real, the product inside can contains all sorts of fillers or chemicals and might not be same to put on your face.</li>
            <li>It does have a grey color at first</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t see how much I have left.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that it covers well too.</li>
            <li>I tried some American BB creams, but they didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>go ahead and buy it, seems legit so far</li>
            <li>seems o-k for daily use, we&#x27;ll see how much it does in..</li>
            <li>Now 20 years later it is more blotchy and uneven.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, it acts as a perfect base for makeup.</li>
            <li>When I first put the cream on it is almost a grey color like others have said but quickly adjusts to blend into my skin and makes a noticeable difference in the tone and covers up almost completely the dark spots.</li>
            <li>Skin79 bb cream actually didn&#x27;t lighten it all that much but made everything consistent- no oily sheen and no flaky dry skin.</li>
            <li>We both have different complexions but it somehow blends right in and works the same on both of us.</li>
            <li>product has a sheer coverage (so if you have medium to dark spots, then reconsider), but it is easy to blend with the fingers.</li>
            <li>Coverage is light, and the finish is matt but slightly (very slightly) reflective, giving a soft diffuse glow.</li>
            <li>I did my research and found there were many people ordering their BB creams from familiar websites such as ebay and even amazon getting fake skin79 products in the mail.</li>
            <li>I received my product in barely five days, the package was new and the seal was intact.</li>
            <li>I have leftover if I use a full pump, half is like plenty to generously coat my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a little more grey before it adjusts to your skin tone, but don&#x27;t be weirded out.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to those who want to try a BB and a new Holy Grail for their face!</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, subtle, floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think this actually does cover pretty well though and definitely evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore this BB cream, I wore a regular daytime moisturizer under it, and my cheeks were getting flaky from dryness later in the day.</li>
            <li>I think the few bad reviews can be attributed to people getting fakes and people with perfect skin not needing as much coverage as this product offers.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does come out very light, though not light enough to make a noticeable difference between the tones of my face and my neck.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and the free sample I got with it is also fabulous (heynature Black Diamond), so I will be ordering that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will not easily cover significant flaws.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m Japanese American, but a lot of people say I could pass as Indian, also for reference, I live in New England, so I&#x27;m not crazy extreme stay in the sun 24-7 tan, or been in a booth all the time tan, think natural medium-dark tan)</li>
            <li>(In the winter, I&#x27;m relatively light), so I&#x27;m not sure how well that&#x27;ll work out with the lightness of the BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Grey undertone and very drying.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself ever going back to normal foundation after trying this.</li>
            <li>I prefer the hot pink over the gold.</li>
            <li>The hot pink will stand out in your collection.</li>
            <li>my order came with a sample of the gold and the hot pink.</li>
            <li>hot pink bb cream</li>
            <li>BB Triple Function in the hot pink container.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hot pink version is for oily skin</li>
            <li>Bottle, box, and the BB cream itself are identical to Skin79 Hot Pink that I purchased from a trusted retail store in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottle, box, and the BB cream itself are identical to Skin79 Hot Pink that I purchased from a trusted retail store in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Triple Function Hot Pink SPF25/</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup over my entire face, so I often forget to take it off at night.</li>
            <li>This product is great when used under a loose mineral powder makeup but find if rather useless if used under a med-full coverage liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>The box matched the new criterion; big red circle, misspelling in &amp;#34;wriinkles&amp;#34; on the English portion of the instructions inside the box, the perforated line on the back of the box, three line items on the bottom opposite the bar code, scanner on the top right of the ingredients panel on the outside of the box, consistency of the product matches the reviews of its gel like and firm texture, color matches</li>
            <li>; I suppose the fact that this will match only a certain range of skin tones is a draw back.</li>
            <li>and I seem to get them from products I put on my skin at night and never seem to get new blemishes while I&#x27;m actually wearing the bb cream.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this in my mailbox so much sooner than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>Different color, different smell that is intensely powdery.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who are unfamiliar with bb creams, this will go on a light grayish color, but adjusts to different skin tones after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The BB cream itself comes out looking fairly dark, but applies a light grey that fades over time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sheer natural finish but still somehow manages to completely hide my imperfections while letting my freckles and skin show through.</li>
            <li>that if we were buying regular foundation, I&#x27;m consistently at least 1 or 2 shades lighter than my mom with most brands.</li>
            <li>but there seems to be a tiny bit left at the very end.</li>
            <li>It is also the real deal, not the fake Skin79 stuff that many ebay buyers are getting.</li>
            <li>That being said, the thickness/cakeyness of the bb cream ultimately depends on how much you use (i&#x27;d say about 1-2 grains of rice is enough/more than enough.</li>
            <li>if you find this too light then you can always put a powder over it, i think it makes a nice base.</li>
            <li>good product, then i saw i had only 1 only one month before the product expired which is not good at all!</li>
            <li>but nothing uncomfortable happened on my face although I have very sensitive skin and very easy to get allergy.</li>
            <li>It was very pale for me and I have skin tone between light and medium.</li>
            <li>I have a pale, warmish skin tone with freckles, and this BB cream has light enough coverage</li>
            <li>But before you go out after using this, make sure you double check in the mirror because the product oxidizes a little bit and turns a tiny tiny bit darker.</li>
            <li>I usually do not apply powder over it, because it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary.</li>
            <li>It rated a lot higher than any of the other BB or CC</li>
            <li>I put the hot pink one on and i was immediately worried about the fact that my face look gray!</li>
            <li>- it clogged my pores and caused a major breakout.</li>
            <li>Once I discontinued use, my skin cleared up with no other change to my skincare regimen...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure its fake too because if you look at SKIN79&#x27;s actual website they have changed the product packaging.</li>
            <li>I received this product from the seller A-Poly and I&#x27;m quite certain that it is not a real SKIN79 bb cream because it did not have a authenticity label like all their products have.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes me lighter than normal, coverage is rather sheer to slightly medium, my redness from fresh acnes needed additional covering but it did make my skin seem rather even toned...</li>
            <li>highly recommend this seller (SeoulGlamour); I received my order nearly two weeks ahead of the earliest expected arrival date.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend to try it especially for asian&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER</li>
            <li>It is also very buildable, for those places that need a little extra, and very light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is more of an ashy/grey pink flesh tone, it doesn&#x27;t dull your skin at all and the ashy part of it actually brightened up my face where my skin was more dull.</li>
            <li>Just a smooth matte finish, at least for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying this product twice a day, even though I know it is generally meant to be a day cream.  </li>
            <li>, I read like all the reviews on several sites, but still took me awhile to decide, so I tried to address what I felt wasn&#x27;t too clear to me.  </li>
            <li>I had always thought my skin wasn&#x27;t clear enough to get away with using just a bb cream, but I can with this one!</li>
            <li>i think this product does as much as any cosmetic cream will do, it&#x27;s not magical or a miracle cure for all your blemishes, but it covers light to medium, some of my freckles are visible, but the pinkish nose is covered, and some of my dark eye circles are gone.</li>
            <li>Actually I wasn&#x27;t  very sure to order because I had read a lot of reviews saying it was a fake</li>
            <li>Not only does it contain the important UVA-UVB protection and whitening ingredient (Arbutin - which is missing in North American versions and is essential in Blemish Balm creams considering it lightens the blemishes and age spots!), but it provides even coverage and is not heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased from Pink Gelee, Thanks.</li>
            <li>Arrived much sooner than expected and the product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>(Apparently it was at the post office on the 10th)</li>
            <li>It looks really natural - definitely the</li>
            <li>I never wear this alone, I always use my bare minerals with it.  </li>
            <li>It feels like my face is bare.</li>
            <li>bare escentuals user for over 10 years</li>
            <li>and I was surprised it actually did.</li>
            <li>but apparently there is a no return policy on this product.</li>
            <li>but of course it probably won&#x27;t adjust far enough for people with deeper skin tones.  </li>
            <li>(coverage is \\&quot;barely there\\&quot;, moisturizing properties are sub-par, no \\&quot;porcelain skin\\&quot; effect), I do not see any point in buying it again.</li>
            <li>I Barely sweat it during workout.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, this is definitely a weaker-effect cream</li>
            <li>First of all, it got here lot faster than I expected (which it was big plus).</li>
            <li>It temporarily evened out my tone but did not last more than a few hours on a 80 degree sunny day w minimal sweating.  </li>
            <li>If you have younger, acne prone skin then you should try this Skin79 Hot Pink BB Cream.</li>
            <li>purchased both of Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink and Gold label BB Creams last month have been using them for about 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Missha Perfect Cover BB cream before, and hated the feeling of it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I think only good reviews are only posted on here because this product was really useless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because I loved the real makeup, but now I&#x27;m worried that I will keep receiving fakes.</li>
            <li>: admittedly, this is only the very first time i&#x27;ve used it, but after a few hours of it on, it feels like there&#x27;s barely anything on my face!</li>
            <li>But if you want a light everyday coverage then buy this!!</li>
            <li>I dotted a little bit on a paper towel, next to what&#x27;s left in my genuine Skin79 BB, and they not only looked identical, but also oxidized identically</li>
            <li>I dotted a little bit on a paper towel, next to what&#x27;s left in my genuine Skin79 BB, and they not only looked identical, but also oxidized identically</li>
            <li>The coverage is alright for my skin; I usually go back and add a little more to cover my acne scars and my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I also tried this on my mom (who is Korean but has a much darker skin tone than me...sort of a caramel color), as well as my friend&#x27;s mom (who is white but has very dry skin), and the tone adjusted to match them as well.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the product really speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>I have been using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB Cream for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten it from Amazon (I usually get it from ebay but needed it ASAP).</li>
            <li>I like the product because it&#x27;s also gentle to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;the product blends well with other powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and thick, but feels lightweight on the face.  </li>
            <li>I applied two coats to half of my face (the equivalent of one squirt) and it noticeably whitened some of the natural redness in my cheeks but obviously didn&#x27;t do much for the acne on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin looks smoother but only provides a medium coverage, If you are looking for a bb cream that gives you a natural look, this is definitely the bb cream for you.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned at first that this wouldn&#x27;t go well with my skin because I&#x27;m not Korean</li>
            <li>and so it matches my (medium complexion Asian) skin tone much better than other Korean BB&#x27;s, which tend to be made for very pale skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on dark (which again, worried me haha)</li>
            <li>Since BB Creams are meant to apply only a little ammount (a pea size to your entire face, maybe a little more)</li>
            <li>You barely need a big pump.</li>
            <li>Usually, at the end of the day, I look worn out but this makes my face look fresh</li>
            <li>I am interested to see how my skin reacts to the product in a few days since</li>
            <li>I have dry cheeks, but a super oily t-zone, so in the end I went with the pink label, but make sure you put on lotion or moisturizer, because a couple days I was lazy, and it dried out my cheeks a bit since they are dry already,and I have flaky skin</li>
            <li>The price of the cream is decent compared to other brands as well.</li>
            <li>pretty pale (Mac foundation NC 20 for reference).</li>
            <li>and at first you think you look ultra pale...</li>
            <li>A pea size or less is about all you need to generously cover your whole face.    </li>
            <li>My skin is combination and prone to looking shiny in some spots, but I chose to use this over a moisturizer (Lush&#x27;s vanishing cream) because this product seems like it would stick to and accentuate dry spots and the moisturizer helped the balm glide over my skin easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it literally takes me less than 10 minutes to get ready.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a pretty pale Asian</li>
            <li>Im white with olive undertones, skin is pretty pale during the colder months though)</li>
            <li>I would not suggest this product to those with very dry or mature skin.</li>
            <li>After using it for a while (a month?), I haven&#x27;t seen THAT much of a difference to my face, but I do notice that my face has gotten a little lighter.</li>
            <li>I love BB cream, and I will only buy the skin79 because other brands are not nearly as good.</li>
            <li>It may be a little more but at least you can be assured that there is t anything harmful I.</li>
            <li>The white may be a little too much</li>
            <li>Only a little bit is enough for your whole face.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered very fast, and according to the web, the one I received is REAL, not one of the fake ones that some people are apparently receiving.  </li>
            <li>So for anyone that wants a light makeup base that will also benefit your skin by healing it, I highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li> , I have been considering this product after figuring out that this BB cream would be best for me (affordability wise, and compatible with my skin type)</li>
            <li> When it comes out of the pump it looks a bit beige toned, but it blends beautifully into the skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the ease of using this product in the morning and how it had the perfect coverage.</li>
            <li> #34;your skin is so beautiful, what are you using?&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>
            <li> #34;your skin is so beautiful, what are you using?&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ll reach that perfect flawless face for sure</li>
            <li> very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> And It does a great job as a BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great for me, works as a moisturizer sunscreen and foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Even though it didnt match with my skin I am happy to have this product.</li>
            <li> I am Filipino/Caucasian and it works great with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but both products are great.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s all I need for great coverage</li>
            <li> It covers great and you need</li>
            <li> but it is great for people who have redness on their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and agh I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> It feels great going on and does even out skin tone, however the color just did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> even though the YouTube video advised it makes great under eye concealer.  </li>
            <li> Well priced, great to have products combined.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>

            <li> It works great and covers all my flaws.</li>
            <li> This had great reviews, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It covers great.  </li>
            <li> This tube does a great job of getting all the product out</li>
            <li> They both make great primers for makeup.</li>
            <li> GREAT for Combination/Oil skins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for oily skin types.</li>
            <li> It came with samples which are great for traveling or using if I run out without realizing it&#x27;s gone.  </li>

            <li> but this bb cream is so amazing!</li>
            <li> and I must say, this BB cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> And it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Having read so many wonderful reviews, decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> I wish everyone could try this and see how awesome it is! :)</li>
            <li> I can wear this by itself when I&#x27;m having a good skin day and when my skin isn&#x27;t so great, I just add a touch of concealer.</li>
            <li> Good price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I ever used love it</li>
            <li> Love it, awesome seller.</li>
            <li> This was authentic and made my fair skin look flawless.  </li>
            <li> REAL REAL REAL!!!!</li>
            <li> The container is a beautiful pump that keeps the bb balm protected from bacteria and it pumps out slowly in a nice amount.</li>
            <li> I loved the sample.</li>
            <li> I loved BB cream, except for that.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t look good.  </li>
            <li> So keep in mind, if you have combination skin or otherwise, it&#x27;s just good to moisturize your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> but I mix it with my tinted moisturizer or foundation and Voila good to go.</li>
            <li> Received the BB Cream and loved the container it came in, but did not like the formula itself.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li> Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with some hyper pigmentation and acne scars.</li>
            <li> It is good but not compatible with my skin</li>
            <li> She loved it since it did what it said.</li>
            <li> It is good</li>
            <li> The color matches me well and my mom wanted to know what I was using on my face because it looked so good.</li>
            <li> I expect to purchase another BB product that does list ingredients, Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF42 PA+++, available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This worked fairly well for those minimalist days.</li>
            <li> My mom asked me about it because she noticed my skin looked really nice, and I had her try some, and she thought it was great, too, and she hates wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> The logo rubbed easitly off the container and the product remained fairly gray on my skin even after oxidizing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all good reviews here.</li>
            <li> i have used missha M perfect BB cream in 23, and that one is my skin tone, so if you are a 23 in missha this will be a tad light, but going out at night it won&#x27;t be noticeable.</li>
            <li> This evened out my skin tone perfectly, but didn&#x27;t cover a zit on my chin or some light circles under my eyes, so I needed concealer.</li>
            <li> tone(this would not be good for darker skin),</li>
            <li> It looked good</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; and it was fairly pricey.  </li>
            <li> Price is a good company.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the product or just a good month for me</li>
            <li> Nongreasy good coverage.</li>
            <li> and this fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> product itself...is good.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for light to medium skin tones.</li>
            <li> I bought it after all the good reviews I read on here.  </li>
            <li> I loved this and used it for about two weeks...</li>
            <li> This is good for people with oily skin like me</li>
            <li> good, bought couple times</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Amount is good in this container.</li>
            <li> Should remove with a good cleanser, I use Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox Effect.  </li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a good BB cream because I wanted one from Korea</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worth the money! :D</li>
            <li> Super awesome!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed by that because 1.</li>
            <li> Super excited!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has great coverage and you don&#x27;t need more than a pump for you face.</li>
            <li> lol :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, it is great once blended on the skin:)</li>
            <li> The coverage is great; lighter than a foundation, but more coverage than a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very, very pleased with this seller.</li>
            <li> wonderfully, when I put it on it did have a grey look but within about 10 minutes it looked perfect, I&#x27;m stunned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall at the moment, I am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase :).  </li>
            <li> They sell truly authentic SKIN79 product&#x27;s for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So with a million good reviews and youtube videos I thought this would be amazing.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair completion, so I can&#x27;t say it would work as well for some one with a more golden skin tone, but for me it has been a great go to product.</li>
            <li> It has a very light feeling and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> All I do is dust a bit of powder on top and voila!  </li>
            <li> and i surely say it does wonders!</li>
            <li> I want my skin to be able to breathe!</li>
            <li> And the coverage for me personally is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> And the packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li> But I decided to trust my sender, pinkgelee, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did!</li>
            <li> I first tried the Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover Cream in 21.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I saw that someone said that user TOKTOK sells authentic products, and I can verify that they do!</li>

            <li> product is authentic!  </li>
            <li> It did send from Korea so that is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> but i love it already!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it works beautifully for many</li>
            <li> I am very excited about finding skin79 bb cream!</li>
            <li> the sample was fine, got 3 great uses out of it, a lil does go along way.</li>
            <li> I must say that this product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The product is light, so you can&#x27;t feel it which is great.</li>

            <li> The fact that it has an SPF 25 sunscreen in it is also amazing.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it on my face and still an amazing texture.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> But I must say that this product is quite amazing.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff</li>
            <li> The seller included samples with my order.&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> The finish is amazing.</li>
            <li> the disappoint was from my own skin&#x27;s response.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin color and gives a nice finish to my skin.</li>
            <li> Well....I really wasnt impressed.</li>
            <li> (I will be honest</li>
            <li> The consistency was nice though but just not for me.</li>
            <li> I was, and still am, thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice in between look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I need some kind of powder on mu face ..</li>
            <li> I decided to try it on my face, and I&#x27;m loving the feel of it</li>
            <li> It kind of got in the way.</li>
            <li> This came in so handy.</li>
            <li> It was also good, had maybe a better coverage</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream because it covers so nicely and gives a good shine to my cheeks and face.</li>
            <li> and it works really nice.  </li>
            <li> gives a nice \\&quot;my skin but better\\</li>
            <li> but this BB cream is a great makeup if you want to look natural yet polished and have your face feel incredible during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled that I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> but I still would not use this product on its own without foundation over it and a setting powder.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it has really nice coverage.</li>
            <li> she says its nice to her skin and asked me about where she could buy it.</li>
            <li> The sample blush is nice too, just sparingly.</li>
            <li> you want to buy this as an easy-apply sunscreen/moisturizer or something, it will be nice.</li>
            <li> And yes, the color seems off and kind of grayish, but it blends right into my skin tone (very fair skinned), and I never have to worry about the dreaded makeup line around my chin.  </li>
            <li> They also included 4 free samples which was very nice.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this BB cream on amazon since I&#x27;veheard many people can get fakes but this one was authentic and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to apply, just like a tinted moisturizer, and it makes my skin look nice and</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super smooth and flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good things about this, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and the skin looks bright after applying it.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very securely and safely, I liked that there was a mini sample of another product and</li>
            <li> The BB cream is light and yet covers fairly well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;t light weight yet has good coverage, it smooths my skin and makes me look pore-less, and it mattifies my oily skin.</li>
            <li> The pay-off will be great, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how natural yet picture perfect the product turned out on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was fun and great to try out if it works for my skin.</li>
            <li> I do love the feel but not everyone in my office liked how it felt on.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best BB cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good size--it could easily fit in your purse</li>
            <li> Most importantly this product feels so nice on my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice quality, and the shipping was SO FAST!!</li>
            <li> If you have very fair skin and are looking for clean coverage that looks natural, this product is a great choice.</li>
            <li> How easy!</li>
            <li> I love love love B.B. Cream!</li>
            <li> love love love this product by skin79!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be buying more of this stuff, hopefully will be able to trade up my foundation! :-)</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> The cream is amazingly smooth and like lotion, and much thinner than Missha Perfect Cover Cream.  </li>
            <li> Even more surprising, it feels light and the sunscreen does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> like the packaging and the color of the BB cream is suitable for most people.</li>
            <li> The seller was great first of all.</li>
            <li> first couple of uses were as great as the sample...</li>
            <li> I found out about this product through my Korean friend and it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s as good as a medium to full coverage foundation</li>
            <li> This goes really well with her skin, gives her a clean flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light, i don&#x27;t feel it caking on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to putting on some VERY LIGHT moisturizer on and allowing it to absorb before applying the BB cream.</li>
            <li> Does not look like makeup but makes me look very smooth and even.  </li>
            <li> The BB cream had good coverage and at first I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Shipment was good, quick, packaged well.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy to review this product with positive feedback, saying that it is indeed a legit product.</li>
            <li> Seoul Glamour included two free samples and a cute book mark in my package!</li>
            <li> Provides amazing coverage, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and blends wonderfully with any skin tone.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and light but with great coverage.</li>
            <li> Its a good product and the bottle is super cute.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to BB creams, this is a good start!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin looks very smooth and flawless, especially in photos :)</li>
            <li> Love it didn&#x27;t break my skin</li>
            <li> I like it with bronzer on top.  </li>
            <li> Lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to foundation, something more lightweight for the summer, so I decided to try BB cream.</li>
            <li> I am able to use it as a foundation.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this BB Cream</li>
            <li> I just love those.</li>
            <li> I researched these some before buying and I am pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> As for the product, it was okay.  </li>
            <li> just okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> 1st time to try BB cream and really love it with a dusting of finishing powder.</li>
            <li> Love it, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which a lot of products do.</li>
            <li> is the latest issue I&#x27;m dealing with)</li>
            <li> Obviously most of us don&#x27;t buy it because of the packaging but it is always a plus.</li>
            <li> but I am really pleased with the product</li>
            <li> I thought I was paying more cash for more product</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m not gonna lie</li>
            <li> Anyway, then it&#x27;s smooth and light feeling, no cake look, and it really just looks like I had superb skin to start with.  </li>
            <li> I really love the pump.  </li>
            <li> I might just buy a couple more to stock up. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my BB cream for a month now and my skin looks better than ever</li>
            <li> Well the  ox is authentic and it does ship from Korea</li>
            <li> I believe it was an authentic product.  </li>
            <li> However, I started noticing that it was making my skin break out and that I was having to use more and more of the product to cover up my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> it is ok and it works</li>
            <li> But then again, I&#x27;m more in the warmer tone and have a lighter face than the rest of my body but have a tan complexion.  </li>
            <li> i would be ordering more and recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> The BB cream is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> They sent a cute letter thanking customers, you know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it out fully tomorrow, but I can tell i&#x27;m going to love it.</li>
            <li> If I forget to put this on under my foundation I start over!! :)</li>
            <li> The item I recieved IS authentic, so if are worried about authenticity, I think you should just give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It feels okay, not oily or anything.  </li>
            <li> for the product itself, I love it.</li>
            <li> Good product and worth a try though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did my skin loves it</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite BB Cream, after using it for a month, my blemishes went away.</li>
            <li> They do not work as well as SKIN79 BB Cream. :)</li>
            <li> then i pumped some out and thought there is NO WAY my skin is going to be able to breathe through this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Even with shipping it is still cheaper than many store brands.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s authentic</li>
            <li> My favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to order more but have not received the product.</li>
            <li> The more I use it, the better my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> But, overall...I like it :) About 3 stars for now.</li>
            <li> Then I started mixing Mac foundation with a BB Cream from Garnier, which was ok</li>
            <li> I may update this review at a later time to elaborate on how well the product has done, but for now I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> (most helpful I&#x27;ve found is the review by Sugar Reviews on Wordpress) and also used RedLaser app the scan the barcode.</li>
            <li> I really love this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I love using this on days</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be throw off when you get it by the color, it adapts to your skin tone, which is awesome because that means more people can use the same product.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  </li>
            <li> best formulation out of all the ones i see in American cosmetic lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all cakey or streaky, like I experience with most foundations.</li>
            <li> Have I mentioned I love this stuff?</li>
            <li> There were more than the said amount in the description.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat that! :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better for your skin than foundation.</li>
            <li> which most of the time bb creams do.</li>
            <li> also still put on a layer of moisturizer on top of this even if it does say that it&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> it looks to be authentic</li>
            <li> but I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> this bbcream is the best that I´ve trying before, I´m very white and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I really do love it.</li>
            <li> It provides medium coverage, some acne scars still visible but a LOT better than without.</li>
            <li> , it just makes me love my Skin79 so much more.</li>
            <li> I have to say Im really satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was not for sure if this bb cream was legit or not.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many combinations of products over the years; cream/liquid/powder/mineral foundation, foundation with primer/moisturizer/mattifying creams, etc.</li>
            <li> and it is better than any combination of products I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT: I read that blotting bb cream on will yield the most even look.</li>
            <li> Coverage was OK.</li>
            <li> : The seller is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> Some videos are better than others</li>
            <li> The seller is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I feel it works better than any almay, nutrogena,</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and plan to reorder when I finish this jar.  </li>
            <li> better about putting something on my skin that is helping to make it better.</li>
            <li> it magically turns into your skin color.</li>
            <li> but I love wearing this.</li>
            <li> It controls the oil on my skin better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I picked this one and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It made my blotchy, red skin, even toned and flawless...</li>
            <li> So glad to see it&#x27;s eligible for Amazon Prime now,</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> ..blends out perfect for my yellow under tones...</li>
            <li> mostly this, mascara and a bit of color on the lips</li>
            <li> the product is authentic.</li>
            <li> i will surely buy more products from them.</li>
            <li> Yaaaay! :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this BB cream a lot!</li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;s even</li>
            <li> I think that anyone who wants great looking skin should try this out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream brand.  </li>
            <li> Smooth bb cream ever!</li>
            <li> It controls oil well and stays matte for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that many of my acne scars are fading in color.</li>
            <li> I will give more feedback as I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I also don&#x27;t ever use foundation or concealer.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone looked much better with this cream since it evens out my face.  </li>
            <li> My sister plans on trying Missha since they have more skin color</li>
            <li> I really love this BB CREAM because it  helps even out my skin tone before I apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> We both use and love this product which adjusts to match both our skin tones and have both noticed fewer breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It does not make me break out, which most products do.</li>
            <li> This is the genuine article!</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels and looks.</li>
            <li> and it was 100 % authentic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work for some,  </li>
            <li> : Whether or not this product is authentic, I have no idea, but my skin didn&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> while on and made my skin look better when off.  </li>
            <li> I looked more &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Has really cute packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try BB creams but haven&#x27;t been impressed by American varieties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it without any issues and find that it works best layered with a primer, then powder and finally the BB cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin any more oilier nor does it tend to fade or wipe off as I have to blot during the day.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best bb cream!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face look.</li>
            <li> I love it and it lasts all day for me.</li>
            <li> and i am glad.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the genuine product!</li>
            <li> It made my already glowing skin even better.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel better even after taking it off.</li>
            <li> and I love its color and coverage.</li>
            <li> Cute packaging.  </li>
            <li> When I spray tan I add a squirt of a darker foundation to blend better with the tone.</li>
            <li> Many have tried, but nobody can imitate the perfection of this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I have been stopped on the street so many times (and this at age 50) with the question of what I use that I can&#x27;t ever think of changing.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not too sure about</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this to anyone looking for a good foundation with good coverage, and something that&#x27;s overall good for the skin!</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the product, was really excited about the fact that it had sunscreen in it and might be an alternative to foundation on weekends.  </li>
            <li> Also It has a light to medium coverage, pretty great coverage for a bb cream.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is great in my opinion, it provides decent coverage without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> May be great for normal to oil skin.</li>
            <li> It covers imperfections pretty good, but my face looked like i just took a oil bath.</li>
            <li> well it took a good three or four pumps to get product out for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty good considering.    </li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t match my fair skin well, but it really does!</li>
            <li> But anyways, this is the first BB cream that I&#x27;ve tried since I heard a lot of good things about it.</li>
            <li> It provides a beautiful, natural finish that is neither too dewy or too matte.</li>
            <li> Also i wore it today and it really is great, matches my nc20-25 skin fine and seems to work on my oily combo skin really well.</li>
            <li> so I am glad it does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> A couple of ways you can tell is if the BB logo and the skin 79 logo rubs off easily, also there should be a sticker at the top.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how easy it is to apply, the color coverage.</li>
            <li> and I got it very quickly, along with the samples and a cute card thanking me.  </li>
            <li> However, how quickly it blends, depends on how warm your skin is at application.</li>
            <li> I have only tried 3 types of BB cream and this one seems to be the best fit for my oily/uneven skin.</li>
            <li> For coverage, I would say that it probably has light to sheer medium coverage, so if you want something that is between a tinted moisturizer and a foundation, than this is perfect!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have to set it with a powder, but since it doesn&#x27;t exactly match my perfect skin tone, I lightly dust some powder over my face.</li>
            <li> It works fine on me, but I would like something that has more coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB Cream for about 2 weeks now, and so far I have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> But, I can always use more, and pile it up on my face for a more flawless coverage, and it won&#x27;t feel heavy on my face, cakey, or anything.</li>
            <li> I have tried a wide range of creams designed for oily skin and this held up the best.</li>
            <li> BB Pink, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Its like a one size fit most.</li>
            <li> The package came with two free samples and an adorable bookmark.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks great and it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee has the original product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for a month and so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten more tan in the summer, it looks a tad light, but nevertheless it still works.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better BB creams readily available in the United States.  </li>
            <li> Lots of natural beneficial nutrients, and a great skin</li>
            <li> would really recommend this product if you are fair</li>
            <li> Its very thick/and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> It works very well for fair skin tones.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing about how if you really want a good BB cream, you need to get a Korean one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coverage is good and really conceals my sun spots</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pleasant surprise for a fair, sensitive skinned American over 40 to find a Korean BB cream is a great option!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works real well on my fairly tan</li>
            <li> specially who you buy it from!</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Interested in trying some more!</li>
            <li> , i dont even get that with full coverage foundation!</li>
            <li> This product is full coverage and DEFINITLY covers the fine lines on your face with an airbrushed look!</li>
            <li> I received this very quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and I did not have any problems with the seller.</li>
            <li> It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I liked it better than any of the foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, but it didn&#x27;t blend very well to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I also suggest you order this from seoulglamour; I got this delivered very quickly considering it came from South Korea; it could have been delivered by May 13 and be on time, but it came today...</li>
            <li> If you break out easily it will be a hit-or-miss.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and blends well.  </li>
            <li> + Easy to apply, non-greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Overall a great product :)</li>
            <li> I really love how this cream not only looks great, but I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that the SPF factor is a strong plus though.</li>
            <li> Thank you seoulglamour for an amazing experience and thank you for the incredibly fast shipping!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;d like to comment on how amazing seoulglamour is.</li>
            <li> It kind of feels like lotion before it dries when you first apply.  </li>
            <li> It matches my skin tone perfectly and diminishes my dark post acne marks.  </li>
            <li> first thing i did was to make sure it was authentic...</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying from a authentic website like pretty and cute or sasa.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with black heads, and this product helps me cover it perfectly.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a darker tinted moisturizer, and it does just fine.</li>
            <li> I have year-round dry skin that becomes incredibly parched during the winter.</li>
            <li> It goes on really easily and will stay on all day if I put a light lotion on underneath.</li>
            <li> I am caucasion with light skin but tan easily in the summer.</li>
            <li> Unlike Laura Mercier, they do not settle in the fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li> and they both were fine.</li>
            <li> It has a super cute packaging &amp; I like the feeling of it on my face.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and oxidies quickly to my skin tone, it doesn&#x27;t create that cakey look either if you need more coverage.</li>
            <li> The coverage is adequate, and you can layer it on for more if you want.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream is also definately 100 percent authentic, and ships very fast from Korea!</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite :) would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I just add a bit of light blush after applying and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> packaging is very cute and highly \\&quot;spottable\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so my review won&#x27;t be that accurate</li>
            <li> This is a huge component for me because 1) I have acne prone/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as a primer and overall maintains my skin oily free throughout the day.</li>
            <li> However, the color of this BB creme is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> B.B. Cream has been such a great beauty product to have because it&#x27;s so versatile.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and blends into your skin.  </li>
            <li> The cream does not feel heavy or oily - though it works better if your own skin is a bit oily/combination; using a good moisturizer before it is good for better application.&lt;br /&gt;Covers way better than a tinted moisturizer or at some parts of the face covers better than a concealer/foundation ( ...for me at least (: ).&lt;br /&gt;Conceals</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and even included a nice thank you note.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth investing into and trying it out. :)</li>
            <li> I was worried because I&#x27;m cheap and wanted to buy from amazon, but no fear!&lt;br /&gt;  2.)  </li>
            <li> Was a bit too light for my medium -tan complexion</li>
            <li> So if this is still too light for you, you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
            <li> but it feels as light as tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It also has amazing oil control so much</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied, and it was well worth the 20 day</li>
            <li> (: The seller (seoulglamour) included two free samples.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smooth out lines either.  </li>
            <li> how comfortable it is to wear.</li>
            <li> Nice finish and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> It was a fantastic item.</li>
            <li> Amazing value, the formula works really well if you have oily skin because it helps absorb some of the oil that collects during the day.</li>
            <li> It’s light and not cakey.</li>
            <li> If I had blemish FREE skin, this  would be my go-to with some blush for some color.   </li>
            <li> I did some research, and the product I got was definitely genuine which is something that I worried about.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this bb cream</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would be too light for my skin -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooo cheap compared to all of the brands it surpasses.</li>
            <li> Not as great as foundation, but on the same level as a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> And did I mention it doesn&#x27;t look like I have a layer of foundation on...very important to</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is light and blends well, but the foundation aspect is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> after hearing about how great this product is i finally purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be way too light for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Though the coverage is rather light, but it does even out your skin tone and covers any redness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to realize that this is still MAKEUP</li>
            <li> however I did not receive the free sample as shown I will continue to use this product to see if the results are as advertised</li>
            <li> I’m of Irish/German descent and have fairly light olive skin</li>
            <li> The containers that say “Wrinkle Free” are distributed by SKIN79 North America.</li>
            <li> but if you just give it a minute or 2, it blends smooth and will match to skin tone.</li>
            <li> It too light for my light-medium face</li>
            <li> The finish/texture this gives me is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think for the price it is a great product.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased from SeoulGlamour on Amazon and the product appears to be authentic and fresh (date of manufacture June 2012).</li>
            <li> shipping was free, and 2.</li>
            <li> The BB cream also has a light, flowery sort of fragrance.</li>
            <li> so I put Revlon Colorstay powder over it in Light</li>
            <li> I just received mine and after research, I deem it to be genuine.</li>
            <li> Its oil control makes it a comfortable wear in the summer.</li>
            <li> was that it&#x27;s a bit too light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because I can add however much</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, never cracks or gets cakey, and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> indications of a genuine bottle:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> It also has SPF which is important to me.</li>
            <li> im very hapy that she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Use alone for light coverage, with a concealer for medium.  </li>
            <li> The service was fantastic.</li>
            <li> ) flowery smell like it should be, and smooth creamy texture and not chunky</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too light</li>
            <li> It is perfect for light coverage everyday since I don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of make-up at work.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brand and this cream!</li>
            <li> It surprisingly looked natural on me.  </li>
            <li> It feels great, and I even received more samples than I expected.</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;m simply excited about the product as well as how quickly the seller shipped my items!)</li>
            <li> It has great staying power ( I live in a hot, humid climate) and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> First time my skin was fairly warm, and it blended in quickly.</li>
            <li> And I can gladly say as of right now</li>
            <li> The added benefits sound nice and may possibly be true but I have not seen a great change in my skin over the few times that I have worn them.</li>
            <li> Then I got a sample of Skin79 Triple Function pink label and loved it!  </li>
            <li> BB Triple Function Hot pink BB cream SPF25/PA++ 40g) seems genuine too, which is perfect!</li>
            <li> I really liked the all-in-one usefulness of this product, and I think it would be great for people who normally put on multiple products in the morning.</li>
            <li> but I think it looks pretty good, there isn&#x27;t too much difference between my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Covers up the skin really well and does a pretty good job at clearing some blemishes too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, Skin79 Hot Pink BB cream is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried a variety of Korean BB creams, including Missha, Heynature, Lioele, and Skinfood.)</li>
            <li> It really did live up to all my expectations and I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It was light and absorbed easily into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old with very fair skin with many red, brown and tan discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Amazon said it would arrive between March 23 and April 17, and I got it more than a week before the first date...</li>
            <li> but I was just really excited about getting this BB cream</li>
            <li> this was my first BB Cream ever purchased and it blends with my skin flawlessly, love it.</li>
            <li> but it takes mine no more than 15 minutes to oxidize and match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> original box and all.</li>
            <li> (original</li>
            <li> I use a bit of concealor on small spots and then fix with mineral powder and my skin looks a feels great!</li>
            <li> My makeup routine has significantly simplified with this product.</li>
            <li> So excited about this product.</li>
            <li> For the price it is really worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always check for authenticity with every purchase, but with amazon backing everything I buy, I feel pretty safe.</li>
            <li> I am fair and this product worked fine with my skin tone, evening it out and making a mid coverage layer for makeup application.</li>
            <li> my skin looks great all day long and my makeup stays put through the day!</li>
            <li> My skin is fair and overall acne free.</li>
            <li> Gives the face coverage with a clean look.</li>
            <li> I watched YouTube videos, ready reviews, etc and decided to give the Pink bottle a try since it was the one that seemed to be best for Acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Also I think it looks a lot better and more natural during the day with the sunlight.</li>
            <li> This one is best for normal skin but can work for anyone as long as you set with powder.</li>
            <li> Powder and blush are applicable but optional; this cream looks very natural on its own.</li>
            <li> Feels great, looks great, and offers just the right amount of sunscreen (the highest you should typically go is 35 SPF, and this product is 25).</li>
            <li> But if you have oily skin like myself, I&#x27;m almost positive you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale, and my daughter is olive, but it is perfect for both of us.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I ordered another right away from her.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister and on her first application you could quickly see a brighter more healthy/natural glow.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is medium olive right now (I tan easily, and has just begun to lighten with coming of winter).</li>
            <li> Extremely relieved that it is the real thing and completely happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Favorite new foundation!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This goes on lightweight but has great coverage- dark spots, scars and fine lines and all.  </li>
            <li> The color is a little intimidating because it is so light, but it I found that blends nicely with your own skin color once it is massaged in to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does appear grayish when first applied to skin, however after a few minutes, it oxidizes and matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> the Pink Label BB cream by Skin79 seems great.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, i was worried about fakes etc, and if you want to find out more about dif fakes there are a ton of youtubes out there to help you see the difference.</li>
            <li> used it all over my face and my most worry-some place is my T-zone which is very oily compared to the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Especially because I was told this product was good for combination skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good company to buy from.  </li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Sweet.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and did some online research, only to find that the date on the bottom is the date of manufacture and the product is good for three years from that date.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived way, way earlier than the anticipated date in good condition.</li>
            <li> Love the product, and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> It also had the real deal authentic sticker on it as well, mine wasn&#x27;t a brand X rip off.</li>
            <li> Have tried it before in a sample pack that i ordered from a different seller and loved it</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this well over 3 times because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> it just looks natural on its own.</li>
            <li> I purchased this full size 40g from two sellers.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and AUTHENTIC product.</li>
            <li> only recommend this product if you already have moderately good skin.</li>
            <li> I was VERY nervous about receiving an authentic cream after reading some of the horror stories</li>
            <li> this blends well and gives a nice natural look while treating skin.</li>
            <li> MY skin type: fair, acne prone, combination,&lt;br /&gt;Age: mid 20s</li>
            <li> It is definitely made for people with fair skin though.</li>
            <li> I knocked off one star because I wish it had controlled oil a bit better (I still had to powder) and really did nothing to help my purplish undereye circles.</li>
            <li> If you want medium to full coverage look for something else, use this primer or apply concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used professional quality makeup for years and this stuff has been a nice reprieve price wise.</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> It has never broken me out, and if fact has made my skin look better over time.</li>
            <li> I love all BB Cream really</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> American brands are better described as tinted moisturizers at best, certainly not foundation coverage.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 18, but have always had prominent veins on my face), and I swear have had less break outs, acne wise.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that I feel the bottle does not smell as strong as the samples for some reason, and I really liked the smell of the sample.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t apply this to your face like foundation and you only need a very small amount applied in a patting motion, finish with a dash of mineral powder after its set and voila, gorgeous flawless skin for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I make sure there are not any marks that need touching up, I set with my bare minerals (fairly medium as I have pretty light skin and am red headed, so I want to cover freckles too) and then with the mineral veil.</li>
            <li> Other reviews said that the color was kind of greyish but oxidized to their skin color...which I didn&#x27;t believe could be true but it is!!  </li>
            <li> sister, on the other hand, wasn&#x27;t too happy with the skin79.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup, but this is really easy to apply, and I mainly like it because it&#x27;s easy to blend with fingers (unlike most liquid foundations).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other sunscreens, this BB cream has a light, pleasant scent, and does not \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; the skin.</li>
            <li> I tried the drugstore brand (G_____) before this and while I liked the luminosity of it, it was greasy, orangey, smelled SUPER strong, and it would be absorbed into my pores and gross after ~4-6 hours.  </li>
            <li> The youtube video was MORE helpful, since it is the most recent.</li>
            <li> It had a date on the bottom of September 9, 2011, which I quickly assumed was an expiration date.  </li>
            <li> You can most definitely dust a translucent powder atop this BB Cream for a more matte look.</li>
            <li> The product (SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> shipping was quick considering it was from South Korea to North Carolina, US.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with my purchase and will continue to repurchase again in the future.  </li>
            <li> it oxidizes fairly quickly, but I just wish it doubled as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked through a whole lot of different BB creams before settling on this one, and it ended up being a great choice.</li>
            <li> Super+</li>
            <li> for Super+</li>
            <li> price is soooooo much better than most American BB creams (clinique, benefit, etc).</li>
            <li> When i received this product (which arrived really quickly)</li>
            <li> With Skin79&#x27;s Super+</li>
            <li> This BB cream leaves your skin super moisturized, glowing (NO GLITTER OR SHIMMER.</li>
            <li> I just applied SKIN 79 Super+</li>
            <li> It does appear gray coming out of the bottle but quickly adapts to my skin color (which has lighter and darker areas).</li>
            <li> Or if you have dry/combination skin I would suggest VIP Gold Super</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li> B004R5E12M SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on ordering a bb cream, I HIGHLY recommend this seller. :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all my friend and I love this product..</li>
            <li> am extremely pleased with both the seller and the product and highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> It also has a very natural appearance and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, so it didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing makeup at all!</li>
            <li> If you are anything other than light or fair, it will now work well for you.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t very sure if I would like it or not, especially because of my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell and fits my skin tone pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two free samples, which I don&#x27;t really care for...but is a bonus!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very pleased to find that BB creams such as this one can accommodate the lightest of skins.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it isn&#x27;t oil free and that&#x27;s because the oils in this cream is part of the skincare component.</li>
            <li> The product comes out of the container a grayish color, however, within a few minutes it adjusted beautifully to my skin.</li>
            <li> Works with my pale, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing is that it&#x27;s authentic - or well, is a very fine replica (...which I doubt, haha).</li>
            <li> The hyper pigmentation is slightly less noticeable and the texture of the scars has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> And the product is super fresh Feb 2012.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Vurea and item came very quickly and is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I like the dispenser because it makes it really easy to measure how much you&#x27;re using, versus sticking your finger into a jar or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my pores were stretched out even more while using this cream, making them more visible.  </li>
            <li> I really like it though!!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed in a bb cream!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!  </li>
            <li> The best BB cream I have ever bought, I usually buy American BB creams and they never match my skin, I am very fair with pink undertones, and this jewel covers imperfections and it does not cake up, looks like I don&#x27;t have any makeup on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super flawless coverage, which is something I like because I like to go for the \\&quot;natural beauty\\</li>
            <li> While the color is a *little* too light for my skin, a tiny bit of my normal foundation on top blends it in perfectly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much at a time and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> This BB cream gives very good coverage, but keep in mind that that means it finishes quite thick and matte.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, the authenticity sticker was there, along with a few sample products (I&#x27;ve yet to try them).</li>
            <li> (I will be doing another review in my YouTube Channel: BeautyByRenata or Renataps88) in about a week but as soon as I opened the package I tested it on my hands and face, it feels really light and kinda of fresh and has a really really light scent (I am really sensitive for scents)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have oil control and the color, since there isn&#x27;t really a color to choose from, was too light for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light coverage, and it&#x27;s really to apply and use, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> For now going Back to TooFaced nude glow as that gives nice and more natural skin tone, faded sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for the price, my face feels healthier after using this product for a few days.</li>
            <li> After trying the Skin79 BB Cream Miniature Mini Kit, I picked the bright pink to purchase full-size.</li>
            <li> Like any make up, its a layer on top of your face, but this by far is the most natural looking cover I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and it was a success.</li>
            <li> made my skin soft, smooth and not oily or shiny at all  on top of that it blended in very well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The fragrance for me is nice, something I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting on daily.</li>
            <li> it means its worth reading.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I then found out about Skin79&#x27;s brand... and how the pink label was good for people with combination skin (like mine).  </li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a foundation type of cream to try, then it&#x27;s definately worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I am keeping it till it comes in useful.</li>
            <li> It gives me a fresh, even look without appearing \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; with foundation.</li>
            <li> and I use it sometimes too on my more mature skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to believe the hype with this BB cream, but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> far, I have not been able to find a list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> The look is so natural, that I may have to start using this daily because it is great.</li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone (Neutrogena 70, \\&quot;Fresh Beige,\\</li>
            <li> SIMPLY FRESH LOOKING, DEWY, SEMI-MATTE/SATIN SKIN).</li>
            <li> It evens out your skin tone and gives you a fresh look.</li>
            <li> My skin is freckled, fair, with pink tones.  </li>
            <li> One criticism I have is that I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s enough as a moisturizer on its own.</li>
            <li> Skin79 has incorporated many natural ingredients into this product.</li>
            <li> Seeing the price, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this on bare skin or after a full routine and it has great lasting power without clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li> It gives far better coverage than a tinted moisturizer, brightens and evens out skin tone, and has some oil control properties.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that Hot Pink is an amazing first BB cream, especially considering the great price.</li>
            <li> (I know the VIP Gold is known for being better for coverage) and more whitening on my skin, but I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These BB creams are best applied in thin layers.</li>
            <li> This is a solid product that produces good results keeping your skin clear and light.</li>
            <li> It is authentic as far as I can</li>
            <li> It is authentic as far as I can</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does look grayish when freshly applied but will adjust to your skin tone after five minutes or so.</li>
            <li> It sets well without having to use a powder on top of it (but if you want more coverage than it offers, feel free to use a powder with it obviously).</li>
            <li> means, it doesn&#x27;t make me more pale), but it feels like putting on a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands, but I really don&#x27;t see the need - the price is great</li>
            <li> Other then that, overall very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> luckily, this stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I had good results starting with a small amount then patting on more in areas where I needed more coverage.</li>
            <li> but I feel very confident after researching how to tell a fake from an authentic that I received an authentic cream, from the box to the authenticity sticker, to the consistentancy of the cream</li>
            <li> Anyways, after concluding that the products were legitimate, I jumped right into application.</li>
            <li> And it never settles in to the right color for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right out of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> The color blends into my skin right away as well.</li>
            <li> and i put it right on.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I am skeptic about the review on here as to whether they are true or if the product will work the same for me.</li>
            <li> This was the first one I&#x27;ve tried, and 4-5 brands later, I still can&#x27;t reproduce some of the things I really liked about this cream.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and give high points to the seller who sent it quickly and was fast to respond to my inquiry.</li>
            <li> If you are new to BB creams or are just wanting something different, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> less is more :)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me on a full makeup day.</li>
            <li> Makeup Forever, Stila, Bare Minerals, Neutrogena, Bobbi Brown, Pur Minerals, Laura Mercier and Estee Lauder (as well as so many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years).</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin has generally gotten a lot better since I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the Skin79 Triple Function bb cream which barely gave me coverage and looked greasy/</li>
            <li> First off- the delivery and service of this seller was good: very prompt, I received my cream within just a few days of ordering, it arrived in good condition and there&#x27;s an authenticity seal on the back, so no worries about fakes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic and my skin tone isn&#x27;t fair but nor is it dark, yet this doesn&#x27;t change the color or anything.</li>
            <li> The main issue with buying this BB cream is that its popularity resulted in a variety of Chinese knock-offs, some of which look very convincing.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned ordering, because it&#x27;s made for Asian skin tones and I&#x27;m practically albino, but it matches to my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is authentic BB cream and comes with a little sample of some more bb cream.</li>
            <li> best thing about this product is that I only use a little and it evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase and I cannot wait to see if it does actually reduce the appearance in dark spots as others have said they noticed!</li>
            <li> it smells good and its not oily on my face its really smooth and i look natural on it unlike other products.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look AND feel better, both instantly, and over-time as I wear it more, I will break out less and my skin just looks brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> Soooooo glad I came across this and will be buying a few more.</li>
            <li> Wow, that is incredibly fast shipping and the product is genuine!</li>
            <li> This is def worth the shot, since the price is similar to most comparable foundations.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I got a real one.</li>
            <li> I got it super fast</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair with cool undertones, and I have been frustrated for years that most makeup lines available in the U.S. don&#x27;t even carry a color light enough for my skin, and are predominantly yellow-toned.</li>
            <li> It make my face very clear and light.</li>
            <li> It is very naturally looking also light weight.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting and helps very much with evening your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I wasn&#x27;t surprise because it was very cheap.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t feel that it covered very much of anything on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A grey colored liquid, smells very strongly of sunscreen, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to my skin except make my makeup heavier</li>
            <li> I put a little powder on over it and am good to go.</li>
            <li> Well mine is real!</li>
            <li> Will be buying more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered my bottle and today is the first day I used it</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for almost a week, and I&#x27;m noticing more blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> :) I will definitely be repurchasing, and stocking up!</li>
            <li> This is my first BB Cream</li>
            <li> Plus I apply my Studio Fix or Mineralize Skin Finish Natural (NC20 and Light Plus) over with a kabuki blush and it evens out everything.</li>
            <li> I started to buy the smaller trial size because its cheaper and you get more products for just a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> it matches mine pretty close, and I no longer have the sticky feeling you feel when first applying.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you test not on your face at first (obviously)</li>
            <li> so 10 business days is pretty</li>
            <li> First off if you receive a BB cream from seoulglamour check</li>
            <li> considering it was coming straight from Korea!</li>
            <li> i would like to give credit to the seller of this bb cream because it is authentic and they totally gained my trust.</li>
            <li> (I was pretty sure everyone knew how big that was.)</li>
            <li> My friend send me this product from Korea and I bought this one here to use for the first time....</li>
            <li> garnier bb cream thanks!  </li>
            <li> It feels like I didn&#x27;t really put anything on my face at all!</li>
            <li> I really hope you found this review helpful!</li>
            <li> I really liked the pink packaging, bubble wrap, and there were even two samples included.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much SeoulGlamour!</li>
            <li> All the free gifts promised were properly enclosed and the ordered product nicely packets with personal notes.</li>
            <li> The fact that this is my first review ever....</li>
            <li> I think it is pretty versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels more \\&quot;free\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t actually feel like I&#x27;m wearing any make up.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty oily and I thought - this product is for me ..</li>
            <li> First of allit is oily andheavy on the face - the rest are details for me but .. promissed color on the face</li>
            <li> bb triple function not gonna last 3 hours thats for sure</li>
            <li> I was iffy about the product being an authentic skin79 product, but it came with the authenticity label and was properly sealed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using, doesn&#x27;t seem to offer more.</li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I first learned of the product by a friend who let me try hers.</li>
            <li> This cream stays on my face through most of my 10-hour workday, which I definitely appreciate!  </li>
            <li> All in all, I love this product and definitely would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and have re-ordered more.</li>
            <li> so I have olive skin but get pretty tan during the summer.</li>
            <li> At first, I was worried because I thought the color didn&#x27;t match me, but after about 5 minutes it started to get closer to my skin color.</li>
            <li> I find that when I reapply makeup later in the day/night the bb cream looks even better, don&#x27;t know exactly what that means</li>
            <li> a first</li>
            <li> It lasts whole day and i still feel fresh.</li>
            <li> the gold is easier to apply in my opinion, at first the gold seemed warmer</li>
            <li> a product actually make my skin tone look more even.</li>
            <li> Try the sample pack first if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
            <li> Thanks, SeoulGlamour!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to assure anyone considering purchasing this</li>
            <li> &#x3D;*)</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it looks grayish.</li>
            <li> first BB here</li>
            <li> All the hype about BB creams and I needed to know if it was really a miracle product!</li>
            <li> the coverage is exactly where you want it that way.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first bb cream I tried was smashbox</li>
            <li> OK now to the full size hot pink...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, and it is my first time with this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The graying effect is there, but not terribly noticeable; especially after I do my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the VIP gold sample first just to see what a BB cream was like</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using any type of bb cream.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried the bb cream, I used moisturizer</li>
            <li> Next day, I used it without moisturizer and it was much better for me.  </li>
            <li> I really love it and definitely plan on repurchasing either this one or the Gold one next time. :-))</li>
            <li> I like it because he is gently and fresh my face skin when i go my work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, even though I&#x27;ve watched a bunch of youtube videos and read a bunch of product reviews, I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after hearing all the buzz on BB creams, and that Asian versions are better then the ones you can buy here in the U.S.</li>
            <li> First time user</li>
            <li> so was reluctant to try at first.  </li>
            <li> of now at first impression</li>
            <li> it looked ashy at first, but the BB cream blended into my skin tone.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time BB cream buyer, then I suggest you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I have tried</li>
            <li> Its not a fake.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what it was supposed to be</li>
            <li> Good coverage, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the four bb cream sample set and from that, selected the Super+ Hot Pink bb cream as my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was scared of getting scammed, the price seemed too good to be true, but it&#x27;s surely not!</li>
            <li> Might be good if you want lighten out your skin tone, but I&#x27;m already pale and I don&#x27;t want to look any paler.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this as a standalone product because the color is very light almost greyish when applied, however it does oxidize and change to a more normal color after a few mins</li>
            <li> Super+ is targated as &amp;#34;all normal skin, SPF protection, whitening feature, sebum control, and wrinkle improvement&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Even though it oxidizes to fit your true skin color, it&#x27;s still a little to light for tanner skin.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It covers great, does look a little gray when it first goes on, but once it&#x27;s blended it looks like my natural skin tone (</li>
            <li> This is my first B.B Cream and I must say what a positive surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received my hot pink BB cream from Seoulglamour today, and I&#x27;m super excited!</li>
            <li> can apply this with your fingers, but I use a dense flat top brush for a fuller coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the cream is less watery than other bb creams (compared to missha&#x27;s perfect cover blahblah bb cream)</li>
            <li> As you may know, a big issue with buying such products is authenticity - I am pleased to say I received the genuine product :) (&amp;#34;Sold by Constant Connection and Fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;) Received sample, as advertised, but have yet to try.</li>
            <li> but whenever I get this from a new seller, I always subject the packaging to intense scrutiny to make sure it&#x27;s an authentic product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute and pink, there was much bubble wrap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, you can use more for problem areas that are more difficult to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i thought wow nice big bottle</li>
            <li> Good product, it&#x27;s my 3rd bottle, well, the 2nd one was a gift to my cousin who also loves it.  </li>
            <li> Intense Classic or Super Perfection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to wear this BB cream without moisturizer and with only applying loose powder over top.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I now use some jojoba or coconut oil with a good moisturizer with this, and I have a good feeling that the excessive moisture will not be necessary for me in the summer.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a foundation alternative for cosplay and special occasions, because I always break out with foundation and have sensitive skin, but you know, I might just use it forever.  </li>
            <li> I thought the color would be too light and the coverage too sheer, but this turns out just right.  </li>
            <li> ordered this because of all the positive review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear even under the Boston dry winter weathers.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my cheeks, so I apply a very light moisturizer to those areas under the BB</li>
            <li> , the shipping was pretty fast from Korea, I ordered it on March 11,2012 (Sunday) and it arrive March 23,2012 (Friday).</li>
            <li> My skin gets pretty oily during the day, so it&#x27;s really all I need in the morning after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> of the first things that catches anyone&#x27;s attention is the adorable dispenser that the Hot Pink BB creams in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light--it has the consistency of lotion and doesn&#x27;t do much to cover blemishes or anything.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look more dry than without it.  </li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin, I&#x27;d recommend to just use a heavier moisturizer underneath (perhaps one for night time) and it will will work- better than any tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This particular company has so many to choose from that it took literally days to decide on which one was for me, especially since I had never used a BB cream before and didn&#x27;t know that much about them or this company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink is definitely more of a tinted moisturizer than a replacement for foundation.</li>
            <li> Feels super soft.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly re-purchase this</li>
            <li> I have large pores on and around my nose and every liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried makes me break out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Another thing I love is that it only took 8 days to send it here in New York.</li>
            <li> the grey undertone sometimes complained about, interior bottle removes easily from outer pink shell containing the appropriately raised and reflective lettering, appropriate hole opening at the dispenser, and shell shaped tab on top.</li>
            <li> I rarely feel compelled to write a product review, however, I simply had to do so concerning the Skin 79 Super+</li>
            <li> skin tone is fairly even, but very sensitive and prone to redness in a few areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to lose my summer tan, so the balm color was fine.</li>
            <li> This BB cream blended very well and is neutral and sheer enough that it could work with most light to medium skin tones, and for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I know who have tested it is pretty decent,</li>
            <li> This product matches my skin tone pretty well and provides decent coverage for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pale (my shade is porcelain in most foundations and concealers)</li>
            <li> Goes on really light with almost a weird green tint but quickly evens out perfectly.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit of this and some powder for an amazing look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I was a little hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;ve heard of people receiving fakes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and leaves my skin looking dewy and really pretty!</li>
            <li> /&gt;so far, KATIE THE BABE seller is legit (to the extent of my knowledge) and you also get a pretty large amount of sample creams!</li>
            <li> so I spent about a week researching before I settled on this particular BB cream as it seemed good for normal to oily skin as well as sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> and she said that she has received more positive feedback regarding this product than any other.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again but not for some time as the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Deliver fast.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to this pink BB cream until I find another one that works better.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase skin 79 pink bb cream.</li>
            <li> it saves sooo much time in the mornings as it acts as your moisturizer, primer, and foundation.</li>
            <li> Really Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am really picky with my foundations, tinted moistorizers and etc.</li>
            <li> but REALLY</li>
            <li> then it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase a BB Cream because I am really focused on improving my skin and this BB Cream has Wrinkle Improvement, SPF 25, works as a moisturizer, sebum control and whitening</li>
            <li> really Hope this review is helpful for you</li>
            <li> I was also very worried if it would be a legitimate product.  </li>
            <li> really does seem like a keeper miracle product to me.  </li>
            <li> I was very worried about the authenticity of this cream and reading horror stories of people getting fakes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seller, seoulglamour, ships the real deal.</li>
            <li> Real vs. Fake\\&quot; to confirm the authenticity.</li>
            <li> It is real.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> Shipping for this was also incredibly fast in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and delivery, and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> i would break out one pimple if i didn&#x27;t wash my face after wearing foundation for 4 hours straight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much blemishes to cover tho, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much for coverage.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenses a bit too much product for me.</li>
            <li> Whenever I put on foundation or tinted moisturizer, I always end up looking either very orange, or ghost like because I can never find a share that matches my skin.  </li>
            <li> The color is much lighter than what I thought but after applying powder, it blends well.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer than it</li>
            <li> cream looks very gray when dispensed</li>
            <li> It arrived in about 1 1/2 weeks in a cute pink package</li>
            <li> I had the travel size, so there wasn&#x27;t much.    </li>
            <li> I didnt use it very often.</li>
            <li> I was really needing a bb cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to order from Pink Gelee.  </li>
            <li> The bottle from Pink Gelee comes in an authentic box.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, if your bottle does not have a sticker, it is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and have light skin already.  </li>
            <li> The BB Cream doesn&#x27;t seem to cover up much at all.  </li>
            <li> I was very hestitant on purchasing on amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to get a dupe.</li>
            <li> It just looks neat, fresh, and natural without setting with powder.</li>
            <li> coverage is nothing to rave about, and I don&#x27;t really like the consistency of the product</li>
            <li> The real skin79 brand will have a sticker of authenticity on the foundation bottle.</li>
            <li> Unborn babies, infants, and children are especially sensitive to the effects of mercury and lead.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much since I have been using this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light coverage but gives you that extra brightening glowing quality on your face.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY evens out my skin tone (which is really what &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal and made it all the way from Hong Kong within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> It feels lightweight and breathable when applied and stays on really well even without a primer.</li>
            <li> It also blended very well despite my inexperience in how to &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li> If you are really tan, it might not work without some bronzer.</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t need too much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, this is my 3rd bottle!</li>
            <li> That being said, I can see how this would work really well on oily/acne-prone</li>
            <li> I dont know how much of the product is</li>
            <li> but I had that cream so much</li>
            <li> and it feels much lighter than a foundation on my skin.</li>
            <li> I looked up videos, and searched on how to know if your bb cream was indeed real.</li>
            <li> It is completely real.</li>
            <li> bb cream cream is really gentile on your skin.</li>
            <li> : I have a medium skin tone, more olive/yellow than pink.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin that was being exacerbated by mineral makeup</li>
            <li> : I waited a whole month before writing this review so that I could comment on how my skin reacts to it over time.</li>
            <li> , I literally go a whole day without applying additional powder.</li>
            <li> The VIP Gold sample also worked very well</li>
            <li> Also really grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came on time, it was the real thing</li>
            <li> If you have light skin, this will only make you look paler when applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is my first day wearing it, I will be sure to update after my trip in a few weeks to share how it held up in hot weather.</li>
            <li> This went on smoothly over my regular skin are regimen.  </li>
            <li> They got the same look, it looked too light for them and it should not have been.  </li>
            <li> My sister uses this product  more than I do, I always get the gold not the pink.</li>
            <li> Still I would have much preferred receiving the real product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a before, but there is one close up of my face where you can really see my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need too much coverage and</li>
            <li> -The seller(neverprice) has the real product</li>
            <li> I have a very oily t-zone, and combination skin</li>
            <li> I figure if you&#x27;re gonna spend the money, buy it from a place that&#x27;s guaranteeing the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This product worked really well on me.</li>
            <li> But after my skin cleared up from acne, I didn&#x27;t need as much coverage</li>
            <li> This product does have a very gray effect on my skin if I over-apply.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from Pink Gelee and yes, it is authentic.  </li>
            <li> I really like it for my eyes as well.  </li>
            <li> I think she wants that lighter-white powder finish</li>
            <li> and I found that this product made me look very skinny.</li>
            <li> and it was real.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy and leaves my skin nourished without being too shiny.</li>
            <li> purchasing this product, I was very concerned about its authenticity, as this 40g bottle was much cheaper on Amazon than on Skin79&#x27;s official website.</li>
            <li> If you want a BB cream to act like a foundation you really need to consider South Korean brands.</li>
            <li> Also, when it starts running out, you can get the tube out of the pink outer casing, twist the top off and scoop out the remaining cream.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry this is the real BB</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is really greyish but it blends with your skin color well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was much quicker than I had anticipated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy it</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> This lasts all day and is reasonably price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very oily but this keeps me from getting shiny.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much.</li>
            <li> and I really like how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s is the real thing.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is that I didn&#x27;t get a gold sample I got a sample of the bb cleanser, but I did use that and liked it so that&#x27;s ok , though I wanted to try the gold one to see if its better than the pink.</li>
            <li> Skin79 seemed to stand above most in ratings for sensitive skin types and in decreasing the appearance of post acne scarring.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice dewy, polished look without looking greasy, and works for several different skin types and tones.  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is pretty thick for me, but I LOVE the product!</li>
            <li> It does smell good compared to other American BB cream however.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s authentic based on other&#x27;s review on YouTube.</li>
            <li> The texture of both BB creams to me was somewhere between a rich tinted moisturizer and sunscreen without the gross oily feeling.</li>
            <li> While most other signs of authenticity are here, there is no corresponding expiration date/manufacture number on the bottom of</li>
            <li> /&gt;She on the other hand loves it (she has more oily skin than I do)</li>
            <li> I have stayed away from some other sellers whose products do appear to differ from what should be authentic, and sell at lower prices.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this to dark or even tan skin tones because it is a very light color.</li>
            <li> I am Mexican, Sicilian and French with light medium skin (I wear fairly medium in the Bare Essentials line) and it turned my skin grey.  </li>
            <li> but so far this product works fine for me now just that it is a little too light for me unlike the one my friend sent to me</li>
            <li> Everyone was so surprised and copied down the name so they can get their own.</li>
            <li> it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much, but for my occasional red spots and blackheads it does just fine!</li>
            <li> oddly enough I do like the Garnier roll on undereye concealer or the Revlon Photo Ready concealer over the Mac concealer which looks a little too bright and unnatural).</li>
            <li> I mixed it with a darker colored foundation and it fit my color a little better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really love this product because it makes my face appear less oily throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> I just got this super fast only took 2 weeks maybe to get here to the States.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the VIP Gold BB Cream to those of you who have more mature or dry skin.</li>
            <li> i think, if my mind isn&#x27;t playing tricks on me, there is a slight scent like perfume, very light, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> looks grey on my skin , I am light olive .</li>
            <li> and I look naturally beautiful instead of fake and over done.</li>
            <li> I want full coverage in a foundation, but nothing that looks cakey or powdery and definitely nothing that makes my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, if I use it as concealer on days when I don&#x27;t want to wear full makeup, it doesn&#x27;t look obviously spotty on my face.</li>
            <li> A full pump isn&#x27;t necessary, in my opinion, and would be wasting product.</li>
            <li> I am mixed race (Korean and white) in my mid-20&#x27;s with naturally oily skin while my best friend is a very white German/Irish girl in her 30&#x27;s with combination skin that can get dry in places.  </li>
            <li> This is good for someone who has clear skin and wants to have light coverage witih SPF and correct slight uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Less than one full pump from the bottle is more than enough for me!</li>
            <li> I can not feel or see any evidence of it having been applied aside from the evened skin tone and most blemishes hidden.</li>
            <li> (more color for summer because I tan, less in winter because I get lighter).</li>
            <li> (both spots became slightly darker and more gray after sitting in a drawer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (both spots became slightly darker and more gray after sitting in a drawer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My main channel (renataps88) is in portuguese</li>
            <li> Just super excited to get this cream for half the price!</li>
            <li> I have been receiving a lot of compliments because my skin looks so natural and smooth even when I&#x27;m not wearing the BB cream, so it definitely works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover acne 100% but does a decent job.</li>
            <li> It does cost more than my current foundation, so I will probably just stick with Revlon in the future.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I purchased this product, as there&#x27;s a lot of brew-ha-ha surrounding this particular company&#x27;s BB creams.</li>
            <li> I think the concept of having make-up and skincare in one is a clever idea.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give up on BB creams, I still think they are a clever concept.</li>
            <li> I will not be able to use this product alone for complete coverage at this point but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> but it seems to do a decent job of adjusting.</li>
            <li> For only 10 dollars and free shipping, I got a 40 dollar BB cream and a cute little card with a sample!</li>
            <li> This color is a little too light for me right now.</li>
            <li> (super awesome, there&#x27;s at least 5-6 samples in this little ziploc bag that comes with the hot pink bb cream!!!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went on very pale on my medium toned skin, however after blending it really adapts to your natural skin tone and the end result is a really clear, bright looking skin tone.</li>
            <li> This goes on a little chalky, but as it warms up to your skin temp, it is perfect and it only takes just a little pump or two to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this no matter if your skin is clear or imperfect!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Hot pink BB cream from the seller seoulglamour who claimed that it was authentic.</li>
            <li> Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus BB Cream Triple Functions 40g + Missha Sample [Misc.]]]</li>
            <li> As for the seller, seoulglamour, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing from Seoulglamour.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but the coloring was just not for me.  </li>
            <li> Made of high quality ingredients</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am so excited with the packaging, it is so cute, the bottle is really small, I was expecting to be the size of a pop can and its the same height as my MAC Studio Fix foundation</li>
            <li> All I use is a little mineral powder on top of it</li>
            <li> I thought I was just adding a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> As for the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; (which others assure me does not mean &#x27;bleaching&#x27;)</li>
            <li> After MUCH research on products I found that a BB cream was the way I wanted to go, and after even more research I found that for sensitive skin all directions pointed to an Asian or Korean BB cream rather than the new American creams.</li>
            <li> BB Cream to the large end of my foundation brush and began to apply from the inside (closer to my nose) first to the outside (towards my ears)..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on any effects it has on improving your skin, but I enjoy the coverage and the SPF factor is good, and will go a long way as only a tiny bit of product is needed for quite a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I am around a natural to medium beige and it blends in very well.</li>
            <li> I has not broken me out so far either.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after much research online for something my daughter could wear with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> everyone ask me my face it so soft and lightly thanks</li>
            <li> It has a very matte finish and my face feels really soft and velvety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> PA++ 40g (Autheticity Label &amp; Perforations with Free VIP Gold Sample!!!)]]&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product through Pink Gelee via Amazon.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t really improved anything, so for now it&#x27;s 4/5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this tinted moisturizer and it causes my face to break out in places I normally don&#x27;t have acne.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;ll mention a few more things.</li>
            <li> Actually I don&#x27;t use it that much, but whenever I do, it never fails to satisfy me.</li>
            <li> normal skin w/ oily T-zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use that but decided to try from this company \\&quot;Seoul</li>
            <li> Glamour\\&quot; NEVER AGAIN, don&#x27;t waste your money, if you order the cream you&#x27;re better off gettin from another seller</li>
            <li> It has a dewy finish and i have normal skin so by the end of the day my skin does tend to look a bit shiny.</li>
            <li> The container is generously sized to last A LONG TIME which I love.</li>
            <li> I of course remove it at night before my normal skin routine, but I can wear this every day with no skin problems.</li>
            <li> So disappointed since it really did make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> than I normally do.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great skin care product to begin with for girls in their late teens or early to mid 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is it is better than that heavy chunky garnier bb cream.</li>
            <li> As of right now, I wake up with smaller and fewer new acne, when before I was waking up to new pimples that were pretty large and in charge on almost a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this BB cream, it&#x27;s has much more coverage than my previous one (Garnier) and actually comes out a bit like a clay mask.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or dry), the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m actually wearing anything on my face, but still makes it look so much better.  </li>
            <li> This product does an amazing job with a small bit of concealer for under eye circles and im out the door!</li>
            <li> (There were even two free samples, one of the same pink one and one of the VIP Gold version.)After watching comparison videos of the real and fake product, I was so happy to find that it was the real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with it covering dark under eye circles, pores or small blemishes, and my skin is really getting better and more clear with every use.</li>
            <li> Super thick, a little goes a long way, great coverage and does a really good job toning down the different colors on the face and evening out skiing tone.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but compared to the drugstore bb creams I&#x27;ve tried, this is hands down the best one so far.</li>
            <li> makeup.&amp;#34; For the first hour or so after application, upon closer look, it appeared slightly cakey, but this quickly disappeared and now I feel like there is nothing on my face.</li>
            <li> Plus, this was all I ordered, and got 3 free samples, two of them Missha, the other the vip gold Skin79.  </li>
            <li> Minimal coverage, takes significant layering to cover flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It is new afterall,so just be patient.  </li>
            <li> I live in Texas</li>
            <li> Their product isn&#x27;t worth it, the package was off, the product was way to bright and dry, what a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> But then again, it arrives so quickly that I wouldn&#x27;t be without this BB cream for very long.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product because, as a fellow Asian with a lighter skin complexion, this product really brightens up my face and evens out the skin tone.</li>
            <li> (Speaking of that, there are a few \\&quot;Real vs Fake\\&quot; BB cream videos available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also true that when you first apply this coverage, it looks a bit greyish but that fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Have not tried dept store US BB creams yet, but likely will not if the Asian products are available</li>
            <li> The last two sellers I&#x27;ve bought from (SeoulGlamour and Pink Gelee) both had 100% authentic products.</li>
            <li> First off Hot Pink</li>
            <li> The product is fairly thick (which is probably why it has such good coverage)</li>
            <li> its thick and even on my fair skin looks ghostly white.</li>
            <li> However, do not expect major coverage without using so much that it makes you greasy or break out.</li>
            <li> I have very clear skin</li>
            <li> It makes the skin look very natural and blends into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have only started using this product but seems very promising</li>
            <li> Just to clear up a misnomer, the only difference between Hot Pink Skin79 pump containers that contain the wording “Wrinkle Free” or “Wrinkle Improvement” are, those that say “Wrinkle Improvement” are manufactured by Wizcoz Co., the makers of SKIN79 in South Korea.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin)  </li>
            <li> It feels very natural on the skin, and is everything that I heard about this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am recovering from a severe allergic reaction to another cosmetic.</li>
            <li> only warning I have is that a full pump of this product is more than enough for three heavy applications.</li>
            <li> It smooths on nicely (a little goes a long way) and has higher coverage than many bb creams out there.  </li>
            <li> and I think because of the light grey tone that it will look better if you have a pink undertone opposed to my yellow undertone but for me the light grey tone is not a huge deal and doesn&#x27;t look so evident.</li>
            <li> I bought this from seoulglamor and it&#x27;s definitely the real product!</li>
            <li> This is the second bb cream brand that I&#x27;m using (my first was Dr Jart water fuse bb cream), and although skin 79 gives better coverage, I&#x27;m not sure if it helped with my oily skin(which</li>
            <li> wow, this ended up a lot longer than I intended!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for in BB Creams after researching various ones.</li>
            <li> it is hot outside</li>
            <li> it just wasent a pretty color against my skin.(im med white w/freckles)So it should have worked from my understanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several people and anyone interested in this product should purchase it.</li>
            <li> balm is the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually minimizes the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> Overall it did exactly what I was looking for which was something to conceal redness and create a smoother/even looking skin surface.</li>
            <li> No one has ever said, Wow!</li>
            <li> No one has ever said, Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely purchasing more bb cream and other products from this seller..</li>
            <li> I just received this today and first thing I did was try it on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> Definitely might feel a little like a sunscreen when your rubbing it on your face, and the color may seem initially a little ashy, but when the product meets your face, the warmth and pigments of the BB simply melt into your skin and the color matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this even more than my expensive MAC studio fix fluid.</li>
            <li> The product is pale upon first application but adjusted to my skin tone quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually blot it on, lightly over my whole face</li>
            <li> so I typically use a light moisturizer under it.</li>
            <li> stuff is pretty much what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to unbox the babies in fear of getting shipped a fraud, but with all the research and videos I&#x27;ve watched to educate myself on what a real skin79 pink label and vip gold edition should look like I had no trouble coming to the conclusion that both these products were the real deal!</li>
            <li> so I took it to work and let some of my less tan (more white) friends try it.</li>
            <li> so it more or less matched my skin (yellow undertones and all!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big make-up person, but Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB cream hit the right nerve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to wear this all day long without breakouts, sweating it off, or any other issues.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need a large amount to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly and can be a little greasy after wearing all day.</li>
            <li> My face is naturally a little whiter than my neck, which is slightly more yellow (I&#x27;m Korean)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna use other product,, I&#x27;m stay skin79 super BB</li>
            <li> highly recommend this hot pink for people with combination/oily skin like me..</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone; however, those with dry skin may want to purchase the other Skin79 Gold version because it&#x27;s more moisturizing and has a thicker formula.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream came only 2 days after I purchased it, packaged carefully and thoughtfully, even containing a thank-you note.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than buying it from the actual site.</li>
            <li> Within seconds to a minute it completely abosorbed well.</li>
            <li> The cream covers my old acne scars and has been lightening them since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li> It has taken nearly 2 weeks to clear up, and I still have redness from the breakouts to deal with.  </li>
            <li> I like a natural look, and this looks like I didn&#x27;t even put any make up on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sanitary, and not messy.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is sensitive to it or</li>
            <li> So I had a choice to either order from the actual skin79 website and get the real deal or purchase from a website like this and risk getting a fraud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, Cambodian to be specific, but I am fairly light, but not ivory enough to get away with wearing just the BB cream.</li>
            <li> at least 11 days before the \\&quot;deadline.\\&quot;  that&#x27;s better than some of the shipping services I got from sellers inside the country.</li>
            <li> tried the Skin79 BB Cream twice so far.  </li>
            <li> I do not see much benefit since it doesn&#x27;t cover my blemishes and looks almost sheer.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on  drugstore brands like Maybelline BB Cream, Revlon BB Cream, etc.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hide it completely.</li>
            <li> The pump is very hygienic (nothing goes back in).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to blend much near my neck..</li>
            <li> \\&quot;mountain\\&quot; colored powders all look natural with this BB</li>
            <li> The one I purchased from a Korean seller arrived later, but seems to be the real product.</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday, so I can&#x27;t attest to the long term effects, but here are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt; - LOOKS grey at first...</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> In my twenties I had a natural rosy glow.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look natural and luminescent; never caked on.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely the real product, it passes ALL authenticity tests.</li>
            <li> Also, I could never apply it anywhere near my eyes (burns)</li>
            <li> Wow, I was nervous about buying this for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, and didn&#x27;t get any adverse reaction (but you should always test a product on your wrist 24h before putting it on your face).</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth...looks really natural.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural beige.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, so it may not affect all people this way, but I thought I should mention it In the review.</li>
            <li> wanted an alternative light tinted moisturizer with spf that did not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> As far as BB creams go, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> So to tell if it is real, It should have a perforated line on the back of the box.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when i put it on and it made my pores completely invisible</li>
            <li> The bottle was even shaped differently than real makeup.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how well I ended up liking this product.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural looking foundation, this is perfecto</li>
            <li> While the packaging of the fakes might look real, the product inside can contains all sorts of fillers or chemicals and might not be same to put on your face.</li>
            <li> It does have a grey color at first</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see how much I have left.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it covers well too.</li>
            <li> I tried some American BB creams, but they didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> go ahead and buy it, seems legit so far</li>
            <li> seems o-k for daily use, we&#x27;ll see how much it does in..</li>
            <li> Now 20 years later it is more blotchy and uneven.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, it acts as a perfect base for makeup.</li>
            <li> When I first put the cream on it is almost a grey color like others have said but quickly adjusts to blend into my skin and makes a noticeable difference in the tone and covers up almost completely the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Skin79 bb cream actually didn&#x27;t lighten it all that much but made everything consistent- no oily sheen and no flaky dry skin.</li>
            <li> We both have different complexions but it somehow blends right in and works the same on both of us.</li>
            <li> product has a sheer coverage (so if you have medium to dark spots, then reconsider), but it is easy to blend with the fingers.</li>
            <li> Coverage is light, and the finish is matt but slightly (very slightly) reflective, giving a soft diffuse glow.</li>
            <li> I did my research and found there were many people ordering their BB creams from familiar websites such as ebay and even amazon getting fake skin79 products in the mail.</li>
            <li> I received my product in barely five days, the package was new and the seal was intact.</li>
            <li> I have leftover if I use a full pump, half is like plenty to generously coat my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a little more grey before it adjusts to your skin tone, but don&#x27;t be weirded out.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to those who want to try a BB and a new Holy Grail for their face!</li>
            <li> It has a lovely, subtle, floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think this actually does cover pretty well though and definitely evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore this BB cream, I wore a regular daytime moisturizer under it, and my cheeks were getting flaky from dryness later in the day.</li>
            <li> I think the few bad reviews can be attributed to people getting fakes and people with perfect skin not needing as much coverage as this product offers.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does come out very light, though not light enough to make a noticeable difference between the tones of my face and my neck.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and the free sample I got with it is also fabulous (heynature Black Diamond), so I will be ordering that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will not easily cover significant flaws.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m Japanese American, but a lot of people say I could pass as Indian, also for reference, I live in New England, so I&#x27;m not crazy extreme stay in the sun 24-7 tan, or been in a booth all the time tan, think natural medium-dark tan)</li>
            <li> (In the winter, I&#x27;m relatively light), so I&#x27;m not sure how well that&#x27;ll work out with the lightness of the BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Grey undertone and very drying.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself ever going back to normal foundation after trying this.</li>
            <li> I prefer the hot pink over the gold.</li>
            <li> The hot pink will stand out in your collection.</li>
            <li> my order came with a sample of the gold and the hot pink.</li>
            <li> hot pink bb cream</li>
            <li> BB Triple Function in the hot pink container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hot pink version is for oily skin</li>
            <li> Bottle, box, and the BB cream itself are identical to Skin79 Hot Pink that I purchased from a trusted retail store in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottle, box, and the BB cream itself are identical to Skin79 Hot Pink that I purchased from a trusted retail store in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Triple Function Hot Pink SPF25/</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup over my entire face, so I often forget to take it off at night.</li>
            <li> This product is great when used under a loose mineral powder makeup but find if rather useless if used under a med-full coverage liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> The box matched the new criterion; big red circle, misspelling in &amp;#34;wriinkles&amp;#34; on the English portion of the instructions inside the box, the perforated line on the back of the box, three line items on the bottom opposite the bar code, scanner on the top right of the ingredients panel on the outside of the box, consistency of the product matches the reviews of its gel like and firm texture, color matches</li>
            <li> ; I suppose the fact that this will match only a certain range of skin tones is a draw back.</li>
            <li> and I seem to get them from products I put on my skin at night and never seem to get new blemishes while I&#x27;m actually wearing the bb cream.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this in my mailbox so much sooner than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Different color, different smell that is intensely powdery.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who are unfamiliar with bb creams, this will go on a light grayish color, but adjusts to different skin tones after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The BB cream itself comes out looking fairly dark, but applies a light grey that fades over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sheer natural finish but still somehow manages to completely hide my imperfections while letting my freckles and skin show through.</li>
            <li> that if we were buying regular foundation, I&#x27;m consistently at least 1 or 2 shades lighter than my mom with most brands.</li>
            <li> but there seems to be a tiny bit left at the very end.</li>
            <li> It is also the real deal, not the fake Skin79 stuff that many ebay buyers are getting.</li>
            <li> That being said, the thickness/cakeyness of the bb cream ultimately depends on how much you use (i&#x27;d say about 1-2 grains of rice is enough/more than enough.</li>
            <li> if you find this too light then you can always put a powder over it, i think it makes a nice base.</li>
            <li> good product, then i saw i had only 1 only one month before the product expired which is not good at all!</li>
            <li> but nothing uncomfortable happened on my face although I have very sensitive skin and very easy to get allergy.</li>
            <li> It was very pale for me and I have skin tone between light and medium.</li>
            <li> I have a pale, warmish skin tone with freckles, and this BB cream has light enough coverage</li>
            <li> But before you go out after using this, make sure you double check in the mirror because the product oxidizes a little bit and turns a tiny tiny bit darker.</li>
            <li> I usually do not apply powder over it, because it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary.</li>
            <li> It rated a lot higher than any of the other BB or CC</li>
            <li> I put the hot pink one on and i was immediately worried about the fact that my face look gray!</li>
            <li> - it clogged my pores and caused a major breakout.</li>
            <li> Once I discontinued use, my skin cleared up with no other change to my skincare regimen...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure its fake too because if you look at SKIN79&#x27;s actual website they have changed the product packaging.</li>
            <li> I received this product from the seller A-Poly and I&#x27;m quite certain that it is not a real SKIN79 bb cream because it did not have a authenticity label like all their products have.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes me lighter than normal, coverage is rather sheer to slightly medium, my redness from fresh acnes needed additional covering but it did make my skin seem rather even toned...</li>
            <li> highly recommend this seller (SeoulGlamour); I received my order nearly two weeks ahead of the earliest expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend to try it especially for asian&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER</li>
            <li> It is also very buildable, for those places that need a little extra, and very light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is more of an ashy/grey pink flesh tone, it doesn&#x27;t dull your skin at all and the ashy part of it actually brightened up my face where my skin was more dull.</li>
            <li> Just a smooth matte finish, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this product twice a day, even though I know it is generally meant to be a day cream.  </li>
            <li> , I read like all the reviews on several sites, but still took me awhile to decide, so I tried to address what I felt wasn&#x27;t too clear to me.  </li>
            <li> I had always thought my skin wasn&#x27;t clear enough to get away with using just a bb cream, but I can with this one!</li>
            <li> i think this product does as much as any cosmetic cream will do, it&#x27;s not magical or a miracle cure for all your blemishes, but it covers light to medium, some of my freckles are visible, but the pinkish nose is covered, and some of my dark eye circles are gone.</li>
            <li> Actually I wasn&#x27;t  very sure to order because I had read a lot of reviews saying it was a fake</li>
            <li> Not only does it contain the important UVA-UVB protection and whitening ingredient (Arbutin - which is missing in North American versions and is essential in Blemish Balm creams considering it lightens the blemishes and age spots!), but it provides even coverage and is not heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased from Pink Gelee, Thanks.</li>
            <li> Arrived much sooner than expected and the product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> (Apparently it was at the post office on the 10th)</li>
            <li> It looks really natural - definitely the</li>
            <li> I never wear this alone, I always use my bare minerals with it.  </li>
            <li> It feels like my face is bare.</li>
            <li> bare escentuals user for over 10 years</li>
            <li> and I was surprised it actually did.</li>
            <li> but apparently there is a no return policy on this product.</li>
            <li> but of course it probably won&#x27;t adjust far enough for people with deeper skin tones.  </li>
            <li> (coverage is \\&quot;barely there\\&quot;, moisturizing properties are sub-par, no \\&quot;porcelain skin\\&quot; effect), I do not see any point in buying it again.</li>
            <li> I Barely sweat it during workout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, this is definitely a weaker-effect cream</li>
            <li> First of all, it got here lot faster than I expected (which it was big plus).</li>
            <li> It temporarily evened out my tone but did not last more than a few hours on a 80 degree sunny day w minimal sweating.  </li>
            <li> If you have younger, acne prone skin then you should try this Skin79 Hot Pink BB Cream.</li>
            <li> purchased both of Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink and Gold label BB Creams last month have been using them for about 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Missha Perfect Cover BB cream before, and hated the feeling of it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I think only good reviews are only posted on here because this product was really useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I loved the real makeup, but now I&#x27;m worried that I will keep receiving fakes.</li>
            <li> : admittedly, this is only the very first time i&#x27;ve used it, but after a few hours of it on, it feels like there&#x27;s barely anything on my face!</li>
            <li> But if you want a light everyday coverage then buy this!!</li>
            <li> I dotted a little bit on a paper towel, next to what&#x27;s left in my genuine Skin79 BB, and they not only looked identical, but also oxidized identically</li>
            <li> I dotted a little bit on a paper towel, next to what&#x27;s left in my genuine Skin79 BB, and they not only looked identical, but also oxidized identically</li>
            <li> The coverage is alright for my skin; I usually go back and add a little more to cover my acne scars and my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I also tried this on my mom (who is Korean but has a much darker skin tone than me...sort of a caramel color), as well as my friend&#x27;s mom (who is white but has very dry skin), and the tone adjusted to match them as well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the product really speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB Cream for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten it from Amazon (I usually get it from ebay but needed it ASAP).</li>
            <li> I like the product because it&#x27;s also gentle to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;the product blends well with other powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and thick, but feels lightweight on the face.  </li>
            <li> I applied two coats to half of my face (the equivalent of one squirt) and it noticeably whitened some of the natural redness in my cheeks but obviously didn&#x27;t do much for the acne on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin looks smoother but only provides a medium coverage, If you are looking for a bb cream that gives you a natural look, this is definitely the bb cream for you.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned at first that this wouldn&#x27;t go well with my skin because I&#x27;m not Korean</li>
            <li> and so it matches my (medium complexion Asian) skin tone much better than other Korean BB&#x27;s, which tend to be made for very pale skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on dark (which again, worried me haha)</li>
            <li> Since BB Creams are meant to apply only a little ammount (a pea size to your entire face, maybe a little more)</li>
            <li> You barely need a big pump.</li>
            <li> Usually, at the end of the day, I look worn out but this makes my face look fresh</li>
            <li> I am interested to see how my skin reacts to the product in a few days since</li>
            <li> I have dry cheeks, but a super oily t-zone, so in the end I went with the pink label, but make sure you put on lotion or moisturizer, because a couple days I was lazy, and it dried out my cheeks a bit since they are dry already,and I have flaky skin</li>
            <li> The price of the cream is decent compared to other brands as well.</li>
            <li> pretty pale (Mac foundation NC 20 for reference).</li>
            <li> and at first you think you look ultra pale...</li>
            <li> A pea size or less is about all you need to generously cover your whole face.    </li>
            <li> My skin is combination and prone to looking shiny in some spots, but I chose to use this over a moisturizer (Lush&#x27;s vanishing cream) because this product seems like it would stick to and accentuate dry spots and the moisturizer helped the balm glide over my skin easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it literally takes me less than 10 minutes to get ready.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a pretty pale Asian</li>
            <li> Im white with olive undertones, skin is pretty pale during the colder months though)</li>
            <li> I would not suggest this product to those with very dry or mature skin.</li>
            <li> After using it for a while (a month?), I haven&#x27;t seen THAT much of a difference to my face, but I do notice that my face has gotten a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I love BB cream, and I will only buy the skin79 because other brands are not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> It may be a little more but at least you can be assured that there is t anything harmful I.</li>
            <li> The white may be a little too much</li>
            <li> Only a little bit is enough for your whole face.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered very fast, and according to the web, the one I received is REAL, not one of the fake ones that some people are apparently receiving.  </li>
            <li> So for anyone that wants a light makeup base that will also benefit your skin by healing it, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The BB cream is thick and appears gray when freshly applied.</li>
            <li> Decent coverage and dries matte without the grey tint seen in a lot of other BB creams.  </li>
            <li> But, be aware the main demographic for this BB cream are people of Asian ethnicity (Who usually have a ver yellow undertone), so it can look a little grayish.</li>
            <li> Coverage is just right, but for those who have dark post acne marks, brown spots or dark circles under the eyes might need an extra concealer.</li>
            <li> I use this all year long as a primer/base and put a little foundation over it since it&#x27;s a little light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It blends so well and actually looks natural compared to other foundations and BB Creams.</li>
            <li> I may try some other brands in the future, but I will be surprised if they surpass the effectiveness I&#x27;ve found here.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other products, a little goes a long way, and a little stays on.</li>
            <li> As everyone knows the Hot Pink SKIN79 goes on a little gray, and then blends into your skin tone.</li>
            <li> pink undertone, consistancy thick, blendable but will have a light white cast on face dry with a powder finish on face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use much makeup (eyeliner and mascara sometimes) because of the cake-y feeling and the constant fear of rubbing it off.</li>
            <li> And application of the BB creams was reminiscent of applying high spf suncreen that gives you a pale complexion, so the mineral foundation to set the BB cream was a must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try some other brands (Dr. Jart+) before settling down on a type, but Skin79 is really up there on the likely to repurchase list!    </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to my beauty</li>
            <li> my dark circles completely.</li>
            <li> As I said before if you apply a small amount it won&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> re-watched multiple Youtube videos on real vs. fake Skin79 BB cream), and decided that this was the real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also long lasting (no blotting), which I like.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting product.</li>
            <li> First of all, buy it from Pink Gelee seller (authentic!)&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I am half black and my skin is pretty tan (think Rihanna&#x27;s shade) and in order to match it, I add a little bit of my foundation to it and wahla!</li>
            <li> , my skin actually cleared up a little from switching from my old foundation to this BB cream.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get nice coverage and it&#x27;ll look a little weird or you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s major because I have extremely skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried it was going to be a fake, but it turned out to be the real deal and worked very well.</li>
            <li> I woul suggest using this if you only have dry skin.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is much darker than I had remembered (my sister has this bb cream</li>
            <li> Also, this is definitely for oily skin so stay away if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> This came in several days earlier than expected, in time for my trip to 90</li>
            <li> in the future i will use missha 23 just because it is my skin tone, besides the limited color of skin 79</li>
            <li> Actually, I have noticed that when I do try to apply a loose powder to set it, my skin does appear too \\&quot;made-up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Once I put on my regular concealer (of which I use less, now) and Bare Minerals, it&#x27;s like those issues have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The last one is, if you look in the box, It should say &amp;#34;SKIN 79&amp;#34; and there should be American writing on one wall of the box and other Korean languages inside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually the lightest foundation I can find (ivory/ classic ivory).</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to see that this dark color blended so well into my skin!</li>
            <li> If I weren&#x27;t so crazy about constantly trying new things, I would have stopped right here and labeled this my HG bb.  </li>
            <li> And unlike foundations, the scent is kind of like lotion and NOT have that bad chemical scent.</li>
            <li> If the Bb and skin 79 logo does not have a rainbow effect in the light and rubs off very easily it is a fake.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been really into taking care of my skin lately</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth, silky finish for my skin, without looking fake or even made up.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and it covers enough that I don&#x27;t spend the extra $ or effort on a concealer.  </li>
            <li> it caused acne and made my skin look grey.. not for me.</li>
            <li> it is oily and wil not stay long on face ..</li>
            <li> It does however leave my skin looking a tad grey.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit grey.</li>
            <li> and I completely regret it, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells strange</li>
            <li> It does go on grey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding make make up that covers my flaws and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> When I use it this way, it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It also takes a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I tried this for the first time and applied a thin layer to my entire face to cover up some blemishes as well as to even out my face.</li>
            <li> I came out to thick and cakey, so I was unsure how the Hot Pink one would come out.</li>
            <li> The grey hue that other reviewers mentioned is very subtle in my opinion, barely noticable, and it actually matches the shade of my skin, which is pretty tan.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin natural rather than pale.</li>
            <li> this one.i have normal to oily skin,and not super dark</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to my beauty products!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very high quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other ones from the same line, this would be the darkest.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it now, I&#x27;ve realized after watching YouTube tutorials that I had been applying it all wrong!</li>
            <li> I got this so much earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also compared it to several other bb creams including Mischa.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lasting me as you only need a little.</li>
            <li> the visibility of my pores and other discoloration of skin(minor red marks) are</li>
            <li> At first I thought the product was too thick for me, because it did remind me of sunscreen, but after a minute or two of application it almost felt like I had nothing on my face!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long</li>
            <li> I had no issues, shipping was reasonable considering I live outside the US and shipping usually costs $20 (completely ridiculous!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reference: Tan, Dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I have to mention that it does dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry</li>
            <li> Some people say you don&#x27;t need a moisturizer before you put it on, but I have quite dry skin</li>
            <li> I do have dry spots as well during winter.  </li>
            <li> It is not for people who have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Holds up well against oil and humidity, and does not amplify dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single issue with this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about getting a fake product, but I ordered from Pink Gelee [twice] and both are authentic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the oriental in the past but did not like it half as much as this one.</li>
            <li> Stats: I have normal skin, slight acne scars, a somewhat uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if it is fraud, as far as I know</li>
            <li> I have a couple of skin issues that I prefer to hide - some reddish patches on one of my cheeks, a perpetually red nose and some seriously dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have done EVERYTHING to even out my skin tone and try to cover and heal dark spots left over from some acne scaring.</li>
            <li> so I obviously cannot speak to the decrease in appearance of my dark spots</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Amazon lists the same product from multiple sellers under one listing, and some may very well be fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side is</li>
            <li> They will last me for years because a little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> am 7 month pregnant and did a a very thorough job researching real vs fake Skin79 BB Cream, as I do not want to put unknown cosmetics on my skin.</li>
            <li> Did notice, if you are a little tan that usual or use too much product you get a grayish tint to your face.</li>
            <li> It has a horrible gray undertone which is very unnatural, I&#x27;m frankly quite confused about all the good reviews on here!</li>
            <li> 002 Vanilla so the BB Cream is SLIGHTLY lighter than my skin and you can only notice if you apply a thicker layer.</li>
            <li> and it actually makes my face less shiny.</li>
            <li> I do find that I need less foundation overall.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually noticing a decrease in the small bumps (not actual break outs).</li>
            <li> Only half a pump is needed for covering the face.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets 4 stars because when it goes on it has a slight gray color that needs time to seep into your skin</li>
            <li> grey shade is noticeable only after a few mins of application,&lt;br /&gt;afterwards</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely a light-feeling, seems to cover a bit less than Missha (my skin still has some imperfections that the MISSHA bb cream would&#x27;ve covered up)</li>
            <li> It covers most redness, acne, dark circles, hyperpigmentation, and unevenness almost as an expensive foundation would without feeling heavy on my skin or looking cakey.</li>
            <li> I had never used a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; BB cream, but I know regular foundation is too heavy for my skin, and tinted moisturizers aren&#x27;t quite enough for my minor pore issue and few blemishes.</li>
            <li> I put it on with a cosmetic sponge before putting on any other makeup, then brush my teeth or something to give it time to dry.  </li>
            <li> The BB cream came in its pink box, and was accompanied with not only a sample of VIP gold cream, but also a sample of BB cleanser and a little bookmark from seoulglamour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unlike other bb creams that are usually dry, it also moisturizes.</li>
            <li> it is not heavy and you can hardly tell you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> super sad this was just like every other foundation for me.</li>
            <li> Despite being fake, the consistency is quite similar and has not broken me out yet.</li>
            <li> After a few days later, my skin was glowing and my acne redness cleared away (thus still using my treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I put in and order of this pink label BB cream as well as the VIP gold edition.</li>
            <li> I squirted a pump of the pink label on my hand as well as a pump of the vip gold edition.</li>
            <li> is noy pink</li>
            <li> I order the pink one n received the brown one.</li>
            <li> Not really acne prone</li>
            <li> Was worried about color matching (it comes out of the pump a bit gray/beige), but applied to center of face and blended out</li>
            <li> Thank you PINK GELEE(:</li>
            <li> with the pink I do not even need foundation..</li>
            <li> I am extremely careful about what I put on my skin bc of my sensitivity</li>
            <li> Pink Gelee sent it asap</li>
            <li> I have been using my BB cream for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Unlike me, her skin is fair/white with some pink tones.  </li>
            <li> I know the seller says Pink Gelee</li>
            <li> , I use Gold for colder, drier days and Pink on cool/warmer</li>
            <li> I got this from PINK GELEE</li>
            <li> terrible really wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with a warm skin tone, it makes you look dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I had a little left in my last bottle of this product, and am very paranoid about using fake products on my skin since I&#x27;ve accidentally used a fake Hot Pink BB cream before</li>

            <li> Asian, early-20&#x27;s, pale skin w/ rosy undertones,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pale (not asian, not ivory skinned...</li>
            <li> The two products and packaging looked EXACTLY the same, except that one made me breakout like crazy and made my skin oily and the other was slightly fragranced different and did not make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail today and it came in a strange black bag from South Korea.  </li>
            <li> (I started with a huge red mountain on my chin :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;So all in all, if you expected a magical cream that will cover up pores, blemishes, and moisturize....then you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Several dark areas of uneven tanning is neutralized, and shine control is quite good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Creamy, but heavy texture and coverage, and the shade (there&#x27;s only one) is too gray and dark for my lighter skin.  </li>
            <li> The pink one is a little bit dry for me</li>
            <li> (little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> It covers well for me, but I do not have problematic skin, so coverage is not a worry of mine…and a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is Caucasian and quite pale (dark blonde hair with freckles, if that helps.)</li>
            <li> Even after applying a generous amount of moisturizer before applying this BB cream my face still felt dry and tight.  </li>

            <li> This product does break my skin out, but because I am not a consistent day to day user, I cannot determine if this is because my skin is not fully used to the product yet.</li>
            <li> (although if I had to wear any other than this bb cream, I&#x27;d still wear mineral).</li>
            <li> They contradict each other.</li>
            <li> Other cons</li>
            <li> (it was from other seller) but</li>
            <li> and I will purchase other Skin 79 BB cream varieties.</li>
            <li> used it all summer without any other make up.  </li>
            <li> ; persuaded by reviewers on MUA and other sites:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Skin79 due to the reviews and the benefits of medium coverage, anti-wrinkle properties, and SPF.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t usually wear make up but want something to cover the dullness of my skin tone, and this totally does it.</li>
            <li> According to Skin79&#x27;s official website, the BB creams no longer include a perforated box or authenticity sticker (since January 2013), and they removed the &amp;#34;KFDA 3-functions certification&amp;#34; text from the bottle on (July 2013), along with other design changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when buying this!</li>
            <li> I use this as I would any other foundation</li>
            <li> This is like any other make up product</li>
            <li> yes it is a shade or two too pale, but after like ten minutes (usually less)</li>
            <li> I have some pretty bad dark circles compared to my pale white skin) - the dark circles are completely covered and I used a lot less cream in the eye area than I&#x27;d ever use foundation or concealer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there is very minimal shine.</li>
            <li> but I was a bit worried about the \\&quot;gray\\&quot; and how pale I would be, since I am naturally tan year round, and a lot of reviews or videos are pale people, and if not they mix with foundation, and</li>
            <li> I have very pink undertones in my skin</li>
            <li> Everything was great for a few days, and then my face broke out in horrible acne all over.  </li>
            <li> She worked late to send my package out sooner than expected, and contacted me personally to let me know.  </li>
            <li> What is really curious about it is that once on, one waits a few minutes, and it adjusts to your skin tone, and this with a wide range.</li>
            <li> Just for kicks (and to see the difference between the two), I applied the pink label to half of my face and the gold edition to the other half.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily from forehead down to nose, and dry the other half, so I was a little unsure how the cream would work.</li>
            <li> This has a slight grey tint, but it works for my pale skin tone.   </li>
            <li> I did a little bit of research before ordering and went with Pink Gelee because I saw some YouTube reviews about them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item when I was drunk, but here is a warning to all other drunk shoppers: this is not a good BB cream for warm skin tones!  </li>
            <li> I was upset to find a small chamber with little moisturizer in the big bottle!</li>
            <li> It gives me semi-perfect coverage (just because I only use a little bit) and I have been seeing it even out my skin tone for the past weeks since I received it.</li>
            <li> and it was a bit dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> But none the least, the second is helpful as well.</li>
            <li> some of you, I was really concerned about being sent a fake bottle and debated about whether I should order one or not.  </li>
            <li> I checked my item (which came on time) for authenticity, compared with helpful fake vs. real comparisons online</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with really dark skin, but I think even tan tones can use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect match to my skin, but it isn&#x27;t really a base/foundation product, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous of purchasing this product and to end up with a fake</li>
            <li> Did not know if I would get a fake or real product</li>
            <li> This BB cream has whitening properties, meaning that it can diminish or lighten dark spots, acne scars etc.</li>
            <li> You can watch the fake versus real comparison on Youtube.  </li>
            <li> Additional layers of cream can be applied to dark eye circles, sun spots, etc.</li>
            <li> It oxidizes a bit dark</li>
            <li> My skin color is kinda dark</li>
            <li> took the gold hands down.</li>
            <li> It dries down to a satin-matte finish.  </li>
            <li> I mean really tiny</li>
            <li> South Korea produces numerous high quality BB creams but they are hard to find in the States and can be expensive to ship.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly buildable, however, allowing me to skip concealer for my dark circles if need be.</li>
            <li> Let it sit for a few minutes while I&#x27;m doing other stuff then finish off with a powder</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefits like wrinkle reduction or getting rid of dark spots, but I guess it&#x27;s at least not making these things any worse.  </li>
            <li> Did not feel like a very heavy product,  and a little would go a long way.</li>
            <li> They shipped in about a week and a half, despite the estimated three weeks.</li>
            <li> I dont think this product would work for everyone, as it is not super concealing.</li>
            <li> This gives medium coverage but is slightly build-able.</li>
            <li> I thought this was weird because it should have been the commercial box since this is a commercial product.  </li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin, &amp; typically wear MAC 35 - 40 (winter vs summer) for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have had basically no acne (though I&#x27;m not super prone to breakouts)</li>
            <li> Got two small zits on my temple, not sure if it&#x27;s product related.</li>
            <li> The oilyness of my skin has reduced slightly, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about a half a pump each time I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super oily</li>
            <li> However, while applying it, it does have a slight gray color as some have said.  </li>
            <li> it also gives a slightly dewy look, so if you are wanting a matte finish, you will need to use a powder.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, in which, I mean the coverage was minimal.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it feels very slightly heavier than mineral makeup, but</li>
            <li> If you have heavy acne or a lot of dark spots, you may need a concealer.  </li>
            <li> It DOES apply a little thick with a slight grey hue</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too thin to make me feel like I have to put on a bunch to get decent coverage or too thick where I feel like I caked on the make up.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a loooong way.  </li>
            <li> but I say whats a little blending with powder or mixing some BB cream into your foundation.</li>
            <li> a little while ago i decided to try this product again</li>
            <li> I do wear a little pressed powder over mine and it lasts all day that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, but it&#x27;s a moisturizer, so that&#x27;s a given.</li>
            <li> I do tan dramatically in the summer, so I&#x27;m a little nervous that the shade won&#x27;t match, but we&#x27;ll have to see...</li>
            <li> Dab little dots of it all over your face</li>
            <li> and then again a little heavier on my blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is a little gray-ish, but don&#x27;t let that bother you -</li>
            <li> little, it has lasted for months because of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually the one I reach for over my other bb creams.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin moisturized and literally with a little glow.</li>
            <li> The texture is like a foundation but a little thicker because of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I think since I am on the somewhat oily skin type, it was little too moist for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this as little why not gifts to friends who have had interest and they&#x27;ve gotten hooked too.</li>
            <li> I think I bought the wrong one for my dry skin, but I&#x27;ll give it a go anyways and try the VIP Gold one next time.</li>
            <li> I let her know, and she wrote it down so she will probly buy some too !</li>
            <li> I also read a few reviews that claimed their pump wasn&#x27;t working,</li>
            <li> I have hyper pigmentation and an uneven skin tone 3)</li>
            <li> -----I&#x27;d like to revise this review as its been a few months and</li>
            <li> I like how this product does not feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> and Now I &#x60;m using it everyday.</li>
            <li> but it dried to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I have a few scars on my face and the BB Cream helps even out my skin.</li>
            <li> It had a green customs sticker with the box for gift checked off.  </li>
            <li> It was too heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I can recommend it to anyone who doesnt want to use all those heavy foundations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I find that I prefer this to my tinted moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t make me as oily and shiny, although I still needed to blot a few times.</li>
            <li> i have recommended to a few family members.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and makes my skin feel great--soft &amp; balanced.  </li>
            <li> But everyone says it should oxidize in a few minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people apply a few coats to cover blemishes, but I have a feeling that wouldn&#x27;t work out with my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend for heavy coverage.  </li>
            <li> compared/checked it with all those blogs that talk about fake skin79 bb cream and so far everything checks out&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> It feels like you&#x27;re applying lotion and smells slightly of sunscreen but applied quite well and required very little to cover everything.</li>
            <li> I also did not know if the product would match my skin tone because mine is not light but not dark its weird</li>
            <li> Too pale for my tanner skin</li>
            <li> It may make you look pale</li>
            <li> just pale).  </li>
            <li> it (I am terribly pale)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you are pale.</li>
            <li> so i dont look like a ghost or pale because it adapts to my skin color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To remove the BB cream, I use Pond&#x27;s classic cold</li>
            <li> So they send me samples of: skin inner moist nutritive essence, super + BB cream, and signature dramatic base boomer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in my dark spots and am slowly moving toward eliminating my concealor from my routine... not yet, but getting there...</li>
            <li> When I spread them out both on my skin, the Skin79 one blended perfectly; I seriously could not tell I had bb cream on my hand, unless i compared it to my other hand which didn&#x27;t have anything on it.  </li>
            <li> Some may find the limited skin color choice unappealing</li>
            <li> I still get very oily, but I don&#x27;t think it gets as bad as usual.  </li>
            <li> The seller also gave me few samples(2)!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my wrist with a small pump and dabbed it in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small, but noticeably uneven!</li>
            <li> not sure)</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> but it is not authentic.</li>
            <li> Sad that you can buy twice from same company and have this happen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss and raving was about after all.  </li>
            <li> so it usually needs something to even it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only does the expiration date read from 2012, the product appears to be a fake.</li>
            <li> I usually wear \\&quot;medium beige\\&quot; to \\&quot;tan\\&quot; in foundations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product would work on darker or olive skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually like scented cosmetics and/or skincare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that are my usual go to foundations.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about how well it covers freckles, moles, age spots or acne spots</li>
            <li> I put on two coats and then applied my usual finishing powder and bronzed powder.  </li>
            <li> instead, it is usually &amp;</li>
            <li> instead, it is usually &amp;</li>
            <li> and it tends to be oilier than not most of the time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it has faded any spots, I have been using for about a month.</li>
            <li> Bye, bye tinted moisturizer and everyday foundation!</li>
            <li> So I decided if it was fake, I&#x27;d just send it back.</li>
            <li> Just faint enough to know its there.</li>
            <li> I usually use about 0.5-1 pump to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> but my face is usually a lot whiter than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I do hate that you can&#x27;t see how much is left in it, so I have to keep an extra on hand just in</li>
            <li> At first it feels disgusting on the skin, but then it sinks in.</li>
            <li> I took noticed that are hardly any reviews about BB cream working on medium skin tones.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to blend at times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe.</li>
            <li> And I would have given this 5 stars, but I was being hard for the greasy feeling toward the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> And I would have given this 5 stars, but I was being hard for the greasy feeling toward the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> For $9.99 plus shipping, there was hardly anything to lose.</li>
            <li> However, I decided what the hell, never gonna know if I don&#x27;t try it, and at least it&#x27;s affordable.  </li>
            <li> it did not have any negative impact on my skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have a difficult time buying foundations and concealers because they usually end up too dark or orange.</li>
            <li> but I suggest viewing at least one to familiarize yourself with the product.</li>
            <li> again, the US market is slow on bringing out BB creams, and I&#x27;m not convinced the US drugstore versions are anything besides repackaged foundation.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of getting a fake product because of all the fake knock offs out there, but this one was a genuine product from seoulglamour.</li>
            <li> thick creamy lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reflective label is thick and iridescent&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> And I mean a loooong time before you run out.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to receive an expired product…by nearly 2 years!</li>
            <li> Since I never tried any other BB cream, sorry I cannot compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The FAKE one I got was from a seller that also sold me the REAL sample size ones, so I&#x27;m not going to bad mouth that seller.</li>
            <li> According to this government site, \\&quot;Use of these skin creams can cause serious health problems including problems with the nervous system, kidneys, skin, blood pressure, and digestive tract.</li>
            <li> my face is getting clearer with less spots because I got fake nails to stop the picking.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product because the formulation was heavy and did not match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> 90% gone;&lt;br /&gt;the layer of cream doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or suffocating the skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Do not waste anymore money on overpriced crap makeup.</li>
            <li> Wish it had worked for me, but unfortunately I&#x27;ll be sticking with what I&#x27;ve been using in the past.</li>
            <li> With cold weather approaching, I&#x27;m hoping this creamy texture will help since people tends to have drier skin during the cold weather season.</li>
            <li> It was thick and didn&#x27;t blend well, not to mention I probably got the wrong shade.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Mac and got tired of it clogging up my pores and looking like</li>
            <li> The packaging is broken on one of them..</li>
            <li> foundation was getting annoying, especially since my skin is oily.</li>
            <li> Occassionally I wear Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Camouflage concealer over the BB cream.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending tons of money on designer brands, so I tried this</li>
            <li> was a little afraid to order this product through Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to receive a fake.</li>
            <li> It is not incredibly moisturizing</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to order makeover through Amazon because I&#x27;m afraid it would be fake.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t recommend it because it made my face skin tone sooo uneven!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.   </li>
            <li> My biggest concern with ordering this skin79 BB cream from any online website was being sent a fake skin79 product.</li>
            <li> I tell everyone withing earshot about how effing genius it is.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.</li>
            <li> But that being said, I do believe I bought a fake.</li>
            <li> I have watched a ton of videos and read articles on how to tell what is fake.</li>
            <li> It goes on a rather weird grayish color, but keep blending</li>
            <li> I knew it was a fake.</li>
            <li> The bottle wasn&#x27;t circular and the writing looked completely fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am never ordering make up from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is real or fake, but I didn&#x27;t like the consistency and the way it looked.</li>
            <li> Even though some of them read &amp;#34;FAKE&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t know which seller sells the fake ones.</li>
            <li> But then some days it blends and oxidizes well with my skin, its kinda weird.</li>
            <li> The bottle that I received was fake.  </li>
            <li> I was weary before ordering it because I did not want to receive a fake.</li>
            <li> This product is made from ash and fake product factory worker&#x27;s tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never got a &amp;#34;free random gift&amp;#34; with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Some sellers may send you a fake product.</li>
            <li> Since it is difficult to find Korean BB creams</li>
            <li> is going to cause a breakout (I mean so bad that if my husband even touches my face I will break out from the oils on his skin), and that did not happen after using this cream.</li>
            <li> I like how it is slightly water repellent, so it doesn&#x27;t come melting off of my face if it starts to rain.</li>
            <li> However, I forgot to take into consideration that summer is comming up and that I tan like crazy</li>
            <li> terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> Coverage was terrible, made my skin break out, waste of money.  </li>
            <li> sorry for that!</li>
            <li> omg this stuff is made as plaster for those scary looking mannequins in stores!</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne, and used to do the impossible with covering them up, given the fact that I also used my treatments.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> nt so bad</li>
            <li> It will provide some coverage, but if you have really bad skin (severe acne, for instance)</li>
            <li> This product made me break out so bad that even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li> Daughter bought it without realizing it had parabens. :(</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it didn&#x27;t break my skin</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described. And It does a great job as a BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging and the color of the BB cream is suitable for most people.</li>
            <li> This is the legitimate SKIN79 BB cream. So much cheaper than buying it from the actual site. I encourage anyone who likes this product to order it.</li>
            <li> In my 30&#x27;s decided to buy for the summer months.  I like it with bronzer on top.  Lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> I just got this super fast only took 2 weeks maybe to get here to the States. This is the real deal, i was worried about fakes etc, and if you want to find out more about dif fakes there are a ton of youtubes out there to help you see the difference. Well mine is real! yay! Also i wore it today and it really is great, matches my nc20-25 skin fine and seems to work on my oily combo skin really well. I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to foundation, something more lightweight for the summer, so I decided to try BB cream. It has a super cute packaging &amp; I like the feeling of it on my face. However, the color of this BB creme is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> I received this very quickly. Seller is awesome. Having read so many wonderful reviews, decided to try it out for myself. It definitely makes me lighter than normal, coverage is rather sheer to slightly medium, my redness from fresh acnes needed additional covering but it did make my skin seem rather even toned...the disappoint was from my own skin&#x27;s response. I broke out while using this...sigh...will continue the search for the perfect makeup...</li>
            <li> B.B. Cream has been such a great beauty product to have because it&#x27;s so versatile.  I am able to use it as a foundation.  It&#x27;s light and blends into your skin.  It&#x27;s wonderful as a primer as well.  Long-lasting and helps very much with evening your skin tone.  I love love love B.B. Cream! Can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> I must say that this product is AMAZING. I suffer from acne, and used to do the impossible with covering them up, given the fact that I also used my treatments. Recently I noticed that my foundation has been lacking in many ways such as greasy, flaky, and unable to blend in. I finally gave in, bought it, and couldn&#x27;t be any happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing i did was to make sure it was authentic...and it was! The seller also gave me few samples(2)! I tried it on my wrist with a small pump and dabbed it in a circular motion. Within seconds to a minute it completely abosorbed well. The product is light, so you can&#x27;t feel it which is great. After a few days later, my skin was glowing and my acne redness cleared away (thus still using my treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the purpose of buying foundations and powders when you have this? I got rid of them! BB cream has now been the only thing i used for replacement of foundations, concealers, and powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I took noticed that are hardly any reviews about BB cream working on medium skin tones. I am around a natural to medium beige and it blends in very well. BB cream did amazing on my latina skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also &#x27;promoted&#x27; the product to my friends of all skin tones to try it and it was a success. Will be buying more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB Cream for about 2 weeks now, and so far I have gotten great results. The cream covers my old acne scars and has been lightening them since I&#x27;ve started using it.  It evens out my skin color and gives a nice finish to my skin. The only downside is that it does come out very light, though not light enough to make a noticeable difference between the tones of my face and my neck.  However, I forgot to take into consideration that summer is comming up and that I tan like crazy (In the winter, I&#x27;m relatively light), so I&#x27;m not sure how well that&#x27;ll work out with the lightness of the BB Cream. We&#x27;ll see what happens with that.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product through my Korean friend and it seemed too good to be true. I ordered my bottle and today is the first day I used it and I love it! I have very oily skin and there is very minimal shine. I love the way my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is my first B.B Cream and I must say what a positive surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I used it all over my face and my most worry-some place is my T-zone which is very oily compared to the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin soft, smooth and not oily or shiny at all  on top of that it blended in very well.&lt;br /&gt;The other problem area I wanted to use the B.B Cream on was the eye area(and I have some pretty bad dark circles compared to my pale white skin) - the dark circles are completely covered and I used a lot less cream in the eye area than I&#x27;d ever use foundation or concealer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does not look or feel cakey at all !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cream does not feel heavy or oily - though it works better if your own skin is a bit oily/combination; using a good moisturizer before it is good for better application.&lt;br /&gt;Covers way better than a tinted moisturizer or at some parts of the face covers better than a concealer/foundation ( ...for me at least (: ).&lt;br /&gt;Conceals my dark circles completely. Works with my pale, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing is that it&#x27;s authentic - or well, is a very fine replica (...which I doubt, haha). Checked a YouTube video for all the authenticity points - all checks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased from Pink Gelee, Thanks.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the product, was really excited about the fact that it had sunscreen in it and might be an alternative to foundation on weekends.  Everything was great for a few days, and then my face broke out in horrible acne all over.  It has taken nearly 2 weeks to clear up, and I still have redness from the breakouts to deal with.  Wish it had worked for me, but unfortunately I&#x27;ll be sticking with what I&#x27;ve been using in the past.</li>
            <li> Deliver fast. And the product is super fresh Feb 2012. It does have sort of gray tone but after you apply it on your face,it totally disappear. I am using it every day now.</li>
            <li> Daughter bought it without realizing it had parabens. :(</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s authentic based on other&#x27;s review on YouTube. it makes my skin natural rather than pale. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this BB Cream I really did. Especially because I was told this product was good for combination skin. Well....I really wasnt impressed. The coverage was like to medium at best and it was hard to blend at times. I also didnt like the greyish cast that the BB cream had.     I bought this with the lioele triple the solution BB cream and lioele took the gold hands down. I recommend buying that one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Missha Perfect Cover BB cream before, and hated the feeling of it on my skin.  It was thick and didn&#x27;t blend well, not to mention I probably got the wrong shade.  Then I got a sample of Skin79 Triple Function pink label and loved it!  It was light and absorbed easily into my skin.  I like a natural look, and this looks like I didn&#x27;t even put any make up on.  I thought the color would be too light and the coverage too sheer, but this turns out just right.  I also tried the gold edition as well, but that one just felt off somehow.  I&#x27;m sticking to this pink BB cream until I find another one that works better.  I bought this from seoulglamor and it&#x27;s definitely the real product!</li>
            <li> The seller was great first of all. Fast shipping and even included a nice thank you note. I just love those. The product is great! I researched these some before buying and I am pleased with this one. I will be getting the gold one as well. I loved the sample. For me the product replaces the need for moisturizer, primer, and SPF. (I will be honest I was skipping SPF) I just put this on. Let it sit for a few minutes while I&#x27;m doing other stuff then finish off with a powder and I&#x27;m good to go! How easy!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good company to buy from.  They have delivered my purchase on the third day of the estimated time of delivery.  As for the product, it was okay.  It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, in which, I mean the coverage was minimal.  I was hoping it would help blot out my blemishes, but turns out just okay.  I would definitely try Missha next time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has great coverage and you don&#x27;t need more than a pump for you face. If you are anything other than light or fair, it will now work well for you. It has great staying power ( I live in a hot, humid climate) and does not make me break out. I do wash off every night though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.   I&#x27;ve tried this tinted moisturizer and it causes my face to break out in places I normally don&#x27;t have acne. I&#x27;ve tried it again and again, but the result is always the same. A day after I put it on, my face breaks out. They&#x27;re small, but noticeably uneven! Too bad. I loved BB cream, except for that.</li>
            <li> 1st time to try BB cream and really love it with a dusting of finishing powder. Best price I could find on this product.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is not for oily skin. It covers imperfections pretty good, but my face looked like i just took a oil bath. I use it when i go to the beach, it gives SPF and covers redness on m y face.</li>
            <li> The BB cream is light and yet covers fairly well. You don&#x27;t even need a large amount to cover your entire face. The added benefits sound nice and may possibly be true but I have not seen a great change in my skin over the few times that I have worn them. It&#x27;s worth investing into and trying it out. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews for products on Amazon. For this, though, I just had to share. I don&#x27;t usually use much makeup (eyeliner and mascara sometimes) because of the cake-y feeling and the constant fear of rubbing it off. My skin is oily from forehead down to nose, and dry the other half, so I was a little unsure how the cream would work. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now.  The result: Amazingly even skin tone, covered my acne scars, and blended in after about five minutes for me. My skin tone is medium olive right now (I tan easily, and has just begun to lighten with coming of winter). Skin79 bb cream actually didn&#x27;t lighten it all that much but made everything consistent- no oily sheen and no flaky dry skin. Love it, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which a lot of products do. In fact, my acne has diminished since I used it. I will definitely be buying more.  As for the seller, seoulglamour, I highly recommend them. They shipped in about a week and a half, despite the estimated three weeks. Great packaging, the authenticity sticker was there, along with a few sample products (I&#x27;ve yet to try them).</li>
            <li> I bought this item when I was drunk, but here is a warning to all other drunk shoppers: this is not a good BB cream for warm skin tones!  I am Mexican, Sicilian and French with light medium skin (I wear fairly medium in the Bare Essentials line) and it turned my skin grey.  When I had finally rubbed it in enough so that I no longer looked like a corpse, I didn&#x27;t notice any change.  It did what any dollar store lotion would do if it were mixed with a dab of dollar store foundation.  What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase skin 79 pink bb cream. First of all, it got here lot faster than I expected (which it was big plus). This is the second bb cream brand that I&#x27;m using (my first was Dr Jart water fuse bb cream), and although skin 79 gives better coverage, I&#x27;m not sure if it helped with my oily skin(which is the latest issue I&#x27;m dealing with) I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for almost a week, and I&#x27;m noticing more blemishes on my face. With cold weather approaching, I&#x27;m hoping this creamy texture will help since people tends to have drier skin during the cold weather season.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple weeks back &amp; ive been hooked ever since! it saves sooo much time in the mornings as it acts as your moisturizer, primer, and foundation. I just put this on, set it with powder cuz i have oily skin &amp; im out the door. :) I will definitely be repurchasing, and stocking up!</li>
            <li> I bought my Product from Pink Gelee and it just arrived TODAY! I am so excited with the packaging, it is so cute, the bottle is really small, I was expecting to be the size of a pop can and its the same height as my MAC Studio Fix foundation but the bottle is a lot thicker. Obviously most of us don&#x27;t buy it because of the packaging but it is always a plus. Really Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product, I am a YouTube Beauty Guru so I am really picky with my foundations, tinted moistorizers and etc. This is my first BB Cream and I wasn&#x27;t very sure if I would like it or not, especially because of my oily skin. I just recieved it today so my review won&#x27;t be that accurate (I will be doing another review in my YouTube Channel: BeautyByRenata or Renataps88) in about a week but as soon as I opened the package I tested it on my hands and face, it feels really light and kinda of fresh and has a really really light scent (I am really sensitive for scents) so I am glad it does not have a strong scent. It smells like sunscreen but REALLY lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a MAC NC15 on MAC, Revlon Colorstay Combation to Oily Skin 105 Buff, Revlon PhotoReady 002 Vanilla so the BB Cream is SLIGHTLY lighter than my skin and you can only notice if you apply a thicker layer. Since BB Creams are meant to apply only a little ammount (a pea size to your entire face, maybe a little more) then it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Plus I apply my Studio Fix or Mineralize Skin Finish Natural (NC20 and Light Plus) over with a kabuki blush and it evens out everything. As I said I don&#x27;t know how well my skin will react in one week but I am really pleased with the product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase a BB Cream because I am really focused on improving my skin and this BB Cream has Wrinkle Improvement, SPF 25, works as a moisturizer, sebum control and whitening so I really can&#x27;t ask for more. Plus you can also use this on your eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend this product if you are fair I think this will work Between MAC NC or NW 15 til 30 maybe 35 (not sure) and I think because of the light grey tone that it will look better if you have a pink undertone opposed to my yellow undertone but for me the light grey tone is not a huge deal and doesn&#x27;t look so evident. But before you go out after using this, make sure you double check in the mirror because the product oxidizes a little bit and turns a tiny tiny bit darker. As I said before if you apply a small amount it won&#x27;t really matter. Also It has a light to medium coverage, pretty great coverage for a bb cream. If you want to watch my review after a week just leave a comment on my channel (My main channel (renataps88) is in portuguese so I will be recording a review in portuguese and if you guys want I can record in english as well and post on my second channel (BeautyByRenata)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really Hope this review is helpful for you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renata</li>
            <li> One star for the tricky tactics! ... I thought I was paying more cash for more product but this is was I found! Look to the pictures where the bb cream container fell apart... I was upset to find a small chamber with little moisturizer in the big bottle! I started to buy the smaller trial size because its cheaper and you get more products for just a fraction of the cost. Don&#x27;t be fooled!  It does work I couldn&#x27;t live without it. But I don&#x27;t like being scammed!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I have been considering this product after figuring out that this BB cream would be best for me (affordability wise, and compatible with my skin type) but I was a bit worried about the \\&quot;gray\\&quot; and how pale I would be, since I am naturally tan year round, and a lot of reviews or videos are pale people, and if not they mix with foundation, and I don&#x27;t want to have to mix products. (I&#x27;m Japanese American, but a lot of people say I could pass as Indian, also for reference, I live in New England, so I&#x27;m not crazy extreme stay in the sun 24-7 tan, or been in a booth all the time tan, think natural medium-dark tan) However, I decided what the hell, never gonna know if I don&#x27;t try it, and at least it&#x27;s affordable.  I was also very worried if it would be a legitimate product.  So, now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile I can tell you:&lt;br /&gt;  1.)  It is the legit product.  I was worried because I&#x27;m cheap and wanted to buy from amazon, but no fear!&lt;br /&gt;  2.)  I highly recommend purchasing from Seoulglamour. Amazon said it would arrive between March 23 and April 17, and I got it more than a week before the first date...I got it March 12. Plus, this was all I ordered, and got 3 free samples, two of them Missha, the other the vip gold Skin79.  Sweet.  I always like free.&lt;br /&gt;  3.)  I have no problem with a gray color.  When I apply it (with my fingers) yes it is a shade or two too pale, but after like ten minutes (usually less) it matches mine pretty close, and I no longer have the sticky feeling you feel when first applying.  It kind of feels like lotion before it dries when you first apply.  Anyway, then it&#x27;s smooth and light feeling, no cake look, and it really just looks like I had superb skin to start with.  It also hides the red blotches of pimples well (I started with a huge red mountain on my chin :( but it wasn&#x27;t too noticable, just on side angles cuz you could see it protruding), covers my veins (I&#x27;m 18, but have always had prominent veins on my face), and I swear have had less break outs, acne wise.  I have dry cheeks, but a super oily t-zone, so in the end I went with the pink label, but make sure you put on lotion or moisturizer, because a couple days I was lazy, and it dried out my cheeks a bit since they are dry already,and I have flaky skin so it didn&#x27;t look good.  So keep in mind, if you have combination skin or otherwise, it&#x27;s just good to moisturize your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It really does seem like a keeper miracle product to me.  It is also long lasting (no blotting), which I like.  All I do is dust a bit of powder on top and voila!  I look great!&lt;br /&gt;  4.)  A little goes a loooong way.  I have leftover if I use a full pump, half is like plenty to generously coat my face and neck.  It is also very buildable, for those places that need a little extra, and very light.&lt;br /&gt;  5.)  I really love the pump.  It&#x27;s sanitary, and not messy.  I also read a few reviews that claimed their pump wasn&#x27;t working, well it took a good three or four pumps to get product out for the first time.  It is new afterall,so just be patient.  My sister thinks the packaging itself makes her want it lol :)&lt;br /&gt;  6.)  I bought this as a foundation alternative for cosplay and special occasions, because I always break out with foundation and have sensitive skin, but you know, I might just use it forever.  It&#x27;s that awesome to me.  Definitely will repurchase in future.  Just make sure you test not on your face at first (obviously) in case you do have a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;  This definitely lived up to the hype for me, and I hope it will for you too!  I hoped this helped, I read like all the reviews on several sites, but still took me awhile to decide, so I tried to address what I felt wasn&#x27;t too clear to me.  Good Luck! wow, this ended up a lot longer than I intended! sorry for that!</li>
            <li> I was very worried about the authenticity of this cream and reading horror stories of people getting fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller, seoulglamour, ships the real deal. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I was just really excited about getting this BB cream and it was real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared it to MissKaharas youtube video,\\&quot;Skin79: Real vs. Fake\\&quot; to confirm the authenticity. It is real. I&#x27;ve also uploaded a couple of pictures as well for you guys to see. They&#x27;re not very high quality but I hope they help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipping was pretty fast from Korea, I ordered it on March 11,2012 (Sunday) and it arrive March 23,2012 (Friday). I live in Texas so 10 business days is pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not paid, hired or anything. Just super excited to get this cream for half the price! I might just buy a couple more to stock up. :)</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for in BB Creams after researching various ones. It is perfect for light coverage everyday since I don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of make-up at work.</li>
            <li> Save yourself time and money by buying this product. It is amazing AND does everything it advertises to do....shocking I know. Do not waste anymore money on overpriced crap makeup. I&#x27;ve had my BB cream for a month now and my skin looks better than ever and I look naturally beautiful instead of fake and over done. Soooooo glad I came across this and will be buying a few more. They will last me for years because a little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> First off if you receive a BB cream from seoulglamour check that it&#x27;s real. I recently purchased a Hot pink BB cream from the seller seoulglamour who claimed that it was authentic. Well the  ox is authentic and it does ship from Korea but it is not authentic. A couple of ways you can tell is if the BB logo and the skin 79 logo rubs off easily, also there should be a sticker at the top. If the Bb and skin 79 logo does not have a rainbow effect in the light and rubs off very easily it is a fake. I will not use the product because fakes can have any harmfull stuff in them. I would suggest buying from a authentic website like pretty and cute or sasa. It may be a little more but at least you can be assured that there is t anything harmful I. Your skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and I did not have any problems with the seller. I believe it was an authentic product.  The BB cream had good coverage and at first I really liked it.  However, I started noticing that it was making my skin break out and that I was having to use more and more of the product to cover up my breakouts.  I also noticed that at night when I would wash my face I would have to wash it several times to attempt to get all the residue off of my face ( which was probably the cause of my breakouts) Everyone has different skin so I&#x27;m sure it works beautifully for many, it just didn&#x27;t work out for me!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the service of the seller of this product. I had no issues, shipping was reasonable considering I live outside the US and shipping usually costs $20 (completely ridiculous!). I&#x27;ve never bought anything online before, but I could only get this BB cream online so I had to give it a go. It was shipped very quickly. It was packaged very securely and safely, I liked that there was a mini sample of another product and a personal thank you note from the seller. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the BB cream! It&#x27;t light weight yet has good coverage, it smooths my skin and makes me look pore-less, and it mattifies my oily skin. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good things about this, I love it!!! I can&#x27;t see myself ever going back to normal foundation after trying this. I wish everyone could try this and see how awesome it is! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. Was a bit too light for my medium -tan complexion but I mix it with my tinted moisturizer or foundation and Voila good to go.Leaves my skin super smooth and flawless complexion. Great seller. There are some knockoff&#x27;s of this product being sold and I can tell you that this seller is legit! Will be recommending to all my friends. Shipping took about 2 weeks for me here in NJ which I thought wasnt so bad considering it was coming straight from Korea!</li>
            <li> I have only tried 3 types of BB cream and this one seems to be the best fit for my oily/uneven skin. It gives me semi-perfect coverage (just because I only use a little bit) and I have been seeing it even out my skin tone for the past weeks since I received it. I have been receiving a lot of compliments because my skin looks so natural and smooth even when I&#x27;m not wearing the BB cream, so it definitely works. Shipping for this was also incredibly fast in my opinion. I would say if you&#x27;re looking to try a BB cream that is affordable, durable, and amazing SKIN79 BB cream should be it!</li>
            <li> it is ok and it works</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as recommended by LisaLisaD1 on YouTube. I received it within 1 week as promised. This product is great when used under a loose mineral powder makeup but find if rather useless if used under a med-full coverage liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and delivery, and very well packaged.  I had high hopes but the coloring was just not for me.  It was too gray and thought it&#x27;ll blend or oxidized when I wear it but it didn&#x27;t.  But then again, I&#x27;m more in the warmer tone and have a lighter face than the rest of my body but have a tan complexion.  The consistency was nice though but just not for me.</li>
            <li> this bb cream is so amazing! i have been using this bb cream for a week and i surely say it does wonders! i would like to give credit to the seller of this bb cream because it is authentic and they totally gained my trust. i would be ordering more and recommend this to my friends. it also doesn&#x27;t break me out. i don&#x27;t have acne but i am pimple prone. i would break out one pimple if i didn&#x27;t wash my face after wearing foundation for 4 hours straight. but this bb cream is so amazing! i wore it for 10 hours, it didn&#x27;t come off and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I think bb cream is either for you or not. I&#x27;ve bought this for me and my friend. It&#x27;s works great for me, works as a moisturizer sunscreen and foundation. I don&#x27;t have that much blemishes to cover tho, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much for coverage. I&#x27;ve tried the other ones from the same line, this would be the darkest. So if this is still too light for you, you&#x27;re out of luck. I wish they would sell just the samples. Would probably be easier for everybody to see which shade they would want and lesser returns.</li>
            <li> Received the BB Cream and loved the container it came in, but did not like the formula itself.  Maybe my skin is sensitive to it or so but I tried it on for a day and by the evening, somehow I started breaking out?  It doesn&#x27;t have oil control and the color, since there isn&#x27;t really a color to choose from, was too light for my complexion.  Overall, I wasn&#x27;t surprise because it was very cheap.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is pretty thick for me, but I LOVE the product! The pump dispenses a bit too much product for me. I really like it though!! It&#x27;s very nice quality, and the shipping was SO FAST!! I ordered this Sunday and got it on Friday. I was supposed to get it november 17- december 1 and I got it October 28th.  I also ordered the B.B miniature set, so that will be included. So they send me samples of: skin inner moist nutritive essence, super + BB cream, and signature dramatic base boomer. Probably because I ordered two things from them. The packaging is super cute and pink, there was much bubble wrap so nothing was damaged. The BB cream is 100% authentic. They sent a cute letter thanking customers, you know. I used some of the product on my jawline to test the color and it was a bit dark for my skin tone. But then I blended it in and it matched perfectly! I&#x27;m usually the lightest foundation I can find (ivory/ classic ivory). I was so surprised to see that this dark color blended so well into my skin! I&#x27;m going to try it out fully tomorrow, but I can tell i&#x27;m going to love it. I submitted a picture and you can see all of the components and products compared to an iPod touch. (I was pretty sure everyone knew how big that was.) I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my skin since I have used this &amp; a couple people have thought that I lost weight!!  If I forget to put this on under my foundation I start over!! :)</li>
            <li> My friend send me this product from Korea and I bought this one here to use for the first time....but so far this product works fine for me now just that it is a little too light for me unlike the one my friend sent to me</li>
            <li> My biggest concern with ordering this skin79 BB cream from any online website was being sent a fake skin79 product. I did my research and found there were many people ordering their BB creams from familiar websites such as ebay and even amazon getting fake skin79 products in the mail. So I had a choice to either order from the actual skin79 website and get the real deal or purchase from a website like this and risk getting a fraud. But when I saw that this BB cream was only about 10 bucks, I told myself what have I got to lose. So I put in and order of this pink label BB cream as well as the VIP gold edition. I put my order in around June 4th and i received it June 16th (today), about 2 weeks before the estimated arrival (which I commend this company for because I was itching to try these products)! I was nervous to unbox the babies in fear of getting shipped a fraud, but with all the research and videos I&#x27;ve watched to educate myself on what a real skin79 pink label and vip gold edition should look like I had no trouble coming to the conclusion that both these products were the real deal! I&#x27;ll leave a link below of the sources i used. So unless you are purchasing from this seller, I suggest you do your research because you might just get conned. When I run out I will definitely be repurchasing from this seller!    Anyways, after concluding that the products were legitimate, I jumped right into application. I squirted a pump of the pink label on my hand as well as a pump of the vip gold edition. And the initial colors are similar. Just for kicks (and to see the difference between the two), I applied the pink label to half of my face and the gold edition to the other half. What I found was that the pink label was slightly harder to blend, not by much but I found I got an easier application with the gold edition. The texture of both BB creams to me was somewhere between a rich tinted moisturizer and sunscreen without the gross oily feeling. At first I thought the product was too thick for me, because it did remind me of sunscreen, but after a minute or two of application it almost felt like I had nothing on my face! This is a huge component for me because 1) I have acne prone/extremely oily skin 2) I have hyper pigmentation and an uneven skin tone 3) I hate caking on my makeup products. I want my skin to be able to breathe! And I can gladly say as of right now, I feel like my skin&#x27;s refreshed, moisturized and looking flawless. I did have to put a swirl of mineral foundation over my face however because the color is a shade or two lighter than my actual skin tone. I&#x27;m Asian, Cambodian to be specific, but I am fairly light, but not ivory enough to get away with wearing just the BB cream. And application of the BB creams was reminiscent of applying high spf suncreen that gives you a pale complexion, so the mineral foundation to set the BB cream was a must. Some may find the limited skin color choice unappealing but I say whats a little blending with powder or mixing some BB cream into your foundation. The pay-off will be great, I think it&#x27;s worth it. And the coverage for me personally is phenomenal! I would say it&#x27;s as good as a medium to full coverage foundation but it feels as light as tinted moisturizer. There is no sticky residue after application, no shine. Just a smooth matte finish, at least for me. If I could I would use this day and night, but for the evenings I&#x27;ll opt for a nourishing night cream. Remember, even though skin79 BB creams are considered skincare for all thier pros, it&#x27;s still technically a makeup product and we all know we should wash off our makeup before we sleep to let our skin breathe! That being said, I&#x27;ll mention a few more things. The fragrance for me is nice, something I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting on daily. And the packaging is adorable! Other than that, the product really speaks for itself. It really did live up to all my expectations and I am really happy with this purchase. I would really recommend this to anyone looking for a good foundation with good coverage, and something that&#x27;s overall good for the skin! Hope this review helped and good luck to you all on your BB cream hunting!      Most helpful links to spotting a fake skin79 bb cream:    [...]  [...]    Keep in mind that skin79 has changed their packaging a bit and the overall look of their product. The youtube video was MORE helpful, since it is the most recent. But none the least, the second is helpful as well.</li>
            <li> terrible really wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with a warm skin tone, it makes you look dead. It has a horrible gray undertone which is very unnatural, I&#x27;m frankly quite confused about all the good reviews on here! it also sits in any wrinkles or creases on the skin and accentuates them. I&#x27;ll stick to garnier bb cream thanks!  -----I&#x27;d like to revise this review as its been a few months and a little while ago i decided to try this product again and I absolutely love it now, I&#x27;ve realized after watching YouTube tutorials that I had been applying it all wrong! You don&#x27;t apply this to your face like foundation and you only need a very small amount applied in a patting motion, finish with a dash of mineral powder after its set and voila, gorgeous flawless skin for the rest of the day. It also has amazing oil control so much so I cant even imagine using greasy foundation again. Just brilliant.</li>
            <li> good product, then i saw i had only 1 only one month before the product expired which is not good at all! smh! :(</li>
            <li> Different color, different smell that is intensely powdery.  I returned as I didn&#x27;t want to take the chance that it would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because, as a fellow Asian with a lighter skin complexion, this product really brightens up my face and evens out the skin tone. It&#x27;s not super flawless coverage, which is something I like because I like to go for the \\&quot;natural beauty\\&quot; look. It&#x27;s light coverage, and it&#x27;s really to apply and use, which is also a plus. Less than one full pump from the bottle is more than enough for me! But, I can always use more, and pile it up on my face for a more flawless coverage, and it won&#x27;t feel heavy on my face, cakey, or anything. It feels like I didn&#x27;t really put anything on my face at all! After using it for a while (a month?), I haven&#x27;t seen THAT much of a difference to my face, but I do notice that my face has gotten a little lighter. I&#x27;ve heard from BubzBeauty on youtube that prolonged use will prevent wrinkles, heal acne scars, etc. So I guess I&#x27;ll just have to keep using it, and I&#x27;ll reach that perfect flawless face for sure (: So for anyone that wants a light makeup base that will also benefit your skin by healing it, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this BB cream, it&#x27;s has much more coverage than my previous one (Garnier) and actually comes out a bit like a clay mask. It went on very pale on my medium toned skin, however after blending it really adapts to your natural skin tone and the end result is a really clear, bright looking skin tone. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on any effects it has on improving your skin, but I enjoy the coverage and the SPF factor is good, and will go a long way as only a tiny bit of product is needed for quite a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Received the product on January 30, 2011.  It had a date on the bottom of September 9, 2011, which I quickly assumed was an expiration date.  I contacted the seller and did some online research, only to find that the date on the bottom is the date of manufacture and the product is good for three years from that date.  I strongly recommend this product and give high points to the seller who sent it quickly and was fast to respond to my inquiry. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product before and loved it. It passed all tests of authenticity. This time I purchased it did not pass and it&#x27;s watery, does not blend well and makes my face greasy.  Sad that you can buy twice from same company and have this happen.  BEWARE !!!!!</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product 10 out of 5 stars, I would. If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive BB cream that works well, look no further! I recommend this to anyone; however, those with dry skin may want to purchase the other Skin79 Gold version because it&#x27;s more moisturizing and has a thicker formula. But if you have oily skin like myself, I&#x27;m almost positive you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I was a little hesitant to buy this product because I&#x27;ve heard of people receiving fakes. But I decided to trust my sender, pinkgelee, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did! This BB Cream came only 2 days after I purchased it, packaged carefully and thoughtfully, even containing a thank-you note. (There were even two free samples, one of the same pink one and one of the VIP Gold version.)After watching comparison videos of the real and fake product, I was so happy to find that it was the real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried it out: I was, and still am, thrilled with the results. It covers most redness, acne, dark circles, hyperpigmentation, and unevenness almost as an expensive foundation would without feeling heavy on my skin or looking cakey. You can most definitely dust a translucent powder atop this BB Cream for a more matte look. I really hope you found this review helpful! Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li> Alright, so the estimated delivery date that they gave me was January 6, but it arrived on December 21! It came 10 times faster than I thought it would. I really liked the pink packaging, bubble wrap, and there were even two samples included. The item I recieved IS authentic, so if are worried about authenticity, I think you should just give it a try. I used it on my skin already and I must say, this BB cream is amazing! The grey hue that other reviewers mentioned is very subtle in my opinion, barely noticable, and it actually matches the shade of my skin, which is pretty tan. Whenever I put on foundation or tinted moisturizer, I always end up looking either very orange, or ghost like because I can never find a share that matches my skin.  But this bb cream oxidizes and matches perfectly with my skin tone. For coverage, I would say that it probably has light to sheer medium coverage, so if you want something that is between a tinted moisturizer and a foundation, than this is perfect! I am extremely satisfied, and it was well worth the 20 day wait shipping all the way from South Korea! Thank you so much SeoulGlamour!</li>
            <li> this was my first BB Cream ever purchased and it blends with my skin flawlessly, love it. recommended buy to all!</li>
            <li> Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin... it caused acne and made my skin look grey.. not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it wouldn&#x27;t make me break out... Not only did i break out, it made me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> I like it and works well but I think it makes me break out. Its a good product and the bottle is super cute.</li>
            <li> The product arrived way, way earlier than the anticipated date in good condition. All the free gifts promised were properly enclosed and the ordered product nicely packets with personal notes. The product (SKIN79 Super+ BB Triple Function Hot pink BB cream SPF25/PA++ 40g) seems genuine too, which is perfect! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase from the same seller again.</li>
            <li> I like it. It make my face very clear and light. sometime I wear this for hike. I do not get blery.</li>
            <li> Love the product, and the delivery was fast. The color is much lighter than what I thought but after applying powder, it blends well. I like how this product does not feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> The fact that this is my first review ever....it means its worth reading. This product is everything its cracked up to be. I dont think this product would work for everyone, as it is not super concealing. My skin is fair and overall acne free. This product does an amazing job with a small bit of concealer for under eye circles and im out the door! Thank you seoulglamour for an amazing experience and thank you for the incredibly fast shipping! Will be back to purchase after this bottle is done!</li>
            <li> I have been using this bb cream for about a week and I am already seeing results. I have fair skin with some hyper pigmentation and acne scars. The hyper pigmentation is slightly less noticeable and the texture of the scars has greatly improved. My skin is much softer than it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream looks very gray when dispensed but it takes mine no more than 15 minutes to oxidize and match my skin perfectly. I do wear a little pressed powder over mine and it lasts all day that way. It leaves my skin neither dewey or matte. It&#x27;s a nice in between look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people with all skin types. I think it is pretty versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from seoulglamor and received it within 6 days. They also included 4 free samples which was very nice.</li>
            <li> Pros: Controls my oily skin, feels like I have nothing on my face, No chemical scent, Not sticky, BEEN IN SOUTH KOREA (TOUCHED BY SOUTH KOREANS ^_^)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Too pale for my tanner skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really love this product because it makes my face appear less oily throughout the whole day. My face feels more \\&quot;free\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t actually feel like I&#x27;m wearing any make up. And unlike foundations, the scent is kind of like lotion and NOT have that bad chemical scent. Also, when applied, my face does not feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick considering it was from South Korea to North Carolina, US. It arrived in about 1 1/2 weeks in a cute pink package (: The seller (seoulglamour) included two free samples. I got the SKIN79 VIP Gold BB Cream and Missha Aqua Snail Renewal (a skin cell renewal cream).&lt;br /&gt;Application&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really have to set it with a powder, but since it doesn&#x27;t exactly match my perfect skin tone, I lightly dust some powder over my face. Even though it oxidizes to fit your true skin color, it&#x27;s still a little to light for tanner skin.&lt;br /&gt;You can apply this with your fingers, but I use a dense flat top brush for a fuller coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth the money! :D</li>
            <li> This bb cream is great in my opinion, it provides decent coverage without looking cakey. It is very naturally looking also light weight. I has not broken me out so far either. So I would recommend it:)[[ASIN:B005OU4J6C {2012.01.09 produce}NEW Skin79 Hot Pink Super Plus BB Cream Triple Functions 40g + Missha Sample [Misc.]]]</li>
            <li> i was waiting this cream sooo unpationly . and Now I &#x60;m using it everyday. My skin is pretty oily and I thought - this product is for me .. Please ..it is oily and wil not stay long on face .. I would not say it is gray it is rather grayish But on the face it is very white ( My skin is white I&#x60; m russian) First of allit is oily andheavy on the face - the rest are details for me but .. promissed color on the face is noy pink it is deadly white ..plus greasy ..I &#x60; m stil kinda waiting to see undercovered benefits of this crem with blotting tissues ..but meanwhile thinking to go back with my usual oil control foundation .. it is hot outside and I need some kind of powder on mu face ..bb triple function not gonna last 3 hours thats for sure</li>
            <li> I first tried the Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover Cream in 21.  I liked it better than any of the foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, but it didn&#x27;t blend very well to my skin.  I thought it was my fault for buying no. 21 rather than 23.  I had the travel size, so there wasn&#x27;t much.    Anyway, I then found out about Skin79&#x27;s brand... and how the pink label was good for people with combination skin (like mine).  So I decided to give it a go, and I got it today.  The cream is amazingly smooth and like lotion, and much thinner than Missha Perfect Cover Cream.  When I spread them out both on my skin, the Skin79 one blended perfectly; I seriously could not tell I had bb cream on my hand, unless i compared it to my other hand which didn&#x27;t have anything on it.  The Missha one is still there, and looks reddish/pink on my skin.    I decided to try it on my face, and I&#x27;m loving the feel of it (doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or dry), the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m actually wearing anything on my face, but still makes it look so much better.  It won&#x27;t cover my acne 100%, but I feel this won&#x27;t clog my face up and worsen my acne, especially since it feels like moisturizer.  I&#x27;m going to try some other brands (Dr. Jart+) before settling down on a type, but Skin79 is really up there on the likely to repurchase list!    I also suggest you order this from seoulglamour; I got this delivered very quickly considering it came from South Korea; it could have been delivered by May 13 and be on time, but it came today... at least 11 days before the \\&quot;deadline.\\&quot;  that&#x27;s better than some of the shipping services I got from sellers inside the country.</li>
            <li> It is good but not compatible with my skin so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It has a light smell and fits my skin tone pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t cover acne 100% but does a decent job. It does however leave my skin looking a tad grey. I like how it is slightly water repellent, so it doesn&#x27;t come melting off of my face if it starts to rain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say or where to start....she wanted to try this product. She loved it since it did what it said. After awhile she noticed that she started breaking out. I suppose this wasn&#x27;t the product for her skin type.</li>
            <li> It is alright. I didnt use it very often. I&#x27;m still not sure if it is fraud, as far as I know it did not have any negative impact on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have very fair skin and are looking for clean coverage that looks natural, this product is a great choice. I was iffy about the product being an authentic skin79 product, but it came with the authenticity label and was properly sealed. Once I run out, I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love it. Actually I don&#x27;t use it that much, but whenever I do, it never fails to satisfy me. I have a problem with black heads, and this product helps me cover it perfectly. It makes my skin looks very smooth and flawless, especially in photos :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, it is great once blended on the skin:) Would order it again and again. Gives the face coverage with a clean look.</li>
            <li> I order the pink one n received the brown one. I was really needing a bb cream so I just kept it.. but the item came in the time it said it would</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I was a little concerned ordering, because it&#x27;s made for Asian skin tones and I&#x27;m practically albino, but it matches to my skin tone perfectly. It goes on dark (which again, worried me haha) but it dried to my skin tone. It&#x27;s a little greasy, but it&#x27;s a moisturizer, so that&#x27;s a given. I put a little powder on over it and am good to go. It also had the real deal authentic sticker on it as well, mine wasn&#x27;t a brand X rip off.</li>
            <li> I received my BB cream today.  The container is smaller than I had imagined, but cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some of you, I was really concerned about being sent a fake bottle and debated about whether I should order one or not.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to order from Pink Gelee.  I did a little bit of research before ordering and went with Pink Gelee because I saw some YouTube reviews about them.  The bottle from Pink Gelee comes in an authentic box.  The bottle itself is stamped with a number that matches the number on the bottom of the box.  The bottle also has a sticker that will self-destruct if peeled off.  Therefore, if your bottle does not have a sticker, it is not the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two free samples, which I don&#x27;t really care for...but is a bonus! I have not had a chance to try the BB cream itself.  I will update once I&#x27;ve had a chance to try on the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Skin79 BB Cream twice so far.  It feels okay, not oily or anything.  I&#x27;m Asian and have light skin already.  The BB Cream doesn&#x27;t seem to cover up much at all.  It&#x27;s almost sheer on my skin.  I don&#x27;t know about covering up pores and blemishes since my skin looks the same with or without the BB cream.  I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if it&#x27;ll work as a moisturizer.  I do not see much benefit since it doesn&#x27;t cover my blemishes and looks almost sheer.  It doesn&#x27;t smooth out lines either.  Makes my skin look more dry than without it.  I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss and raving was about after all.  I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed in the product itself.  I don&#x27;t know how it could make pores disappear or cover blemishes in some people as they say in their reviews....is not doing that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, if you expected a magical cream that will cover up pores, blemishes, and moisturize....then you will be disappointed.  If you are just looking for a foundation type of cream to try, then it&#x27;s definately worth a try.  This is comparable to my foundation (Revlon) I&#x27;m currently using, doesn&#x27;t seem to offer more. It does cost more than my current foundation, so I will probably just stick with Revlon in the future.</li>
            <li> I was very hestitant on purchasing on amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to get a dupe. I saw that someone said that user TOKTOK sells authentic products, and I can verify that they do! Arrived before the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I love it. It smells like sunscreen and it goes on very sheer? It&#x27;s hard to describe. It gives some coverage, and it&#x27;s buildable, but it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. It just makes it look like your skin is glowing. I&#x27;m a NC35, and it oxidized correctly too my skin, giving it a luminous glow. I do tan dramatically in the summer, so I&#x27;m a little nervous that the shade won&#x27;t match, but we&#x27;ll have to see...</li>
            <li> It is good but I prefer Missha&#x27;s BB. This one is a bit grey. Good product and worth a try though.</li>
            <li> I read alot of reviews about this before I purchased it and I&#x27;m glad I did my skin loves it and it stays on all day without feeling gross. The color matches me well and my mom wanted to know what I was using on my face because it looked so good. I let her know, and she wrote it down so she will probly buy some too !hehehe the only complaint I have is that I didn&#x27;t get a gold sample I got a sample of the bb cleanser, but I did use that and liked it so that&#x27;s ok , though I wanted to try the gold one to see if its better than the pink.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite BB Cream, after using it for a month, my blemishes went away. I started using the drugstore BB cream, because I could only order SKIN79 BB Cream online and I completely regret it, waste of money. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on  drugstore brands like Maybelline BB Cream, Revlon BB Cream, etc. They do not work as well as SKIN79 BB Cream. :)</li>
            <li> This is my end-all be-all foundation. I tell everyone withing earshot about how effing genius it is. Don&#x27;t get scammed by any American product that touts itself as a BB cream. This is the jam 100%.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I purchased this product, as there&#x27;s a lot of brew-ha-ha surrounding this particular company&#x27;s BB creams. I compiled a list, after rather extensive research, of qualities I needed to look for to determine it&#x27;s authenticity. The box matched the new criterion; big red circle, misspelling in &amp;#34;wriinkles&amp;#34; on the English portion of the instructions inside the box, the perforated line on the back of the box, three line items on the bottom opposite the bar code, scanner on the top right of the ingredients panel on the outside of the box, consistency of the product matches the reviews of its gel like and firm texture, color matches the grey undertone sometimes complained about, interior bottle removes easily from outer pink shell containing the appropriately raised and reflective lettering, appropriate hole opening at the dispenser, and shell shaped tab on top. I purchased it from Seoul Glamour. You&#x27;re not going to get Prime two-day shipping for the price, though.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too yellow toned (I&#x27;m hispanic) for this product but I didn&#x27;t like the gray hint of color.  Even after a while, the color didn&#x27;t change on me.  I tried applying some mineral foundation after this, but still didn&#x27;t like the color.  If you have yellow tones, I would stay away from this.</li>
            <li> Even though it didnt match with my skin I am happy to have this product. I am keeping it till it comes in useful.</li>
            <li> Well after reading all the reviews on BB creams i thought id go w/this one.i have normal to oily skin,and not super dark so thought it would blend in.1st off when i got it i thought wow nice big bottle then i pumped some out and thought there is NO WAY my skin is going to be able to breathe through this.Its very thick/and not in a good way.Then i put it on just to see if it would blend. After 5min. i still looked like a white greenish ghost.And let me tell u, im a person who always puts on spf moisturizer and med. to heavey coverage but can also just go out w/spf and primer so it wasent that it covered enough it just wasent a pretty color against my skin.(im med white w/freckles)So it should have worked from my understanding.I would have returned if it wasent from overseas but it is so i didnt.Ended up giving to my mother who ended up throwing it away.(and she loves BBcreams!)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It gives me a fresh, even look without appearing \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; with foundation. It stays put even with all my oil production, and does not cake. It makes my pores look smaller. Since it is summer, I have a bit of a tan. This color is a little too light for me right now. I mix it with a darker tinted moisturizer, and it does just fine. The trick is to pat it into the skin. I usually do not apply powder over it, because it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary. Actually, I have noticed that when I do try to apply a loose powder to set it, my skin does appear too \\&quot;made-up\\&quot;. It just looks neat, fresh, and natural without setting with powder. It does not provide an opaque coverage like a foundation does. I have very clear skin so I do not need to cover my face. I just need something to even out the skin tone a bit, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after much research online for something my daughter could wear with sensitive skin.  She has just now wanted to start wearing make up and this has worked perfectly.  I ordered from Vurea and item came very quickly and is the real deal.  Even with shipping it is still cheaper than many store brands.  She loves it and I use it sometimes too on my more mature skin.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday. It&#x27;s easy to apply and the skin looks bright after applying it. The pink one is a little bit dry for me so I have to mix it with the moisturizer every time. But overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s authentic but nothing uncomfortable happened on my face although I have very sensitive skin and very easy to get allergy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to believe the hype with this BB cream, but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m about an NC 42 in MAC. I&#x27;ve heard girls darker than me saying this stuff matches with their skin tone. It definitely doesn&#x27;t for me. I look like I&#x27;m wearing a grey-tinted face balm. And it never settles in to the right color for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is nothing to rave about, and I don&#x27;t really like the consistency of the product either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is something that I regret purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the SPF factor is a strong plus though.</li>
            <li> My favorite bb cream. Use it as a primer to even out skin tone.  This is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. The real skin79 brand will have a sticker of authenticity on the foundation bottle. This knock off made my skin break out and is terrible!</li>
            <li> Have yet to receive this product! Ordered over a month ago and it still has not come in and seller didn&#x27;t provide any tracking information. Have tried it before in a sample pack that i ordered from a different seller and loved it so I wanted to order more but have not received the product. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for 4 months. I absolutely love how easy it is to apply, the color coverage. how comfortable it is to wear. I am 64 years old with very fair skin with many red, brown and tan discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;I just read an article, however, at [...] The news - Someone brought a skin lightening product from Mexico that had very dangerous levels of mercury. According to this government site, \\&quot;Use of these skin creams can cause serious health problems including problems with the nervous system, kidneys, skin, blood pressure, and digestive tract. Unborn babies, infants, and children are especially sensitive to the effects of mercury and lead. If the label does not list the ingredients, stop using it. Federal law requires that the ingredients be listed on the label.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t consider  myself an alarmist but this seems too risky for the sake of a convenient foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have not been able to find a list of ingredients. I expect to purchase another BB product that does list ingredients, Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF42 PA+++, available through Amazon. Ingredient list is at [...]</li>
            <li> This was for my sister who used up the last one I bought for her on Amazon.com. This is authentic BB cream and comes with a little sample of some more bb cream. Shipment was good, quick, packaged well. original box and all.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much since I have been using this. The more I use it, the better my skin looks and feels. Now, I only get a couple pimples a month. At first it feels disgusting on the skin, but then it sinks in. Also, I don&#x27;t get sunburned when wearing this!</li>
            <li> This worked fairly well for those minimalist days. It didn&#x27;t really work for me on a full makeup day. It kind of got in the way. Don&#x27;t use too much at a time and you should be fine. It works very well for fair skin tones. But, be aware the main demographic for this BB cream are people of Asian ethnicity (Who usually have a ver yellow undertone), so it can look a little grayish. But, overall...I like it :) About 3 stars for now.</li>
            <li> I think the concept of having make-up and skincare in one is a clever idea. I was not impressed with this product because the formulation was heavy and did not match my skin tone. I won&#x27;t give up on BB creams, I still think they are a clever concept.</li>
            <li> It takes forEVER to arrive so order WELL before you run out. And I mean a loooong time before you run out. You&#x27;re looking at a month wait until it gets here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on looking a bit gray, but as it oxidizes it adjusts to your skin tone. I used to use Mac and got tired of it clogging up my pores and looking like I pasted a layer of gunk over my face. Then I started mixing Mac foundation with a BB Cream from Garnier, which was ok but I hated the smell of Garnier. My co-worker introduced me to the Korean line of BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t just rub this stuff on and don&#x27;t use a brush. You won&#x27;t get nice coverage and it&#x27;ll look a little weird or you&#x27;ll end up wasting a lot of product. Dab little dots of it all over your face (little goes a long way) then pat it on to even it out over all of your face. Use a regular concealer (oddly enough I do like the Garnier roll on undereye concealer or the Revlon Photo Ready concealer over the Mac concealer which looks a little too bright and unnatural). It provides a softer coverage (I&#x27;d say medium) but you can always add another layer if you want heavier coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty pale (Mac foundation NC 20 for reference). This works well enough, but I tend to prefer the gold one. I&#x27;ll be ordering that one next.</li>
            <li> I may update this review at a later time to elaborate on how well the product has done, but for now I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s great! I checked my item (which came on time) for authenticity, compared with helpful fake vs. real comparisons online (most helpful I&#x27;ve found is the review by Sugar Reviews on Wordpress) and also used RedLaser app the scan the barcode. If it&#x27;s the legit product, it should find the product in its directory via the barcode. I first learned of the product by a friend who let me try hers. I was amazed at how natural yet picture perfect the product turned out on my skin. I&#x27;m not a big make-up person, but Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB cream hit the right nerve. It gave my skin a smooth finish that felt and looked great. So I&#x27;m happy to review this product with positive feedback, saying that it is indeed a legit product. Feels great, looks great, and offers just the right amount of sunscreen (the highest you should typically go is 35 SPF, and this product is 25).</li>
            <li> I really love this BB Cream. It blends so well and actually looks natural compared to other foundations and BB Creams. Will buy another one after I use it all up.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing about how if you really want a good BB cream, you need to get a Korean one. So, I went to the internet to find out which one I should get and this is the one that was recommended. I love using this on days were I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation or just need some SPF because I&#x27;ll be outside. I can wear this by itself when I&#x27;m having a good skin day and when my skin isn&#x27;t so great, I just add a touch of concealer. I think this actually does cover pretty well though and definitely evens out my skin tone. I have very pink undertones in my skin so it usually needs something to even it out. Don&#x27;t be throw off when you get it by the color, it adapts to your skin tone, which is awesome because that means more people can use the same product. I am very fair skinned and it wasn&#x27;t orangey which is a problem I have had with American BB creams and tinted moisturizers. The product is fairly thick (which is probably why it has such good coverage) but when it goes on (apply with your fingers), you can&#x27;t even feel it. It feels just like a moisturizer!  I definitely recommend this product and would repurchase it when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Side note, I purchased from World Buy 365, Inc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product multiple times, its the only BB cream I use.</li>
            <li> Arrived much sooner than expected and the product exceeded my expectations. I had always thought my skin wasn&#x27;t clear enough to get away with using just a bb cream, but I can with this one! It covers my acne scars and redness. Nice finish and very hydrating. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love love love it. The best BB cream I have ever bought, I usually buy American BB creams and they never match my skin, I am very fair with pink undertones, and this jewel covers imperfections and it does not cake up, looks like I don&#x27;t have any makeup on. I am so impressed with this product. I will forever use this.</li>
            <li> Decent coverage and dries matte without the grey tint seen in a lot of other BB creams.  This cream stays on my face through most of my 10-hour workday, which I definitely appreciate!  The only thing I wish they would change is that it is difficult to know when I&#x27;m running out and need to purchase more.  But then again, it arrives so quickly that I wouldn&#x27;t be without this BB cream for very long.  Overall, very happy with my purchase and will continue to repurchase again in the future.  :)</li>
            <li> Good product, it&#x27;s my 3rd bottle, well, the 2nd one was a gift to my cousin who also loves it.  What more can I say?  it&#x27;s light coverage but gives you that extra brightening glowing quality on your face.  If you have pimple scare or spots then don&#x27;t expect to use this to cover it up because it won&#x27;t.  This is good for someone who has clear skin and wants to have light coverage witih SPF and correct slight uneven skin tone.  People come up to me and say I am gorgeous without make-up!! *wink*</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have been using Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB Cream for years, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten it from Amazon (I usually get it from ebay but needed it ASAP). As you may know, a big issue with buying such products is authenticity - I am pleased to say I received the genuine product :) (&amp;#34;Sold by Constant Connection and Fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;) Received sample, as advertised, but have yet to try.</li>
            <li> It was a fantastic item. I will definitely be purchasing it again. It is exactly what I needed in a bb cream!</li>
            <li> This product is full coverage and DEFINITLY covers the fine lines on your face with an airbrushed look! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> pink undertone, consistancy thick, blendable but will have a light white cast on face dry with a powder finish on face. best formulation out of all the ones i see in American cosmetic lines.</li>
            <li> If I had to pick one make-up product to use for the rest of my life, I would pick this stuff. I have oily / acne prone skin, and I get redness on my face. This stuff REALLY evens out my skin tone (which is really what &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; means, it doesn&#x27;t make me more pale), but it feels like putting on a nice moisturizer. It&#x27;s not at all cakey or streaky, like I experience with most foundations. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin. It&#x27;s just the best. It makes my skin look AND feel better, both instantly, and over-time as I wear it more, I will break out less and my skin just looks brighter and more even. Have I mentioned I love this stuff? I love it! My mom asked me about it because she noticed my skin looked really nice, and I had her try some, and she thought it was great, too, and she hates wearing make-up. She bought some for herself the next day.</li>
            <li> This does well to diminish the redness around my nose and mouth. When it comes out of the pump it looks a bit beige toned, but it blends beautifully into the skin. It lasts about 3 - 5 hours and can last longer with a setting powder.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal and made it all the way from Hong Kong within 2 weeks. Good price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, premature aged skin from all of the UV exposures in California. There are also a plethora of spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a sheer coverage (so if you have medium to dark spots, then reconsider), but it is easy to blend with the fingers. This product does break my skin out, but because I am not a consistent day to day user, I cannot determine if this is because my skin is not fully used to the product yet. The whitening effects are not kicking in as well, but it has only been a couple of weeks. I do like the complexion evening aspect, however. Several dark areas of uneven tanning is neutralized, and shine control is quite good.&lt;br /&gt;I am also quite impressed with the speed of delivery and the amount of samples that came with my order. There were more than the said amount in the description.</li>
            <li> The moisturize does not come out.  The packaging is broken on one of them..Very disapointed. I feel that I should be sent another one at no cost to me.  Norma Gordon</li>
            <li> I am using this product for about two years and I love it.  Provides amazing coverage, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and blends wonderfully with any skin tone.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite BB cream. I have tried a wide range of creams designed for oily skin and this held up the best. It gives a matte finish and the matte finish lasts throughout the day. I have ordered this well over 3 times because I love it so much. The color also blends well and gives medium coverage. If you have any blemishes, it will definitely cover the redness.</li>
            <li> Amazing value, the formula works really well if you have oily skin because it helps absorb some of the oil that collects during the day. This gives medium coverage but is slightly build-able. It feels lightweight and breathable when applied and stays on really well even without a primer. I have oily/cystic acne prone skin and did not experience any breakouts when I used this, my skin actually cleared up a little from switching from my old foundation to this BB cream. The color is more of an ashy/grey pink flesh tone, it doesn&#x27;t dull your skin at all and the ashy part of it actually brightened up my face where my skin was more dull. I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It’s light and not cakey. I have a few scars on my face and the BB Cream helps even out my skin. It doesn&#x27;t hide it completely. It&#x27;s not used to for that, but it make its where its not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to receive an expired product…by nearly 2 years! Not only does the expiration date read from 2012, the product appears to be a fake. While most other signs of authenticity are here, there is no corresponding expiration date/manufacture number on the bottom of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 7 month pregnant and did a a very thorough job researching real vs fake Skin79 BB Cream, as I do not want to put unknown cosmetics on my skin. This expired AND seemingly counterfeit product is unsafe for both me and my future child. Do not put your self at risk by purchasing from this seller. Spend the extra money and by from a trusted source.</li>
            <li> I would just like to start off with saying that I do NOT wear makeup on a regular basis so I&#x27;m used to nothing at all on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Today I tried this for the first time and applied a thin layer to my entire face to cover up some blemishes as well as to even out my face. It feels like you&#x27;re applying lotion and smells slightly of sunscreen but applied quite well and required very little to cover everything. It also blended very well despite my inexperience in how to &amp;#34;do makeup.&amp;#34; For the first hour or so after application, upon closer look, it appeared slightly cakey, but this quickly disappeared and now I feel like there is nothing on my face. I can not feel or see any evidence of it having been applied aside from the evened skin tone and most blemishes hidden. The look is so natural, that I may have to start using this daily because it is great. I was a little concerned at first that this wouldn&#x27;t go well with my skin because I&#x27;m not Korean (and this is a Korean product meant for Korean ladies) but it worked and blended with my European heritage skin color. All in all, I love this product and definitely would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! My skin has blemishes from picking at my skin,  so a lot of time I feel I can&#x27;t where it alone. If I had blemish FREE skin, this  would be my go-to with some blush for some color.   The coverage is pretty good considering.    my face is getting clearer with less spots because I got fake nails to stop the picking. So I will see what its like with a clearer face.  This has a slight grey tint, but it works for my pale skin tone.   If you are really tan, it might not work without some bronzer.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I love it!  I love how moisturizing it is.  My skin gets pretty oily during the day, so it&#x27;s really all I need in the morning after I wash my face.  The coverage is great; lighter than a foundation, but more coverage than a tinted moisturizer.  Perfect for the summer! It&#x27;s rich and thick, but feels lightweight on the face.  And you don&#x27;t need too much.  A pea size or less is about all you need to generously cover your whole face.    Also, I would definitely recommend seoulglamour as a seller.  I did some research, and the product I got was definitely genuine which is something that I worried about.  Plus, they gave me two samples instead of just the advertised one!  Can&#x27;t beat that! :)</li>
            <li> Works well! I&#x27;ve purchased the oriental in the past but did not like it half as much as this one. You have to know how to properly apply. I use it daily and have re-ordered more. I am Filipino/Caucasian and it works great with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I loved the ease of using this product in the morning and how it had the perfect coverage. However, it made my skin break out. I wish this product had worked for me.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this bb cream and I feel that&#x27;s it&#x27;s better for your skin than foundation. I do say that it does not double as concealer which most of the time bb creams do. I do like that it oxidizes fairly quickly, but I just wish it doubled as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this did not break me out, but then again I don&#x27;t break out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also still put on a layer of moisturizer on top of this even if it does say that it&#x27;s included. Also,watch out for fakes. I bought mine from k-beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reference: Tan, Dry skin. Not really acne prone</li>
            <li> I got this so much earlier than expected! It was suppose to be here the 19th and its the 12th! (Apparently it was at the post office on the 10th) it looks to be authentic and I can&#x27;t wait to test it out.</li>
            <li> Long lasting product. If you break out easily it will be a hit-or-miss.  Anytime I used this product it would make me break out! Did not feel like a very heavy product,  and a little would go a long way.</li>
            <li> Medium coverage. Smells strange but I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m korean and irish so I have olive skin but get pretty tan during the summer. I use this all year long as a primer/base and put a little foundation over it since it&#x27;s a little light for my skin tone. It&#x27;s fantastic, this is my 3rd bottle! I prefer the hot pink over the gold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about an NC30 and I love this BB cream.  I like the texture, it&#x27;s not too thin to make me feel like I have to put on a bunch to get decent coverage or too thick where I feel like I caked on the make up.  At first, I was worried because I thought the color didn&#x27;t match me, but after about 5 minutes it started to get closer to my skin color. My face is naturally a little whiter than my neck, which is slightly more yellow (I&#x27;m Korean) but I think it looks pretty good, there isn&#x27;t too much difference between my face and neck. I find that when I reapply makeup later in the day/night the bb cream looks even better, don&#x27;t know exactly what that means but I guess it&#x27;s good. I just put this on and maybe a setting powder and I&#x27;m set.</li>
            <li> this bbcream is the best that I´ve trying before, I´m very white and this bb cream adapted to my skin color</li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail today and it came in a strange black bag from South Korea.  It had a green customs sticker with the box for gift checked off.  I thought this was weird because it should have been the commercial box since this is a commercial product.  Everything checked out with what I have researched about authenticity however the perforated line on the box to read the instructions printed in the inside is not there.  Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
            <li> But that being said, I do believe I bought a fake. The logo rubbed easitly off the container and the product remained fairly gray on my skin even after oxidizing. I am going to buy the next one direclty from the Skin79 United States website. I&#x27;m sure it will be a drastic improvement.</li>
            <li> It came a week before and it came with everything that was said to come with it. Thank you! It was fun and great to try out if it works for my skin.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy on my skin. Felt a bit too cakey and it gave me pimples immediately. I do not recommend this product if you have acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Grey undertone and very drying.</li>
            <li> I looked through a whole lot of different BB creams before settling on this one, and it ended up being a great choice. My skin is Caucasian and quite pale (dark blonde hair with freckles, if that helps.) I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t match my fair skin well, but it really does! In fact, I have a difficult time buying foundations and concealers because they usually end up too dark or orange. Super+ BB has given me zero issues with that. It&#x27;s also very easy to apply, just like a tinted moisturizer, and it makes my skin look nice and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have to mention that it does dry out my skin. I have year-round dry skin that becomes incredibly parched during the winter. The first day I wore this BB cream, I wore a regular daytime moisturizer under it, and my cheeks were getting flaky from dryness later in the day. However, this does make sense as it&#x27;s made for blemishes (BB &#x3D; Blemish Balm), and all I need it to do is even out my skin tone. So if you have dry skin, I&#x27;d recommend to just use a heavier moisturizer underneath (perhaps one for night time) and it will will work- better than any tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. Personally, I now use some jojoba or coconut oil with a good moisturizer with this, and I have a good feeling that the excessive moisture will not be necessary for me in the summer. That being said, I can see how this would work really well on oily/acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the samples that came with the order yet so I can&#x27;t speak for those.&lt;br /&gt;As for Super+ BB Pink, I&#x27;m impressed. I may try some other brands in the future, but I will be surprised if they surpass the effectiveness I&#x27;ve found here. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very cute and highly \\&quot;spottable\\&quot;. The hot pink will stand out in your collection. The pump is very hygienic (nothing goes back in). The only down side is I dont know how much of the product is left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love it. It has replaced my BareMinerals matte foundation for now. It makes the skin look very natural and blends into the skin. It may make you look pale a first but once it sets, it will look just like skin. Doesnt feel like I am wearing a foundation at all. It provides medium coverage, some acne scars still visible but a LOT better than without. Dont need to set it with a powder and it actually makes my face less shiny. I like to wear it with my moisturizer underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to wedding recently, and some people asked me to do their makeup. This came in so handy. Its like a one size fit most. Everyone was so surprised and copied down the name so they can get their own. ^.^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is soooooo much better than most American BB creams (clinique, benefit, etc). It is however slightly more expensive that Garnier&#x27;s bb cream but I had that cream so much, it just makes me love my Skin79 so much more.</li>
            <li> I am in looooove with this BB cream. I was scared of getting scammed, the price seemed too good to be true, but it&#x27;s surely not! For only 10 dollars and free shipping, I got a 40 dollar BB cream and a cute little card with a sample! I&#x27;m definetly rebuying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all good reviews here. I have to say Im really satisfied. I can recommend it to anyone who doesnt want to use all those heavy foundations. It lasts whole day and i still feel fresh. I will definately order again when i run out of the current tube. I also had a sample of VIP Gold. It was also good, had maybe a better coverage but both products are great. I may order both of them next time.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would be too light for my skin - I have a medium skin tone (Neutrogena 70, \\&quot;Fresh Beige,\\&quot; if that&#x27;s helpful) - but I wanted to try a BB cream, since separately putting on arbutin powder + sunscreen + foundation was getting annoying, especially since my skin is oily. While the color is a *little* too light for my skin, a tiny bit of my normal foundation on top blends it in perfectly. I mean really tiny, like I put a couple of drops on a foundation sponge and blend it all in. It looks really natural - definitely the \\&quot;me but better\\&quot; look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this seller (SeoulGlamour); I received my order nearly two weeks ahead of the earliest expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> my order came with a sample of the gold and the hot pink. the gold is easier to apply in my opinion, at first the gold seemed warmer but once they both oxidize they are almost the same. i have used missha M perfect BB cream in 23, and that one is my skin tone, so if you are a 23 in missha this will be a tad light, but going out at night it won&#x27;t be noticeable. i think, if my mind isn&#x27;t playing tricks on me, there is a slight scent like perfume, very light, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. if you find this too light then you can always put a powder over it, i think it makes a nice base. it&#x27;s very light, i don&#x27;t feel it caking on my face. in the future i will use missha 23 just because it is my skin tone, besides the limited color of skin 79 i think this product does as much as any cosmetic cream will do, it&#x27;s not magical or a miracle cure for all your blemishes, but it covers light to medium, some of my freckles are visible, but the pinkish nose is covered, and some of my dark eye circles are gone.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been really into taking care of my skin lately and I found this and was impressed by all the rave reviews. I was a little nervous about getting a fake product, but I ordered from Pink Gelee [twice] and both are authentic. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I find that it has definitely helped even my skin tone. Moreover, it acts as a perfect base for makeup. All I use is a little mineral powder on top of it and that&#x27;s all I need for great coverage and it feels much lighter than a foundation on my skin. The fact that it has an SPF 25 sunscreen in it is also amazing. It also seems that my skin has definitely been clearer since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several people and anyone interested in this product should purchase it.</li>
            <li> I was not for sure if this bb cream was legit or not. I looked up videos, and searched on how to know if your bb cream was indeed real. When i received this product (which arrived really quickly) I checked to see if it was actually a real or fake. It is completely real. It has the authenticity sticker on it, and the sticker has not been tampered with. Witch means this product is real.&lt;br /&gt;This bb cream cream is really gentile on your skin. it does not change color after hours of having it applied. Only a little bit is enough for your whole face. I really love this product!</li>
            <li> OVERALL REVIEW: I first purchased the four bb cream sample set and from that, selected the Super+ Hot Pink bb cream as my favorite. I cannot say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT COMPARES TO: I am a cosmetics junkie and have compared this bb cream as a foundation to brands like Chanel, Makeup Forever, Stila, Bare Minerals, Neutrogena, Bobbi Brown, Pur Minerals, Laura Mercier and Estee Lauder (as well as so many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years). I&#x27;ve also compared it to several other bb creams including Mischa. I have tried so many combinations of products over the years; cream/liquid/powder/mineral foundation, foundation with primer/moisturizer/mattifying creams, etc. This bb cream is an all in one; primer, foundation, mattifying product, and even seems to even skin tone. I prefer this bb cream to ANY foundation I have ever used and it is better than any combination of products I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT MY SKIN: I have a medium skin tone, more olive/yellow than pink. I usually wear \\&quot;medium beige\\&quot; to \\&quot;tan\\&quot; in foundations. I have VERY oily skin that was being exacerbated by mineral makeup (although if I had to wear any other than this bb cream, I&#x27;d still wear mineral). I am prone to breakouts. I want full coverage in a foundation, but nothing that looks cakey or powdery and definitely nothing that makes my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLYING THIS PRODUCT: I read that blotting bb cream on will yield the most even look. I usually blot it on, lightly over my whole face and then again a little heavier on my blemishes. It does go on grey. Let it sit for a few minutes. It will mattify and blend to your skin tone. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone with really dark skin, but I think even tan tones can use this. I don&#x27;t have to blend much near my neck.. it just looks natural on its own. And, if I use it as concealer on days when I don&#x27;t want to wear full makeup, it doesn&#x27;t look obviously spotty on my face. Occassionally I wear Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Camouflage concealer over the BB cream. I also always finish with a Nars powder. Without a finishing powder, the product can look too dewey. Nars \\&quot;beach\\&quot;, \\&quot;desert\\&quot;, and \\&quot;mountain\\&quot; colored powders all look natural with this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS OF PRODUCT: I waited a whole month before writing this review so that I could comment on how my skin reacts to it over time. I have NEVER before had a product actually make my skin tone look more even. I still have breakouts, but fewer and I seem to get them from products I put on my skin at night and never seem to get new blemishes while I&#x27;m actually wearing the bb cream. My skin used to get oily an hour after applying makeup. I would apply powder once I got to school/work and then about every two hours. By the end of the day I could cake on powder and it&#x27;d still be oily. With Skin79&#x27;s Super+ hot pink bb cream, I literally go a whole day without applying additional powder. Part way through the day I might blot my skin with tissue. This is a miracle to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: BEWARE OF FAKES!! I have watched a ton of videos and read articles on how to tell what is fake. They contradict each other. I purchased this full size 40g from two sellers. The two products and packaging looked EXACTLY the same, except that one made me breakout like crazy and made my skin oily and the other was slightly fragranced different and did not make my skin break out. The FAKE one I got was from a seller that also sold me the REAL sample size ones, so I&#x27;m not going to bad mouth that seller. What I WOULD recommend is trying to get it from Korea. The one I purchased from a Korean seller arrived later, but seems to be the real product. The date on the bottom of the product is the date it was made, not the expiration date. Other cons; I suppose the fact that this will match only a certain range of skin tones is a draw back. Other than that, it feels very slightly heavier than mineral makeup, but what doesn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: TRY THIS STUFF!!! It&#x27;s sooo cheap compared to all of the brands it surpasses. Don&#x27;t think all BB creams are the same. Try this one. Try the sample pack first if you&#x27;re unsure. I think the few bad reviews can be attributed to people getting fakes and people with perfect skin not needing as much coverage as this product offers.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of skin issues that I prefer to hide - some reddish patches on one of my cheeks, a perpetually red nose and some seriously dark circles under my eyes (I&#x27;m 42).  This stuff is like Kilz for your face.  It&#x27;s not a perfect match to my skin, but it isn&#x27;t really a base/foundation product, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be.  It is a little gray-ish, but don&#x27;t let that bother you - it doesn&#x27;t make any difference once you&#x27;re done with your makeup.  I put it on with a cosmetic sponge before putting on any other makeup, then brush my teeth or something to give it time to dry.  Once I put on my regular concealer (of which I use less, now) and Bare Minerals, it&#x27;s like those issues have disappeared.  It lasts all day.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, you can use more for problem areas that are more difficult to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product from a friend&#x27;s daughter who is a celebrity makeup artist.  I thanked her for her suggestion and she said that she has received more positive feedback regarding this product than any other.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands, but I really don&#x27;t see the need - the price is great and I can&#x27;t imagine it working any better than it does!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream because it covers so nicely and gives a good shine to my cheeks and face. It can hold my powder and makeup well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this BB cream moisturizes and also lightens and brightens my skin as well. The VIP Gold sample also worked very well and I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying a bottle of the gold edition.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a foundation wearer.  ever.  but after reading about this product i decided to try it.  i&#x27;m very fair - burn in the sun, etc.  the \\&quot;gray hue\\&quot; on your skin some reviewers mention actually complimented my tone and covered pinkish spots on my skin.  it is not heavy and you can hardly tell you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> Dries out my skin, even with moisturizer under it. Also really grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is good and really conceals my sun spots but because it dries me out I gave it to my sister in law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She on the other hand loves it (she has more oily skin than I do)</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday, so I can&#x27;t attest to the long term effects, but here are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little afraid to order this product through Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to receive a fake. I did some research on how to spot the fakes and luckily, this stuff is the real deal! It shipped immediately and only took two weeks to get to me in Florida. The package came with two free samples and an adorable bookmark.  Thanks, SeoulGlamour! I&#x27;ll be purchasing from you again in the future. If you&#x27;re planning on ordering a bb cream, I HIGHLY recommend this seller. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty much what I expected it to be. It&#x27;s not what I would consider a miracle product, but I definitely prefer it to my tinted moisturizers and will continue to purchase after I finish the bottle. I have light/medium skin with neutral undertones and I get quite tan during the summer. The product is pale upon first application but adjusted to my skin tone quickly. I&#x27;m starting to lose my summer tan, so the balm color was fine. I&#x27;m not sure if this product would work on darker or olive skin. Coverage was OK. Not as great as foundation, but on the same level as a tinted moisturizer. I find that I prefer this to my tinted moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t make me as oily and shiny, although I still needed to blot a few times. My skin is combination and prone to looking shiny in some spots, but I chose to use this over a moisturizer (Lush&#x27;s vanishing cream) because this product seems like it would stick to and accentuate dry spots and the moisturizer helped the balm glide over my skin easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is fairly even, but very sensitive and prone to redness in a few areas. This evened out my skin tone perfectly, but didn&#x27;t cover a zit on my chin or some light circles under my eyes, so I needed concealer. I also used a finishing powder (every day minerals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm is the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually minimizes the size of my pores. It also has a very natural appearance and doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines, so it didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing makeup at all! I plan to use this in place of my mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have very fair skin.  This matched my complexion perfectly.  It is easy to use and blends well.  I do find that I need less foundation overall.  Will definitely purchase again but not for some time as the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> Actually I wasn&#x27;t  very sure to order because I had read a lot of reviews saying it was a fake (it was from other seller) but still!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came on time, it was the real thing and it works really nice.  So, thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but compared to the drugstore bb creams I&#x27;ve tried, this is hands down the best one so far. Non-greasy and oxidies quickly to my skin tone, it doesn&#x27;t create that cakey look either if you need more coverage. This bb cream is best for concealing redness however in my opinion. If you have any acne scars, it doesn&#x27;t exactly do a perfect job of concealing them. Overall it did exactly what I was looking for which was something to conceal redness and create a smoother/even looking skin surface.</li>
            <li> Super awesome!  Miraculously matches my skin in the summer and winter!</li>
            <li> I rarely feel compelled to write a product review, however, I simply had to do so concerning the Skin 79 Super+ BB Triple Function in the hot pink container. First off, I&#x27;d like to assure anyone considering purchasing this: The seller is fantastic! Fast shipping and AUTHENTIC product. Unfortunately, there are MANY \\&quot;dupes\\&quot; and fakes out there but this is NOT one of them. I&#x27;m very, very pleased with this seller. Secondly, this BB cream is terrific! ONE-HALF pump is all you need to cover your face AND neck. A full pump isn&#x27;t necessary, in my opinion, and would be wasting product. My skin tends to be dry so I do apply moisturizer before applying the cream. It applies like a dream. I use my fingers and apply in a patting motion. The product comes out of the container a grayish color, however, within a few minutes it adjusted beautifully to my skin. As a point of reference for those who are wondering if this cream will work for their skintone/color--I&#x27;m an NC 35 in MAC in summer and NC30 in winter. This BB cream leaves your skin super moisturized, glowing (NO GLITTER OR SHIMMER. SIMPLY FRESH LOOKING, DEWY, SEMI-MATTE/SATIN SKIN). It has a lovely, subtle, floral fragrance. Not \\&quot;perfume-y\\&quot; per se, moreso the scent of fresh-picked wildflowers. I love the scent and I don&#x27;t usually like scented cosmetics and/or skincare. I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brand and this cream! By the way, there are several videos on YouTube that review the product and demonstrate its use. Some videos are better than others but I suggest viewing at least one to familiarize yourself with the product. I will certainly re-purchase this and I will purchase other Skin 79 BB cream varieties. This is a WINNER! The seller is FANTASTIC! PRODUCTS ARE AUTHENTIC! (Speaking of that, there are a few \\&quot;Real vs Fake\\&quot; BB cream videos available. I suggest watching them to educate yourself about what to look out for. The wonderful thing is, that won&#x27;t be a concern purchasing from this seller. (I don&#x27;t know her personally--I haven&#x27;t been compensated for my review--I&#x27;m simply excited about the product as well as how quickly the seller shipped my items!) God bless!  &#x3D;*)</li>
            <li> This is the only BB cream I have so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else. I like it but I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My profile:  Asian, early-20&#x27;s, pale skin w/ rosy undertones, normal skin w/ oily T-zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- If you have light skin, this will only make you look paler when applied. Might be good if you want lighten out your skin tone, but I&#x27;m already pale and I don&#x27;t want to look any paler.&lt;br /&gt;- Minimal coverage, takes significant layering to cover flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Evens out your skin tone, makes skin look smooth.&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces shine from oiliness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only recommend this product if you already have moderately good skin. It will not easily cover significant flaws. It works fine on me, but I would like something that has more coverage.</li>
            <li> This came in several days earlier than expected, in time for my trip to 90+ degree weather in Thailand! I purchased this and a tube of Missha Perfect Cover BB cream and will be testing both out in TH. I have combination oily skin, &amp; typically wear MAC 35 - 40 (winter vs summer) for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Skin79 Super+:&lt;br /&gt; + Light-medium coverage&lt;br /&gt; + Leaves skin feeling soft&lt;br /&gt; + Easy to apply, non-greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt; + Looks grey/pale against my skin, but after a bit of time it adjusts perfectly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - LOOKS grey at first... and that&#x27;s about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first day wearing it, I will be sure to update after my trip in a few weeks to share how it held up in hot weather.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail foundation. I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. This bb cream covers flawlessly, controls oil all day, and does not cause break outs. Love.</li>
            <li> I did some research on this before I ordered it.  It rated a lot higher than any of the other BB or CC creams.&lt;br /&gt;I used it all summer without any other make up.  Now I use it as a foundation.  It covers great and you need&lt;br /&gt;so little, it has lasted for months because of this. I feel it works better than any almay, nutrogena, cover girl,&lt;br /&gt;that are my usual go to foundations.  I really love this stuff and plan to reorder when I finish this jar.  I also&lt;br /&gt;feel better about putting something on my skin that is helping to make it better.</li>
            <li> love love love this product by skin79! highly recommend this hot pink for people with combination/oily skin like me.. very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and a friend and we both LOVE it!! It evens out your skin tone and gives you a fresh look. We both have different complexions but it somehow blends right in and works the same on both of us. When you first put it on it looks grayish. However, once you rub it in and it oxidizes it magically turns into your skin color. I hate wearing makeup but I love wearing this.</li>
            <li> To give some background, I have a medium(on the lighter side) skin tone(this would not be good for darker skin), very oily skin, prone to occasional acne breakouts and have red uneven skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot pink version is for oily skin and I read that their gold version is for dryer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is that I only use a little and it evens out my skin tone. My skin looks great and it looks totally natural. It controls the oil on my skin better than anything I have ever used. Usually, at the end of the day, I look worn out but this makes my face look fresh like I just did my makeup. And did I mention it doesn&#x27;t look like I have a layer of foundation on...very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about how well it covers freckles, moles, age spots or acne spots but it is great for people who have redness on their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also true that when you first apply this coverage, it looks a bit greyish but that fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product arrived in perfect condition very quick delivery, thank you! Would purchase from seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first BB here; persuaded by reviewers on MUA and other sites:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant surprise for a fair, sensitive skinned American over 40 to find a Korean BB cream is a great option! Was worried about color matching (it comes out of the pump a bit gray/beige), but applied to center of face and blended out gives a nice \\&quot;my skin but better\\&quot; appearance. Have not tried the sample yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, the US market is slow on bringing out BB creams, and I&#x27;m not convinced the US drugstore versions are anything besides repackaged foundation. Have not tried dept store US BB creams yet, but likely will not if the Asian products are available (I prefer Japanese sunscreen to all others I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> My skin is freckled, fair, with pink tones.  In my twenties I had a natural rosy glow.  Now 20 years later it is more blotchy and uneven.  This went on smoothly over my regular skin are regimen.  I put on two coats and then applied my usual finishing powder and bronzed powder.  This product did not give me any glow but extra shininess to my tone.  It temporarily evened out my tone but did not last more than a few hours on a 80 degree sunny day w minimal sweating.  Since there are no returns I will save this for winter when my skin is lighter and weather colder.  For now going Back to TooFaced nude glow as that gives nice and more natural skin tone, faded sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is light and blends well, but the foundation aspect is too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this in my mailbox so much sooner than the expected delivery date. All the hype about BB creams and I needed to know if it was really a miracle product! This particular company has so many to choose from that it took literally days to decide on which one was for me, especially since I had never used a BB cream before and didn&#x27;t know that much about them or this company. I read reviews and I trust Amazon.com, so it was on. I picked this one and I am glad I did. If you are new to BB creams or are just wanting something different, this is a good choice. You get lots of samples with your purchase. This cream goes on smoothly and can be a little greasy after wearing all day. I never wear this alone, I always use my bare minerals with it.  I thought I was just adding a little more coverage. I had a lot of redness to my skin and am always wanting flawless coverage and flawless porcelain like skin. This goes on a little chalky, but as it warms up to your skin temp, it is perfect and it only takes just a little pump or two to cover your whole face. I would recommend this for people with combination skin even if on the oily side (just use some powder to set) and for people who don&#x27;t want to use a lot of products, as this one multi-tasks. With all the hype now on CC creams, you could skip that and just use this product because of the coverage. It made my blotchy, red skin, even toned and flawless...I blended with a foundation brush and that made it even easier. I just applied SKIN 79 Super+ BB Cream to the large end of my foundation brush and began to apply from the inside (closer to my nose) first to the outside (towards my ears)..the coverage is exactly where you want it that way. You don&#x27;t want a ring around your face so people know you are wearing makeup!!! LOL! ;)&lt;br /&gt;Once blended and I make sure there are not any marks that need touching up, I set with my bare minerals (fairly medium as I have pretty light skin and am red headed, so I want to cover freckles too) and then with the mineral veil. No one has ever said, Wow! Look at all the makeup you are wearing!...instead, it is usually &amp;#34;your skin is so beautiful, what are you using?&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tell me your secret&amp;#34;!!! ;) And I would have given this 5 stars, but I was being hard for the greasy feeling toward the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Try this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed...I wasn&#x27;t and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to my beauty products!want to cover freckles too) and then with the mineral veil. No one has ever said, Wow! Look at all the makeup you are wearing!...instead, it is usually &amp;#34;your skin is so beautiful, what are you using?&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tell me your secret&amp;#34;!!! ;) And I would have given this 5 stars, but I was being hard for the greasy feeling toward the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Try this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed...I wasn&#x27;t and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to my beauty products!</li>
            <li> I was very nervous of purchasing this product and to end up with a fake BUT noooooo I made my research on YouTube and agh I&#x27;m so happy Pink Gelee has the original product!!!!!! I&#x27;m definitely purchasing more bb cream and other products from this seller.. Thank you PINK GELEE(:</li>
            <li> The first bb cream I tried was smashbox and I got a *perfect* color match with medium.  It looked good but it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; and it was fairly pricey.  Then I got to reading blogs and of course a gazillion amazon reviews about bb creams before I gave this a try.  It feels great going on and does even out skin tone, however the color just did not work for me.  Remember, I am a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; in smashbox.  The overall effect that I got was that of wearing zinc based sunblock (not unlike what I get when I wear eucerin daily protecting moisturizer with sunblock http://www.amazon.com/Eucerin-Daily-Protection-Moisturizing-Lotion/dp/B00008MNZH/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361361426&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;eucerin+sunscreen).  I thought it might just be me so I took it to work and let some of my less tan (more white) friends try it. They got the same look, it looked too light for them and it should not have been.  So in the end I will wear it on weekends and for the gym, etc, but it&#x27;s not a work or going out look for me.  I do love the feel but not everyone in my office liked how it felt on.</li>
            <li> This is the only BB cream I will buy. I don&#x27;t even bother with the big-name makeup brand versions; they&#x27;re not even close to the quality of this stuff. So glad to see it&#x27;s eligible for Amazon Prime now, but whenever I get this from a new seller, I always subject the packaging to intense scrutiny to make sure it&#x27;s an authentic product. The last two sellers I&#x27;ve bought from (SeoulGlamour and Pink Gelee) both had 100% authentic products. I&#x27;ll post another review when I order from the Prime provider.</li>
            <li> As someone with combination skin who has been struggling with acne for 15 years, this product is wonderful!  It blends well and matches my skin tone.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding make make up that covers my flaws and looks natural.  A little bit goes a long way and the free sample I got with it is also fabulous (heynature Black Diamond), so I will be ordering that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on lightweight but has great coverage- dark spots, scars and fine lines and all.  Made of high quality ingredients so I don&#x27;t have to worry about skin irritation.  It makes my skin look natural and luminescent; never caked on.  It lasts all day *and* it has spf.</li>
            <li> after hearing about how great this product is i finally purchased it.  i m really impressed with this bb.  i m a bb junkie and this is by far my favorite :) would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream. My sister uses this product  more than I do, I always get the gold not the pink. This goes really well with her skin, gives her a clean flawless complexion. It&#x27;s a lot of product for the price, and it isn&#x27;t a glorified tinted moisturizer like the american brand bb creams. Super thick, a little goes a long way, great coverage and does a really good job toning down the different colors on the face and evening out skiing tone. Did notice, if you are a little tan that usual or use too much product you get a grayish tint to your face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for oily skin though.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for the price, my face feels healthier after using this product for a few days. i have recommended to a few family members.</li>
            <li> I need to amend my review...the sample was fine, got 3 great uses out of it, a lil does go along way. OK now to the full size hot pink...first couple of uses were as great as the sample...after about the 4th application it totally turned into nothing but grease..(original review,Love it..blends out perfect for my yellow under tones...with the pink I do not even need foundation..a touch of concealer if needed...a dab of powder on sweaty days..mostly this, mascara and a bit of color on the lips and I&#x27;m done...less is more :)</li>
            <li> faster service and I like the product because it&#x27;s also gentle to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;the product blends well with other powder. and i highly recommend to try it especially for asian&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER Price is a good company. the product is authentic. i will surely buy more products from them.</li>
            <li> I received my hot pink BB cream from Seoulglamour today, and I&#x27;m super excited! It is definitely the real product, it passes ALL authenticity tests. Manufactured in Oct. of 2013 so it does not have authenticity sticker. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, and it is my first time with this product. I think I bought the wrong one for my dry skin, but I&#x27;ll give it a go anyways and try the VIP Gold one next time. Yaaaay! :)</li>
            <li> I received this product from the seller A-Poly and I&#x27;m quite certain that it is not a real SKIN79 bb cream because it did not have a authenticity label like all their products have. Despite being fake, the consistency is quite similar and has not broken me out yet. Still I would have much preferred receiving the real product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all my friend and I love this product.. I&#x27;m not gonna use other product,, I&#x27;m stay skin79 super BB</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this BB cream a lot! I have a pale, warmish skin tone with freckles, and this BB cream has light enough coverage so they show through. It is slightly buildable, however, allowing me to skip concealer for my dark circles if need be. Some people say you don&#x27;t need a moisturizer before you put it on, but I have quite dry skin and I apply moisturizer anyway. In fact, sometimes I don&#x27;t even use a setting powder with it since it absorbs well. Also, it&#x27;s a little more grey before it adjusts to your skin tone, but don&#x27;t be weirded out. Just make sure it&#x27;s even and you&#x27;ll have no problems! Here are a couple pics of my wearing it. I don&#x27;t have a before, but there is one close up of my face where you can really see my skin. [...]</li>
            <li> I had never used a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; BB cream, but I know regular foundation is too heavy for my skin, and tinted moisturizers aren&#x27;t quite enough for my minor pore issue and few blemishes. This BB cream is amazing! It provides a smooth, silky finish for my skin, without looking fake or even made up. It goes on a rather weird grayish color, but keep blending and it melts into your skin flawlessly. I have no trouble with it covering dark under eye circles, pores or small blemishes, and my skin is really getting better and more clear with every use. I have a very fair completion, so I can&#x27;t say it would work as well for some one with a more golden skin tone, but for me it has been a great go to product.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be way too light for my skin tone.  Also, I could never apply it anywhere near my eyes (burns) even though the YouTube video advised it makes great under eye concealer.  I plan to return it.</li>
            <li> I received the product promptly and it was well packaged. It does appear gray coming out of the bottle but quickly adapts to my skin color (which has lighter and darker areas). It is not incredibly moisturizing so I typically use a light moisturizer under it. As someone else suggested, I also use powder over my T-zone because it tends to be oily. Well priced, great to have products combined. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have done EVERYTHING to even out my skin tone and try to cover and heal dark spots left over from some acne scaring. I have very sensitive skin and it tends to be oilier than not most of the time. After MUCH research on products I found that a BB cream was the way I wanted to go, and after even more research I found that for sensitive skin all directions pointed to an Asian or Korean BB cream rather than the new American creams. Skin79 seemed to stand above most in ratings for sensitive skin types and in decreasing the appearance of post acne scarring. I am extremely careful about what I put on my skin bc of my sensitivity so I spent about a week researching before I settled on this particular BB cream as it seemed good for normal to oily skin as well as sensitive skin types. I only received this product Saturday so I obviously cannot speak to the decrease in appearance of my dark spots but I can rave about the coverage and quality of this product. I was VERY nervous about receiving an authentic cream after reading some of the horror stories but I feel very confident after researching how to tell a fake from an authentic that I received an authentic cream, from the box to the authenticity sticker, to the consistentancy of the cream I think I&#x27;m good to go. I must point out that I have an almost immediate reaction when I put something on that is going to cause a breakout (I mean so bad that if my husband even touches my face I will break out from the oils on his skin), and that did not happen after using this cream. I&#x27;m on day 3 and I&#x27;m actually noticing a decrease in the small bumps (not actual break outs). When I first put the cream on it is almost a grey color like others have said but quickly adjusts to blend into my skin and makes a noticeable difference in the tone and covers up almost completely the dark spots. I will not be able to use this product alone for complete coverage at this point but that was to be expected. I use a bit of concealor on small spots and then fix with mineral powder and my skin looks a feels great! It also works as a great primer as my makeup stays put all day! I am very happy with my purchase and I cannot wait to see if it does actually reduce the appearance in dark spots as others have said they noticed! I think that anyone who wants great looking skin should try this out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add an update to my review, I have been using my cream for almost 2 weeks now and I am absolutely in love with it! I have noticed a decrease in my dark spots and am slowly moving toward eliminating my concealor from my routine... not yet, but getting there... my skin looks great all day long and my makeup stays put through the day! I am very excited about finding skin79 bb cream!</li>
            <li> After trying the Skin79 BB Cream Miniature Mini Kit, I picked the bright pink to purchase full-size. I love the ease of use. The pump allows for perfect dispensing amount. I don&#x27;t need too much coverage and this blends well and gives a nice natural look while treating skin.</li>
            <li> Stats: I have normal skin, slight acne scars, a somewhat uneven skin tone and I&#x27;m pale (not asian, not ivory skinned...just pale).  I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for a month and so far it&#x27;s great.  It goes on really easily and will stay on all day if I put a light lotion on underneath. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the product or just a good month for me but I have had basically no acne (though I&#x27;m not super prone to breakouts) and I believe I can see an improvement in the texture of my skin/size of my pores.  Other reviews said that the color was kind of greyish but oxidized to their skin color...which I didn&#x27;t believe could be true but it is!!  I bet this could work with any skin tone, winter or summer.  Though the coverage is rather light, but it does even out your skin tone and covers any redness.  If you have heavy acne or a lot of dark spots, you may need a concealer.  I have dark circles and it covers enough that I don&#x27;t spend the extra $ or effort on a concealer.  I love how my skin feels with it on!  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and makes my skin feel great--soft &amp; balanced.  I tried the drugstore brand (G_____) before this and while I liked the luminosity of it, it was greasy, orangey, smelled SUPER strong, and it would be absorbed into my pores and gross after ~4-6 hours.  I&#x27;m not saying my face looks airbrushed now or anything but this BB cream is a great makeup if you want to look natural yet polished and have your face feel incredible during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is authentic!  Pink Gelee sent it asap and I got it very quickly, along with the samples and a cute card thanking me.  Highly recommended!!!  And the price is EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> Wow, I was nervous about buying this for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1) Did not know if I would get a fake or real product&lt;br /&gt;  -The seller(neverprice) has the real product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2) I also did not know if the product would match my skin tone because mine is not light but not dark its weird lol&lt;br /&gt;  -Worked wonderfully, when I put it on it did have a grey look but within about 10 minutes it looked perfect, I&#x27;m stunned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of this stuff, hopefully will be able to trade up my foundation! :-)</li>
            <li> This one is best for normal skin but can work for anyone as long as you set with powder. It&#x27;s usually the one I reach for over my other bb creams. I don&#x27;t have a lot of blemishes to cover but it does hide redness well.</li>
            <li> Nongreasy good coverage. I am not sure if it has faded any spots, I have been using for about a month.</li>
            <li> omg this stuff is made as plaster for those scary looking mannequins in stores! its thick and even on my fair skin looks ghostly white. terrible waste of money. used it once now stuck with a bottle of goo</li>
            <li> I just received this today and first thing I did was try it on the back of my hands. And it feels amazing! I can&#x27;t notice anything on there! Then I tried it on my face and still an amazing texture. It feels like my face is bare. Another thing I love is that it only took 8 days to send it here in New York. It did send from Korea so that is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;d like to comment on how amazing seoulglamour is. I paid for my order on March 1st and it was sent out on March 1st. The delivery date was estimated to be March 27-April 16 but I received it today March 12. Wow, that is incredibly fast shipping and the product is genuine! Extremely relieved that it is the real thing and completely happy with my purchase! I will definitely be buying again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, simply wonderful. I&#x27;m super pale (my shade is porcelain in most foundations and concealers) and this fit perfectly. I have a very oily t-zone, and combination skin and I get awful cyst like breakouts. I have not had a single issue with this BB Cream. Interested in trying some more! Definitely got swept up in the BB Cream craze and I&#x27;m so happy I did. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> First off- the delivery and service of this seller was good: very prompt, I received my cream within just a few days of ordering, it arrived in good condition and there&#x27;s an authenticity seal on the back, so no worries about fakes! I figure if you&#x27;re gonna spend the money, buy it from a place that&#x27;s guaranteeing the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself...is good. Like any make up, its a layer on top of your face, but this by far is the most natural looking cover I&#x27;ve used. Although it doesn&#x27;t give a dewy look to skin so kinda disappointed there.&lt;br /&gt;Also. Got two small zits on my temple, not sure if it&#x27;s product related. Did not have an allergic reaction!!! That&#x27;s major because I have extremely skin. This is def worth the shot, since the price is similar to most comparable foundations.</li>
            <li> This is great for medium coverage! I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup, but this is really easy to apply, and I mainly like it because it&#x27;s easy to blend with fingers (unlike most liquid foundations). I should caution that it is by no means a \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot; as some people testify. It will provide some coverage, but if you have really bad skin (severe acne, for instance) it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much, but for my occasional red spots and blackheads it does just fine! I also have sensitive skin, and didn&#x27;t get any adverse reaction (but you should always test a product on your wrist 24h before putting it on your face). As for the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; (which others assure me does not mean &#x27;bleaching&#x27;) I think it does have the effect of zapping the colour from your face (elsewise how would the pimples and discolouration get covered-up). I just add a bit of light blush after applying and it looks fine. One criticism I have is that I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s enough as a moisturizer on its own. I&#x27;ve taken to putting on some VERY LIGHT moisturizer on and allowing it to absorb before applying the BB cream. It&#x27;s important to realize that this is still MAKEUP and you need to wash your face at the end of the day, and give your skin a break sometimes (I wouldn&#x27;t wear foundation every day, why should I wear BB cream every day?). Overall I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Awful experience with this product. Makes my face look so cakey.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream brand.  Perfect for my coloration.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle will last up to 3 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Covers evenly and does not smell.</li>
            <li> Smooth bb cream ever!</li>
            <li> A grey colored liquid, smells very strongly of sunscreen, and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to my skin except make my makeup heavier</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing. It is perfect for light to medium skin tones. As it is a Korean BB cream and only comes in one shade, I was concerned that it would not match my skin tone. I am caucasion with light skin but tan easily in the summer. It blends into my skin perfectly. You cannot even tell that I am wearing it. The product does appear grayish when first applied to skin, however after a few minutes, it oxidizes and matches my skin tone perfectly. It controls oil well and stays matte for most of the day. This product did not cause me to break out. Skin79 has incorporated many natural ingredients into this product. It contains, sunflower, rice bran and ivy extracts. This BB cream has whitening properties, meaning that it can diminish or lighten dark spots, acne scars etc. I have noticed that many of my acne scars are fading in color. I have been using my BB cream for only a few weeks. This BB cream is also definately 100 percent authentic, and ships very fast from Korea! Seoul Glamour included two free samples and a cute book mark in my package! I would not suggest this product to those with very dry or mature skin. I would recommend the VIP Gold BB Cream to those of you who have more mature or dry skin. If you have younger, acne prone skin then you should try this Skin79 Hot Pink BB Cream. Great price and Great product.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well on me. I feel like my skin has generally gotten a lot better since I&#x27;ve used this. I use it almost every day and it&#x27;s lasting me as you only need a little. Goes on smooth...looks really natural. Since I&#x27;ve gotten more tan in the summer, it looks a tad light, but nevertheless it still works. I was afraid of getting a fake product because of all the fake knock offs out there, but this one was a genuine product from seoulglamour. Love it! Will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> This is truly the holy grail of BB creams. I&#x27;m so thrilled that I purchased this item. It states what it truly says it does. Bye, bye tinted moisturizer and everyday foundation! Thank you skin 79 you truly are a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> I have only started using this product but seems very promising however I did not receive the free sample as shown I will continue to use this product to see if the results are as advertised</li>
            <li> MY skin type: fair, acne prone, combination,&lt;br /&gt;Age: mid 20s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bare escentuals user for over 10 years, I was hesitant to switch over to a BB cream. But after my skin cleared up from acne, I didn&#x27;t need as much coverage so I decided to look into a BB. Raving reviews were all over the web about this product. Seeing the price, it was worth a try. I&#x27;m now on my 2nd bottle and made one of the smartest decisions of my life! My makeup routine has significantly simplified with this product. it literally takes me less than 10 minutes to get ready. Coverage is just right, but for those who have dark post acne marks, brown spots or dark circles under the eyes might need an extra concealer. It leaves your skin moisturized and literally with a little glow. Definitely might feel a little like a sunscreen when your rubbing it on your face, and the color may seem initially a little ashy, but when the product meets your face, the warmth and pigments of the BB simply melt into your skin and the color matches perfectly. Definitely recommend to those who want to try a BB and a new Holy Grail for their face!</li>
            <li> I watched YouTube videos, ready reviews, etc and decided to give the Pink bottle a try since it was the one that seemed to be best for Acne prone skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now, and the next morning I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin without makeup.  I&#x27;ve been applying this product twice a day, even though I know it is generally meant to be a day cream.  But I wanted to test its affects overnight.  As of right now, I wake up with smaller and fewer new acne, when before I was waking up to new pimples that were pretty large and in charge on almost a daily basis.  I am interested to see how my skin reacts to the product in a few days since that is when I will be going through my worst acne-time of the month.  Girls, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.  The oilyness of my skin has reduced slightly, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.  I still get very oily, but I don&#x27;t think it gets as bad as usual.  I still have to use blotting papers a couple times in the day depending on the temperatures outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the lack of color availability.  I am Puerto Rican, and while I have lighter tone skin, it does have a yellow undertone.  This product does have a very gray effect on my skin if I over-apply.  I&#x27;ve been using about a half a pump each time I put it on.  I rub my fingertips together and dab it all over my face before rubbing it in.  The graying effect is there, but not terribly noticeable; especially after I do my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall at the moment, I am very satisfied with the product.  I will give more feedback as I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again. Left my skin glowing. All you need is a little bit of this and some powder for an amazing look.</li>
            <li> Their product isn&#x27;t worth it, the package was off, the product was way to bright and dry, what a waste of my money!!! I ordered the Missha BB cream in #21. I normally use that but decided to try from this company \\&quot;Seoul Glamour\\&quot; NEVER AGAIN, don&#x27;t waste your money, if you order the cream you&#x27;re better off gettin from another seller</li>
            <li> Like most people, I am skeptic about the review on here as to whether they are true or if the product will work the same for me. But I must say that this product is quite amazing. I tried the VIP gold sample first just to see what a BB cream was like and I hated it. I came out to thick and cakey, so I was unsure how the Hot Pink one would come out. I put the hot pink one on and i was immediately worried about the fact that my face look gray! But everyone says it should oxidize in a few minutes and I was surprised it actually did. It is definitely made for people with fair skin though. The texture is like a foundation but a little thicker because of the sunscreen. It smells nice. It has a dewy finish and i have normal skin so by the end of the day my skin does tend to look a bit shiny. Overall a great product :)</li>
            <li> I bought this from Pink Gelee and yes, it is authentic.  You can watch the fake versus real comparison on Youtube.  This is my first time ever using any type of bb cream.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I also don&#x27;t ever use foundation or concealer.  I wanted to try Skin79 due to the reviews and the benefits of medium coverage, anti-wrinkle properties, and SPF.  First time I tried the bb cream, I used moisturizer and I think since I am on the somewhat oily skin type, it was little too moist for me.  Next day, I used it without moisturizer and it was much better for me.  I&#x27;m not super oily but I do have the t-zone/combination skin.  I do have dry spots as well during winter.  My skin tone looked much better with this cream since it evens out my face.  It matched me well.  I am Asian with pale-yellow skin tone.  It surprisingly looked natural on me.  However, while applying it, it does have a slight gray color as some have said.  That vanishes as it sets into your skin.  I really like it for my eyes as well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a wrinkle line or cause flake.  I am happy with my purchase :).  Since I never tried any other BB cream, sorry I cannot compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister, on the other hand, wasn&#x27;t too happy with the skin79.  Unlike me, her skin is fair/white with some pink tones.  I think she wants that lighter-white powder finish so if you want that, you might not like this.  I prefer natural beige.  My sister plans on trying Missha since they have more skin color options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is wondering, I did receive samples with my purchase (three of them).</li>
            <li> First off Hot Pink Super+ is targated as &amp;#34;all normal skin, SPF protection, whitening feature, sebum control, and wrinkle improvement&amp;#34;. If you have oily/combination skin I would suggest SKIN79 Intense Classic or Super Perfection. Or if you have dry/combination skin I would suggest VIP Gold Super +.  As everyone knows the Hot Pink SKIN79 goes on a little gray, and then blends into your skin tone. However, how quickly it blends, depends on how warm your skin is at application. First time my skin was fairly warm, and it blended in quickly. I’m of Irish/German descent and have fairly light olive skin and it matched perfectly. It covers well for me, but I do not have problematic skin, so coverage is not a worry of mine…and a little goes a long way.. It has a very light feeling and the smell is pleasant. Just to clear up a misnomer, the only difference between Hot Pink Skin79 pump containers that contain the wording “Wrinkle Free” or “Wrinkle Improvement” are, those that say “Wrinkle Improvement” are manufactured by Wizcoz Co., the makers of SKIN79 in South Korea. The containers that say “Wrinkle Free” are distributed by SKIN79 North America.</li>
            <li> I was worried it was going to be a fake, but it turned out to be the real deal and worked very well. Not the best BB Cream for oily skin or to conceal blemishes, but it works.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to order makeover through Amazon because I&#x27;m afraid it would be fake. This confirm my suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because of all the positive review. However, the minute I took the bottle out of the box I knew it was a fake. The bottle wasn&#x27;t circular and the writing looked completely fake. The cream does not blend in at all, it just look like thick creamy lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return it but apparently there is a no return policy on this product. Needless to say, I am never ordering make up from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I really love this BB CREAM because it  helps even out my skin tone before I apply my foundation. I don&#x27;t even need moisturizer when I use this. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and leaves my skin looking dewy and really pretty! The container is generously sized to last A LONG TIME which I love. I would not recommend using this as a standalone product because the color is very light almost greyish when applied, however it does oxidize and change to a more normal color after a few mins but I still would not use this product on its own without foundation over it and a setting powder. I really love it and definitely plan on repurchasing either this one or the Gold one next time. :-))</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and because of this, I stopped using liquid foundation a couple of years ago. My skin has improved but I hated not having anything to set my powder with... I love love love this product! It DOES apply a little thick with a slight grey hue but if you just give it a minute or 2, it blends smooth and will match to skin tone. Its absolutely perfect and I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I like it because he is gently and fresh my face skin when i go my work everyone ask me my face it so soft and lightly thanks my friend seller.</li>
            <li> Coverage was terrible, made my skin break out, waste of money.  I bought it after all the good reviews I read on here.  I think only good reviews are only posted on here because this product was really useless.  Back to regualar drug store make up.</li>
            <li> It too light for my light-medium face and I don&#x27;t recommend it because it made my face skin tone sooo uneven!!!! I have wait for 30 minutes but it still the same...</li>
            <li> If I weren&#x27;t so crazy about constantly trying new things, I would have stopped right here and labeled this my HG bb.  This was the first one I&#x27;ve tried, and 4-5 brands later, I still can&#x27;t reproduce some of the things I really liked about this cream.  The finish/texture this gives me is fantastic.  It smooths on nicely (a little goes a long way) and has higher coverage than many bb creams out there.  I&#x27;ve tried this on bare skin or after a full routine and it has great lasting power without clogging my pores.  It gives me a nice dewy, polished look without looking greasy, and works for several different skin types and tones.  I am mixed race (Korean and white) in my mid-20&#x27;s with naturally oily skin while my best friend is a very white German/Irish girl in her 30&#x27;s with combination skin that can get dry in places.  We both use and love this product which adjusts to match both our skin tones and have both noticed fewer breakouts.  I also tried this on my mom (who is Korean but has a much darker skin tone than me...sort of a caramel color), as well as my friend&#x27;s mom (who is white but has very dry skin), and the tone adjusted to match them as well.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with bb creams, this will go on a light grayish color, but adjusts to different skin tones after a few minutes.  I feel like the range in color of the 4 people I know who have tested it is pretty decent, but of course it probably won&#x27;t adjust far enough for people with deeper skin tones.  I really love how this cream not only looks great, but I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; my skin from it.  I of course remove it at night before my normal skin routine, but I can wear this every day with no skin problems.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best BB cream I have ever used.  It matches my skin tone perfectly and diminishes my dark post acne marks.  I use it only where I need it, and apply it with a brush.  It does not make me break out, which most products do. (I have very sensitive skin)  Katie the babe is a great seller too!  She worked late to send my package out sooner than expected, and contacted me personally to let me know.  She also sent me some great samples with it.  I liked it so much, I ordered another right away from her.  This is the genuine article!</li>
            <li> The seller was wonderful and the product is authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - it clogged my pores and caused a major breakout. Since I have not noticed any benefits while using this cream (coverage is \\&quot;barely there\\&quot;, moisturizing properties are sub-par, no \\&quot;porcelain skin\\&quot; effect), I do not see any point in buying it again.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of the BB creams coming out on the market from mainstream U.S. and European based companies are just overpriced and relabeled tinted moisturizers (Garnier, Smashbox, etc). This product is different. It gives far better coverage than a tinted moisturizer, brightens and evens out skin tone, and has some oil control properties. My skin is very fair with cool undertones, and I have been frustrated for years that most makeup lines available in the U.S. don&#x27;t even carry a color light enough for my skin, and are predominantly yellow-toned. So I&#x27;m very pleased to find that BB creams such as this one can accommodate the lightest of skins. This BB cream blended very well and is neutral and sheer enough that it could work with most light to medium skin tones, and for normal to oily skin. I had good results starting with a small amount then patting on more in areas where I needed more coverage. I wonder if the folks on here that noticed a grayish cast had over applied it. I knocked off one star because I wish it had controlled oil a bit better (I still had to powder) and really did nothing to help my purplish undereye circles. Overall, I think for the price it is a great product. I have heard rumors of counterfeit products being sold and the Skin79 US official website states that they do not have any authorized dealers on Amazon or Ebay. However, I purchased from SeoulGlamour on Amazon and the product appears to be authentic and fresh (date of manufacture June 2012). There is an in-depth youtube vid out there on how to spot fakes if you are concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, even though I&#x27;ve watched a bunch of youtube videos and read a bunch of product reviews, I didn&#x27;t know exactly what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, seoulglamour is awesome. I know the seller says Pink Gelee but I received the shipment from seoulglamour today (July 17) after ordering on July 6th, way before the shipping estimate of August 1st-August 21st. I&#x27;m super impressed by that because 1. shipping was free, and 2. the product ships all the way from Korea. Awesome. It also came with a sample for the VIP Gold BB cream plus a sample for a Missha BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things that catches anyone&#x27;s attention is the adorable dispenser that the Hot Pink BB creams in. It&#x27;s definitely a good size--it could easily fit in your purse but it holds plenty of product. I like the dispenser because it makes it really easy to measure how much you&#x27;re using, versus sticking your finger into a jar or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream itself comes out looking fairly dark, but applies a light grey that fades over time. I&#x27;m already a pretty pale Asian so it more or less matched my skin (yellow undertones and all!) right out of the dispenser. The BB cream also has a light, flowery sort of fragrance. You can definitely smell it out of the dispenser but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it bothered me at all, especially since my mom has used fragrant Shiseido products all of her life so I&#x27;m used to scented skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink is definitely more of a tinted moisturizer than a replacement for foundation. It&#x27;s pretty light--it has the consistency of lotion and doesn&#x27;t do much to cover blemishes or anything. I applied two coats to half of my face (the equivalent of one squirt) and it noticeably whitened some of the natural redness in my cheeks but obviously didn&#x27;t do much for the acne on my forehead. I&#x27;ve seen people apply a few coats to cover blemishes, but I have a feeling that wouldn&#x27;t work out with my skin. I would say that it perfects your skin morethan anything else. If you&#x27;re going for that \\&quot;make-up to look like you didn&#x27;t put on make-up\\&quot; look, this is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that Hot Pink is an amazing first BB cream, especially considering the great price. I wish it had been a bit heavier (I know the VIP Gold is known for being better for coverage) and more whitening on my skin, but I have no real complaints.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. Will rebuy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is real or fake, but I didn&#x27;t like the consistency and the way it looked. It does smell good compared to other American BB cream however.</li>
            <li> This was my first BB cream.  It&#x27;s advertised for being for oliy skin. I have combination skin and I found that this product made me look very skinny. I woul suggest using this if you only have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after hearing all the buzz on BB creams, and that Asian versions are better then the ones you can buy here in the U.S. The product was delivered very fast, and according to the web, the one I received is REAL, not one of the fake ones that some people are apparently receiving.  It covers great, does look a little gray when it first goes on, but once it&#x27;s blended it looks like my natural skin tone (Im white with olive undertones, skin is pretty pale during the colder months though) it also gives a slightly dewy look, so if you are wanting a matte finish, you will need to use a powder. The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars is because it seems to make my skin breakout. I have really sensitive skin, so it may not affect all people this way, but I thought I should mention it In the review. Other then that, overall very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both of Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink and Gold label BB Creams last month have been using them for about 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an alternative light tinted moisturizer with spf that did not feel heavy. This does the trick from me. It protects &amp; nourish my skin, evens my skin tone and last all day and does not rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will be replacing my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer.  Unlike Laura Mercier, they do not settle in the fine lines under my eyes and I do not have apply a separate primer.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I use Gold for colder, drier days and Pink on cool/warmer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; coverage moisturize/primer/foundation in one.  Emphasis on sheer, do not expect it to cover all your blemishes or promient pigmentation/freckles.  If you want medium to full coverage look for something else, use this primer or apply concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These BB creams are best applied in thin layers. Dot the product on your face and patt with two/three fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply with a brush, sponge or spread with your finger like you would do with a liqued or cream foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gender: F&lt;br /&gt;Age:  31&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type:  Combination (acne prone)&lt;br /&gt;Foundation: MUFE 118/MAC NC20/LM Tinted Sand</li>
            <li> I love this product. First time user but i love it already! it smells good and its not oily on my face its really smooth and i look natural on it unlike other products. I will buy this again. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is one of the better BB creams readily available in the United States.  South Korea produces numerous high quality BB creams but they are hard to find in the States and can be expensive to ship.  This is a solid product that produces good results keeping your skin clear and light.</li>
            <li> This was authentic and made my fair skin look flawless.  It dries down to a satin-matte finish.  I loved this and used it for about two weeks...until I broke out with cystic acne while using this.  Once I discontinued use, my skin cleared up with no other change to my skincare regimen...so I&#x27;m setting it was this.  So disappointed since it really did make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the reviews on any product related to this item, it puts them all on all of them. Even though some of them read &amp;#34;FAKE&amp;#34;, I don&#x27;t know which seller sells the fake ones. So I decided if it was fake, I&#x27;d just send it back. Luckily, I got a real one. I actually ordered 2 and they both were fine. As far as BB creams go, this does the trick. I put it on and it has really nice coverage. Not enough to mask your face. The whitening is a great thing to it because I like having a lighter face. The white may be a little too much so I put Revlon Colorstay powder over it in Light and it gives my face some of its color back. The Packaging is awesome. The pump is great! You barely need a big pump. So to tell if it is real, It should have a perforated line on the back of the box. On top of the box there will be a faint red circle. Just faint enough to know its there. Thats another way to tell. The last one is, if you look in the box, It should say &amp;#34;SKIN 79&amp;#34; and there should be American writing on one wall of the box and other Korean languages inside. Hope this helps! Also, you can search a video on youtube and they explain it all. I got this from PINK GELEE and it was real. REAL REAL REAL!!!! So excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I just received mine and after research, I deem it to be genuine. It feels great, and I even received more samples than I expected. It feels very natural on the skin, and is everything that I heard about this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this BB cream on amazon since I&#x27;veheard many people can get fakes but this one was authentic and it&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy and leaves my skin nourished without being too shiny. The color blends into my skin right away as well. It&#x27;s a sheer natural finish but still somehow manages to completely hide my imperfections while letting my freckles and skin show through. I was so surprised when i put it on and it made my pores completely invisible, i dont even get that with full coverage foundation! It&#x27;s much better than the Skin79 Triple Function bb cream which barely gave me coverage and looked greasy/ gray. I really recommend this no matter if your skin is clear or imperfect!</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than anticipated and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week.  Excellent texture and the color just slides into your skin and evens out your complexion.  My face feels moisturized and even toned!</li>
            <li> The estimated delivery was a month after ordering, but it arrived in 2 weeks. The BB cream came in its pink box, and was accompanied with not only a sample of VIP gold cream, but also a sample of BB cleanser and a little bookmark from seoulglamour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When purchasing this product, I was very concerned about its authenticity, as this 40g bottle was much cheaper on Amazon than on Skin79&#x27;s official website. I checked the box and the bottle thoroughly upon arrival (and re-watched multiple Youtube videos on real vs. fake Skin79 BB cream), and decided that this was the real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream is thick and appears gray when freshly applied. Only half a pump is needed for covering the face. After a minute of application, it blends in and evens out skin tone. Additional layers of cream can be applied to dark eye circles, sun spots, etc. (There are also youtube videos that give instructions on how to apply BB cream.) To remove the BB cream, I use Pond&#x27;s classic cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other sunscreens, this BB cream has a light, pleasant scent, and does not \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; the skin. It is similar to Neutrogena&#x27;s dry-touch sunblock in consistency. Its oil control makes it a comfortable wear in the summer. Powder and blush are applicable but optional; this cream looks very natural on its own.</li>
            <li> Received it today...and i put it right on. Love the way it feels and looks. Blends in perfectly. Super excited!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I Got my skin79 BB cream from seoul glamour and it was 100 % authentic. It works great and covers all my flaws. I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore!</li>
            <li> This had great reviews, so I gave it a try. I&#x27;m sure it would work for some,  but this isn&#x27;t what I was looking for. Creamy, but heavy texture and coverage, and the shade (there&#x27;s only one) is too gray and dark for my lighter skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for maturer skin types.</li>
            <li> If I could I think I would have given it a 3.5 stars. But anyways, this is the first BB cream that I&#x27;ve tried since I heard a lot of good things about it. I usually use about 0.5-1 pump to cover my face and neck. A little goes a long way. The coverage is alright for my skin; I usually go back and add a little more to cover my acne scars and my dark circles. It has a very matte finish and my face feels really soft and velvety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it&#x27;s a bit too light for my skin tone. I&#x27;m Asian and my skin is tan but my face is usually a lot whiter than the rest of my body. But then some days it blends and oxidizes well with my skin, its kinda weird. Also I think it looks a lot better and more natural during the day with the sunlight. I&#x27;ve applied it as my foundation when I would go out at night and oh man it is just no bueno. Pictures are alright until you take a picture with flash, then you just look like a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it and I would recommend it, but beware if you&#x27;re darker skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Whether or not this product is authentic, I have no idea, but my skin didn&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 bottles of this. Even though it did not cover all my freckle. It does make my complexion looks even.</li>
            <li> The bottle that I received was fake.  I&#x27;m disappointed because I loved the real makeup, but now I&#x27;m worried that I will keep receiving fakes. The bottle was even shaped differently than real makeup. I tried it on my arm and it stained it for 3 days.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to be a miracle cream that made me look flawless while on and made my skin look better when off.  Unfortuantely that just didn&#x27;t happen.  It looked like I was wearing foundation and it felt like it.  I looked more &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; than I normally do.  I normally use a powder foundation.  I am 42.  I have large pores on and around my nose and every liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried makes me break out.  Based on previous reviews I didn&#x27;t think I would have that problem with this cream.  I took it off every night using Neutrogena make up remover towlettes and then washed my face w/Murad.  I got horrible pimples... lots of them and my pores were stretched out even more while using this cream, making them more visible.  super sad this was just like every other foundation for me.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this BB cream.  Every where people raved about it.  SO I bought it and tried it.  It is not for people who have dry skin.  Even after applying a generous amount of moisturizer before applying this BB cream my face still felt dry and tight.  It covers great.  Has really cute packaging.  May be great for normal to oil skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used professional quality makeup for years and this stuff has been a nice reprieve price wise. I&#x27;ve wanted to try BB creams but haven&#x27;t been impressed by American varieties. If you want a BB cream to act like a foundation you really need to consider South Korean brands. American brands are better described as tinted moisturizers at best, certainly not foundation coverage. Be aware that it isn&#x27;t oil free and that&#x27;s because the oils in this cream is part of the skincare component. I&#x27;ve used it without any issues and find that it works best layered with a primer, then powder and finally the BB cream. When I use it this way, it lasts all day long. Yes, it&#x27;s only one shade but it seems to do a decent job of adjusting. Both my mom and I use it and we have different skin tones. Granted we aren&#x27;t a lot different but enough that if we were buying regular foundation, I&#x27;m consistently at least 1 or 2 shades lighter than my mom with most brands. Also, when it starts running out, you can get the tube out of the pink outer casing, twist the top off and scoop out the remaining cream. This tube does a great job of getting all the product out but there seems to be a tiny bit left at the very end.</li>
            <li> The coverage is adequate, and you can layer it on for more if you want.  I&#x27;m able to wear this all day long without breakouts, sweating it off, or any other issues.  I have combination skin, though it tends to get oily in the summer.  I&#x27;m able to wear this BB cream without moisturizer and with only applying loose powder over top.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefits like wrinkle reduction or getting rid of dark spots, but I guess it&#x27;s at least not making these things any worse.  And yes, the color seems off and kind of grayish, but it blends right into my skin tone (very fair skinned), and I never have to worry about the dreaded makeup line around my chin.  The container is much smaller than it appears in the picture, but the stuff lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry this is the real BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this to dark or even tan skin tones because it is a very light color.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how well I ended up liking this product.  I have very oily skin so was reluctant to try at first.  It has actually improved my overall skintone as I have continued to use it.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin any more oilier nor does it tend to fade or wipe off as I have to blot during the day.  Would definitely recommend it and would buy again or something similar.</li>
            <li> Covers up the skin really well and does a pretty good job at clearing some blemishes too. This product does make you look a lot paler though, which for me, I didn&#x27;t like. But overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> looks grey on my skin , I am light olive .</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best bb cream! Has been using it for quite awhile now and I really like it. It makes your skin looks smoother but only provides a medium coverage, If you are looking for a bb cream that gives you a natural look, this is definitely the bb cream for you. It is really greyish but it blends with your skin color well. This is good for people with oily skin like me but I would like to try the vip gold one for the winter.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome BB creme. This and the Missa #23 are my favorites. They both make great primers for makeup.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the seller. They sell truly authentic SKIN79 product&#x27;s for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now at first impression the Pink Label BB cream by Skin79 seems great. I purchased this for my sister and on her first application you could quickly see a brighter more healthy/natural glow.  The color is a little intimidating because it is so light, but it I found that blends nicely with your own skin color once it is massaged in to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great skin care product to begin with for girls in their late teens or early to mid 20&#x27;s. Lots of natural beneficial nutrients, and a great skin protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t usually wear make up but want something to cover the dullness of my skin tone, and this totally does it. unlike other bb creams that are usually dry, it also moisturizes. It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear even under the Boston dry winter weathers. The only thing is that I feel the bottle does not smell as strong as the samples for some reason, and I really liked the smell of the sample.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is absolutely amazing. It blends effortlessly into the skin and can be used as a sheer to medium coverage &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;. It has never broken me out, and if fact has made my skin look better over time. It provides a beautiful, natural finish that is neither too dewy or too matte. Holds up well against oil and humidity, and does not amplify dry spots. GREAT for Combination/Oil skins.</li>
            <li> good, bought couple times</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. I haven&#x27;t even used it for 3 days and already my skin looks more beautiful and flawless than it had in ages. PERFECT replacement for foundation.  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> First of all, buy it from Pink Gelee seller (authentic!)&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I am half black and my skin is pretty tan (think Rihanna&#x27;s shade) and in order to match it, I add a little bit of my foundation to it and wahla! Blends perfectly. It&#x27;s nice because I can add however much I need depending on the season (more color for summer because I tan, less in winter because I get lighter).</li>
            <li> Shipping was much quicker than I had anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bb cream is legitimate. I was weary before ordering it because I did not want to receive a fake. However, I did my fare share of research and this bb cream passed all the tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is much darker than I had remembered (my sister has this bb cream and I tried hers out) it (I am terribly pale) however when I blend/buff it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend buying some samples to see which one you like best.</li>
            <li> So with a million good reviews and youtube videos I thought this would be amazing. It wasn&#x27;t. It was gray and oily. It felt gloopy on my face and didn&#x27;t have coverage what so ever. I&#x27;m pretty sure its fake too because if you look at SKIN79&#x27;s actual website they have changed the product packaging. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the good reviews. This product is made from ash and fake product factory worker&#x27;s tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I never got a &amp;#34;free random gift&amp;#34; with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and light but with great coverage. I got tired of spending tons of money on designer brands, so I tried this and I love it. Goes on smooth, never cracks or gets cakey, and stays on for hours. If you use primer, it&#x27;ll stay on all day. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural looking foundation, this is perfecto</li>
            <li> I use this and send some samples to my sister who loves it as well, so I sent her this for her birthday.  She got it in a couple of weeks (the official shipping time said it would take 4-6 weeks) so we were both very happy.  I didn&#x27;t ask her if she got a &amp;#34;random&amp;#34; gift with it.</li>
            <li> It was very pale for me and I have skin tone between light and medium. I had to buy a medium colored bb cream to mix with this bb cream to reach somewhat to my skin tone. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you are pale.</li>
            <li> This BB cream gives very good coverage, but keep in mind that that means it finishes quite thick and matte. If you&#x27;re new to BB creams, this is a good start! Also, this is definitely for oily skin so stay away if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love BB cream, and I will only buy the skin79 because other brands are not nearly as good. I do hate that you can&#x27;t see how much is left in it, so I have to keep an extra on hand just in case I run out. It also takes a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. I love all BB Cream really but this works so well. I love the way it makes my face look. I&#x27;m hispanic and my skin tone isn&#x27;t fair but nor is it dark, yet this doesn&#x27;t change the color or anything. It just evens everything out and makes it seem very smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Haven&#x27;t seen all the benefits the product markets, even skin tone, etc. I have been using it for about 2.5 months now.</li>
            <li> I thought this would make me look younger and cover well, just made me look white, still had to do all my normal makeup routine after so this just added a step</li>
            <li> Its perfect and it goes on flawlessly! I love it and it lasts all day for me. I was very hesitant to buy it and after forever i did and i am glad. The only reason it gets 4 stars because when it goes on it has a slight gray color that needs time to seep into your skin and then it evens out but give it time to like arrange to the color of your skin. If that makes sense, well that&#x27;s how it is for me. But if you want a light everyday coverage then buy this!!</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the genuine product! Some sellers may send you a fake product. My purchase of the &amp;#34;fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; version, from the seller &amp;#34;k-beauty&amp;#34;, seems to be authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, Skin79 Hot Pink BB cream is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried a variety of Korean BB creams, including Missha, Heynature, Lioele, and Skinfood.) It oxidizes a bit dark and so it matches my (medium complexion Asian) skin tone much better than other Korean BB&#x27;s, which tend to be made for very pale skin. Coverage is light, and the finish is matt but slightly (very slightly) reflective, giving a soft diffuse glow. This cream is medium consistency. I have dry skin on my cheeks, so I apply a very light moisturizer to those areas under the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Skin79 BB already has a cult following, so you can find plenty of in-depth reviews of it just by doing a google search. The main issue with buying this BB cream is that its popularity resulted in a variety of Chinese knock-offs, some of which look very convincing. While the packaging of the fakes might look real, the product inside can contains all sorts of fillers or chemicals and might not be same to put on your face. Unfortunately, Amazon lists the same product from multiple sellers under one listing, and some may very well be fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This review is only for the Fulfilled by Amazon version purchased from the seller &amp;#34;k-beauty&amp;#34; ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin79 has changed the packaging over the years. According to Skin79&#x27;s official website, the BB creams no longer include a perforated box or authenticity sticker (since January 2013), and they removed the &amp;#34;KFDA 3-functions certification&amp;#34; text from the bottle on (July 2013), along with other design changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some indications of a genuine bottle:&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> I loved this product and will be reordering it soon!! It&#x27;s great for oily skin types. I have oily skin and I&#x27;m prone to acne breakouts. It does have a grey color at first but you have to let it set and it will blend into your skin tone. It&#x27;s great as a primer and overall maintains my skin oily free throughout the day. Most importantly this product feels so nice on my skin!</li>
            <li> I caved in to the BB cream hype. I have tried Garnier which felt like a glorified tinted moisturizer. Since it is difficult to find Korean BB creams I. My area, I didn&#x27;t have to look any further than Amazon. For $9.99 plus shipping, there was hardly anything to lose. As soon as I received my package, I ripped it open and tried it on. it looked ashy at first, but the BB cream blended into my skin tone. It made my already glowing skin even better. It also has SPF which is important to me. It was my best beauty purchase of the year.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out so bad that even my husband noticed. Be careful when buying this! specially who you buy it from!</li>
            <li> I love this even more than my expensive MAC studio fix fluid. It creates a flawless look and never clogs my pores, even if I accidentally sleep in it I have no irritation whatsoever! It makes my skin look and feel better even after taking it off. Amazing stuff, I&#x27;ll never buy foundation again!</li>
            <li> i purchased this product as a gift for my friend. she says its nice to her skin and asked me about where she could buy it. im very hapy that she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I ever used love it</li>
            <li> I use this as I would any other foundation and I love its color and coverage. HOWERVER YOU MUST WASH YOU FACE. This is like any other make up product and you need to wash your face its not a moisturizer or a wrinkle treatment its an all in one make up that has the benefits of wrinkle cream and such. I would truly recomend to anyone</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream. It goes on like a dream, covers my flaws and give me add protection and antioxidant. This lasts all day and is reasonably price. Amount is good in this container. The sample blush is nice too, just sparingly. Lasts all day. Should remove with a good cleanser, I use Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox Effect.  Excellent value for money on all three products. I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li> Favorite new foundation!! I hope that it never gets discontinued or stops being sold on Amazon.  Goes on really light with almost a weird green tint but quickly evens out perfectly.  Use alone for light coverage, with a concealer for medium.  I don&#x27;t recommend for heavy coverage.  Feels super soft.  Cute packaging.  Two cons, it stings my eyes and I can&#x27;t see how much I have left.  It came with samples which are great for traveling or using if I run out without realizing it&#x27;s gone.  I definitely recommend this, just as with all makeup, watch your eyes.</li>
            <li> I am fair and this product worked fine with my skin tone, evening it out and making a mid coverage layer for makeup application. When I spray tan I add a squirt of a darker foundation to blend better with the tone. The container is a beautiful pump that keeps the bb balm protected from bacteria and it pumps out slowly in a nice amount. It arrived quickly and was as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not look like makeup but makes me look very smooth and even.  I&#x27;m also very oily but this keeps me from getting shiny.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to compare to this. Many have tried, but nobody can imitate the perfection of this BB cream. I have been stopped on the street so many times (and this at age 50) with the question of what I use that I can&#x27;t ever think of changing. I&#x27;ve given this as little why not gifts to friends who have had interest and they&#x27;ve gotten hooked too. What is really curious about it is that once on, one waits a few minutes, and it adjusts to your skin tone, and this with a wide range. I&#x27;m very pale, and my daughter is olive, but it is perfect for both of us. Don&#x27;t be freaked if you put it on and at first you think you look ultra pale...wait and it will adjust. Also, don&#x27;t make the mistake of using too much. Unlike many other products, a little goes a long way, and a little stays on. For the price it is really worth a try! As for authenticity, I&#x27;ve bought this from this seller many times, checking the fake facts and have never found any. I have stayed away from some other sellers whose products do appear to differ from what should be authentic, and sell at lower prices. I&#x27;ll always check for authenticity with every purchase, but with amazon backing everything I buy, I feel pretty safe.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004R5E12M SKIN79 Super+ BB Triple Function Hot Pink SPF25/PA++ 40g (Autheticity Label &amp; Perforations with Free VIP Gold Sample!!!)]]&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product through Pink Gelee via Amazon. The service was fantastic. I received my product in barely five days, the package was new and the seal was intact. The seller included samples with my order.&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and am recovering from a severe allergic reaction to another cosmetic. My skin is now hyper-sensitive and I&#x27;m covered in red spots. The BB cream calms and protects my skin. I was surprised to find that it covers well too. Even more surprising, it feels light and the sunscreen does not irritate my eyes. I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;It does look grayish when freshly applied but will adjust to your skin tone after five minutes or so. I would not recommend this for anyone with olive or darker skin tones, however, I believe Skin79 makes a product with a darker shade.&lt;br /&gt;The only warning I have is that a full pump of this product is more than enough for three heavy applications. Dispense it lightly.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with both the seller and the product and highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time BB cream buyer, then I suggest you give this one a try. Not only does it contain the important UVA-UVB protection and whitening ingredient (Arbutin - which is missing in North American versions and is essential in Blemish Balm creams considering it lightens the blemishes and age spots!), but it provides even coverage and is not heavy feeling on my face. It sets well without having to use a powder on top of it (but if you want more coverage than it offers, feel free to use a powder with it obviously). It is also the real deal, not the fake Skin79 stuff that many ebay buyers are getting.</li>
            <li> Purchased this bb cream from seoulglamour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is real:&lt;br /&gt;  1) Skin79 authenticity logo on back of bottle&lt;br /&gt;  2) Shiny \\&quot;BB\\&quot; logo on front of bottle&lt;br /&gt;  3) No misspelling or different language(chinese/taiwainese) used&lt;br /&gt;  4) flowery smell like it should be, and smooth creamy texture and not chunky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works real well on my fairly tan skin.&lt;br /&gt;The grey shade is noticeable only after a few mins of application,&lt;br /&gt;afterwards the visibility of my pores and other discoloration of skin(minor red marks) are 90% gone;&lt;br /&gt;the layer of cream doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or suffocating the skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;It also restricts my sebum oil. I Barely sweat it during workout.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too light so i dont look like a ghost or pale because it adapts to my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is it is better than that heavy chunky garnier bb cream.</li>
            <li> I really liked the all-in-one usefulness of this product, and I think it would be great for people who normally put on multiple products in the morning. However, I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup over my entire face, so I often forget to take it off at night. This product definitely made me break out. I also didn&#x27;t feel that it covered very much of anything on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy this as an easy-apply sunscreen/moisturizer or something, it will be nice. However, do not expect major coverage without using so much that it makes you greasy or break out.</li>
            <li> I tried some American BB creams, but they didn&#x27;t really work for me. This product matches my skin tone pretty well and provides decent coverage for me. It blends in well and I really like how my skin looks. I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so I&#x27;m not too sure about how well it improves your skin over time. So far it hasn&#x27;t really improved anything, so for now it&#x27;s 4/5. The price of the cream is decent compared to other brands as well.</li>
            <li> My skin color is kinda dark and I thought this would be a good BB cream because I wanted one from Korea and it said it could change to my skin color. I tried putting it on different ways because I saw comments saying it also depends on the way you put on the BB cream but it didn&#x27;t do anything it stayed the same color and made me look ashy. I mixed it with a darker colored foundation and it fit my color a little better but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is amazing. It&#x27;s the first one I have tried and I LOVE it. I will no longer be searching for foundations.  I will be sticking with this.  I am a person that never writes reviews on things but this time I just had to. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It truly looks like skin when you put it on. There is no makeup mask. It blends so well. Do not rub it in PAT it.  The finish is amazing. I just love it. The seller is awesome.  I got it super fast and it&#x27;s is the real thing. Its not a fake. If your thinking of ordering it.  Stop thinking. Just order it.  You will not be disappointed. I&#x27;m about to order another one!  Love it, awesome seller.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what it was supposed to be and I&#x27;m really enjoying the product. I use it nearly every day&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> i bought it from KATIE THE BABE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve compared/checked it with all those blogs that talk about fake skin79 bb cream and so far everything checks out&lt;br /&gt;note: i haven&#x27;t used it yet, this is a 3-minutes-out-of-the-box review just for people who plan to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;so far, KATIE THE BABE seller is legit (to the extent of my knowledge) and you also get a pretty large amount of sample creams! (super awesome, there&#x27;s at least 5-6 samples in this little ziploc bag that comes with the hot pink bb cream!!!)&lt;br /&gt;so go ahead and buy it, seems legit so far, i&#x27;ll come back to update in a month or so about the item itself. happy buyings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: admittedly, this is only the very first time i&#x27;ve used it, but after a few hours of it on, it feels like there&#x27;s barely anything on my face! the cream is less watery than other bb creams (compared to missha&#x27;s perfect cover blahblah bb cream), it&#x27;s definitely a light-feeling, seems to cover a bit less than Missha (my skin still has some imperfections that the MISSHA bb cream would&#x27;ve covered up) So far, this is definitely a weaker-effect cream BUT it also doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re caking it on your face. That being said, the thickness/cakeyness of the bb cream ultimately depends on how much you use (i&#x27;d say about 1-2 grains of rice is enough/more than enough. seems o-k for daily use, we&#x27;ll see how much it does in.. a month or so</li>
