            <li>It goes on very nicely and you can use it as both a lip liner and a lip color (there&#x27;s even a sharpener on the bottom end of the product).</li>

            <li>I FOUND IT LOVING</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s a nice color.</li>
            <li>You do need to wear a lip liner as I noticed it would feather out a bit,otherwise it&#x27;s a really nice stick.</li>
            <li>The color is really nice.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a nice color.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>Love it even more!</li>
            <li>Then fills in quickly, very smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>Love love love!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will probably purchase more colors.</li>
            <li>This red is perfect, so I then ordered two more pencils.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lip colour.</li>
            <li>I have problems getting the perfect red lipstick.</li>
            <li>but definitely glad i bought this..</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the way this lipstick goes on.</li>
            <li>Best red out there</li>
            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love elf products</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re better off with another brand for lipticks.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get more</li>
            <li>I put a red lipgloss over it though, and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I love this matte lip color.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is the best matte red lipstick I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I like this one, though it&#x27;s more of a berry color on my lips.</li>
            <li>how many times I have to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;Cute</li>
            <li>I love that its like a pencil, makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I love all of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also impressed by how long this lasts, and yes, it doesn&#x27;t over-dry or chap the lips!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, with no liner needed as this is it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, creamy when put on and didn&#x27;t irritate my lips.  </li>
            <li>Crayon style makes applying easy.</li>
            <li>It is a great red color.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like the glossy/shiny kind.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lasts for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I still feel comfortable using this lip color.</li>
            <li>You can enjoy dinner and still look glamorous.</li>
            <li>I own this in 3 colors: Rich Red, Tea Rose and Coral.</li>
            <li>this is a very pretty color and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll most likely but more mattee lip colors from e.l.f :3</li>
            <li>so i was really excited when i picked this up at target.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>It was love at first smile.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to stay on through a full meal and still look good by the end of date night.</li>
            <li>It lasts long and looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Its like love at first smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for this.</li>
            <li>My lips are thinner and more &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; so anything wears off me sooner, but this does really well for me and leaves an even stain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very brilliant in color and goes on quite thick-</li>
            <li>It has some matte to it, but not what you would expect in a true Matte lipstick.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve found other great matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li>its so smooth and silky and definitely my favorite, by far.  </li>
            <li>its a perfect red and last all day.</li>
            <li>This is nice and I like the color, but it&#x27;s much brighter than I thought...not a blood red but more electric.</li>
            <li>Well first of all the entire stick of lipstick fell out and second of all this is wonderful if you want a yucky clown orange colour on your lips</li>
            <li>First off, it is not a matte texture, it&#x27;s pretty shiny and smears easily.</li>
            <li>Nice rich color that lasts fairly long.</li>
            <li>It is well pigmented color, and will be a nice red even if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>I love Rich Red matte lip color!!!</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li>tried this matte lipstick when I first started getting into makeup</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I actually wear it more than some of my $20 listicks from Makeup Forever...</li>
            <li>first day I wore this a guy in my office came up to me and said.</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>Rich Red gives you the most amazing red lip - with a blue undertone, which makes your teeth look whiter.</li>
            <li>With my fair skin, dark hair and dark eyes-- the Rich Red color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Other than that nice color</li>
            <li>When you find a color that you like, you want to make sure you have backup just in case you loose one or on those rare occasions a person wants to take it home with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is because it&#x27;s still sort of pretty, but I won&#x27;t be using it much.</li>
            <li>It lasts very long and you can wear it matte or top it with gloss.</li>
            <li>The trick is to let it air dry for about 10 minutes- avoid touching, rubbing the lips or drinking anything, and it almost stains them unless you scrub it off.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very pleased to see that even though this is not a lipstain and it will transfer if you eat or drink, it still clings to your lips enough that your red lip look stays largely intact even through dinner.</li>
            <li>Its a bit lighter than expected (the red), however its very smooth and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>my new favorite red lipstick.</li>
            <li>The color was lighter than expected as well, it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;rich red&amp;#34;, but more of a magenta color.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t use lipsticks or anything</li>
            <li>it really makes my face pop</li>
            <li>So what I do with it now is gently dab it on my moistened lips and then blend really well.</li>
            <li>but without it being so intense.</li>
            <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t feather too much either if I don&#x27;t have a lip liner</li>
            <li>i have pale skin and it looks nice on my compleion.</li>
            <li>The name rich red is quite descriptive.  </li>
            <li>Color may work for some, but don&#x27;t expect a rich red as the name implies.</li>
            <li>A true red, not coral or deepened bluish.</li>
            <li>infact going to order a new one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say but it seems to have decent staying power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to learn now that I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li>All the high ratings this lipstick got made me think this would be a steal, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth it feels and how it looks, though in the picture it looks like a dark red, it&#x27;s actually a little brighter, other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>The stick is orangey, bright red that turns hot pink against cool tones, not the blue based, deep red shown on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a lipstick wearer, normally, but I wear this one almost every day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been wearing rich red more lately</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit more bold and dramatic.</li>
            <li>I used the pencil Rich Red as a lip pencil and then applied my red matte lipstick for a richer color.  </li>
            <li>I usually just add a bit of NYX butter gloss over the top</li>
            <li>It lasts all day if you don&#x27;t mess with your lips, but its so cheap that I don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li>The Rich Red color is more like a dark pink with some red in it.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to see how a red would look on me.</li>
            <li>It goes on rather pink; it lasts a long time and goes on smooth, but I was really hoping for a true, dark red.</li>
            <li>A pretty red, but very red</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t call this a matte red which is the main reason i bought</li>
            <li>When I asked him if it was better than the one I usually wear he said it definitely was!</li>
            <li>IT BEEN LOOKING FOR MATTE RED FOR A LONG TIME FOR THE RIGHT PRICE</li>
            <li>but I expected a little more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a red lip color woman, and this matte pencil is long wearing and the color is pretty.  </li>
            <li>True Hollywood red lipstick is hard to find and this comes very close.</li>
            <li>in general.</li>
            <li>so much for long lasting....</li>
            <li>It was just the dramatic color I was looking for :)</li>
            <li>The pigment does not dry out your lips, like a lot of matte lipsticks do, and does not leave lines on your lips either.</li>
            <li>I love this as there&#x27;s nothing worse than having a dalmatian looking red lip.</li>
            <li>I have a medium skin tone (I&#x27;m white but not pale at all) and this color was a little intense for my taste.</li>
            <li>I purchased this looking for something that would go nice with my milky pale skin and dark black hair</li>
            <li>Above all it does NOT dry your lips.</li>

            <li> The trick is to let it air dry for about 10 minutes- avoid touching, rubbing the lips or drinking anything, and it almost stains them unless you scrub it off.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been very pleased to see that even though this is not a lipstain and it will transfer if you eat or drink, it still clings to your lips enough that your red lip look stays largely intact even through dinner.</li>
            <li> Its a bit lighter than expected (the red), however its very smooth and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> my new favorite red lipstick.</li>
            <li> The color was lighter than expected as well, it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;rich red&amp;#34;, but more of a magenta color.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t use lipsticks or anything</li>
            <li> it really makes my face pop</li>
            <li> So what I do with it now is gently dab it on my moistened lips and then blend really well.</li>
            <li> but without it being so intense.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t feather too much either if I don&#x27;t have a lip liner</li>
            <li> i have pale skin and it looks nice on my compleion.</li>
            <li> The name rich red is quite descriptive.  </li>
            <li> Color may work for some, but don&#x27;t expect a rich red as the name implies.</li>
            <li> A true red, not coral or deepened bluish.</li>
            <li> infact going to order a new one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say but it seems to have decent staying power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to learn now that I&#x27;m getting older.</li>
            <li> All the high ratings this lipstick got made me think this would be a steal, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it feels and how it looks, though in the picture it looks like a dark red, it&#x27;s actually a little brighter, other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> The stick is orangey, bright red that turns hot pink against cool tones, not the blue based, deep red shown on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a lipstick wearer, normally, but I wear this one almost every day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been wearing rich red more lately</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a bit more bold and dramatic.</li>
            <li> I used the pencil Rich Red as a lip pencil and then applied my red matte lipstick for a richer color.  </li>
            <li> I usually just add a bit of NYX butter gloss over the top</li>
            <li> It lasts all day if you don&#x27;t mess with your lips, but its so cheap that I don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li> The Rich Red color is more like a dark pink with some red in it.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to see how a red would look on me.</li>
            <li> It goes on rather pink; it lasts a long time and goes on smooth, but I was really hoping for a true, dark red.</li>
            <li> A pretty red, but very red</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t call this a matte red which is the main reason i bought</li>
            <li> When I asked him if it was better than the one I usually wear he said it definitely was!</li>
            <li> IT BEEN LOOKING FOR MATTE RED FOR A LONG TIME FOR THE RIGHT PRICE</li>
            <li> but I expected a little more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a red lip color woman, and this matte pencil is long wearing and the color is pretty.  </li>
            <li> True Hollywood red lipstick is hard to find and this comes very close.</li>
            <li> in general.</li>
            <li> so much for long lasting....</li>
            <li> It was just the dramatic color I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> The pigment does not dry out your lips, like a lot of matte lipsticks do, and does not leave lines on your lips either.</li>
            <li> I love this as there&#x27;s nothing worse than having a dalmatian looking red lip.</li>
            <li> I have a medium skin tone (I&#x27;m white but not pale at all) and this color was a little intense for my taste.</li>
            <li> I purchased this looking for something that would go nice with my milky pale skin and dark black hair</li>
            <li> Above all it does NOT dry your lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long lasting lipstick and no smudges.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last terribly long</li>
            <li> You can put a lot on for complete opaque coverage or you can put a little bit on for just a touch of color.</li>
            <li> I expected a wonder woman-ey color, but this is a pinky red, and not what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry too a powder look, but it&#x27;s not glossy either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person.</li>
            <li> After wanting to start wearing some red color on my lips instead of my usual pink I decided to go with this inexpensive brand to try it out.</li>
            <li> Their other colors do not go on</li>
            <li> Can leave lips a little dry.</li>
            <li> I usually love E.L.F. products so this was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27; hardly and product in this, and</li>
            <li> Hard to describe the color,</li>
            <li> Im a  Matte fanatic, and I do Pinup Modeling.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product, and I tried it on almost immediately, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit lighter than I expected, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear orange based reds so this one must have blue base notes.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and melted.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I own this lipstick. It is not for the timid. It is a great red color. I can&#x27;t wear orange based reds so this one must have blue base notes. True Hollywood red lipstick is hard to find and this comes very close.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for my purchased products, but I felt like I needed to say something about this one. All the high ratings this lipstick got made me think this would be a steal, but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all. I was really excited to receive this product, and I tried it on almost immediately, but I was very disappointed. First off, it is not a matte texture, it&#x27;s pretty shiny and smears easily. The color was lighter than expected as well, it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;rich red&amp;#34;, but more of a magenta color. The reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is because it&#x27;s still sort of pretty, but I won&#x27;t be using it much. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for this.</li>
            <li> A true red, not coral or deepened bluish. My grandaughter wears this so I got it. It&#x27;s easy to apply, with no liner needed as this is it. Then fills in quickly, very smooth and moist. I can use a gloss or chap stick over it but don&#x27;t need to. It lasts pretty well. My lips are thinner and more &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; so anything wears off me sooner, but this does really well for me and leaves an even stain. Not an outer rim. I have smeared it with my finger, but still, this is not a sheer gloss. It is well pigmented color, and will be a nice red even if you use it sparingly. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this matte lipstick when I first started getting into makeup and I absolutely loved it. It&#x27;s what got me into e.l.f. in general. I can&#x27;t go out without wearing my matte lipstick! ;)</li>
            <li> this is a very pretty color and glides on easily. It doesn&#x27;t stay on all day so take it with you but you can make it last longer by priming and blotting. I will probably purchase more colors. Great seller, packed well and on time.</li>
            <li> Redder than this photo looks.  The name rich red is quite descriptive.  A pretty red, but very red</li>
            <li> I received my order on 10/15 and was very pleased with the results.  I used the pencil Rich Red as a lip pencil and then applied my red matte lipstick for a richer color.  This red is perfect, so I then ordered two more pencils.  When you find a color that you like, you want to make sure you have backup just in case you loose one or on those rare occasions a person wants to take it home with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Afr Amer and all colors do not come out the color you see either in a magazine or on the counter display.  This is &amp;#34;what you see is what you get&amp;#34;.  I hope I see this shade in Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and melted. Other than that nice color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a red lip color woman, and this matte pencil is long wearing and the color is pretty.  I plan to purchase an additional red pencil and another color.</li>
            <li> Totally orange! Not matte at all. Smudges everywhere. TERRIBLE product. I would give it 1 star but I guess it didn&#x27;t kill me. I usually love E.L.F. products so this was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip colour. It&#x27;s a bit lighter than I expected, but not in a bad way. The pigment does not dry out your lips, like a lot of matte lipsticks do, and does not leave lines on your lips either. I even got my friends to buy some, after trying mine and loving it. I do wish that they would make this product in more colours, though!</li>
            <li> I have problems getting the perfect red lipstick. This is nice and I like the color, but it&#x27;s much brighter than I thought...not a blood red but more electric.</li>
            <li> This is a very beautiful lipstick and you don&#x27;t need a lip liner it does it for you. It&#x27;s a long lasting lipstick and no smudges. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of matte lipsticks and I don&#x27;t really like the glossy/shiny kind.  This lipstick is perfect and the color is beautiful!  It goes on smooth and lasts for quite a while.  You can put a lot on for complete opaque coverage or you can put a little bit on for just a touch of color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just perfection. i really don&#x27;t use lipsticks or anything but definitely glad i bought this.. it really makes my face pop lol</li>
            <li> Its a bit lighter than expected (the red), however its very smooth and easy to put on. I love it and I&#x27;ll most likely but more mattee lip colors from e.l.f :3</li>
            <li> The Rich Red color is more like a dark pink with some red in it.  Hard to describe the color, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t call it red.  Color may work for some, but don&#x27;t expect a rich red as the name implies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a lipstick wearer, normally, but I wear this one almost every day.  It&#x27;s very brilliant in color and goes on quite thick- only this red color, too.  Their other colors do not go on so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also impressed by how long this lasts, and yes, it doesn&#x27;t over-dry or chap the lips!  The trick is to let it air dry for about 10 minutes- avoid touching, rubbing the lips or drinking anything, and it almost stains them unless you scrub it off. I go about 8 hours without needing to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a fair amount of compliments on this- so if you want to grab attention, this seems to do it.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever. With my fair skin, dark hair and dark eyes-- the Rich Red color is gorgeous. It was just the dramatic color I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> I love the way this lipstick goes on. its so smooth and silky and definitely my favorite, by far.  Best red out there</li>
            <li> I purchased this looking for something that would go nice with my milky pale skin and dark black hair and I love the color. I put a lip primer on from makeup forever and that keeps it from smudging or bleeding out onto my skin but over all I love it! It lasts long and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it feels and how it looks, though in the picture it looks like a dark red, it&#x27;s actually a little brighter, other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> After wanting to start wearing some red color on my lips instead of my usual pink I decided to go with this inexpensive brand to try it out. I have a medium skin tone (I&#x27;m white but not pale at all) and this color was a little intense for my taste. So what I do with it now is gently dab it on my moistened lips and then blend really well. I still get the red color but without it being so intense. It doesn&#x27;t last terribly long but that&#x27;s probably because I only dab a bit instead of gliding it all over my lips.</li>
            <li> It goes on rather pink; it lasts a long time and goes on smooth, but I was really hoping for a true, dark red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but I expected a little more</li>
            <li> If you pull off the twisty end part there is a sharpener!!</li>
            <li> 1.  The stick is orangey, bright red that turns hot pink against cool tones, not the blue based, deep red shown on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Not matte.  Not by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Makes lips feel sticky and wipes off with no resistance or scrubbing, so much for long lasting....</li>
            <li> I love elf products so i was really excited when i picked this up at target.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27; hardly and product in this, and i wouldn&#x27;t call this a matte red which is the main reason i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re better off with another brand for lipticks. you&#x27;ll get more and i&#x27;ve found other great matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I expected a wonder woman-ey color, but this is a pinky red, and not what i wanted.  I put a red lipgloss over it though, and it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lipliner! It&#x27;s so easy to apply and provides great coverage. I usually just add a bit of NYX butter gloss over the top and I&#x27;m all set!</li>
            <li> I love this matte lip color. It is strong enough to stay on through a full meal and still look good by the end of date night. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it for longer than about 4 hours I&#x27;d say but it seems to have decent staying power. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t feather too much either if I don&#x27;t have a lip liner handy I still feel comfortable using this lip color.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Target once and really liked it. Im a  Matte fanatic, and I do Pinup Modeling. Its like love at first smile. Best $3 investment Ive ever made... I actually wear it more than some of my $20 listicks from Makeup Forever...just go ahead and press the &amp;#34;add to cart&amp;#34; button...</li>
            <li> Awesome Lipstick. infact going to order a new one!</li>
            <li> I FOUND IT LOVING IT BEEN LOOKING FOR MATTE RED FOR A LONG TIME FOR THE RIGHT PRICE</li>
            <li> I love it. I bought it again.</li>
            <li> I wear this lipsrick every day. This is the best matte red lipstick I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I love Rich Red matte lip color!!!</li>
            <li> my new favorite red lipstick. its a perfect red and last all day. i have pale skin and it looks nice on my compleion.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s a nice color. Easy to apply, creamy when put on and didn&#x27;t irritate my lips.  It has some matte to it, but not what you would expect in a true Matte lipstick. It doesn&#x27;t dry too a powder look, but it&#x27;s not glossy either. You do need to wear a lip liner as I noticed it would feather out a bit,otherwise it&#x27;s a really nice stick. The color is really nice. Out of the 12-15 red lipsticks I have in the drawer, this stick has become my Fav.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person. In fact I wear makeup like once every year or so. I&#x27;m trying to learn now that I&#x27;m getting older. I really wanted to see how a red would look on me. I like this one, though it&#x27;s more of a berry color on my lips. I was hoping for a bit more bold and dramatic. But it&#x27;s still a nice color.</li>
            <li> I used to use MAC&#x27;s Ruby Woo and one day I found this on the elf site and gave it a try (for $3 why not). It was love at first smile.&lt;br /&gt;It glides on perfectly and the fact that its a pencil means I don&#x27;t need a lip liner. It lasts all day if you don&#x27;t mess with your lips, but its so cheap that I don&#x27;t care how many times I have to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;Cute Story&lt;br /&gt;The first day I wore this a guy in my office came up to me and said. \\&quot;You need to go buy this lipstick in bulk, it looks great. I don&#x27;t want to hear you say its finished or you can&#x27;t find it to buy. \\&quot; When I asked him if it was better than the one I usually wear he said it definitely was!</li>
            <li> Very good product! I love that its like a pencil, makes it easier to apply. Nice rich color that lasts fairly long. Above all it does NOT dry your lips.</li>
            <li> Not matte.... Pretty color but it&#x27;s glossy</li>
            <li> Nice color. Crayon style makes applying easy. Can leave lips a little dry. Overall I like the color and look!</li>
            <li> Well first of all the entire stick of lipstick fell out and second of all this is wonderful if you want a yucky clown orange colour on your lips</li>
            <li> Forgot to remove before bed. Didn&#x27;t go on my pillow, but was still on my lips in the morning. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> The pic doesn&#x27;t do this justice. Very nice color :)</li>
            <li> I own this in 3 colors: Rich Red, Tea Rose and Coral. I love all of them. For being a matte lipcolor, this is actually moisturizing. It goes on very nicely and you can use it as both a lip liner and a lip color (there&#x27;s even a sharpener on the bottom end of the product). It lasts very long and you can wear it matte or top it with gloss. The colors I have are just gorgeous. Rich Red gives you the most amazing red lip - with a blue undertone, which makes your teeth look whiter. Excellent product for $3 on the ELF website!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been wearing rich red more lately and I&#x27;ve been very pleased to see that even though this is not a lipstain and it will transfer if you eat or drink, it still clings to your lips enough that your red lip look stays largely intact even through dinner. I love this as there&#x27;s nothing worse than having a dalmatian looking red lip. You are safe with this, though! You can enjoy dinner and still look glamorous. Love it even more!</li>
