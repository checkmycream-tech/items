    <ol>
            <li>I must be delicious to bugs.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>This product is a great coverup for veins on my lower legs.  </li>
            <li>The shade was good, too.  </li>
            <li>It is good.  </li>
            <li>GOOD COVER CREAM....</li>
            <li>Good match for my very light skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Product should insist on Their own moisturer or suggest stongly on package to apply a moisturer proir to application of coverup.</li>
            <li>I need something that doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; when it&#x27;s supposed to be beige, fair, light, etc.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry, the company sells a \\&quot;setting\\&quot; powder that is very finely milled.  </li>
            <li>I could not recommend this product more strongly!</li>
            <li>I will be better able to rate this product after that.</li>
            <li>If you can put on calamine lotion and it matches your skin perfectly this may actually be your color.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and this color is perfect for me, especially if you follow the tips of the ace reviewer who suggested moisturizing first and then dabbing on as needed.  </li>
            <li>It did not spread on smoothly and coverage was just OK.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product that is waterproof, and it blends right in.</li>
            <li>This makes the legs smooth for the application.  </li>
            <li>Pat it on, then smooth it with your hand.  </li>
            <li>This LEG makeup does not go on smoothly and does not cover well.  </li>
            <li>Way too light.</li>
            <li>I consider myself &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; but this color tone was too light for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first tube of CM Leg Magic from Amazon.com about six months ago.  </li>
            <li>Right to Bare Legs&amp;#34; in a fair shade.  </li>
            <li>Shower and soap as you normally would, but lightly hand smooth over the covered spots.  </li>
            <li>So glad to see it&#x27;s still available, as it&#x27;s not sold locally.  </li>
            <li>FOUND THE RIGHT COLOR FOR MY SKINTONE.</li>
            <li>I also might add that my skin is very sensitive; causing it to \\&quot;break out\\&quot; in a rash easily.  </li>
            <li>Do your shaving first, then moisturize.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this cover is that you can make it last a few days if you don&#x27;t scrub it off (or shave it off!)</li>
            <li>but if you think you are one shade go a level higher or buy in a store.</li>
            <li>It actually went on very smoothly and covered very well.  </li>
            <li>If you apply it with a round makeup sponge, the application is easier and more accurate.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problem with Leg Magic.</li>
            <li>so you have to call them and wait on hold, until they are ready to help you.</li>
            <li>I used a light beige (I am blonde) color</li>
            <li>Much paler then anticipated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It covers really well</li>
            <li>and it was not the right shade, kind of too white, and it looked like I had white sheer panty hose on.  </li>
            <li>My purpose was to cover the numerous varicose veins present on the top of my feet and lower legs.  </li>
            <li>I would never think that \\&quot;light biege\\&quot; is pink, but that is just me</li>
            <li>This product, while it appears to be more expensive that other products, covers nicely and matches skin tones exactly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the other colors, but you may want to call before you order because as costumer service says \\&quot;light biege IS pink\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have used Covermark for many years, finishing up the last tube of several I purchased (2001, and the texture is getting strange!).  </li>
            <li>You really have to blend it properly so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have makeup on your leg.  </li>
            <li>I would like to return it, wrong color, otherwise good.</li>
            <li>Thick, chalky, un-blend able.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m thrilled to find a pink tone because it blends better (for me) and doesn&#x27;t look like, \\&quot;wow, she&#x27;s got a bad shade of cover on those veins\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes, and now I am enjoying wearing open sandals without embarrassment.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount of this product was enough to camouflage the veins; most areas were not visible at all, and I applied it sparingly.  </li>
            <li>Once you find the right shade for you, here are a few tips from my trials and errors with leg cover.  </li>
            <li>I am very pale, it is rare that I meet someone paler than me</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in years but am going to  be using it for an upcoming wedding I am going to. I will be better able to rate this product after that.</li>
            <li> It covers well and makes me less conscious about the recent insect bite marks on my legs till they heal. I must be delicious to bugs. I get bit even when I spray repellent on myself  for them. So this is a big help.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first tube of CM Leg Magic from Amazon.com about six months ago.  My purpose was to cover the numerous varicose veins present on the top of my feet and lower legs.  Only a small amount of this product was enough to camouflage the veins; most areas were not visible at all, and I applied it sparingly.

I could not recommend this product more strongly!</li>
            <li> No need for surgery for a few of those spider veins.  This is an effective product that is waterproof, and it blends right in.</li>
            <li> If you can put on calamine lotion and it matches your skin perfectly this may actually be your color. I would never think that \\&quot;light biege\\&quot; is pink, but that is just me I guess. I don&#x27;t know about the other colors, but you may want to call before you order because as costumer service says \\&quot;light biege IS pink\\&quot;. They are impossible to get ahold of through email so you have to call them and wait on hold, until they are ready to help you. And then you have to pay for shipping AGAIN to send it back and EVENTUALLY they will replace it or refund it.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and this color is perfect for me, especially if you follow the tips of the ace reviewer who suggested moisturizing first and then dabbing on as needed.  It is one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;m quite hard to please and often disappointed when it comes to makeup products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry to hear the last reviewer was unhappy about the \\&quot;pink\\&quot; shade to this color.  I have used Covermark for many years, finishing up the last tube of several I purchased (2001, and the texture is getting strange!).  It takes a few tries to find the right shade in any product.  I need something that doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; when it&#x27;s supposed to be beige, fair, light, etc.  Nearly every cosmetic has a yellow cast, a problem, as I&#x27;m very pale. Personally, I&#x27;m thrilled to find a pink tone because it blends better (for me) and doesn&#x27;t look like, \\&quot;wow, she&#x27;s got a bad shade of cover on those veins\\&quot;.  Bad cover draws attention to the problem, rather than conceal.      I love this product, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Once you find the right shade for you, here are a few tips from my trials and errors with leg cover.  Do your shaving first, then moisturize.  This makes the legs smooth for the application.  As this product is waterproof (yaaay!), it tends to get stuck on your cuticles and in dry skin on your hands.  Not a problem if you wash it off immediately, but an annoyance.  If you apply it with a round makeup sponge, the application is easier and more accurate.      Press it on the worst areas and smooth out lightly on the edges.  Let it dry before putting on clothing.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry, the company sells a \\&quot;setting\\&quot; powder that is very finely milled.  Pat it on, then smooth it with your hand.  You can also use baby powder or perfumed talc, in lieu of their product.  The best thing about this cover is that you can make it last a few days if you don&#x27;t scrub it off (or shave it off!) those areas.  Shower and soap as you normally would, but lightly hand smooth over the covered spots.  You can touch up if some of it washes off.  When it&#x27;s time to shave, use a scrubby to get it all off so you don&#x27;t dull the blade, and start again.      Covermark is a miracle.  So glad to see it&#x27;s still available, as it&#x27;s not sold locally.  Bought several tubes last time, afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it again.  Bless Amazon; they always seem to have the hard-to-find things!</li>
            <li> Good match for my very light skin tone.  Only thing is, even with setting powder, it comes off on my clothes.  Not sure how to remedy that so far.  Dermablend does not come off. It covers well, but if it comes off, that&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> This LEG makeup does not go on smoothly and does not cover well.  I used a light beige (I am blonde) color and it was not the right shade, kind of too white, and it looked like I had white sheer panty hose on.  I had previously used the JOAN RIVERS BEAUTY leg makeup called &amp;#34;The Right to Bare Legs&amp;#34; in a fair shade.  It actually went on very smoothly and covered very well.  The shade was good, too.  The only reason I looked for something different was I wanted waterproof leg makeup.</li>
            <li> It is good.  Bought it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Much paler then anticipated.  I am very pale, it is rare that I meet someone paler than me and I had to put some bronzer over this so that it would blend in.&lt;br /&gt;It covers really well and once you work it in it stays put but if you think you are one shade go a level higher or buy in a store.</li>
            <li> I would like to return it, wrong color, otherwise good.</li>
            <li> Way too light. Lighter than shown. I would go a shade darker than what is shown in pics.</li>
            <li> This product is a great coverup for veins on my lower legs.  I only wish I had ordered a darker color.  Next time!</li>
            <li> White/pink pancake make-up.  Thick, chalky, un-blend able.  Calamine lotion is of thinner consistency.  This was a waste of money.  Not even remotely a skin tone color.</li>
            <li> This product, while it appears to be more expensive that other products, covers nicely and matches skin tones exactly.  The only issue seems to be air in the tube where there should be product.  However, I guess it is despensed by weight not volume.</li>
            <li> GOOD COVER CREAM....FOUND THE RIGHT COLOR FOR MY SKINTONE. iT IS A LASTING MAKEUP AND IT IS WATERPROOF. iT DOES RUB OFF ON CLOTHING.</li>
            <li> It did not spread on smoothly and coverage was just OK. I consider myself &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; but this color tone was too light for me.</li>
            <li> Must use a moisturer under coverup.Product very dry.Product should insist on Their own moisturer or suggest stongly on package to apply a moisturer proir to application of coverup.</li>
            <li> You really have to blend it properly so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have makeup on your leg.  It does stay on well and doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes.  The spot I have on my leg is dark so I did purchase a lighter color.  I do have to apply a few coats to get it to cover the spot completely, letting each coat dry completely before applying the next.</li>
