            <li>Love it, and it looks pretty on my baby girl.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not that familiar with newborn-sized heads.</li>
            <li>Love it other wise.</li>
            <li>Good Quality product, rated 4 because the size is very big.</li>
            <li>Cool just what it said baby loves it .</li>
            <li>My order came quickly, considering it was arriving from mainland China.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a sweet addition to a gift for a precious new baby girl...</li>
            <li>Brought this a while back, very cute</li>
            <li>very cute, but my daughter is 3 1/2 months and the hat is too big.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to receive (actually shipped directly from China), but is a very cute knit hat at a very good price.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors!</li>
            <li>adorable and soft!</li>
            <li>Product is good, but delivery tool longer than expected.</li>
            <li>Adorable for my 5 month old</li>
            <li>Luckily I have a six year old daughter that it will fit.</li>
            <li>Super cute, pretty big though, probably for 6-12 months not newborns.</li>
            <li>Size seems much different than described but overall I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>The loose weave of the knitting is nice so she can wear it into springtime to cover her babies hair.</li>
            <li>This is just a gorgeous little hat.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will have to wait a yr or more until she can finally wear it.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Nice hat, but took an awfully long time to get here!!!!</li>
            <li>Not as cute as in pic and took too long to get here.</li>
            <li>Looks a little big but beautiful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at the price, considering the time it must have taken for a gifted crafts person to make it.&lt;br /&gt;You may not get this little hat in the blink of an eye, but believe me, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I received it in the mail finally and BOY was it HUGE.</li>
            <li>The issue with the hat is, if you don&#x27;t really look at the pictures you think the flower will be huge like the photo on the left.</li>
            <li>The hat came from China and looks cheap and generic.  </li>
            <li>The hat was stuck together with the glue, and I had to remove as much as I could before gifting it.</li>
            <li>The quality is very cheep.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very tall/long.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery..</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>though it arrived late but it looks good.</li>
            <li>Super cute little hat!</li>
            <li>Very soft and looks exactly like the pic.</li>
            <li>It is stretchy and will grow for quite awhile with the child and is expected to fit upwards into her toddler years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute for the price, but it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Seems a bit big,  but well made and useful.</li>
            <li>My new little granddaughter looks so cute in this.  </li>
            <li>The knitting is MUCH more loose on the actual product.</li>
            <li>I got this hat as a gift for my sister to use with her new baby girl.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I received it !</li>
            <li>It is very soft yarn, a pretty floral design, the colors are vivid and yet subdued enough to go with a large number of baby outfits.</li>
            <li>Cannot use for my 7 months old baby.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my soon to be 5 mo old baby at the time.</li>
            <li>However, e entrance though pictured on an infant, this hat will be going to my soon to be 4 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Not sure about fit yey since baby girl has not arrived.</li>
            <li>I am unsure of if this will fit my baby&#x27;s head--once her head is &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; enough, it may be too small in circumference...?</li>
            <li>the pink is intense fuchsia</li>
            <li>It arrived much sooner than expected</li>
            <li>It is a little large for my 6 month old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>A little big for a newborn, but just right for about 4-6 months.</li>
            <li>I was a little let down by this because that&#x27;s why I ordered this, because of the huge flower, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It does run large, so it will not fit a newborn.  </li>
            <li>not pale pink like in the picture.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my soon to be 5 mo old baby at the time.</li>
            <li> However, e entrance though pictured on an infant, this hat will be going to my soon to be 4 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Not sure about fit yey since baby girl has not arrived.</li>
            <li> I am unsure of if this will fit my baby&#x27;s head--once her head is &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; enough, it may be too small in circumference...?</li>
            <li> the pink is intense fuchsia</li>
            <li> It arrived much sooner than expected</li>
            <li> It is a little large for my 6 month old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> A little big for a newborn, but just right for about 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> I was a little let down by this because that&#x27;s why I ordered this, because of the huge flower, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It does run large, so it will not fit a newborn.  </li>
            <li> not pale pink like in the picture.</li>
            <li> this will definitely not fit my new born when I have her</li>
            <li> Disappointing, nonetheless, it was really cute</li>
            <li> Fits larger than expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the quality, very loose, very big and bulky.</li>
            <li> Long wait to get it but for the price...worth it.</li>
            <li> Way bigger then expected!</li>
            <li> Little big but gives her room to grow.</li>
            <li> Shipped quicker than I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thin or poorly made.</li>
            <li> Should hold up for long term wear and even passing down to another child.</li>
            <li> Had long black hair woven it.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these, one for a baby shower gift &amp; one for my grandaughter due in a few months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any reason to rate less than 5.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that there was dried glue clumps on the inside of the hat.</li>
            <li> not happy with this product at all....there was a long black hair I had a hard time pulling out of the crocheting...</li>
            <li> It was so small .</li>
            <li> By the time it arrived, it was too small</li>
            <li> Just not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I feel very disappointed !</li>
            <li> Quality is terrible......</li>

            <li> This hat is very cute and looks exactly as pictured! I&#x27;m really pleased! It came from China and the delivery was faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The hat came from China and looks cheap and generic.  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received it ! It was so small . My 6 months baby could not wear it. I think it is just for newborn.</li>
            <li> So adorable on my niece!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute... But it&#x27;s not for a baby</li>
            <li> Nice hat, but took an awfully long time to get here!!!!</li>
            <li> though it arrived late but it looks good.</li>
            <li> This is an adorable knit cap.  Not infant size though.  Maybe 9-12 months</li>
            <li> I love this!! Shipped quicker than I expected and it&#x27;s even cuter than pictured! If your looking for a sweet addition to a gift for a precious new baby girl... This is it! Very soft.</li>
            <li> not happy with this product at all....there was a long black hair I had a hard time pulling out of the crocheting...I know we wash things before using, but it just grossed me out...it&#x27;s for my baby. I don&#x27;t like the quality, very loose, very big and bulky. The picture is a bit misleading. No problems with the seller, they send me a coupon with my purchase and everything. Just not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these precious hats.  They arrived exactly on schedule and were beautifully made.  Thank you for an excellent transaction!</li>
            <li> This is just a gorgeous little hat. It&#x27;s not thin or poorly made. I ordered 2 of these, one for a baby shower gift &amp; one for my grandaughter due in a few months.</li>
            <li> Not as cute as I thought they were ganna be but cute though</li>
            <li> I bought this for my soon to be 5 mo old baby at the time. It stated &amp;#34;fits 3-12 mos old&amp;#34;. I received it in the mail finally and BOY was it HUGE. I will have to wait a yr or more until she can finally wear it. Disappointing, nonetheless, it was really cute</li>
            <li> This hat is sooo cute. I can&#x27;t see any reason to rate less than 5.</li>
            <li> Love this hat. Darling!</li>
            <li> it is ok. the pink is intense fuchsia not pale pink like in the picture. it is acrylic and looks plasticy.</li>
            <li> Adorable for my 5 month old but I&#x27;m sure she will outgrowing in a month or two</li>
            <li> I feel very disappointed !</li>
            <li> The issue with the hat is, if you don&#x27;t really look at the pictures you think the flower will be huge like the photo on the left. IT IS NOT. I was a little let down by this because that&#x27;s why I ordered this, because of the huge flower, but you get what you pay for. But I just want everybody to know that the flower is not that big, AT ALL&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my friends baby but i ended up falling in love with it and using it for my daughter. A little bit but perfect for her. Shes 1.</li>
            <li> Love it the mother was excited for such wonderful colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a gift for a baby shower&lt;br /&gt;Looked good</li>
            <li> Somehow I now have 3 of these hats.  The hat is just great.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made and so absolutely adorable!  I&#x27;m amazed at the price, considering the time it must have taken for a gifted crafts person to make it.&lt;br /&gt;You may not get this little hat in the blink of an eye, but believe me, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Ok like it did on one</li>
            <li> Loved it the picture shows exactly how its going to be delivered</li>
            <li> Darling!  Looks way more expensive than what I paid.  Looks hand made.</li>
            <li> Adorable! The only complaint is that there was dried glue clumps on the inside of the hat. The hat was stuck together with the glue, and I had to remove as much as I could before gifting it.</li>
            <li> Quality is terrible......</li>
            <li> Adorable and well made.</li>
            <li> Hat is too big for a newborn . Also lot of hair strands were there inside hat when I received it . This might have been used one ..</li>
            <li> This hat is much larger in person than it appears in the picture. The quality is very cheep. It&#x27;s cute for the price, but it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Love it, and it looks pretty on my baby girl.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit big,  but well made and useful. Should hold up for long term wear and even passing down to another child.</li>
            <li> This is a darling beanie that I bought for my granddaughter.  It arrived much sooner than expected and it is really cute.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The knitting is MUCH more loose on the actual product. Also, it is very tall/long. I am unsure of if this will fit my baby&#x27;s head--once her head is &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; enough, it may be too small in circumference...?</li>
            <li> This cap is positively adorable. Soft and a good size for infants. Colors are as pictured. Would by again and give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Actually nicer in person than in pictures</li>
            <li> cap was great like I said the shipper was from China. I forgot to buy American.</li>
            <li> Cute as can be. Very well made.</li>
            <li> love it!!! Pretty colors!</li>
            <li> Great item. Sipping could have been faster.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Fast delivery.. Thanks..</li>
            <li> adorable and soft! great buy...</li>
            <li> Cheap Pricing.&lt;br /&gt;Looks As Shown&lt;br /&gt;After 1st Wash Ruined.&lt;br /&gt;Only Fit For 4months.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive (actually shipped directly from China), but is a very cute knit hat at a very good price. It actually is as cute as the picture. A little big for a newborn, but just right for about 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> It looks just like in the picture, I love it! It was a bit bigger then I imagined but I&#x27;m not that familiar with newborn-sized heads. Guess we will see if it is perfect size or two big when she arrives...either way she will grow into it! So I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Long wait to get it but for the price...worth it.</li>
            <li> Size seems much different than described but overall I&#x27;m happy.  Will work great in winter.</li>
            <li> Super cute little hat! It took awhile to arrive, but that&#x27;s ok. A great gift for a family member.</li>
            <li> I got this hat as a gift for my sister to use with her new baby girl. I don&#x27;t know how to knit, but love the look of this knitted baby hat. My order came quickly, considering it was arriving from mainland China. Upon opening the package to see it before mailing it off. I could see the amazing detail of this item. It is very soft yarn, a pretty floral design, the colors are vivid and yet subdued enough to go with a large number of baby outfits. It is stretchy and will grow for quite awhile with the child and is expected to fit upwards into her toddler years. The loose weave of the knitting is nice so she can wear it into springtime to cover her babies hair.</li>
            <li> Super cute looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> but I never received it.....I love  the picture</li>
            <li> Super cute, pretty big though, probably for 6-12 months not newborns.</li>
            <li> Cute homemade hat good quality.</li>
            <li> Definitely cute and well made but this will definitely not fit my new born when I have her but that&#x27;s ok bc I think she will be able to wear it this coming winter</li>
            <li> Hat is adorable and appears to be well made. However, e entrance though pictured on an infant, this hat will be going to my soon to be 4 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Not as cute as in pic and took too long to get here. Had long black hair woven it. Yuck!</li>
            <li> Cute hat but the flower fell off after two weeks</li>
            <li> This was a baby gift for a friend she said she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived by date promised, sooo precious! Great gift!</li>
            <li> Brought this a while back, very cute I like it but I&#x27;m still waiting far my grand dargther to grow into it, but it is beautiful and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> By the time it arrived, it was too small</li>
            <li> I love this Beanie it is beautiful. Very happy I got the hat was so excited to see it when it came in.</li>
            <li> The detail of the flower and the stitching is just what it looks like on the picture; it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Very soft and looks exactly like the pic. Not sure about fit yey since baby girl has not arrived.</li>
            <li> Bit big for an infant.</li>
