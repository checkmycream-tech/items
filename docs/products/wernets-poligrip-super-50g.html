            <li>not as good as just super polgrip</li>
            <li>Not as good as Super Poligrip.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be as good as Super Poligrip denture powder that was discontinued here in the USA because of Zinc as a ingredient in it.</li>
            <li>just wished I could find a good supply of Super Poligrip with Zinc...</li>
            <li>better than paste</li>
            <li>ANY MORE OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR DENTURE WEARERS.</li>

            <li>Glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but unfortunately most don&#x27;t work much better than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>but now i can&#x27;t find any more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better product than Polident.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wernets for more than 30 years and am glad I will be able to purchase more thru Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This holds better than any powder I have tried.  </li>
            <li>And I think I have tried most all of them.</li>
            <li>There is no product better than this .</li>
            <li>Not as much as I liked Super Poligrip</li>
            <li>Very good Very similar to Polident.</li>
            <li>not as good as the real polygrip..will not hold.</li>
            <li>extra hold that is good without any need for additions!</li>
            <li>The hold is snug and comfortable for a better fit.</li>
            <li>Poligrip Super Wernets is better</li>
            <li>Works good so far, still adjusting to it!</li>
            <li>This product works great for my wife, and it is the only product that works for her.</li>
            <li>Second time buying this product I am happy with it</li>
            <li>Great product,only have to use tiny amount for all day.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it, but thought is was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Everything went smoothly</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product available.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work near as good as the Poligrip Powder that has been off the shevles..</li>
            <li>But worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Not for Fun or FFUNY!</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>Fixodent works better than this and much cheaper and no $10 shipping.  </li>
            <li>Sure wish it was as good as the powder I used before trying to find a new one to take poligrip&#x27;s place, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work well enough to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this on Amazon for him to try.</li>
            <li>N W bought the name super poligrip but not its formula of ingredients, apparentally.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>SO SO glad to find out that this is the same thing and that I was able to get it here.</li>
            <li>but since it said that it was super wernets and made by GSK in Europe I took a shot.</li>
            <li>well I think product is ok, but only ok.&lt;br /&gt;need to have more suction and thickness, maybe&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does anyone know the truth about Super Poligrip Powder?</li>
            <li>its ok too high priced though</li>
            <li>Easy get too much</li>
            <li>I really like the product,it holds all day and has almost no ooze!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what my father-in-law requires!</li>
            <li>Seems to be the same as Poligrip Super Adhesive Powder at a much better price and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Good tight fit, no worries when using this product.</li>
            <li>He has tried so many products and said this product is by far just as comparable to some name brands on the market that were discontinued for some time.</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>Love it and it came  2 weeks early</li>
            <li>This works great and actually dare I say it, a little better than poligrip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wernets super is very gummy.</li>
            <li>Not quite as strong of hold as super poligrip but works well enough.</li>
            <li>Works better than my present brand!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Same manufacturer no need to pay more</li>
            <li>I really cannot believe Poligrip does not import it to the USA!</li>
            <li>wish I could get more and in a bigger size - have to go out of the country to get it as no longer made in US</li>
            <li>IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS MOST POLIGRIP PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>Price is a bit high but well worth it.</li>
            <li>When wernets was bought out by super poligrip co is when the extra strength powder became super improved for its longer holding hours.</li>
            <li>This is a new formula and it doesn&#x27;t hold worth a darn.</li>
            <li>Easy too use and holds with no ooze and ease of removing my dentist had put some on my dentures when I got them but was running low</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell there was not any Zinc in the super Wernets, but it also doesn&#x27;t hold like I need a powder to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good -it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last as long as theULTRA  Pâ€¢Grp.</li>
            <li>No gagging but really holds.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t work very well for me --</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>AND THE TEXTURE IS LIKE A PAPER MACHE PASTE, LIKE A WET GLUE.&lt;br /&gt;NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND OR BUY POLIGRIP ANYWHERE</li>
            <li>and then it becomes really gooey.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery arrived 2 week before teh given date.</li>
            <li>Thanks)</li>
            <li>As good, if not better, than any denture adhesive on the market, at any price!</li>
            <li>the product has become inferior as it is no longer a super poligrip but back to Wernets.</li>
            <li>Powder seems to spread evenly better and not as messy.  </li>
            <li>The powder is the only thing that doesnt rip apart my gums, is easy to remove but holds relatively well.</li>
            <li>I was using that they discontinued here where I live in Tn.</li>
            <li>Om New</li>
            <li>It seems as if this is a VERY OLD bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and still love it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many items from Europe, and for this size package, it should have been here in ten days or less.</li>
            <li>If you apply it as directed, it will last for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Product arived early, and was what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>I am an old hand at this.</li>
            <li>Not messy like the glues out there.</li>
            <li>the old Wernets bofore.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend Super Wernet&#x27;s as I have in the past.</li>
            <li>Super Wernets is just fair, I am sorry it was no better than it was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it seems to be the only game in town.</li>
            <li>It is not available in the states, and it is the only product out there that works for my Wife, and was exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li>Good product, too bad you can&#x27;t get it in the states anymore.</li>

            <li> AND THE TEXTURE IS LIKE A PAPER MACHE PASTE, LIKE A WET GLUE.&lt;br /&gt;NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND OR BUY POLIGRIP ANYWHERE</li>
            <li> and then it becomes really gooey.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery arrived 2 week before teh given date.</li>
            <li> Thanks)</li>
            <li> As good, if not better, than any denture adhesive on the market, at any price!</li>
            <li> the product has become inferior as it is no longer a super poligrip but back to Wernets.</li>
            <li> Powder seems to spread evenly better and not as messy.  </li>
            <li> The powder is the only thing that doesnt rip apart my gums, is easy to remove but holds relatively well.</li>
            <li> I was using that they discontinued here where I live in Tn.</li>
            <li> Om New</li>
            <li> It seems as if this is a VERY OLD bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and still love it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many items from Europe, and for this size package, it should have been here in ten days or less.</li>
            <li> If you apply it as directed, it will last for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Product arived early, and was what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I am an old hand at this.</li>
            <li> Not messy like the glues out there.</li>
            <li> the old Wernets bofore.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend Super Wernet&#x27;s as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Super Wernets is just fair, I am sorry it was no better than it was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it seems to be the only game in town.</li>
            <li> It is not available in the states, and it is the only product out there that works for my Wife, and was exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li> Good product, too bad you can&#x27;t get it in the states anymore.</li>
            <li> Sorry it is no longer available.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get the amount to use correct, but once that happens, my dentures stay in all day long.  </li>
            <li> Back to expensive super poligrip.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a replacement for Super Poligrip Powder which has become very hard to find, DON&amp;#34;T LOOK HERE!</li>
            <li> Within in a couple hours of application dentures were as loose as if I had not applied.</li>
            <li> would recommend to others I get dentures wet</li>
            <li> put on them wet them again</li>
            <li> product did not perform nearly as expected!</li>
            <li> That was novel using what they use on the other side of the pond.</li>
            <li> Holds longer than other powders.</li>
            <li> it holds without all the mess and ooze unlike some other brands.</li>
            <li> Sorry I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> It was no more or less than iI expected.</li>
            <li> It did take a few weeks to get here from the UK</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s something missing.</li>
            <li> At least we know where to get it when Poli Grip goes off the market....</li>
            <li> It turns into a gluey mess that squishes out from under my dentures and gags me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for a powder adhesive since poligrip got taken off the market due to a recall.</li>
            <li> Still not the same as Poly-Grip powder, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have used powders before and have never experienced this before.</li>
            <li> Bad glue not fit for a pig!</li>
            <li> Weird stringy, gooey after removing dentures and my mouth tastes yucky.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!!!</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to find and I don&#x27;t know the reason.</li>
            <li> Gosh, how can the English stand for this crap!!!</li>
            <li> There is NO &amp;#34;Poligrip&amp;#34; in this fake substance!  </li>
            <li> but it will have to do, as Poligrip is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it isn&#x27;t still carried in the USA.  </li>
            <li> have always hated using the glue adhesives because they are a pain to remove and can even tear my gums.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick and taste horrible</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!!!!  </li>
            <li> terrible stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is working just as great as the name brand according to my father. He has tried so many products and said this product is by far just as comparable to some name brands on the market that were discontinued for some time. Luckily I found this on Amazon for him to try. He keeps stockimg up since the quality and price are great!</li>
            <li> Did not hold.  Would not buy again or recommend.  Gooey and oozed out no matter what I did.  Have used powders before and have never experienced this before.</li>
            <li> Works better than my present brand!</li>
            <li> Took forever to get to my house because it&#x27;s coming from the UK. But worth the wait! I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for a powder adhesive since poligrip got taken off the market due to a recall. This works great and actually dare I say it, a little better than poligrip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always hated using the glue adhesives because they are a pain to remove and can even tear my gums. The powder is the only thing that doesnt rip apart my gums, is easy to remove but holds relatively well.</li>
            <li> Still not the same as Poly-Grip powder, disappointed. Weird stringy, gooey after removing dentures and my mouth tastes yucky.</li>
            <li> I really like the product,it holds all day and has almost no ooze!!</li>
            <li> the order was received in a timely manner and the product was excellent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick and taste horrible</li>
            <li> Tha best. No gagging but really holds.</li>
            <li> not as good as the real polygrip..will not hold.</li>
            <li> May have Poligrip in the name but this doesn&#x27;t compare to what the US version was.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the same as Poligrip Super Adhesive Powder at a much better price and free shipping.  It did take a few weeks to get here from the UK but well worth the wait if you like this type of denture adhesive.  I bought them for my Mom.</li>
            <li> Easy too use and holds with no ooze and ease of removing my dentist had put some on my dentures when I got them but was running low and I could find no one localy that carried it. So now I&#x27;m giving him your Info.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The best there is for holding power!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWFUL!!!!  If you are looking for a replacement for Super Poligrip Powder which has become very hard to find, DON&amp;#34;T LOOK HERE!</li>
            <li> This product works great for my wife, and it is the only product that works for her.</li>
            <li> Great service. good product. Thanks</li>
            <li> My Mother loves it..thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best dental powder I&#x27;ve ever used.  The regular Poligrip just doesn&#x27;t do it  HOWEVER, it took an  inordinate amount of time to get here from England.  I have ordered many items from Europe, and for this size package, it should have been here in ten days or less. This one was over a month!!</li>
            <li> Works as always. Sorry it is no longer available.</li>
            <li> better than paste but doesn&#x27;t work very well for me --</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found this product and especially for the excellent price . I was amazed at the speed of the delivery,since it came all the way from the UK.</li>
            <li> VERY UNSATISFIED,.....IT GIVES ME NO HOLD AT ALL AND THE TEXTURE IS LIKE A PAPER MACHE PASTE, LIKE A WET GLUE.&lt;br /&gt;NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND OR BUY POLIGRIP ANYWHERE, I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS.&lt;br /&gt;USING FIXODENT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION, ......IT MAKES ME ERRACTIC, IRRITABLE, I USED FIXODENT FOR 7 YEARS AND HAD MULTIPLE HEALTH ISSUES FROM LOSS OF KIDNEY FUNCTION, TO PARALYSIS IN MY LEGS, ....IT&#x27;S LIKE THERE AREN&#x27;T ANY MORE OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR DENTURE WEARERS.</li>
            <li> It arrive in pently of of time.</li>
            <li> Couldnt manage without it</li>
            <li> If you apply it as directed, it will last for a whole day. For me, it last from 5AM to 10PM without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best denture adhesive powder I tried so far.</li>
            <li> Not quite as strong of hold as super poligrip but works well enough.</li>
            <li> Best holding power of any on the market. Just can&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Very good Very similar to Polident.</li>
            <li> Product arived early, and was what we were looking for. It is not available in the states, and it is the only product out there that works for my Wife, and was exactly what it said it was. Could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It seems as if this is a VERY OLD bottle.  It does not hold my dentures in at all.  I must reapply 2-3 times a day.  Not happy at all!!!</li>
            <li> Works great; much better than the gooey paste.</li>
            <li> When wernets was bought out by super poligrip co is when the extra strength powder became super improved for its longer holding hours. Now that wernets was bought by N W  Health supplies  out of UK the product has become inferior as it is no longer a super poligrip but back to Wernets. Totally disappointed. N W bought the name super poligrip but not its formula of ingredients, apparentally.</li>
            <li> GOT FOR MOM, SHE LOVES IT</li>
            <li> Exactly what my father-in-law requires!</li>
            <li> i know i like it cause i&#x27;ve ordered this product before. i&#x27;ve tryed others and come back to Wernet&#x27;s Poligrip.</li>
            <li> product did not perform nearly as expected!</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to find this product.  Works wonderful!!  Took longer than anticipated to arrive.</li>
            <li> I have dentures for both upper and lower. The lower are a pain . So I use wernets on my lowers and it helps .</li>
            <li> Best denture adhesive ever,wish it was available over the counter here</li>
            <li> This is the best product for  my husband.....Super Glad that you carry it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works good so far, still adjusting to it!</li>
            <li> PRICEY BUT WORKS WELL...</li>
            <li> It works just like Poligrip I was using that they discontinued here where I live in Tn. Powder seems to spread evenly better and not as messy.  Dw</li>
            <li> Second time buying this product I am happy with it it last all day on my uppers would recommend to others I get dentures wet put on them wet them again put some more on seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> Same as powder Polygrip!! Same manufacturer no need to pay more</li>
            <li> I used Wernets for years then could not find in stores.  It is the best denture adhesive ever.  Found it recently through Amazon.  Worth it&#x27;s cost.  My dentist used it and recommeded it. So happy to find a source now.  Great product,only have to use tiny amount for all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only tooth powder I can find without zinc in it.  I would like to order more.  Betty</li>
            <li> This is a new formula and it doesn&#x27;t hold worth a darn.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended this brand. Went online and it appears this isn&#x27;t sold in the states anymore. Ordered it from Amazon and within 10 days got it in the mail with a stamp of Queen Elizabeth on the outside of the package. That was novel using what they use on the other side of the pond. As for the product It holds dentures. It&#x27;s as good as any I&#x27;ve used. probably will order again it nothing else for the novelty of getting something shipped from Europe.</li>
            <li> not as good as the ultra</li>
            <li> Best holding denture adhesive around. Lasts all day. Used this years ago &amp; local stores stopped carrying it. Glad to find it again.</li>
            <li> I meant to buy Wernets ULTRA. My mistake. Wernets super is very gummy. Didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. Within in a couple hours of application dentures were as loose as if I had not applied. I am an old hand at this. Have been wearing dentures for over fifty years. I have tried many products but unfortunately most don&#x27;t work much better than this. Back to expensive super poligrip. It works.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff.  Best on the market.</li>
            <li> not as good as just super polgrip</li>
            <li> It was no more or less than iI expected. I have used it for yers</li>
            <li> The best you can use. Price is a bit high but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good -it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last as long as theULTRA  Pâ€¢Grp.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s suppose to be the same stuff as its&#x27; American counter part, but it doesn&#x27;t hold that well. And it has a different taste to it so there&#x27;s something missing.</li>
            <li> . Not holding as good as I remember Wernets being.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing special but it seems to work for a while. Not as good as some of the others.</li>
            <li> Best Denture adhesive around . Holds all day! At least we know where to get it when Poli Grip goes off the market....</li>
            <li> Good tight fit, no worries when using this product. Not messy like the glues out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it seems to be the only game in town.</li>
            <li> Not as much as I liked Super Poligrip but it will have to do, as Poligrip is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  As good, if not better, than any denture adhesive on the market, at any price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Poligrip Super Wernets is better</li>
            <li> THIS DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS WELL AS THE EXTRA STRENGTH THAT I NEEDED.</li>
            <li> Big corporation bought out Wernets it seems.  I didn&#x27;t know what to do because I only used Wernet&#x27;s denture powder.  I was SO SO SO glad to find out that this is the same thing and that I was able to get it here.</li>
            <li> good product wish we could find it in a store, rather pricey compared to the old Wernets bofore.</li>
            <li> Good product, too bad you can&#x27;t get it in the states anymore.</li>
            <li> Easy get too much and then it becomes really gooey.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My dentist recommended it, but thought is was no longer available.  I really cannot believe Poligrip does not import it to the USA!</li>
            <li> Not as good as Super Poligrip. Doesn&#x27;t hold up all day as advertised.  Has a glue like taste.</li>
            <li> very pleased  could not find anywhere else</li>
            <li> it was good but now i can&#x27;t find any more</li>
            <li> A dentist recommended this stuff to me and I have been using it ever since.  This stuff really works.  It takes a while to get the amount to use correct, but once that happens, my dentures stay in all day long.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Good product. Holds longer than other powders.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and still love it. I like that it holds without all the mess and ooze unlike some other brands. The hold is snug and comfortable for a better fit. I would certainly recommend Super Wernet&#x27;s as I have in the past. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it and it came  2 weeks early</li>
            <li> I purchased this product weary that it was Poligrip because that never worked for me before but since it said that it was super wernets and made by GSK in Europe I took a shot. This is in my opinion the same product that was discontinued by GSK in the US, will buy again. Fast delivery arrived 2 week before teh given date.</li>
            <li> It works almost as good as the one&#x27;s I bought in the american drugnstores.</li>
            <li> its ok too high priced though</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used. It is also difficult to find and I don&#x27;t know the reason.</li>
            <li> well I think product is ok, but only ok.&lt;br /&gt;need to have more suction and thickness, maybe&lt;br /&gt; I had to use strips with product&lt;br /&gt;there is another product fixadent extra hold that is good without any need for additions!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work near as good as the Poligrip Powder that has been off the shevles..Thank God it is coming back this month!  Fixodent works better than this and much cheaper and no $10 shipping.  Sorry I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> This rating does not reflect upon NWhealthcare -  from the UK. Super Wernets is just fair, I am sorry it was no better than it was. I was hoping it would be as good as Super Poligrip denture powder that was discontinued here in the USA because of Zinc as a ingredient in it. As far as I can tell there was not any Zinc in the super Wernets, but it also doesn&#x27;t hold like I need a powder to do. Sure wish it was as good as the powder I used before trying to find a new one to take poligrip&#x27;s place, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work well enough to purchase it again. I have no problem with the seller or company NWhealthcare. They were great in shipping considering the distance. If this stuff worked, I was going to buy it by the case. :(&lt;br /&gt;I just wished I could find a good supply of Super Poligrip with Zinc...</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it isn&#x27;t still carried in the USA.  It&#x27;s a better product than Polident.</li>
            <li> This is the best product!</li>
            <li> wish I could get more and in a bigger size - have to go out of the country to get it as no longer made in US</li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly</li>
            <li> IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS MOST POLIGRIP PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Great product for people who wear partials. This used to be sold here in the U.S. but for some reason they stopped selling it. Glad I can still order it here even from Great Britain. Will definitely Oder it again.</li>
            <li> Om New To This Product I LIke It A Lot Thanx</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wernets for more than 30 years and am glad I will be able to purchase more thru Amazon.com. It was always an excellent product and I am no longer able to purchase it here in the US because GSK, per telephone conversation, is having a manufacturing  problem. Does anyone know the truth about Super Poligrip Powder?</li>
            <li> This holds better than any powder I have tried.  And I think I have tried most all of them.</li>
            <li> There is no product better than this .</li>
            <li> After years of trying substitutes, having Werner&#x27;s is like &amp;#34;coming home&amp;#34;.  Thank you for making this product available.  (You may publish my words, but please don&#x27;t publish my last name. Thanks)</li>
            <li> Bad glue not fit for a pig! Gosh, how can the English stand for this crap!!! Not for Fun or FFUNY!</li>
            <li> WARNING: This product is a BIG TIME RIP OFF!  What I received is hardly more than wheat flour in a plastic bottle! It does NOT form a bond with anything. It turns into a gluey mess that squishes out from under my dentures and gags me! The packaging mimics &amp;#34;Poligrip Ultra Wernets,&amp;#34; but it is NOT THE SAME PRODUCT!  There is NO &amp;#34;Poligrip&amp;#34; in this fake substance!  Beware!  This is a FRAUD!</li>
            <li> terrible stuff., not as expected.&lt;br /&gt;gooey mouth after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;lousey.&lt;br /&gt;take it off the market.&lt;br /&gt;we threw our out the window.&lt;br /&gt;ugh.</li>
