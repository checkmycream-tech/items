            <li>My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong, so go easy, it can gag you if you bathe in it.</li>
            <li>Tursiops is a great buy, especially if you get the combo.</li>
            <li>There is nothing even close to this light scent..</li>
            <li>It was almost light floral smelling to me</li>
            <li>It is sexy, light, fresh...just right.</li>
            <li>People notice the clean scent</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it has a very clean fresh sent and is different that what is available in the department stores.</li>
            <li>i bought a gift pack from the local show aquarium and have been looking for this forever-this is my favorite scent!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have a clean crisp scent I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Tiffany Sheer, Tommy Bahama, Ralph, Amazing Grace...</li>
            <li>So, it is actually a bonus that the fragrance is so nice.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of Tursiops at the beach...</li>

            <li>Years later I went on a cruise and found out they do not sell this on the cruise ships any more....</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it and it definitely is not over powering like your grandmother&#x27;s perfume!</li>
            <li>The bottle is also pretty.</li>
            <li>This perfume is hard to find in stores, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping this around...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t started using it yet as ai still have a bit left in my original bottle, which I bought in FL.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and the scent lasts a long time on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I receive many compliments when I wear it--even when I go overboard and apply too much!</li>
            <li>It goes on a little loud, but dries down to a soft, clean, long-lasting fragrance that is very appropriate for daytime casual and dressy.  </li>

            <li> I freely admit that I bought Tursiops Eau De Parfum just because I loved the way the bottle looked.  It just seemed that it would look terrific on the bathroom vanity, which overlooks the water, which is where the dolphins play almost daily.  Yes, the bottle is a knock-out decorating item.  So, it is actually a bonus that the fragrance is so nice.  It goes on a little loud, but dries down to a soft, clean, long-lasting fragrance that is very appropriate for daytime casual and dressy.  The lotion is a nice surprise as well.  It is non-greasy, but has plenty of moisture for my dry skin.  And, it&#x27;s great for layering with the Eau De Parfum.      Tursiops is a great buy, especially if you get the combo.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that actually stays on you after you put it on. All the perfumes I have never had a perfume that the stay smells.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of Tursiops at the beach...many years ago...have used it ever since. I was happy to find in on Amazon! It is sexy, light, fresh...just right. My husband likes it, better than any I&#x27;ve worn before, such as Ralph. I like something that reminds me of the beach, &amp; this does...not only the bottle, but the fragrance!</li>
            <li> My wife loves dolphins and this perfume was a good fit for her.  It&#x27;s very strong, so go easy, it can gag you if you bathe in it.</li>
            <li> ...great gift for dolphin lovers.  The bottle is beautiful.  It smells fantastic and the scent lasts a long time on my skin.  I get compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear. People notice the clean scent and I receive many compliments when I wear it--even when I go overboard and apply too much!

            <li> LOVE IT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PERFUME, EVERY WHERE I GO PEOPLE WOULD SAY..... YOU SMELL SO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST LOVE IT. SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO THE DALPHINS PROTECT YOU.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ,PLEASE, NEVER STOP MAKING IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CYNTHIA, FROM LAKE HAVASU CITY, AZ.</li>
            <li> i bought a gift pack from the local show aquarium and have been looking for this forever-this is my favorite scent!  light, oceany, just delightful.</li>
            <li> Have been enjoying Tursiopes for years and always, always get asked what parfume I am wearing.  There is nothing even close to this light scent..</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! I bought a roll on of this fragrance years ago at Sea World and I am so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> When I went on my first cruise to the Caribbean they were selling this on the ship.  I smelled this and thought of the oceans water and knew no one else would have this at home.  I bought 2 bottles and received compliments every day. Years later I went on a cruise and found out they do not sell this on the cruise ships any more....so when I got home I went on line and found were I could order some.  Thanks for keeping this around...love this stuff</li>
            <li> Hard to find anywhere. So glad you still have it. Love it!</li>
            <li> This my favorite because I can&#x27;t smell it when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have been looking for this for a long time and am so happy to find it.</li>
            <li> I found this cologne about 5 years ago in a SeaWorld gift shop. I have been wearing it since, on and off. I&#x27;ve probably purchased about 6 bottles since. I&#x27;ve used Tiffany Sheer, Tommy Bahama, Ralph, Amazing Grace... all much more expensive, but I keep coming back to Tursiops. It smells like you just got out of the shower. I get so many compliments on it and it definitely is not over powering like your grandmother&#x27;s perfume! The only problem I have with this product is that you can&#x27;t buy it in stores. I&#x27;ve only found it on the Internet and now, only recently on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This perfume is hard to find in stores, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  The order came in a very timely manner and it was well packed, since the bottle with the dolphin is rather delicate.  Completely safe arrival.  I haven&#x27;t started using it yet as ai still have a bit left in my original bottle, which I bought in FL.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, that&#x27;s why I wanted it so bad! Was disappointed upon smelling it. It didn&#x27;t have a clean crisp scent I was expecting. It was almost light floral smelling to me and I hate floral scents!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance. Went back and bought the room freshener, body lotion and all. Did you know Tursiops means &amp;#34;Dolphin&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it has a very clean fresh sent and is different that what is available in the department stores. The bottle is also pretty.</li>
