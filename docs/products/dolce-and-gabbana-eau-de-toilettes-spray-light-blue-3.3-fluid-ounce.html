            <li>My favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how quick I received the order however the product itself is either a knock off</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of light blue this is the best deal around!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since the first time i smelled it and once my GF smelled it, it&#x27;s been her favorite as well, She gets compliments almost on a daily basis of how she smells good!</li>
            <li>This is a very light, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this is not as strong as if I would of bought it in the department stores.</li>
            <li>It doesnt even have the strong smell that it should have.</li>
            <li>The sample of this product that I received from another source was lovely and inspired me to purchase a full size version.</li>
            <li>and no, I am not one of those ladies who drenches herself with perfume so she can enjoy the scent all day as well</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was a such a great price.</li>
            <li>Always fabulous.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent (I&#x27;m wearing it right now).</li>
            <li>I love an eau de toilette that has a clean smell, like freshly soaped skin, and</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure I cannot.</li>
            <li>This perfume does not smell like the original and</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Very clean, crisp aroma.</li>
            <li>and I am wearing this one I purchased right now and its awesome..best fragrance ever!  </li>
            <li>this a tried  and true fragrance for me.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite scent on the market.</li>
            <li>Sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Light blue is a amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>like i did you take advantage and click on amazons super shipper savings.</li>
            <li>The smell I feel does wear off rather quickly....</li>
            <li>Lovely and Lively.</li>
            <li>She loves it, that is worth 5 stars in my book</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive one of my faves, D&amp;G Light Blue, in the mail after about 10 business days post-order.</li>
            <li>Received right on time.</li>
            <li>Right after spraying this one, It was gone within minutes.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the second bottle was also damaged, but we had more than we&#x27;d originally purchased and were impressed with the professionalism and decency of the seller.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Now, I was thinking, &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t look the exact same, but maybe the smell will win me over?&amp;#34; The smell is the same.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was willing to overlook that.</li>
            <li>Its the real McCoy and my wife loves it, so its a no-brainer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not flowery or girly (if that makes sense), its more deep and musky a bit.</li>
            <li>it is very light did not stay for long.</li>
            <li>It has a soft and clean scent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the real deal!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I can say about Light Blue is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>There are some strange people in this world :)</li>
            <li>I will buy this again online and certainly buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>- I used to get compliments all the time on Light Blue, and now no one can smell it, even when I ask!</li>
            <li>I have used light blue for years.</li>
            <li>Almost makes me feel like it&#x27;s not the real thing??</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied on this one  </li>
            <li>Really reflecting her personality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known about light blue for awhile.</li>
            <li>so when her birthday came up the light bulb above my head appeared!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s Light Blue is just that.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>Good price, prompt delivery, extremely well packaged for a fragile product - no issues with this product or vendor....</li>
            <li>I like it much better that other fragrances that she has worn.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this a very special perfume special occasion perfume not everyday to expensive .thank</li>
            <li>I still had the near-empty bottle of my old Light Blue (bought from Macy&#x27;s, so I knew it was legit)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered light blue that it smelled entirely different on me.</li>
            <li>I should have known that this wouldn&#x27;t be a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Such a soft, clean smell.</li>
            <li>The price seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately it was!</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for 2 yrs and was happy with it, but on this last order I&#x27;m not happy at all.  </li>
            <li>I have several other fragrances I love that are both Parfum and Eau de Toilettes sprays</li>
            <li>or it is old.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was slightly sticky and damp when I removed it from its nice, faux-velvety box, and there was about 1/4&amp;#34; space missing from the contents of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it lasts about as long as a body splash/spritzer does, and by the time i get to my car from my house, I can&#x27;t smell the lovely Light Blue I just put on -</li>
            <li>It barely lasts an hour</li>
            <li>the reference, although some have complained about lasting power, seems to hold just fine - she sprays in the morning</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Next up, I could see actual stick residue on the bottle&#x27;s front - it was a small, rectangular shape that to me, could have been a &amp;#34;TESTER&amp;#34; sticker?</li>
            <li> My near-sighted attempt to save a few bucks is going to end up costing me more in the long run, and that stinks.</li>
            <li> The same as store bought with  less money spent.</li>
            <li> It is just what I expected and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> product was as expected, delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed because this was one of her favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering like I find some other fragrances.</li>
            <li> And it costs less.</li>
            <li> because even though it has a floral scent, it is not sweet.  </li>
            <li> That was a little.</li>
            <li> Maybe the missing liquid had been leaked onto the bottle?</li>
            <li> The price was 16 dollars less than Sam&#x27;s club-WOW!</li>
            <li> I am NOT a fan of knockoff anything, so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Either way, that was a slight disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about that if I pay for 3.4 I have to get 3.4 not 3.3.</li>
            <li> This has to be bootleg.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never experienced something like this.</li>
            <li> The smell is very faint, and it almost seems like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return it, but I do not recommend buying this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Found it cheaper on Amazon so took the chance and ordered it despite some people saying this was a fake.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a fake...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle we&#x27;d bought was damaged and had leaked perfume all over the box before opening.  </li>
            <li> For me this shouldn&#x27;t be your casual fragrance.</li>
            <li> I guess I got one of the bad one this time.</li>
            <li> very sad, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I was very excited to receive one of my faves, D&amp;G Light Blue, in the mail after about 10 business days post-order.The price seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately it was! The bottle was slightly sticky and damp when I removed it from its nice, faux-velvety box, and there was about 1/4&amp;#34; space missing from the contents of the bottle. Maybe the missing liquid had been leaked onto the bottle? Either way, that was a slight disappointment. Next up, I could see actual stick residue on the bottle&#x27;s front - it was a small, rectangular shape that to me, could have been a &amp;#34;TESTER&amp;#34; sticker? not too sure. Anyway, I was willing to overlook that. Until i noticed the bottle had crooked lettering on it! I still had the near-empty bottle of my old Light Blue (bought from Macy&#x27;s, so I knew it was legit) so i compared the two bottles. They are identical in structure, however the lettering on the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; bottle was very different from the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; bottle; it was shinier and like I mention, crooked! and almost falling off!! I am NOT a fan of knockoff anything, so this was a big disappointment. Now, I was thinking, &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t look the exact same, but maybe the smell will win me over?&amp;#34; The smell is the same. Hooray! Unfortunately it lasts about as long as a body splash/spritzer does, and by the time i get to my car from my house, I can&#x27;t smell the lovely Light Blue I just put on - and no, I am not one of those ladies who drenches herself with perfume so she can enjoy the scent all day as well - I used to get compliments all the time on Light Blue, and now no one can smell it, even when I ask! very sad, very disappointing. My near-sighted attempt to save a few bucks is going to end up costing me more in the long run, and that stinks. I would like to return this but I am pretty sure I cannot. I wish I&#x27;d have done more research on this. Bummer for me, please don&#x27;t make the same mistake! (OR, perhaps I just got a &#x27;lemon&#x27; of a bottle?) good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a such a great price. I should have known that this wouldn&#x27;t be a high quality product. The smell is very faint, and it almost seems like it was watered down. It barely lasts an hour and I have to continuously spray it all day. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return it, but I do not recommend buying this product through Amazon. Spend the extra money and buy it at a department store</li>
            <li> I got the order on time the smell is not like I got  from the store it is very light did not stay for long. I also pay for 3.4oz but on the bottle say 3.3. I am not happy about that if I pay for 3.4 I have to get 3.4 not 3.3. I order it because the SIZE.</li>
            <li> My signature scent . Light citrus smell  very crisp great price for the size. One of my favorite scents for sure.</li>
            <li> This perfume does not smell like the original and the scent does not last. DO NOT buy perfume off amazon since you cant return it!</li>
            <li> I have used light blue for years. This is the first time I ordered light blue that it smelled entirely different on me. This has to be bootleg. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is not as strong as if I would of bought it in the department stores. Almost makes me feel like it&#x27;s not the real thing??</li>
            <li> This perfume is my daughter&#x27;s favorite. Found it cheaper on Amazon so took the chance and ordered it despite some people saying this was a fake. It wasn&#x27;t a fake...it&#x27;s the same as the dept store she had. Good price, prompt delivery, extremely well packaged for a fragile product - no issues with this product or vendor....I will buy this again online and certainly buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Tim T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, you know what you&#x27;re gonna get.  Unfortunately, the bottle we&#x27;d bought was damaged and had leaked perfume all over the box before opening.  The seller immediately replaced the it for us and was very courteous in dealing with our problem.  Unfortunately, the second bottle was also damaged, but we had more than we&#x27;d originally purchased and were impressed with the professionalism and decency of the seller.</li>
            <li> I love it. Gave it to my sister and she loves it. She then wanted her friend to get one too.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of light blue this is the best deal around! The price was 16 dollars less than Sam&#x27;s club-WOW! Its the real McCoy and my wife loves it, so its a no-brainer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since the first time i smelled it and once my GF smelled it, it&#x27;s been her favorite as well, She gets compliments almost on a daily basis of how she smells good!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I was very pleased with how quick I received the order however the product itself is either a knock off or it is old.  As people who have worn this perfume off and on for years, we know how it smells on us.  This definately did not smell like it should,  as a matter of fact when my mom wore it , it smelled like a lemon.  Really disappointed because this was one of her favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say about Light Blue is FANTASTIC! Such a soft, clean smell. You even get compliments at the END OF THE DAY! ! When I can&#x27;t even smell it any longer , others are saying &amp;#34;What are you wearing? &amp;#34; &amp;#34;it smells so good!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had men and women just walk up and ask me that question! But ladies BEWARE! I HAD ONE MAN LITERALLY FOLLOW ME ALL OVER AN ENTIRE STORE! That was a little. Freaky! But it&#x27;s the TRUTH! There are some strange people in this world :)</li>
            <li> Wife say&#x27;s it&#x27;s smell is weaker than the bottle I bought in a department store, won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It was a 3.3 oz bottle not a 3.4 oz bottle. It was still an awesome deal. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this a very special perfume special occasion perfume not everyday to expensive .thank you love it</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 2 yrs and was happy with it, but on this last order I&#x27;m not happy at all.  When sprayed on the smell doesn&#x27;t last 30 minutes.  Very dissatisfied on this one  I guess I got one of the bad one this time.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent (I&#x27;m wearing it right now). The price for this was unbelievable--what a deal!</li>
            <li> It doesnt even have the strong smell that it should have. Right after spraying this one, It was gone within minutes.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  Best price ever.</li>
            <li> Immediate delivery. This product I have used for many years now and to find it at this amazing value is indeed a treasure.  Thank you for making this item so affordable.... Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very good pricing for a good product</li>
            <li> this a tried  and true fragrance for me.  always tons of compliments. been wearing it for 12 years. wonderful fragrance</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite scent on the market. Always get compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s not flowery or girly (if that makes sense), its more deep and musky a bit. This size bottle at sephore is around $95 so it&#x27;s definitely a bargain. Will re-order when needed :)</li>
            <li> Perfect Gift for my younger sister. Really reflecting her personality. Lovely and Lively.</li>
            <li> She loves it, that is worth 5 stars in my book</li>
            <li> Wife loved it... the reference, although some have complained about lasting power, seems to hold just fine - she sprays in the morning and I can still smell her when she gets home (the good way... LoL)</li>
            <li> Love this!!  This is a very light, clean fragrance.  I must have!!</li>
            <li> This bottle is twice the size I would get a Ulta, Target, or CVS. And it costs less. I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 10 years and I constantly receive compliments from people. It&#x27;s the only scent that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Worth it! The same as store bought with  less money spent.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. As advertised. Great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known about light blue for awhile. I also know my best lady friend doesn&#x27;t wear it. so when her birthday came up the light bulb above my head appeared!&lt;br /&gt;  Light blue is a amazing fragrance. I&#x27;ve never met anyone who didn&#x27;t love it. For me this shouldn&#x27;t be your casual fragrance. This is more to impress someone on a night out.&lt;br /&gt;  Just make sure if you buy the 3.3 oz like i did you take advantage and click on amazons super shipper savings. I didn&#x27;t realize i could save on this and had a homer Simpson moment when i realized it AFTER i had already purchased.*FACEPALM* DOU!!!</li>
            <li> Sweet smell. My sister likes it a lot! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> merry Christmas to me</li>
            <li> This could be a magic trick. The sample of this product that I received from another source was lovely and inspired me to purchase a full size version. The fragrance is the same as the sample however once applied it disappears. I have several other fragrances I love that are both Parfum and Eau de Toilettes sprays but I&#x27;ve never experienced something like this. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> good price and shopping made easy thru amazon</li>
            <li> Product arrived on schedule and met my expectations</li>
            <li> It is just what I expected and it arrived on time. I will recommend to others. There are many places I can order from but I prefer ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas after she told me that she liked the fragrance. I like it much better that other fragrances that she has worn. It has a soft and clean scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering like I find some other fragrances.</li>
            <li> This perfume make every man head turn. I am so in love with this perfume and the for the size and price this is the BOMB!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  The smell I feel does wear off rather quickly.... But I have enjoyed. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love an eau de toilette that has a clean smell, like freshly soaped skin, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s Light Blue is just that.  It has a soothing quality because even though it has a floral scent, it is not sweet.  I love smelling it on me.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the price. My wife loves it and it smells great! I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a knock off. I&#x27;ll be seeking a refund.</li>
            <li> product was as expected, delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> Love this scent! bought a couple times now. This size lasts me awhile.</li>
            <li> Always fabulous. The absolute best fragrance on the market. Very clean, crisp aroma. LOVE it!!!!</li>
