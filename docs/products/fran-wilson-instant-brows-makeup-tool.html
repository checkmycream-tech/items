            <li>good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Really good, i&#x27;m still using mine, it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Take good care of them and you may not have to buy them so often.</li>
            <li>It is a good product to start if no this skillful hands as it sticks to the skin</li>
            <li>But use a magnifying mirror and get close, if your close vision is not so good, like mine.</li>
            <li>Very easy and works great.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, as it gives a good shape.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better as you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Helps my eyebrow look nicely shaped.</li>
            <li>Have always liked Fran Wilson products.</li>
            <li>They rip very easily.  </li>
            <li>Best product that I&#x27;ve seen or used, so far.</li>
            <li>Just stick the stencil when you wish you new brows to appear and apply brow powder and sealer if you wish and you can go all day and night with the most perfect browns in the room.   </li>
            <li>Great for very sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I love that it sticks on you and peels off.</li>
            <li>but they are okay.</li>
            <li>Once it is placed correctly it is okay.  </li>
            <li>brows look so much better</li>
            <li>I love this product I have never had eyebrows</li>
            <li>every use at Amazon&#x27;s price &#x3D; more than a dollar per application, so more than $30 per month.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>I love these, they are easy to use, and easy to paint in.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using stencils and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Much better options available out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item arrived in good timing, really please with the products, brought it when I travelled to the USA, in sally&#x27;s shop.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, this is the shape that fits my (former) eyebrows perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Can apply both templates at once to get an even fit (with sticky backing), then fill in with pencil or powder.  </li>
            <li>While these are cheap, I still feel ripped off.</li>
            <li>but they are no longer available.  </li>
            <li>When I found them I was so excited because I know hoe</li>
            <li>and I have to fill them in more freehand to make it look more natural</li>
            <li>concept is good but these miss the mark entirely.</li>
            <li>The light adhesive works great to hold them in place, and I&#x27;ve been able to use the same pair several times before having to use new ones.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t seem to use it right</li>
            <li>When I was able to get the stencils off of the paper they were sticking to, they stencils wered fine however there were a few times when the stencils tore while I was trying to remove them from the adhesive paper they were originally on?  </li>
            <li>Have to modify it a little, but still a good line to follow.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used eyebrow stencils, altho I&#x27;ve needed them for years.  </li>
            <li>Also you can use just a pencil to outline the inside of the stencil once it is one to show you exactly what stray hairs have to go.</li>
            <li>For real!  </li>
            <li>First day of use,one side was teared apart,cant recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has helped me draw my eyebrow as I have always loved arched and round.</li>
            <li>I FOUND THESE TO BE TOO LARGE FOR MY FACE</li>
            <li>The Elf stencils are huge but these ones actually work well for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They are very flimsy and may need to be made with a stronger plastic.</li>
            <li>These templates make it much easier to get the eyebrows you want without messing up.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but I apply carefully and since I don&#x27;t need a lot of color applied, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>If this company is reading the reviews, would you please make some new shapes that are wider and also, at the very least, use a colored stencil so you can see more easily if you have it in the correct position on you</li>
            <li>It helped me get a whole new look with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Just got to get use to the new me.</li>
            <li>If not for that, they&#x27;d last much longer!  </li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable, also they last a long time as they are reusable.  </li>
            <li>I would like to say more product information on the material if it is too soft or thin or thicker.</li>
            <li>I kept getting one brow higher then the other.</li>
            <li>Received a different package than what is shown, also the templates are much thinner in shape than previous versions of this brand.</li>

            <li> Received a different package than what is shown, also the templates are much thinner in shape than previous versions of this brand.</li>
            <li> , you repeat with the opposite stencil for your other eye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you are finished with the hair removal, a simple makeup removal cloth will get rid of the dark liner, and your brow will be shaped, beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t loose the look and shape throught the day or night.</li>
            <li> A bit awkward to apply since its plastic, and does not curve easily over your brow line.</li>
            <li> There is only one style of arched and the strips sticks your natural brows making it abit painful when removing the strips too fast and grabbing some hair.</li>
            <li> It can only be used a few times before the it will not adhere any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since investigated other eyebrow stencils that are pricier but are truly re-usable.</li>
            <li> you know where to wax and/or tweeze because you want to get rid of everything that doesn&#x27;t have the dark liner on it.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s SLIGHTLY sticky, not to pull hair, but to help you line it up and keep it in place), and color inside the stencil with a dark brow or eyeliner</li>
            <li> I found the stencils a little difficult to use the first few times but with practice I think it will get easier.  </li>
            <li> My only issue with these are that they are a bit thin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your  money.</li>
            <li> Oh well, looks like I lucked out on few bucks.</li>
            <li> Can be used over sparce or thin brows or especially if you have no brows at all.  </li>
            <li> Its kinda a waste of money.</li>
            <li> But I find that the stencils themselves are very thin, the brow shape is too thin and it&#x27;s hard to see them as you are trying to place them on your face properly because they are a clear color.  </li>
            <li> No more uneven eyebrows!</li>
            <li> These are so cheesy that I tore several just trying to peel them off the paper.</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s at least 12 to a package for this price.  </li>
            <li> But at least you do not have to hold the arch strips.</li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> No happy with purchase.  </li>
            <li> Even if I didn&#x27;t have eyebrows, this stencil would be too thin.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The shape/arch of the brow on these is so unrealistic.</li>
            <li> The adhesive seems quite sticky and, if you could manage to not tear the stencil, they would probably stick--and it would be painful to remove them, but probably not more painful than waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This price is crazy.  </li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> AND I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been terrible with eyebrows.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I was able to get the stencils off of the paper they were sticking to, they stencils wered fine however there were a few times when the stencils tore while I was trying to remove them from the adhesive paper they were originally on?  once they ripped, I did try to reform them and use them.  Package only comes with 6 pairs and I think 50% tore.  They are very flimsy and may need to be made with a stronger plastic.</li>
            <li> Received a different package than what is shown, also the templates are much thinner in shape than previous versions of this brand. This is not what I wanted, but I will try them and see what results are produced.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, as it gives a good shape.  Have to modify it a little, but still a good line to follow.  And, each set lasts several times, before sticky backing wears off.  If not for that, they&#x27;d last much longer!  Great for very sparse eyebrows.  Can apply both templates at once to get an even fit (with sticky backing), then fill in with pencil or powder.  Best product that I&#x27;ve seen or used, so far.</li>
            <li> there is only one style and they are too big for my face, i would not buy it again, nothing else</li>
            <li> The brow make up tool is wonderful.  This price is crazy.  I buy I think there&#x27;s at least 12 to a package for this price.  Unreal.</li>
            <li> Great!!  I love that it sticks on you and peels off. Perfect eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using stencils and I am very pleased. My only issue with these are that they are a bit thin and I have to fill them in more freehand to make it look more natural but they are okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been terrible with eyebrows.  These templates make it much easier to get the eyebrows you want without messing up.  No more uneven eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to use.  Once it is placed correctly it is okay.  It can only be used a few times before the it will not adhere any longer.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used eyebrow stencils, altho I&#x27;ve needed them for years.  Just didn&#x27;t realize there was such a thing.  Actually I thought this package would contain several different shapes to choose from, but it&#x27;s only the &amp;#34;arched&amp;#34; style.  Luckily, this is the shape that fits my (former) eyebrows perfectly.  The light adhesive works great to hold them in place, and I&#x27;ve been able to use the same pair several times before having to use new ones.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like to try to use any of these stencils without the adhesive, because it makes a lot of difference keeping them in place.</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time finding these, after using them years ago. When I found them I was so excited because I know hoe good they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply peel off the stencil, place it over your brow (it&#x27;s SLIGHTLY sticky, not to pull hair, but to help you line it up and keep it in place), and color inside the stencil with a dark brow or eyeliner pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when you remove the stencil (you temporarily look like a monster, but) you know where to wax and/or tweeze because you want to get rid of everything that doesn&#x27;t have the dark liner on it. When you are finished with the hair removal, a simple makeup removal cloth will get rid of the dark liner, and your brow will be shaped, beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, you repeat with the opposite stencil for your other eye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> No happy with purchase.  They rip very easily.  Can&#x27;t even remove them from the backing without ripping. Don&#x27;t waste your  money.</li>
            <li> awesome help in making you look more put together.  brows look so much better w using this stencil.  simple and like the stick ons</li>
            <li> I love this product I have never had eyebrows so now I have a chance to enjoys some for once in my life. Just got to get use to the new me.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try these as my brows are blond and patchy. These stencils are NOT re-useable. They require the user to punch out the stencil portion, and by the time I had managed to do that on just one, the stencil was torn in 3 places. The adhesive seems quite sticky and, if you could manage to not tear the stencil, they would probably stick--and it would be painful to remove them, but probably not more painful than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought mine at Sally&#x27;s and returned them. The saleslady who processed the return said she had tried them also--and had the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also quite pricey for the quality-- every use at Amazon&#x27;s price &#x3D; more than a dollar per application, so more than $30 per month. I&#x27;ve since investigated other eyebrow stencils that are pricier but are truly re-usable. Much better options available out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is good but these miss the mark entirely.</li>
            <li> Great! Great!great! Helps my eyebrow look nicely shaped. I use eyebrow shape holder gel after so I don&#x27;t loose the look and shape throught the day or night.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THESE TO BE TOO LARGE FOR MY FACE AND MADE ME LOOK LIKE A CLOWN. I DON&#x27;T HAVE A REAL TINY FACE BUT FOUND THESE STENCILS TO BE MADE FOR THE LARGER FRAMED FACES BECAUSE I TRIED THE SMALLEST AND THINNEST ARCH STENCIL AND I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED WHEN I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AFTER FINISHING. UGH  IT WAS HORRID. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR THE SMALLER FRAMED GIRLS OUT THERE WHO HAVE A THINNER EYE BROW</li>
            <li> Go it it&#x27;s good I just can&#x27;t seem to use it right</li>
            <li> not good. i could not even get them off the paper.</li>
            <li> Really good, i&#x27;m still using mine, it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> While these are cheap, I still feel ripped off. These are so cheesy that I tore several just trying to peel them off the paper. The shape/arch of the brow on these is so unrealistic. If you want to look like Spock from Star Trek, these are it. I should have known better as you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was a stencil for people with no eyebrows! Oh well, looks like I lucked out on few bucks. It&#x27;s just a tape stencil you put over the area that you want eyebrows and you fill it in. Even if I didn&#x27;t have eyebrows, this stencil would be too thin. Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Have been using Hairoff brand eyebrow stencils for years but they are no longer available.  These stencils are the same idea in that they will adhere to your brow without having to hold them in place.  But I find that the stencils themselves are very thin, the brow shape is too thin and it&#x27;s hard to see them as you are trying to place them on your face properly because they are a clear color.  But I guess they will have to do.  If this company is reading the reviews, would you please make some new shapes that are wider and also, at the very least, use a colored stencil so you can see more easily if you have it in the correct position on you face.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> In a hurry and want beautiful and perfect brows.  Just stick the stencil when you wish you new brows to appear and apply brow powder and sealer if you wish and you can go all day and night with the most perfect browns in the room.   Can be used over sparce or thin brows or especially if you have no brows at all.  Also you can use just a pencil to outline the inside of the stencil once it is one to show you exactly what stray hairs have to go. Pluck them, reapply stencil and power and your good to go with the best looking brows in the room!! For real!  Victoria</li>
            <li> This item arrived in good timing, really please with the products, brought it when I travelled to the USA, in sally&#x27;s shop.  They need to sell it in the u.k.  Price is very reasonable, also they last a long time as they are reusable.  Also create a perfect eye brow shape..</li>
            <li> Had problems to put it on, did not use it.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are easy to use, and easy to paint in.  If you need perfect eyes this adds the perfect eyebrow</li>
            <li> came on time and used them and they make anyone have the perfect eyebrow shape anyone can use these and do a great job</li>
            <li> The Elf stencils are huge but these ones actually work well for my eyebrows. They are def thicker than my own brows but excellent shape etc. The only downside is that they are stickers. Take good care of them and you may not have to buy them so often.</li>
            <li> I would like to say more product information on the material if it is too soft or thin or thicker. I did not think it was like a sticker. But it works for me. It has helped me draw my eyebrow as I have always loved arched and round. It is a good product to start if no this skillful hands as it sticks to the skin and I have used 4 times each sticker and so draw my eyebrows until it grows so with this form.</li>
            <li> I found the stencils a little difficult to use the first few times but with practice I think it will get easier.  Have always liked Fran Wilson products.</li>
            <li> A bit awkward to apply since its plastic, and does not curve easily over your brow line. but I apply carefully and since I don&#x27;t need a lot of color applied, I am satisfied. I would recommend this. But use a magnifying mirror and get close, if your close vision is not so good, like mine.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It helped me get a whole new look with my eyebrows. I could&#x27;nt be happier and I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I thought that they may have been plastic so that I could reuse them, but there were not. They are peal and stick. I would not recommend this product. Its kinda a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. There is only one style of arched and the strips sticks your natural brows making it abit painful when removing the strips too fast and grabbing some hair. But at least you do not have to hold the arch strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try them but I think is not the stencil is me it just wasn&#x27;t made for me ...for some reason I just didn&#x27;t like them they material wasn&#x27;t so good and shipping took for ever!</li>
            <li> They get teared apart,the lastic is not durable enough to use.First day of use,one side was teared apart,cant recommend it.</li>
            <li> Loved getting this product..they are really good!</li>
            <li> Ya las he comprado 4 veces a mi esposa,&lt;br /&gt;le encanta como le quedan las cejas, son muy prácticas y se pueden reutilizar</li>
            <li> if you wear glasses, this product my not work well for you.  I kept getting one brow higher then the other.</li>
            <li> Very easy and works great.</li>
