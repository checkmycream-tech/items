            <li>MY WIFE SAYS THAT IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE PRODUCT AND WHICH, if proved, AND</li>
            <li>but I feel very effective.  </li>
            <li>Amazing !</li>
            <li>My skin feels good and looks great</li>
            <li>You need to use it all the time for best results and it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s so much better than the creams and lotions that are out there.  </li>
            <li>But then again I dislike any kind of an appointment!</li>
            <li>YOu just need a great lotion to glide the wand and a good  witch hazel toner after ward.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>34;too good to be true&amp;#34; item.</li>
            <li>It is a good product but it is not like on tv. ..</li>
            <li>And absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>but I was told that it is reall good and that skin feels good.</li>
            <li>but my skin still looks good.  </li>
            <li>I find a good time to do it</li>
            <li>/&gt;She sells her own great skin products and 2 mos.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it every day, so it must be good.</li>
            <li>, I tried did not do any good</li>
            <li>Wishful thinking, did not do me any good.</li>
            <li>This was for a gift but the comments was good.</li>
            <li>It was a gift and they loved</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>My friends have also commented on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>After reading all kinds of good reviews online and that of Dr. Oz, I thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>The dermawand it good, and the products are also.  </li>
            <li>So based on her enthusiasm, I&#x27;d say it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>So get a good lotion to use as the slide medium, set a routine and stick with it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic purchase, works great!</li>
            <li>I did get some Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic acid since I had read some good reviews from dermawand users.  </li>
            <li>I have waited to put in my review because I wanted to give it a fair chance to see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li>I watched videos on this product for about a month on TV then decided to buy, all along knowing it was to good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I took good care of product, did not drop it and put it in its bag after use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything for you, save your money and buy a good face cream</li>
            <li>I guess , if it is too good to be true.  !!!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Derma wand for three months, and I am very happy with the results; my skin is tighter, laugh lines are not as pronounced.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and love the improvements I see!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Well, I have a MAGIC WAND\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it on amazon.com because I got a speedy refund!</li>
            <li>Got this for my sister cause she fell in love with mine!</li>
            <li>it the better it get!</li>
            <li>My bottom line is that I am satisfied and wished I purchased this in my 40&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>but I was impressed with the &#x27;first time&#x27; use.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I absolutely love the results!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>like you supposed to, I have used it just once a day and the results that I&#x27;m getting are really amazing.</li>
            <li>are effective to stimulate collagen generation according to the web research.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product and will use it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>is like going to have treatments to specializes places, but this you can do it in your own home.</li>
            <li>I use my own cream and it has always worked none of this fancy stuff for me.</li>
            <li>but in my honest review I didn&#x27;t have the time or want to have the time to sit and run this across my face.</li>
            <li>and honestly I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>-- I use my own Clinique moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>AND THATS PUTTING IT NICELY JUST WAISTED 125.00 FOR VANITY</li>
            <li>After one month, I have grown to love this product because it feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product would be effective with dedicated use.</li>
            <li>It is a nice item at a nice price</li>
            <li>it workes great after a clean scrubbing with my nutrisonic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have known better, but the ads were very convincing.</li>
            <li>This product is super Great .</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use</li>
            <li>the instructions are easy to understand however it is best to view the CD first before the pamphlet.  </li>
            <li>GOOD GOOD, VERY VERY RESPONSIBLE, IN ALL ASPECT</li>
            <li>I do not see much results in the fine lines that I have, but I have seen a wonderful improvement&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>Great item, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Great product, it really works!</li>
            <li>I am willing to put in the time to use this as I am happy with the effect.</li>
            <li>, The  Derma wand has tightened ALL OF IT, and gotten rid of my fine lines , i started on top lip line and it will enlarge your lips for about 6 hrs after but fine lines are fading !!</li>
            <li>, THAT IS A HUGE HUGE DEAL !!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it from Amazon</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking for more benefits.</li>
            <li>and I can tell the collagen has regenerated because my skin looks more plump.</li>
            <li>and Im getting like most consumers...</li>
            <li>I have been using one of these for over 12 years and love it .</li>
            <li>:) I just love the derma wand and what it does for your face :) .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok butwhen</li>
            <li>Gives skin a healthy glow and a smoothness for a night out.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I have had so many people freak out Shen</li>
            <li>I use it every day and love it</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a lot of moisturizer or the preface that comes with it.</li>
            <li>but I was able to use this on the highest setting without discomfort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin from day one :)</li>
            <li>Love it and hope the results appear in a month.  </li>
            <li>The appearance around my eyes looks much better now.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product!!!!  </li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>gilbert thanks again for your great product</li>
            <li>more than I</li>
            <li>out makeup ARE GONE, BUT you need to work those areas that ARE issues to you over and over w DERMA WAND and more than the 4 strokes in each area</li>
            <li>I love both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure someone will .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dr procedures, that will reveal a more youthful face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ARE MORE Opened</li>
            <li>i have used derma wand for more than 6 years now.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am a skeptic when it comes to many skin care products.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the return policy.</li>
            <li>and sure beats the price of salon laser therapy.  </li>
            <li>Wanted so many time to return it but got ride to the box that it came from.</li>
            <li>Following the directions to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Yes, the results are temporary but it works a lot better than the lotions and potions that promise temporary results.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin looks brighter and is more moisturized.</li>
            <li>this helps! :)</li>
            <li>I would recommend you save your money until you can talk to a plastic surgeon, many times they will offer a payment plan.  </li>
            <li>Just awesome, feel younger every day.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I get more tingling from my rotating scrub brush than from this wand.  </li>
            <li>Did a lot of research on this to make sure it was safe.</li>
            <li>Of course I am retired and have more time on my hands than others, but if you use the Derma Wand faithfully ones a day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li>I did follow the DVD and it did take many viewings and pausing in the beginning</li>
            <li>so it was more than the 5 minutes</li>
            <li>the ad suggested it was more like 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I love the dermawand.</li>
            <li>The more I used it, the longer the results lasted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>times better then</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re dealing with acne and haven&#x27;t had success with anything else, order this!!</li>
            <li>My face looks lifted and many of the fine lines have vanished.  </li>
            <li>I had read many reviews on this before purchasing and realized it works for some but not others and had hopes that I&#x27;d see fabulous results.</li>
            <li>, do you really think the DermaWand is as good?  </li>
            <li>What the Dermawand did for me was to give me a more awake, more fresh look.</li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Dermawand on Amazon because I knew the return would be easy.</li>
            <li>EASY to apply.</li>
            <li>Watched the dvd and had the pamphlet handy as I began the first use.</li>
            <li>Wasnt sure the infomercial was true but wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>Could not see any improvements of my fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my face looked after the first treatment!  </li>
            <li>this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone that would be interested in using it</li>
            <li>HUGE</li>
            <li>I always look around when any one says WOW you have the most amazing skin .  </li>
            <li>A DERMA WAND &amp; HER RESULTS WERE FANTASTIC, SO</li>
            <li>My skin now is smooth</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and the results are fabulous</li>
            <li>It is not something cheap.</li>
            <li>Is the bulb supposed to light up?</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t order the products that ship with it; but substituting my own products really gave a dynamite result.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a cheap fix because you can&#x27;t afford laser from a plastic surgeon</li>
            <li>Cheap made.  </li>
            <li>very dissatisfied and dissappointed with what seemed to be a nice alternative to cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li>I am 53, light complexion.</li>
            <li>So far so good time will tell</li>
            <li>I was enjoying some good results, using as directed (2 x daily).</li>
            <li>Gives me a healthy glow right after using it.</li>
            <li>, I got what I deserved, believe it or not, companies depend a great deal on the placebo affect those who want to believe will gaze into a mirror and see what they want to see, also I&#x27;m sure companies will go to Amazon and write their own reviews and make it look like it&#x27;s coming from the general public.</li>
            <li>Violet colored high frequency light is effective for acne treatment and anti bacteria VS.</li>
            <li>The case I got with my older one was quilted and a nice case</li>
            <li>product was worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re younger, it will work better and faster than it has for me, but something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh!</li>
            <li>The first one I had fell on the floor and the top of the wand smashed.</li>
            <li>The first one seemed to have so much more power.</li>
            <li>After the first week I am so pleased with how my skin looks that I am not using make-up, just moisturizer when I go out.</li>
            <li>clean tip with alcohol wipe after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a clean oxygenating smell.</li>
            <li>But now that I feel more comfortable and capable</li>
            <li>thanks your product is awesome hope to make buissiness in the near future sincerely</li>
            <li>it will not give you a face lift but it will make your crows feet and fine lines and  make your skin glow WORTH</li>

            <li>NOW THE SKIN FACIAL LOTIONS ARE GOOD</li>
            <li>i am 53 and have always taken good care of my sensitve skin, this device is such a treat!</li>
            <li>I was going to follow the directions to a T for a full month and see if I got results.  </li>
            <li>and fast and the more you us</li>
            <li>I used this product with my own moisturizer because I am sensitive to some ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you want a good result... especially for acne, you have to buy HF, but not this \\&quot;for home use\\&quot; think....</li>
            <li>and I found out quickly what a difference it makes to my appearance.</li>
            <li>the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I am very much into looking as good as possible but found I could not keep this up.</li>
            <li>around nose to  mouth are REALLY plumped OUT!!...</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>After two weeks my lids are higher, lines around mouth almost gone and discoloration of skin and tone is so improved that I could go without makeup!</li>
            <li>and i love the way it stimulates my skin-it really is relaxing and the mild smell is nice, like fresh from the dry cleaner smell which does not linger.</li>
            <li>I have great expectations from this little gizmo.</li>
            <li>It diminishes pores, makes my skin look fresh</li>
            <li>ALSO MY BROW HAD 2 DISTINCT LINES, AFTER USING 2 TIMES A DAY FOR 4 DAYS</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would pay about  $700 for Fillers for these results and any beginning check smile lines</li>
            <li>he said I look rested and fresh.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin feel fresh and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>So for me, this has been a useful purchase.</li>
            <li>My face seems to look more refreshed, tighter, younger, smooth, and clearer looking skin.  </li>
            <li>It is defintely worth the</li>
            <li>I am happy so far with the overall product and skin care kit.</li>
            <li>I just started using it, but it seems worth the price.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and then I go right to the chin and jaw</li>
            <li>and I have always felt that the older you get the more make-up just makes you look older, so</li>
            <li>Derma wand works great on under eye area; the small bags which started to show have vanished.</li>
            <li>you can use you&#x27;d own products as long as it doesn&#x27;t have retinol or anything in it.</li>
            <li>Facial\\&quot;  DR uses a  device like stamper filled with fine needles that are pressed in to face ,  it bleeds ,puncturing the face in tiny holes</li>
            <li>Better to pay a little more than to get stuck with a paper weight.  </li>
            <li>now my DR said , while skin is at its best, Botox will LOCK the Results in , take any lines or left over slight wrinkles completely away like smooth glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel good, but if you are looking to see less wrinkles, you need not try this for that.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep using it and hope to see more improvements within a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>Love this product I see a big difference in my face feel sooth also very clean also notice it removing little spot that I have and wrinkles too love</li>
            <li>It made my pores bigger and my wrinkles more visible.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>everyday use might be the best way for long time results.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within the first 2 weeks of using it on settings 1 - 5.  </li>
            <li>* OK the BIG TEST !!!!  </li>
            <li>5 wks, I NOW CANNOT Pinch extra skin, nor at top of Cheeks or at mouth jaw</li>
            <li>Not only that, it adds more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>After first week, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>It glowed and I looked well rested, brows were higher, puffiness under eyes diminished.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I love it yet as I just haven&#x27;t used it enough.</li>
            <li>then my first buy.</li>
            <li>At first my pores shrunk.</li>
            <li>The first time I called was a month ago, and they said they would send it that week.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter-in-law, and she reports that she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>sparingly at first till your skin gets use to this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great customer service after first receiving a defective wand ....</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>but it really really did &amp; does work!</li>
            <li>Love it, it actually works!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the change in the firmness and shrinking of pores.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not an over night magic cure,  but there is definitely improvement in sagging lines from the nose to chin and under my jaw.  </li>
            <li>If I had one criticism it is that it scared me at first.</li>
            <li>I own New Spa high frequency professional level devise.</li>
            <li>but it was worth a try and easy to send back.</li>
            <li>In the first week, my skin was positively glowing.</li>
            <li>though I own the other unit, I decided to buy Dermawand.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I am really pleased and know it was worth the money spent for it.</li>
            <li>I have used the product pretty consistently for about 2 months and can&#x27;t tell that it is making any real difference.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, noticed tightness of skin  within first week in upper eye lids.  </li>
            <li>but we will give it a positive try.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the higher frequencies.</li>
            <li>Easy to use comes with several items and seems to be working.</li>
            <li>those powerful machines  are used by qualified technicians, which are light years ahead and much more powerful  than this DermaWand toy, the only thing it is good for is to put money in the pockets of the person who makes this piece of junk, I read some bad press on this item, but I foolishly wanted to believed it would work for me anyway</li>
            <li>Use large amounts of face serum.</li>
            <li>eye lines and fine line above brown or on nose bridge</li>
            <li>, maybe that&#x27;s because I only have fine lines there</li>
            <li>Just this morning my mouth fell open when I realized the fine crow&#x27;s feet had disappered.</li>
            <li>this one has a cheap little case something you would use for a cheap pair of glasses.</li>
            <li>I realized when I ordered this product that I was very beyond the early wrinkle, smile, or crows feet lines.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the simplicity.</li>
            <li>I just need to plug in and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>I think it really works.</li>
            <li>I gave this a try but really didn&#x27;t see a change.  </li>
            <li>According to the plastic surgeon on the Dr. Oz show that aired June 6, claims this product works for laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>I have been really impress with it.</li>
            <li>Really works .</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t stand the smell of the ozone it produces and too much exposure to it</li>
            <li>HE IS A REAL MANS MAN...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help at all not something I would really purchase again</li>
            <li>It really improve the way your skin looks.</li>
            <li>Very time consuming to use.</li>
            <li>too much time involved</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>this device really works.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>when I use my weekly teeth whitener -- then I do it for 30 minutes straight.</li>
            <li>I SEE REAL CHANGES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>lost skin color in that area from Plastic surgeon using laser too much..</li>
            <li>ITS SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flawless as my friend and acquaintances have said but I didn&#x27;t want to think it was REAL?</li>
            <li>/&gt;EYE makeup and  lids are much firmer and lids skin don&#x27;t move as i apply shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really done much yet for my deeper wrinkles</li>
            <li>I use the derma wand every day and it really does help with my acne issues.</li>
            <li>I really have made it a part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>too much money</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>Wish I had time to do it twice a day, but just once seems, for me, to work very well.</li>
            <li>love how it stimulates my skin, however, i&#x27;m not really seeing the results that were promised.  </li>
            <li>I was really skepticle...</li>
            <li>Having to do this every day morning &amp; evening forever seemed too much for the results I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.com.</li>
            <li>okay, it is pink.</li>
            <li>After using the derma wand for one week a friend asked me how much weight I had lost...because my face was tighter and thinner.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>very good...and faster delivery...thanks</li>
            <li>I give my face a real workout with Derma Wand by using it for more&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used the dermawand twice a day for a month and it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>It becomes very cumbersome.</li>
            <li>I did really like the Dermawand until it no longer functioned and for the price</li>
            <li>Thanks Dermawand.</li>
            <li>For a hundred plus dollars, I just dont know if its worth the investment of time and money given the cause of laugh lines and how the plastic surgeon actually surgically fixes it....</li>
            <li>Yes, the dermawand definitely makes my face look more alive</li>
            <li>is easy to use and it does not take that long.</li>
            <li>Derma wand definitely made my skin soft and blemishes disappear very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new Dermawand every month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The DRs use the Professional Grade Higher Frequency Machine Procedure , known as  \\&quot;Thermage\\&quot; .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  not giving it a full review until later.</li>
            <li>I dropped the older one ( it still worked )</li>
            <li>I used to be able TO pinch a bit of skin on upper cheek bones, and on side of my mouth PRIOR to  DERMA wand ,</li>
            <li>Love it... can see a different in my eye lids and have only been using a week..  </li>
            <li>That was my main area of concern..  </li>
            <li>After a quick initial use ....</li>
            <li>but they seem decent.  </li>
            <li>This is apparently an older version of the one being advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>no surgical face lift high frequency machine misc</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this --</li>
            <li>I always use the machine on HIGH because i am a man and our skin is denser and can handle it.</li>
            <li>I would highly urge the use of this product, you too will benefit from using the Derma Wanda.....</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
            <li>High Frequency is 100......</li>
            <li>:  WOW, when u have oily skin , u can get large pores, and I had Some, they ARE GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to use it every day and can tell my face is a little more perky.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this from the website - would have been much cheaper to purchase from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>Just giving it few more days..</li>
            <li>I have normal skin with some dryness during the winter</li>
            <li>for each section with my normal cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li>From my profile side,  under chin ,my neck and jaw is nicely well defined, tighter it was not sagging prior BUT corners of my mouth were down turned.  </li>
            <li>BUT THE IMPROVEMENT ON FINE LINES AND MINIMIZING PORE SIZE IS NOT EVIDENT</li>
            <li>The product was much bigger and less effective</li>
            <li>Did not see results right away, however my pores do seem to be smaller</li>
            <li>Around my orbital bones and fine eye lines,  if i smile hard , I do have eye wrinkling, bUT no wrinkles if i don&#x27;t smile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have First hand experience of Medically Approved High frequency radio waves to TREAT  Chronic SPINE Pain ,</li>
            <li>Came very fast and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>face has not had BOTOX , Fillers or any thing for 4 years  when I started use of my new Derma wand .&lt;br</li>
            <li>when she did a live  DEMO with audience person of  THERMAGE , u can Google</li>
            <li>healing time TONS OF NEW COLLAGEN is Produced and  reveals</li>
            <li>And I believe it has helped with newly formed pimples to heal faster.  </li>
            <li>Although i have tried other similar devices including derma needle roller, D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct, and even Tria age-defying Lasor, i found Derma Wand being the most beneficial and economical facial tool.  </li>
            <li>i am only 22 years old, but have smile lines and a turkey</li>
            <li>I have used the dermawand for several years before my first one expired.  </li>
            <li>at first only.</li>
            <li>At first I was only using on the lowest level in all areas of my face.</li>
            <li>Yes it worked the first time...and only time I could use it .</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad my curiosity is satisfied and at least I get to tell others what a waste of money and time this is.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a complete new wand.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money and definitely wouldn&#x27;t spend more.</li>
            <li>The only improvement I have noticed is the slight eye lift however it is not permanent and lasts a day at most</li>
            <li>super simple to use ,affordable and i already fill the difference in only one week of use.</li>
            <li>nutrient rich blood and plasma that flows down the body , not UP To The Face unless procedures are done</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, using it weekly, instructional directions were clear, trying on some problem areas, time will tell how well it works for that</li>
            <li>Age spots have faded, my skin seems firmer and soft.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and this makes me look 45.  </li>
            <li>Think I should save up my money for a real facelift, I think that will be my only hope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised, but my friend and I both got one</li>
            <li>I AM 43 YRS OLD &amp; THIS WORKED THE 1ST DAY</li>
            <li>so the time frame you were given before the return really did not give you time to actually see of it</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>, FACE skin is so much Tigher, Cheek bones are well defined and skin ELASTIN is back !</li>
            <li>I am encouraged that at least I have some results and I can truthfully say that 99% of creams, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>It takes about 45 min to do the whole regimine properly.  </li>
            <li>At least my skin feels better.</li>
            <li>No miracles but not enough time to see if it really works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old and have been dealing with cystic acne for over a year.  </li>
            <li>but i cant be sure till i try it for at least a month</li>
            <li>Using it on a regular basis has really made a difference in removing wrinkles from around the eyes &amp; mouth.  </li>
            <li>If u have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but so far I think it makes my skin rejuvenated and gives it a glow.</li>
            <li>and So far I like it...</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;ozone machines&amp;#34; of the 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money, especially as the kit came with a pre-treatment cleanser and a facial cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to just install a small in-line switch yourself but it should have come with one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the negative reviews, but I believe that it takes at least one full month of regular use to give a product a fair chance.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be a fluke after the first time, but after the 2nd and 3rd times I knew it was the Dermawand.  </li>
            <li>I tend to go up and down in my weight and that can really show in your face, but this is really helping with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why the price was so high it is the same thing I bought years ago.</li>
            <li>He does not offer compliments if not due!</li>
            <li>NOT down turned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been working as fast as I imagined, not really seeing the results I  was expecting, maybe it takes more time but as of now not  very happy with it</li>
            <li>My skin is a little read after each treatment but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>Take it from me, don’t waste your time and money on this piece of junk, and if you want to do it right, go to a professional, I wound up throwing mine in the garbage where it belongs!</li>
            <li>The sagging (especially around the eyes), is also improving, but more slowly.</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable tightening of my jawline and skin in general.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the wand long enough to find out if it really works</li>
            <li>know, there is the  PROFESSIONAL Version of Derma wand that Derma wand was likely based on its science and procdure.</li>
            <li>BUT , you look so Alive , Glowing, Younger</li>
            <li>Only used it three days so far.  </li>
            <li>I gave my old one which was a lot smaller and lighter to my Mom..</li>
            <li>Also there was the feeling of a drag on my skin unless really, really creamed.</li>
            <li>The time needed to complete the treatment is short</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happily surprised that it actually works as promised.</li>
            <li>This new one definitely has a weaker current.</li>
            <li>There are certainly other old scars that may benefit from this too, but right now, I&#x27;m just going to assume it won&#x27;t have supreme effect on old scars, but may make them a bit less visible...</li>
            <li>One of my eyebrows is lower than the other, but the Dermawand really helped raise both to an even level.</li>
            <li>I do have a pretty recent stitch area on my hand that is closed up, but still very red.</li>
            <li>My skin Is pretty tight</li>
            <li>, the redness is fading (much faster than my really pale Irish skin would normally do).</li>
            <li>I had expected it to be an improvement over the older one.</li>
            <li>I found out that both are beneficial but for two different purposes in general.</li>
            <li>I paid $118.00 for the whole package as depicted in the pictures and description but did not get the Skin Mist, Hydra Support, Hydra Infusion!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can buy from other sellers the same product for $99.00.</li>
            <li>COVERS IT and the PINK COLOR IS now normal skin tone</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t trust a seller with less than ethical practices.</li>
            <li>Could this little want REALLY tone up my sagging skin?</li>
            <li>I read good and bad reviews and decided to try it for myself.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My wife uses it every day, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> , I tried did not do any good</li>
            <li> Wishful thinking, did not do me any good.</li>
            <li> This was for a gift but the comments was good.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and they loved</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> My friends have also commented on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> After reading all kinds of good reviews online and that of Dr. Oz, I thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> The dermawand it good, and the products are also.  </li>
            <li> So based on her enthusiasm, I&#x27;d say it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> So get a good lotion to use as the slide medium, set a routine and stick with it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic purchase, works great!</li>
            <li> I did get some Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic acid since I had read some good reviews from dermawand users.  </li>
            <li> I have waited to put in my review because I wanted to give it a fair chance to see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li> I watched videos on this product for about a month on TV then decided to buy, all along knowing it was to good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I took good care of product, did not drop it and put it in its bag after use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for you, save your money and buy a good face cream</li>
            <li> I guess , if it is too good to be true.  !!!  </li>
            <li> I have been using Derma wand for three months, and I am very happy with the results; my skin is tighter, laugh lines are not as pronounced.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>

            <li> My bottom line is that I am satisfied and wished I purchased this in my 40&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> but I was impressed with the &#x27;first time&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I absolutely love the results!</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> like you supposed to, I have used it just once a day and the results that I&#x27;m getting are really amazing.</li>
            <li> are effective to stimulate collagen generation according to the web research.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product and will use it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> is like going to have treatments to specializes places, but this you can do it in your own home.</li>
            <li> I use my own cream and it has always worked none of this fancy stuff for me.</li>
            <li> but in my honest review I didn&#x27;t have the time or want to have the time to sit and run this across my face.</li>
            <li> and honestly I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> -- I use my own Clinique moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> AND THATS PUTTING IT NICELY JUST WAISTED 125.00 FOR VANITY</li>
            <li> After one month, I have grown to love this product because it feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product would be effective with dedicated use.</li>
            <li> It is a nice item at a nice price</li>
            <li> it workes great after a clean scrubbing with my nutrisonic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have known better, but the ads were very convincing.</li>
            <li> This product is super Great .</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use</li>
            <li> the instructions are easy to understand however it is best to view the CD first before the pamphlet.  </li>
            <li> GOOD GOOD, VERY VERY RESPONSIBLE, IN ALL ASPECT</li>
            <li> I do not see much results in the fine lines that I have, but I have seen a wonderful improvement&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> Great item, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great product, it really works!</li>
            <li> I am willing to put in the time to use this as I am happy with the effect.</li>
            <li> , The  Derma wand has tightened ALL OF IT, and gotten rid of my fine lines , i started on top lip line and it will enlarge your lips for about 6 hrs after but fine lines are fading !!</li>
            <li> , THAT IS A HUGE HUGE DEAL !!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it from Amazon</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking for more benefits.</li>
            <li> and I can tell the collagen has regenerated because my skin looks more plump.</li>
            <li> and Im getting like most consumers...</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for over 12 years and love it .</li>
            <li> :) I just love the derma wand and what it does for your face :) .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok butwhen</li>
            <li> Gives skin a healthy glow and a smoothness for a night out.  </li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I have had so many people freak out Shen</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a lot of moisturizer or the preface that comes with it.</li>
            <li> but I was able to use this on the highest setting without discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin from day one :)</li>
            <li> Love it and hope the results appear in a month.  </li>
            <li> The appearance around my eyes looks much better now.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!!!!  </li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> gilbert thanks again for your great product</li>
            <li> more than I</li>
            <li> out makeup ARE GONE, BUT you need to work those areas that ARE issues to you over and over w DERMA WAND and more than the 4 strokes in each area</li>
            <li> I love both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure someone will .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dr procedures, that will reveal a more youthful face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ARE MORE Opened</li>
            <li> i have used derma wand for more than 6 years now.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am a skeptic when it comes to many skin care products.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the return policy.</li>
            <li> and sure beats the price of salon laser therapy.  </li>
            <li> Wanted so many time to return it but got ride to the box that it came from.</li>
            <li> Following the directions to get the best results.</li>
            <li> Yes, the results are temporary but it works a lot better than the lotions and potions that promise temporary results.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin looks brighter and is more moisturized.</li>
            <li> this helps! :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend you save your money until you can talk to a plastic surgeon, many times they will offer a payment plan.  </li>
            <li> Just awesome, feel younger every day.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I get more tingling from my rotating scrub brush than from this wand.  </li>
            <li> Did a lot of research on this to make sure it was safe.</li>
            <li> Of course I am retired and have more time on my hands than others, but if you use the Derma Wand faithfully ones a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> I did follow the DVD and it did take many viewings and pausing in the beginning</li>
            <li> so it was more than the 5 minutes</li>
            <li> the ad suggested it was more like 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I love the dermawand.</li>
            <li> The more I used it, the longer the results lasted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> times better then</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re dealing with acne and haven&#x27;t had success with anything else, order this!!</li>
            <li> My face looks lifted and many of the fine lines have vanished.  </li>
            <li> I had read many reviews on this before purchasing and realized it works for some but not others and had hopes that I&#x27;d see fabulous results.</li>
            <li> , do you really think the DermaWand is as good?  </li>
            <li> What the Dermawand did for me was to give me a more awake, more fresh look.</li>
            <li> Easy</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Dermawand on Amazon because I knew the return would be easy.</li>
            <li> EASY to apply.</li>
            <li> Watched the dvd and had the pamphlet handy as I began the first use.</li>
            <li> Wasnt sure the infomercial was true but wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> Could not see any improvements of my fine lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my face looked after the first treatment!  </li>
            <li> this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone that would be interested in using it</li>
            <li> HUGE</li>
            <li> I always look around when any one says WOW you have the most amazing skin .  </li>
            <li> A DERMA WAND &amp; HER RESULTS WERE FANTASTIC, SO</li>
            <li> My skin now is smooth</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and the results are fabulous</li>
            <li> It is not something cheap.</li>
            <li> Is the bulb supposed to light up?</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order the products that ship with it; but substituting my own products really gave a dynamite result.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a cheap fix because you can&#x27;t afford laser from a plastic surgeon</li>
            <li> Cheap made.  </li>
            <li> very dissatisfied and dissappointed with what seemed to be a nice alternative to cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> I am 53, light complexion.</li>
            <li> So far so good time will tell</li>
            <li> I was enjoying some good results, using as directed (2 x daily).</li>
            <li> Gives me a healthy glow right after using it.</li>
            <li> , I got what I deserved, believe it or not, companies depend a great deal on the placebo affect those who want to believe will gaze into a mirror and see what they want to see, also I&#x27;m sure companies will go to Amazon and write their own reviews and make it look like it&#x27;s coming from the general public.</li>
            <li> Violet colored high frequency light is effective for acne treatment and anti bacteria VS.</li>
            <li> The case I got with my older one was quilted and a nice case</li>
            <li> product was worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re younger, it will work better and faster than it has for me, but something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh!</li>
            <li> The first one I had fell on the floor and the top of the wand smashed.</li>
            <li> The first one seemed to have so much more power.</li>
            <li> After the first week I am so pleased with how my skin looks that I am not using make-up, just moisturizer when I go out.</li>
            <li> clean tip with alcohol wipe after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a clean oxygenating smell.</li>
            <li> But now that I feel more comfortable and capable</li>
            <li> thanks your product is awesome hope to make buissiness in the near future sincerely</li>
            <li> it will not give you a face lift but it will make your crows feet and fine lines and  make your skin glow WORTH</li>

            <li> and fast and the more you us</li>
            <li> I used this product with my own moisturizer because I am sensitive to some ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you want a good result... especially for acne, you have to buy HF, but not this \\&quot;for home use\\&quot; think....</li>
            <li> and I found out quickly what a difference it makes to my appearance.</li>
            <li> the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I am very much into looking as good as possible but found I could not keep this up.</li>
            <li> around nose to  mouth are REALLY plumped OUT!!...</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> After two weeks my lids are higher, lines around mouth almost gone and discoloration of skin and tone is so improved that I could go without makeup!</li>
            <li> and i love the way it stimulates my skin-it really is relaxing and the mild smell is nice, like fresh from the dry cleaner smell which does not linger.</li>
            <li> I have great expectations from this little gizmo.</li>
            <li> It diminishes pores, makes my skin look fresh</li>
            <li> ALSO MY BROW HAD 2 DISTINCT LINES, AFTER USING 2 TIMES A DAY FOR 4 DAYS</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would pay about  $700 for Fillers for these results and any beginning check smile lines</li>
            <li> he said I look rested and fresh.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin feel fresh and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> So for me, this has been a useful purchase.</li>
            <li> My face seems to look more refreshed, tighter, younger, smooth, and clearer looking skin.  </li>
            <li> It is defintely worth the</li>
            <li> I am happy so far with the overall product and skin care kit.</li>
            <li> I just started using it, but it seems worth the price.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and then I go right to the chin and jaw</li>
            <li> and I have always felt that the older you get the more make-up just makes you look older, so</li>
            <li> Derma wand works great on under eye area; the small bags which started to show have vanished.</li>
            <li> you can use you&#x27;d own products as long as it doesn&#x27;t have retinol or anything in it.</li>
            <li> Facial\\&quot;  DR uses a  device like stamper filled with fine needles that are pressed in to face ,  it bleeds ,puncturing the face in tiny holes</li>
            <li> Better to pay a little more than to get stuck with a paper weight.  </li>
            <li> now my DR said , while skin is at its best, Botox will LOCK the Results in , take any lines or left over slight wrinkles completely away like smooth glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel good, but if you are looking to see less wrinkles, you need not try this for that.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using it and hope to see more improvements within a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li> Love this product I see a big difference in my face feel sooth also very clean also notice it removing little spot that I have and wrinkles too love</li>
            <li> It made my pores bigger and my wrinkles more visible.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> everyday use might be the best way for long time results.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within the first 2 weeks of using it on settings 1 - 5.  </li>
            <li> * OK the BIG TEST !!!!  </li>
            <li> 5 wks, I NOW CANNOT Pinch extra skin, nor at top of Cheeks or at mouth jaw</li>
            <li> Not only that, it adds more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After first week, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> It glowed and I looked well rested, brows were higher, puffiness under eyes diminished.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I love it yet as I just haven&#x27;t used it enough.</li>
            <li> then my first buy.</li>
            <li> At first my pores shrunk.</li>
            <li> The first time I called was a month ago, and they said they would send it that week.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter-in-law, and she reports that she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> sparingly at first till your skin gets use to this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great customer service after first receiving a defective wand ....</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> but it really really did &amp; does work!</li>
            <li> Love it, it actually works!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the change in the firmness and shrinking of pores.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not an over night magic cure,  but there is definitely improvement in sagging lines from the nose to chin and under my jaw.  </li>
            <li> If I had one criticism it is that it scared me at first.</li>
            <li> I own New Spa high frequency professional level devise.</li>
            <li> but it was worth a try and easy to send back.</li>
            <li> In the first week, my skin was positively glowing.</li>
            <li> though I own the other unit, I decided to buy Dermawand.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I am really pleased and know it was worth the money spent for it.</li>
            <li> I have used the product pretty consistently for about 2 months and can&#x27;t tell that it is making any real difference.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, noticed tightness of skin  within first week in upper eye lids.  </li>
            <li> but we will give it a positive try.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the higher frequencies.</li>
            <li> Easy to use comes with several items and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> those powerful machines  are used by qualified technicians, which are light years ahead and much more powerful  than this DermaWand toy, the only thing it is good for is to put money in the pockets of the person who makes this piece of junk, I read some bad press on this item, but I foolishly wanted to believed it would work for me anyway</li>
            <li> Use large amounts of face serum.</li>
            <li> eye lines and fine line above brown or on nose bridge</li>
            <li> , maybe that&#x27;s because I only have fine lines there</li>
            <li> Just this morning my mouth fell open when I realized the fine crow&#x27;s feet had disappered.</li>
            <li> this one has a cheap little case something you would use for a cheap pair of glasses.</li>
            <li> I realized when I ordered this product that I was very beyond the early wrinkle, smile, or crows feet lines.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the simplicity.</li>
            <li> I just need to plug in and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> I think it really works.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try but really didn&#x27;t see a change.  </li>
            <li> According to the plastic surgeon on the Dr. Oz show that aired June 6, claims this product works for laugh lines.  </li>
            <li> I have been really impress with it.</li>
            <li> Really works .</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t stand the smell of the ozone it produces and too much exposure to it</li>
            <li> HE IS A REAL MANS MAN...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all not something I would really purchase again</li>
            <li> It really improve the way your skin looks.</li>
            <li> Very time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> too much time involved</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> this device really works.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> when I use my weekly teeth whitener -- then I do it for 30 minutes straight.</li>
            <li> I SEE REAL CHANGES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> lost skin color in that area from Plastic surgeon using laser too much..</li>
            <li> ITS SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flawless as my friend and acquaintances have said but I didn&#x27;t want to think it was REAL?</li>
            <li> /&gt;EYE makeup and  lids are much firmer and lids skin don&#x27;t move as i apply shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really done much yet for my deeper wrinkles</li>
            <li> I use the derma wand every day and it really does help with my acne issues.</li>
            <li> I really have made it a part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> too much money</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> Wish I had time to do it twice a day, but just once seems, for me, to work very well.</li>
            <li> love how it stimulates my skin, however, i&#x27;m not really seeing the results that were promised.  </li>
            <li> I was really skepticle...</li>
            <li> Having to do this every day morning &amp; evening forever seemed too much for the results I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.com.</li>
            <li> okay, it is pink.</li>
            <li> After using the derma wand for one week a friend asked me how much weight I had lost...because my face was tighter and thinner.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> very good...and faster delivery...thanks</li>
            <li> I give my face a real workout with Derma Wand by using it for more&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used the dermawand twice a day for a month and it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> It becomes very cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I did really like the Dermawand until it no longer functioned and for the price</li>
            <li> Thanks Dermawand.</li>
            <li> For a hundred plus dollars, I just dont know if its worth the investment of time and money given the cause of laugh lines and how the plastic surgeon actually surgically fixes it....</li>
            <li> Yes, the dermawand definitely makes my face look more alive</li>
            <li> is easy to use and it does not take that long.</li>
            <li> Derma wand definitely made my skin soft and blemishes disappear very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new Dermawand every month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The DRs use the Professional Grade Higher Frequency Machine Procedure , known as  \\&quot;Thermage\\&quot; .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not giving it a full review until later.</li>
            <li> I dropped the older one ( it still worked )</li>
            <li> I used to be able TO pinch a bit of skin on upper cheek bones, and on side of my mouth PRIOR to  DERMA wand ,</li>
            <li> Love it... can see a different in my eye lids and have only been using a week..  </li>
            <li> That was my main area of concern..  </li>
            <li> After a quick initial use ....</li>
            <li> but they seem decent.  </li>
            <li> This is apparently an older version of the one being advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> no surgical face lift high frequency machine misc</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this --</li>
            <li> I always use the machine on HIGH because i am a man and our skin is denser and can handle it.</li>
            <li> I would highly urge the use of this product, you too will benefit from using the Derma Wanda.....</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
            <li> High Frequency is 100......</li>
            <li> :  WOW, when u have oily skin , u can get large pores, and I had Some, they ARE GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to use it every day and can tell my face is a little more perky.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this from the website - would have been much cheaper to purchase from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> Just giving it few more days..</li>
            <li> I have normal skin with some dryness during the winter</li>
            <li> for each section with my normal cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li> From my profile side,  under chin ,my neck and jaw is nicely well defined, tighter it was not sagging prior BUT corners of my mouth were down turned.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE IMPROVEMENT ON FINE LINES AND MINIMIZING PORE SIZE IS NOT EVIDENT</li>
            <li> The product was much bigger and less effective</li>
            <li> Did not see results right away, however my pores do seem to be smaller</li>
            <li> Around my orbital bones and fine eye lines,  if i smile hard , I do have eye wrinkling, bUT no wrinkles if i don&#x27;t smile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have First hand experience of Medically Approved High frequency radio waves to TREAT  Chronic SPINE Pain ,</li>
            <li> Came very fast and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> face has not had BOTOX , Fillers or any thing for 4 years  when I started use of my new Derma wand .&lt;br</li>
            <li> when she did a live  DEMO with audience person of  THERMAGE , u can Google</li>
            <li> healing time TONS OF NEW COLLAGEN is Produced and  reveals</li>
            <li> And I believe it has helped with newly formed pimples to heal faster.  </li>
            <li> Although i have tried other similar devices including derma needle roller, D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct, and even Tria age-defying Lasor, i found Derma Wand being the most beneficial and economical facial tool.  </li>
            <li> i am only 22 years old, but have smile lines and a turkey</li>
            <li> I have used the dermawand for several years before my first one expired.  </li>
            <li> at first only.</li>
            <li> At first I was only using on the lowest level in all areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Yes it worked the first time...and only time I could use it .</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad my curiosity is satisfied and at least I get to tell others what a waste of money and time this is.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a complete new wand.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and definitely wouldn&#x27;t spend more.</li>
            <li> The only improvement I have noticed is the slight eye lift however it is not permanent and lasts a day at most</li>
            <li> super simple to use ,affordable and i already fill the difference in only one week of use.</li>
            <li> nutrient rich blood and plasma that flows down the body , not UP To The Face unless procedures are done</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, using it weekly, instructional directions were clear, trying on some problem areas, time will tell how well it works for that</li>
            <li> Age spots have faded, my skin seems firmer and soft.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and this makes me look 45.  </li>
            <li> Think I should save up my money for a real facelift, I think that will be my only hope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised, but my friend and I both got one</li>
            <li> I AM 43 YRS OLD &amp; THIS WORKED THE 1ST DAY</li>
            <li> so the time frame you were given before the return really did not give you time to actually see of it</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> , FACE skin is so much Tigher, Cheek bones are well defined and skin ELASTIN is back !</li>
            <li> I am encouraged that at least I have some results and I can truthfully say that 99% of creams, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> It takes about 45 min to do the whole regimine properly.  </li>
            <li> At least my skin feels better.</li>
            <li> No miracles but not enough time to see if it really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and have been dealing with cystic acne for over a year.  </li>
            <li> but i cant be sure till i try it for at least a month</li>
            <li> Using it on a regular basis has really made a difference in removing wrinkles from around the eyes &amp; mouth.  </li>
            <li> If u have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but so far I think it makes my skin rejuvenated and gives it a glow.</li>
            <li> and So far I like it...</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;ozone machines&amp;#34; of the 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money, especially as the kit came with a pre-treatment cleanser and a facial cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to just install a small in-line switch yourself but it should have come with one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the negative reviews, but I believe that it takes at least one full month of regular use to give a product a fair chance.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a fluke after the first time, but after the 2nd and 3rd times I knew it was the Dermawand.  </li>
            <li> I tend to go up and down in my weight and that can really show in your face, but this is really helping with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why the price was so high it is the same thing I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> He does not offer compliments if not due!</li>
            <li> NOT down turned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been working as fast as I imagined, not really seeing the results I  was expecting, maybe it takes more time but as of now not  very happy with it</li>
            <li> My skin is a little read after each treatment but that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li> Take it from me, don’t waste your time and money on this piece of junk, and if you want to do it right, go to a professional, I wound up throwing mine in the garbage where it belongs!</li>
            <li> The sagging (especially around the eyes), is also improving, but more slowly.</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable tightening of my jawline and skin in general.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the wand long enough to find out if it really works</li>
            <li> know, there is the  PROFESSIONAL Version of Derma wand that Derma wand was likely based on its science and procdure.</li>
            <li> BUT , you look so Alive , Glowing, Younger</li>
            <li> Only used it three days so far.  </li>
            <li> I gave my old one which was a lot smaller and lighter to my Mom..</li>
            <li> Also there was the feeling of a drag on my skin unless really, really creamed.</li>
            <li> The time needed to complete the treatment is short</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happily surprised that it actually works as promised.</li>
            <li> This new one definitely has a weaker current.</li>
            <li> There are certainly other old scars that may benefit from this too, but right now, I&#x27;m just going to assume it won&#x27;t have supreme effect on old scars, but may make them a bit less visible...</li>
            <li> One of my eyebrows is lower than the other, but the Dermawand really helped raise both to an even level.</li>
            <li> I do have a pretty recent stitch area on my hand that is closed up, but still very red.</li>
            <li> My skin Is pretty tight</li>
            <li> , the redness is fading (much faster than my really pale Irish skin would normally do).</li>
            <li> I had expected it to be an improvement over the older one.</li>
            <li> I found out that both are beneficial but for two different purposes in general.</li>
            <li> I paid $118.00 for the whole package as depicted in the pictures and description but did not get the Skin Mist, Hydra Support, Hydra Infusion!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can buy from other sellers the same product for $99.00.</li>
            <li> COVERS IT and the PINK COLOR IS now normal skin tone</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t trust a seller with less than ethical practices.</li>
            <li> Could this little want REALLY tone up my sagging skin?</li>
            <li> I read good and bad reviews and decided to try it for myself.  </li>
            <li> The cap is loose and not a good fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product really lives up to the standard of the advertisement ,I,m still yo see any improvement</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference in lines and wrinkles, but my skin is definitely feeling tighter.</li>
            <li> and my face isn’t nearly as wrinkled as the woman displayed on the DermaWand  box, after two months there was absolutely no change in my facial appearance at all, not even a little bit, yes, they took the  principle of how it works from the professional machines which can cost thousands of dollars and this toy is a micro fraction of  that</li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I am double that so as long as it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> i can see and instant lifting effect to my eyebrows and am looking forward to the long term effect.</li>
            <li> * the FINE lines around eyes, above  brows etc , mouth or areas all over randomly ALL have smoothed and I don&#x27;t see them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but at least I can see some positive results.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strange after you use the wand.</li>
            <li> How long does it take before I see a difference?</li>
            <li> Also, took so long for the process.</li>
            <li> The directions are not clear.  </li>
            <li> A new cyst popped up on my face two days ago, and this device has already dried it up!  </li>
            <li> The written and DVD instructions are a little different and very brief.</li>
            <li> It even helped heal the minor break outs I had on my chin!</li>
            <li> The mechanism of action using muscle stimuli with low voltage isn&#x27;t hard to comprehend</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-fifties, with dry skin prone to rosacea.  </li>
            <li> All these reviews complain about the smell it smells like a dry cleaner</li>
            <li> I know the makers say its safe, but it feels very weird (almost like electricuting your face) and always makes my face smell like burnt flesh afterwards.</li>
            <li> THE PINCH TEST OF LOOSE SKIN</li>
            <li> It comes down to how you personally feel about it.</li>
            <li> There is a little difference, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for results.</li>
            <li> I have very little time left in a day to actually use something like this.  </li>
            <li> Skin texture is like satin and my enlarged pores are about half their former size.</li>
            <li> I am 55 &amp; have started seeing larger pores in my t-zone &amp; saging around the jaw line &amp; after 2 treatment I was seeing cleaner pores &amp; less saging.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know whether I look like I had a surgical face lift, but I do look younger, less saggy and my skin seems to look brighter.  </li>
            <li> Only the light is on and just very faintly glows.</li>
            <li> for those not Familiar with TRENDS in  Facial procedures , is called a \\&quot;VAMPIRE</li>
            <li> This little device is actually preventing wrinkles and sagging.  </li>
            <li> have little or no effect unless you&#x27;re younger than 35.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and am not thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I was curious what is the difference between these two colors.  </li>
            <li> Have not really had the time to use it for any length of time.  </li>
            <li> tired of the snake oil, wanting some truths and some real results for my money and my time.</li>
            <li> After just a few days you could see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I keep using it because I spent the money on it and want to see if usage over time produces any results.</li>
            <li> u get produce collagen elastic setc and rush blood to treated area why  skin gets pink</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s harder to tell if there&#x27;s any improvement.  </li>
            <li> Tried calling customer service today 11/26, but they&#x27;re closed.</li>
            <li> and I know the product works to help firm and invigorate my facial muscles.  </li>
            <li> I have only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> A friend of mine moved away &amp; see her only a few times a year &amp;</li>
            <li> You have to be careful as this wand can break blood vessels in your face.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> It is not what l expected, there is no difference.</li>
            <li> D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct is less expensive than Derma Wand but</li>
            <li> The down time is just too long, i gave up.   </li>
            <li> As far as I,m concerned this was a waste of money !!  </li>
            <li> I had read of this same issue occuring in at least one other review prior to my purchase.</li>
            <li> For me, I just am not willing to commit to using it every morning and every night for the rest of my life for the minimal results I am experiencing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see dramatic results like advertized but, I didn&#x27;t really expect to either.</li>
            <li> I do have some extremely fine lines under the corners of my eyes and very faint</li>
            <li> The other area of concern for me was around the lip area....</li>
            <li> I actually believe I can see a difference myself but not sure if I am just being optimistic.</li>
            <li> I had called to get the other dvd.  </li>
            <li> I use the dermawand every other day in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Would buy it again, however will look to other vendors/representatives.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not right</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I only used it 3 times and each time got a dull headache that lasted for hours.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s longevity is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> down time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as it would about 3 months after Filler would start to wear down</li>
            <li> I do turn it down around the eyes.</li>
            <li> youthful appearances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snapping of the Derma wand device,  in a less invasive way, also causes skin to  produce lost collagen&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> a one star however gave it a two stars because I have noticed the slight but temporary eye lift.</li>
            <li> also do NECK jaw exercises you can find on GOOGLE to keep neck and sides of jaw tight</li>
            <li> The cost of using a high quality Korean made one gets too expensive, having it renew every few moths.    </li>
            <li> This is the first time this has occurred in my long history of buying from Amazon :(</li>
            <li> It does take a little patience, so if you don&#x27;t have any this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Took me a little while to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> She was totally amazed when I told her my little secret.  </li>
            <li> I have since googled &amp;#34;Dermawand and headache&amp;#34; and have found others who had the same reaction, although I don&#x27;t think it is a common complaint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> $100.00 + wasted.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, used it just like they say.</li>
            <li> In just a few uses, I could see and feel the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have skipped a few days here and there</li>
            <li> I need to this ASAP, because she is calling me everyday about it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect to look 25 again, but I have been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> her heavy eyelids started to lift and hey mouth wrinkles were sort of fading.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money as claimed benefits never manifested themselves.  </li>
            <li> Will post again after a few weeks and let you know.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it for a few days now</li>
            <li> I do notice a difference if I skip a few days ...</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even bother buying it just a waste of moneyI&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and wanted to slow down the aging process a bit.  </li>
            <li> Is a little tedious to do the treatment in the morning, so I only use it once a day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very small area to work with and takes a very long time to use making it tediously slow.</li>
            <li> If you experiencing dry skin after using derma wand, apply a thin layer of vitamin a with e oil by Derma e before the treatment.</li>
            <li> infact i saw very little change.</li>
            <li> Although i like my derma needle roller, it needs to be sanitized  after every use, and gets dull after a few months.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was as skeptical as the next person.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking close there are faint lines starting</li>
            <li> I already have small face.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is working.  </li>
            <li> and not sure which one I brought</li>
            <li> when she saw me this past winter thought I had surgery.  </li>
            <li> Pore size was increasing and some small discolorations in skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it did anything or not</li>
            <li> it sucks</li>
            <li> if I could it would be a negative 10.</li>
            <li> Been using at least 3 to 4 times a week</li>
            <li> I think I read you need to use it for at least a month, but I didn&#x27;t think there would be a change in another 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> had acne scars and laser removed them, except 2 chicken pox scar on left</li>
            <li> chicken pox mark i had on cheek is Plumped out and a Surgone SCARRED My FACE during LASER proedure that forend a line next to my nose on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> nothing wrong found - need to learn how to use it carefully and give results....</li>
            <li> The creams are nice-no fragrance which is important to me, hate smelly cosmetics!</li>
            <li> I do have a complaint.  </li>
            <li> Lots of negative blogs online</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the skin care products that came with it although I read a lot of negative reviews on those</li>
            <li> : (in past, I&#x27;ve had Botox, fillers, microdermabrasion at plastic surgeons and total laser resurfacing on my face</li>
            <li> Hope the manufacturer takes this feedback seriously and makes improvements.</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird</li>
            <li> After some discussion they said they would send it - I am not happy at all with their customer service, they did not handle the problem, and were rude.</li>
            <li> Not a wise purchase.</li>
            <li> and I can see that the pores are getting smaller, but still nobody have seen any change :(&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> however shes real lazy and stopped using this after two weeks.</li>
            <li> Probably my fault but tough to use for me.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing.</li>
            <li> A MASSAGE, PLUS DECREASED</li>
            <li> use this now, but its behind my mirror</li>
            <li> They said continue using the treatment, spots should be lightened after being darken, but sorry, my skin became so ugly with no positive results.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I fell for this &amp;#</li>
            <li> ; now and then find out years later it causes some awful or lethal damage.</li>
            <li> Now corners are leveled out, SO I do not  look sad or pouting as I have even  as a a kid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I can , then ill start, then update here.&lt;br /&gt;co</li>
            <li> (my Derma Wand my secret!)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the glass part of the wand broke, so I need to get a hold of their customer service to see if I can replace it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this item</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was skeptical when I purchased this product, however I have used the product for almost thirty days now</li>
            <li> Maybe something is wrong with this?</li>
            <li> Useless hype.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to move the wand over my face, even with the cream they supplied.  </li>
            <li> Not a &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; reviewer and skeptical.</li>
            <li> the sparks zap on you like crazy, even into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> ME , the girl known thru life with  bad skin, to go to being known as the woman with Porcelain skin is too Crazy</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised on TV and was very skeptical about it.  </li>
            <li> My friends and family have noticed the bad side effects of this product.</li>
            <li> Iam the one that is bad</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> The smell lingered on me for a while after I was done :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell if I will experience the results advertised, but slightly disappointed in the product itself.</li>
            <li> Its worthless it dose not work.</li>
            <li> Save your money ~ this is worthless.  </li>
            <li> hate that there&#x27;s no on/off control.</li>
            <li> Pre-face worthless</li>

            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hold my breath whilst working around my nose (to avoid breathing in ozone and for the terrible smell).</li>
            <li> putting all the creams and sprays on her face was a bit boring</li>
            <li> the creme is terrible for you</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After using the Dermawand for about one month, I do notice a difference in my skin. Age spots have faded, my skin seems firmer and soft. The device works. However, it&#x27;s not as sturdy as I hoped. Whatever the unit on the inside is, it&#x27;s rattling around when I use the device. A little disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money. It does not work! It made my pores bigger and my wrinkles more visible. I have to return this. My friends and family have noticed the bad side effects of this product. I had to warned them. Don&#x27;t believe those people that are saying it works. I&#x27;m glad I bought it from Amazon so I can return it.The wand gives you carpal tunnel also. Beware!!!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and love the improvements I see!</li>
            <li> It makes you look like you had a facelift. Amazing ! I am 67 years old and this makes me look 45.  I am so hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I realized when I ordered this product that I was very beyond the early wrinkle, smile, or crows feet lines.  So far I have seem minimal improvement but will continue to be optimistic and use it.  Think I should save up my money for a real facelift, I think that will be my only hope.</li>
            <li> I own New Spa high frequency professional level devise. This devise generate violet colored glow. My friend told me Demawand generate orange color glow. Therefore, I was curious what is the difference between these two colors.  I found out that both are beneficial but for two different purposes in general. Violet colored high frequency light is effective for acne treatment and anti bacteria VS. Orange is for anti-aging, lift and tone.&lt;br /&gt;Both are effective to stimulate collagen generation according to the web research.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I own the other unit, I decided to buy Dermawand. It&#x27;s my 3rd day using the devise and I really like the simplicity. I just need to plug in and ready to use.  I can already feel my face muscle has been well stimulated.</li>
            <li> No results seen I did use the product as directed  very disappointed  I did like the sensation of the wand on my skin but no change to appearance</li>
            <li> l  like the product and I&#x27;m still using it and I&#x27;m looking for more benefits. Just giving it few more days..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and have not seen any signs that it works. Sorry I fell for this &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; item.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything for me. I want my money back. Its worthless it dose not work. it sucks</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T SEE ANY CHANGE YET. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANY ONE.THE PRODUCTS THAT XCAME WITH IT DO NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE EITHER.</li>
            <li> My skin feels good and looks great I think it really works.</li>
            <li> Dermawand deluxe skin quench retail kit with 2 derma vital skin care product derma wand for wrinkles puffy eyes saggy skin no surgical face lift high frequency machine misc</li>
            <li> $100.00 + wasted. Did not do anything but tingle &amp; make noise.  Save your money ~ this is worthless.  You must post a star rating here, if I could it would be a negative 10.</li>
            <li> Have not really had the time to use it for any length of time.  Used it for 2 weeks, no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try but really didn&#x27;t see a change.  Maybe there is an age limit and I am just hoping for a miracle product for someone in their fifties.</li>
            <li> Love my dermawand!!! It really works! My skin looks amazing. It diminishes pores, makes my skin look fresh and I can tell the collagen has regenerated because my skin looks more plump. It also tightened up my neck. I am thrilled with this product and will use it for the rest of my life. I get compliments all the time on my skin.  I love it so much I bought one for my mom. She loves it!! If you want beautiful skin and don&#x27;t want to do botox or a facelift, get the dermawand.</li>
            <li> I havent tried this product and am just reviewing it to see what consumers are saying. According to the plastic surgeon on the Dr. Oz show that aired June 6, claims this product works for laugh lines.  Now she didnt state just how well it worked but that it was a product that is used for those that dont want to go under the knife.  For some reason her recommendation just seemed \\&quot;vague\\&quot; like she wasnt telling the viewers everything that she maybe should be.  For a hundred plus dollars, I just dont know if its worth the investment of time and money given the cause of laugh lines and how the plastic surgeon actually surgically fixes it....and Im getting like most consumers...tired of the snake oil, wanting some truths and some real results for my money and my time.</li>
            <li> It made my eyes red for sone reasons. I stopped using it thinking it can&#x27;t be the reason but gave it a try again without getting close to my eyes but it got red again.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone that would be interested in using it</li>
            <li> I have not been using it mornings and nights like you supposed to, I have used it just once a day and the results that I&#x27;m getting are really amazing. is easy to use and it does not take that long. I have been really impress with it. is like going to have treatments to specializes places, but this you can do it in your own home. I tend to go up and down in my weight and that can really show in your face, but this is really helping with that.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommended to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for over 12 years and love it . I use my own cream and it has always worked none of this fancy stuff for me. The price I paid for this one was twice the price of the one I had I dropped the older one ( it still worked ) and that is why I had to get this one. The case I got with my older one was quilted and a nice case this one has a cheap little case something you would use for a cheap pair of glasses. :( I can&#x27;t understand why the price was so high it is the same thing I bought years ago. I will guard this one like it is gold so I hope I will never have to replace it. :) I just love the derma wand and what it does for your face :) .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok butwhen I used it I have stand up in the same place. I would like that it has batteries.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I can see that the pores are getting smaller, but still nobody have seen any change :(&lt;br /&gt;Will continue using it!</li>
            <li> Works well. Gives skin a healthy glow and a smoothness for a night out.  everyday use might be the best way for long time results. BIO-OIL seams to work best.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, used it just like they say. Never saw any results</li>
            <li> Love love love. Really works . A bargain at twice the price!! I have had so many people freak out Shen I tell them I&#x27;m 49.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it</li>
            <li> It is a good product but it is not like on tv. .. my skyn improved and i will continue use it.  I have 3 weeks using it</li>
            <li> MY WIFE SAYS THAT IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE PRODUCT AND WHICH, if proved, AND THAT I ALSO I CAN USE IT NO MATTER WHETHER THE APPLIANCE IS MAN unisex</li>
            <li> I am returning my dermawand. I know the makers say its safe, but it feels very weird (almost like electricuting your face) and always makes my face smell like burnt flesh afterwards. I feel like this may be one of those products that we think is &amp;#34;safe and effective&amp;#34; now and then find out years later it causes some awful or lethal damage. Aside from that, I have seen no results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use comes with several items and seems to be working. Therefore I am really pleased and know it was worth the money spent for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised, but my friend and I both got one and it actually works.  You need to use it all the time for best results and it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s so much better than the creams and lotions that are out there.  Just make sure to use a lot of moisturizer or the preface that comes with it.</li>
            <li> GOOD GOOD, VERY VERY RESPONSIBLE, IN ALL ASPECT</li>
            <li> Love this! Seen results the very next day. Great product and FYI you can use you&#x27;d own products as long as it doesn&#x27;t have retinol or anything in it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see dramatic results like advertized but, I didn&#x27;t really expect to either. What the Dermawand did for me was to give me a more awake, more fresh look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 with practically non-existent signs of sun-damage/aging on my face which I credit to avoiding the sun (covering up, walking in the shade, etc.). I do have some extremely fine lines under the corners of my eyes and very faint || lines between my brows which I decided to especially test out the effectiveness of the Dermawand on. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks and have used it daily for about 5 minutes per session, with no change whatsoever to my lines, sun spots, overall complexion, scars or to a pimple. I had read many reviews on this before purchasing and realized it works for some but not others and had hopes that I&#x27;d see fabulous results. I have normal skin with some dryness during the winter but I was able to use this on the highest setting without discomfort. It feels like an epilation machine to me.&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t stand the smell of the ozone it produces and too much exposure to it causes upper respiratory problems anyway. I&#x27;d hold my breath whilst working around my nose (to avoid breathing in ozone and for the terrible smell). The smell lingered on me for a while after I was done :( I used to smell the same scent when I was welding! I didn&#x27;t know it was ozone! I thought it was flux or oil burning off!&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can only recommend someone to just try it since its results are hit or miss and don&#x27;t make an effort to inhale the ozone like it&#x27;s a flower.&lt;br /&gt;I hate that there&#x27;s no on/off control. It&#x27;s easy to just install a small in-line switch yourself but it should have come with one!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the included lotions since I didn&#x27;t open them, but looking at the ingredients, I don&#x27;t think I would have used them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad my curiosity is satisfied and at least I get to tell others what a waste of money and time this is.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife. And absolutely loved it. After just a few days you could see a big difference. I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Love this product I see a big difference in my face feel sooth also very clean also notice it removing little spot that I have and wrinkles too love It thank you for get about Botox</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I absolutely love the results! I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin from day one :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m younger without it!</li>
            <li> Yes, I was as skeptical as the next person. Could this little want REALLY tone up my sagging skin? The shot answer is YES. In the first week, my skin was positively glowing. Skin texture is like satin and my enlarged pores are about half their former size. The sagging (especially around the eyes), is also improving, but more slowly. I have great expectations from this little gizmo.</li>
            <li> I AM 43 YRS OLD &amp; THIS WORKED THE 1ST DAY I USED IT, MY LINES ON MY FACE WERE SOFTENED.  I REALLY LOVE HOW IT DECREASES THE PUFFY EYE IN AM OR WHENEVER!! ALSO MY BROW HAD 2 DISTINCT LINES, AFTER USING 2 TIMES A DAY FOR 4 DAYS THE LINES ARE ALMOST GONE.  MY HUSBAND NOTICED IMMEDIATELY...HE THOUHT THIS WAS JUST A GIMIC BUT NOW HE MAKES ME USETHE DERMA WAND ON HIS FACE ALMOST DAILY...HE IS A REAL MANS MAN...SO HE DIDNT BELIEVE UNTIL HE SAW THE RESULTS! IT IS AMAZING!! ALSO I HAVE SEVERE MIGRAINES &amp; I USED THIS ON MY TEMPLE &amp; UPPER JAW/EAR AREA &amp; FEELS LIKE A MASSAGE, PLUS DECREASED THE SWELLING WHICHI DID NOT GET A HEADACHE, SO I FEEL THERE ARE MEDICAL BENEFITS TOO. ALSO OUR NEIGHBOR WHO IS 60 SHE GOT A DERMA WAND &amp; HER RESULTS WERE FANTASTIC, SO WHEN I SAW IT AT THE LOW PRICE ON AMAZON I HAD TO GET ONE, NOW I AM SOOOOOOO HAPPY, THANK THANK YOU DERMA WAND!!</li>
            <li> Pulled skin did not like the way it felt everytime it touch the skin. Did not see the difference like they showed in video plus it kept saying temporary so the time frame you were given before the return really did not give you time to actually see of it worked over time.</li>
            <li> If anything, it&#x27;s made my hormonal acne flare up.  I&#x27;m 50 years old and am not thrilled with the results.  I have been using the wand diligently every morning and evening for a month.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this but in my honest review I didn&#x27;t have the time or want to have the time to sit and run this across my face. I just don&#x27;t like taking the time out to do it. But then again I dislike any kind of an appointment! I didn&#x27;t use the wand long enough to find out if it really works so I returned it within the 30 days and got a no questions asked refund through Amazon. I love Amazon! The no hassle returns are great.</li>
            <li> I did not see the damatic change that the ad shows. infact i saw very little change. The smell is strange after you use the wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  How long does it take before I see a difference?</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been working as fast as I imagined, not really seeing the results I  was expecting, maybe it takes more time but as of now not  very happy with it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all not something I would really purchase again</li>
            <li> The written and DVD instructions are a little different and very brief. I have used the product pretty consistently for about 2 months and can&#x27;t tell that it is making any real difference. I keep using it because I spent the money on it and want to see if usage over time produces any results.</li>
            <li> Love it and hope the results appear in a month.  No problem using it and follow directions. Hoping for the improvement.</li>
            <li> I purchased DermaWand, and used it faithfully as instructed for two months and my face isn’t nearly as wrinkled as the woman displayed on the DermaWand  box, after two months there was absolutely no change in my facial appearance at all, not even a little bit, yes, they took the  principle of how it works from the professional machines which can cost thousands of dollars and this toy is a micro fraction of  that, do you really think the DermaWand is as good?  those powerful machines  are used by qualified technicians, which are light years ahead and much more powerful  than this DermaWand toy, the only thing it is good for is to put money in the pockets of the person who makes this piece of junk, I read some bad press on this item, but I foolishly wanted to believed it would work for me anyway, I got what I deserved, believe it or not, companies depend a great deal on the placebo affect those who want to believe will gaze into a mirror and see what they want to see, also I&#x27;m sure companies will go to Amazon and write their own reviews and make it look like it&#x27;s coming from the general public. Take it from me, don’t waste your time and money on this piece of junk, and if you want to do it right, go to a professional, I wound up throwing mine in the garbage where it belongs!</li>
            <li> In just a few uses, I could see and feel the difference in my skin. Especially the puffiness under my eyes and sagging skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really improve the way your skin looks. I love it! The appearance around my eyes looks much better now.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!!!!  I am 55 &amp; have started seeing larger pores in my t-zone &amp; saging around the jaw line &amp; after 2 treatment I was seeing cleaner pores &amp; less saging.  The other area of concern for me was around the lip area....wrinkles above the lip...yuck, I hope with continued use they will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift but I was told that it is reall good and that skin feels good.</li>
            <li> Been using at least 3 to 4 times a week and honestly I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I paid $118.00 for the whole package as depicted in the pictures and description but did not get the Skin Mist, Hydra Support, Hydra Infusion!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can buy from other sellers the same product for $99.00. I feel totally ripped off. Now The product is unavailable.</li>
            <li> Did not like how it felt on my skin and saw no improvement! Would not recommend this product. Very time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> too much time involved and it did&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NO PROFFESSIONAL DERMAWAND,THERE ISN&#x27;T RESULTS.</li>
            <li> super simple to use ,affordable and i already fill the difference in only one week of use. thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I love it, this device really works.&lt;br /&gt;I  recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I bought this one for a family member.&lt;br /&gt;Who can&#x27;t believe I have no wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within the first 2 weeks of using it on settings 1 - 5.  It took the puffiness from my cheeks and has made my skin tighter (I am 50).  I use it on my neck as well and can tell the skin is tighter.  I have skipped a few days here and there but my skin still looks good.  I would highly recommend this -- I&#x27;ve been using for about a month.  I don&#x27;t use the cream that came with it -- I use my own Clinique moisturizer.  I use it at night and morning for about 4 - 5 days a week.  I find a good time to do it is when I use my weekly teeth whitener -- then I do it for 30 minutes straight.</li>
            <li> Didnt do adarn thing to improve my skin</li>
            <li> None of these products work as they claim. It comes down to how you personally feel about it. I will stick to my regular skin cream</li>
            <li> thanks your product is awesome hope to make buissiness in the near future sincerely gilbert thanks again for your great product</li>
            <li> There is a little difference, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for results.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it works, but I feel my skin better. And looks younger than before....My skin now is smooth</li>
            <li> I returned it. I probably didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results. After 2 weeks I didn&#x27;t see any results, so I returned it. I think I read you need to use it for at least a month, but I didn&#x27;t think there would be a change in another 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Looking for the results still I have not seen much but my face has a better jonger look ing ill give it more time</li>
            <li> Surprise!!  I SEE REAL CHANGES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have First hand experience of Medically Approved High frequency radio waves to TREAT  Chronic SPINE Pain ,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it on my spine used though inserted needles to my spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetically speaking the  Derma wand , is a \\&quot; hand held , home device u can use daily, as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;  ITs DONE A GREAT JOB of doing what it says and more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALMSOT SENT BACK W OUT USING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st know, there is the  PROFESSIONAL Version of Derma wand that Derma wand was likely based on its science and procdure. done only&lt;br /&gt;in a dermatology or a  \\&quot; PLASTIC SURGOEN&#x27;s \\&quot; Office, as Outpatient , no down time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DRs use the Professional Grade Higher Frequency Machine Procedure , known as  \\&quot;Thermage\\&quot; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: HOW Does  DERMA WAND  measure up?&lt;br /&gt;I have  the derma wand , i bought here over a  month  ago, ive used it now One mo. for 2 x  day @ 4 min each&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following are my results: (in past, I&#x27;ve had Botox, fillers, microdermabrasion at plastic surgeons and total laser resurfacing on my face 2 x , that looked like  I was in a fire.&lt;br /&gt;I had acne scars and laser removed them, except 2 chicken pox scar on left cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Derma wand  on neck and chest too m though I don&#x27;t have sun /age spots on chest of face , i dont go In sun .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has not had BOTOX , Fillers or any thing for 4 years  when I started use of my new Derma wand .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my experience and results that  I and Others SEE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  From my profile side,  under chin ,my neck and jaw is nicely well defined, tighter it was not sagging prior BUT corners of my mouth were down turned.  Now corners are leveled out, SO I do not  look sad or pouting as I have even  as a a kid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; YES I pay attention to lifting mouth corners that bothered me all life and now my lips are level at edges , NOT down turned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  3 Deep-ish wrinkles on my forehead (that go away w/ BOTOX, they have plumped and lessened ,  at the outer edges..those wrinkles r gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the FINE lines around eyes, above  brows etc , mouth or areas all over randomly ALL have smoothed and I don&#x27;t see them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  NASAL LABIAL  lines (  )  around nose to  mouth are REALLY plumped OUT!!...WOW&lt;br /&gt;( it now appears as they did when i did have FILLER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT looks at Plumped as it would about 3 months after Filler would start to wear down, THAT IS A HUGE HUGE DEAL !!  AND DIFFERNCE!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT doesn&#x27;t go away the next day either,  results I am speaking to ARE still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pay about  $700 for Fillers for these results and any beginning check smile lines I was just starting to see w/out makeup ARE GONE, BUT you need to work those areas that ARE issues to you over and over w DERMA WAND and more than the 4 strokes in each area they suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KNOW tolerance of your face before you start.  My face had gone thru 2 full face laser  treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do home microdermabrasion  2x a month with home machine called NU BRILLIANCE ,which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Around my orbital bones and fine eye lines,  if i smile hard , I do have eye wrinkling, bUT no wrinkles if i don&#x27;t smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking close there are faint lines starting and I use ARGAN oil doing DERM WAND use in the A.M, which drives moisture into the skin leaves a glow and add SPF and thats it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also use DR Copeland&#x27;s Ere REwind cream 2x day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned of DR MICHELLE Copeland  on ABC news , when she did a live  DEMO with audience person of  THERMAGE , u can Google the scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She sells her own great skin products and 2 mos. ago on her site , I bought Rewind eye serum and REWIND night serum I love both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, i use the REWIND serum with Derma Wand , I know it has quickened my results GREATLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fine eye lines and fine line above brown or on nose bridge any where, eye puffiness under eyes from meds, The  Derma wand has tightened ALL OF IT, and gotten rid of my fine lines , i started on top lip line and it will enlarge your lips for about 6 hrs after but fine lines are fading !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I use up close mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** OK the BIG TEST !!!!  THE PINCH TEST OF LOOSE SKIN ON FACE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  I used to be able TO pinch a bit of skin on upper cheek bones, and on side of my mouth PRIOR to  DERMA wand ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER 5 wks, I NOW CANNOT Pinch extra skin, nor at top of Cheeks or at mouth jaw areas!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, FACE skin is so much Tigher, Cheek bones are well defined and skin ELASTIN is back !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMALL chicken pox mark i had on cheek is Plumped out and a Surgone SCARRED My FACE during LASER proedure that forend a line next to my nose on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked that SCAR he made SO MCH wih the TAP OFF ON STYLE I WROTE OF and the SCAR AFTER 10 YEARS is 95% GONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAKEUP COVERS IT and the PINK COLOR IS now normal skin tone so it doenst need coamouflaging. !!

Im get red faced becasue im not that girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DERMA WAND has removed PROBLEMS I LEARNED TO  cover up and get Botox and Fillers to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW i will go back for BOTOX TO SEAL THE RESULTS that DERMA WAND Gave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By getting BOTOX now my DR said , while skin is at its best, Botox will LOCK the Results in , take any lines or left over slight wrinkles completely away like smooth glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DERMA WAND DOES THAT , it will plump out and fade issues you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEENS should use it, the  oxygen  makes  collagen re build probably kills the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I clean tip with alcohol wipe after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used Derma wand  in a  Touch on/ Touch off effect ,if you do that i found it makes the Derma wand \\&quot;snapping effect.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;more intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That snapping or radio wave snap, is what you want from Derma wand , it causes the under skin layer to  u get produce collagen elastic setc and rush blood to treated area why  skin gets pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blood rush to treated areas bringing PLASMA to fill in treated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**PLASMA  for those not Familiar with TRENDS in  Facial procedures , is called a \\&quot;VAMPIRE FACIAL\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: A \\&quot;Vampire Facial\\&quot;  DR uses a  device like stamper filled with fine needles that are pressed in to face ,  it bleeds ,puncturing the face in tiny holes that then cause injury in a controlled DR office, then the PATIENT&#x27;S BLOOD Plasma gets  injected into patients FACE .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER healing time TONS OF NEW COLLAGEN is Produced and  reveals youthful appearances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snapping of the Derma wand device,  in a less invasive way, also causes skin to  produce lost collagen&lt;br /&gt;and nutrient rich blood and plasma that flows down the body , not UP To The Face unless procedures are done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like Derma wand and in office Dr procedures, that will reveal a more youthful face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR ME now, Derma wand will prolong the need to do more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I will NEVER stop using my Derma wand because it does deliver results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*To Lift EYES:  holding device at Arch of the EYEBROW to create a \\&quot;LIFTED BROW\\&quot;  is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since I don&#x27;t have a drooping  upper lids yet, i cant get enough skin to draw up the brow, so i start just under my brow hair,  move toward hair line above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep holding the device at the arch of each brow,  NOW my Eyes  ARE MORE Opened and i can tell( before /after pics)&lt;br /&gt;EYE makeup and  lids are much firmer and lids skin don&#x27;t move as i apply shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!  ALSO its&#x27; Literature speaks about \\&quot;should your face PEEL etc??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  I haven&#x27;t Peeled at all, but then again , I used months of glycolic peels and I have NOT HAD ANY Peeling prior to ever using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  there is a VISIBLE DIFFERNCE Others CAN SEE AND have remarked on .. EVEN ASKED IF I GOT WORK DONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  WHO ME ?  BUT , you look so Alive , Glowing, Younger, Your skin is flawless \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  Your FACE IS SO SMOOTH?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, I tell them THE TRUTH..  I tell them  \\&quot; Well, I have a MAGIC WAND\\&quot;!  (my Derma Wand my secret!)</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable tightening of my jawline and skin in general.  It hasn&#x27;t really done much yet for my deeper wrinkles but I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
            <li> I have dropped weight after eliminating gluten from my diet.  This little device is actually preventing wrinkles and sagging.  Easy&lt;br /&gt;and pleasant to use.  I would recommend this kit for anyone that is in the process of weight reduction.</li>
            <li> works wells. I received my product.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month now, and no visible results.  Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> it works !!! nothing wrong found - need to learn how to use it carefully and give results.... thank you</li>
            <li> i have used derma wand for more than 6 years now. Although i have tried other similar devices including derma needle roller, D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct, and even Tria age-defying Lasor, i found Derma Wand being the most beneficial and economical facial tool.  Here is why,  Although i like my derma needle roller, it needs to be sanitized  after every use, and gets dull after a few months. The cost of using a high quality Korean made one gets too expensive, having it renew every few moths.    D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct is less expensive than Derma Wand but the sparks zap on you like crazy, even into your eyes.  Tria age-defying lasor  darkens age spots and sun spots. They said continue using the treatment, spots should be lightened after being darken, but sorry, my skin became so ugly with no positive results.  The down time is just too long, i gave up.   If you experiencing dry skin after using derma wand, apply a thin layer of vitamin a with e oil by Derma e before the treatment. You can also use a facial steamer to steam your face afterwards,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken 3 wks, but I can actually see some changes around my eyes, maybe that&#x27;s because I only have fine lines there but at least I can see some positive results.  I have larger &amp; deeper lines around my mouth and it&#x27;s harder to tell if there&#x27;s any improvement.  I will continue to use the wand and the booklet does say tha deeper lines take longer. I am encouraged that at least I have some results and I can truthfully say that 99% of creams, lotions, etc. have little or no effect unless you&#x27;re younger than 35.  I am double that so as long as it&#x27;s working I&#x27;ll keep using it.  You do need to do it twice a day and that 5 min a day it total b.s. It takes about 45 min to do the whole regimine properly.  I&#x27;m sure if you&#x27;re younger, it will work better and faster than it has for me, but something is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and the results are fabulous</li>
            <li> This product did minimize my pores.  I think it also reduced the rate at which my facial hair grew in.  So, it probably does work as advertised.  I have very little time left in a day to actually use something like this.  I passed it on to a family member who loves it.</li>
            <li> I use the derma wand every day and it really does help with my acne issues. I let my mother use it and she ended up purchasing one for herself.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every day, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this product. Unfortunately, the glass part of the wand broke, so I need to get a hold of their customer service to see if I can replace it. I need to this ASAP, because she is calling me everyday about it. Tried calling customer service today 11/26, but they&#x27;re closed. I guess I will have to try again next week.</li>
            <li> This Derma wand is wonderful. Just after 3 days of using I can already see a difference. So easy to use. Love it  !!</li>
            <li> I have used the dermawand for several years before my first one expired.  This is my second dermawand and I know the product works to help firm and invigorate my facial muscles.  I really have made it a part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am a skeptic when it comes to many skin care products.  I am 63 and I don&#x27;t expect to look 25 again, but I have been using this for a few weeks and I do see a difference in my skin.  My face looks lifted and many of the fine lines have vanished.  The deeper lines are still there but I did just start using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether I look like I had a surgical face lift, but I do look younger, less saggy and my skin seems to look brighter.  All in all I&#x27;d say this product is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> So far so good time will tell</li>
            <li> Works well after just 1 week!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the Dermawand works on my wrinkles. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. Not only that, it adds more wrinkles. It made my face skinny. I already have small face. I did not like my face in the mirror. After first week, I stopped using it. If it is possible, I&#x27;d like to return it It is not something cheap. Briefly, I did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> I tried emailing about product 3 times. Never got an answer. Is the bulb supposed to light up? Mine doesn&#x27;t. There is no tingling feeling that video says there will be.. No results what so ever.  As far as I,m concerned this was a waste of money !!  Need a refund.</li>
            <li> Derma wand definitely made my skin soft and blemishes disappear very quickly.  I am trying to have patience in hopes that it will also reduce pore size and lessen wrinkles a bit. I have had it for 30 days now so I will continue to use. At least my skin feels better.</li>
            <li> her heavy eyelids started to lift and hey mouth wrinkles were sort of fading. however shes real lazy and stopped using this after two weeks. putting all the creams and sprays on her face was a bit boring but hey if it works why not?&lt;br /&gt;I use this now, but its behind my mirror and i forget it exists. i am only 22 years old, but have smile lines and a turkey neck.&lt;br /&gt;dont overuse this like i did bc my face and neck felt like they were on fire after!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice a day for @ two weeks now. I actually believe I can see a difference myself but not sure if I am just being optimistic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it faithfully for a month now and I don&#x27;t see any changes to my wrinkles or the texture of my skin. Will give it another month and I&#x27;ll send it back!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-fifties, with dry skin prone to rosacea.  I have been using Derma wand for three months, and I am very happy with the results; my skin is tighter, laugh lines are not as pronounced. Derma wand works great on under eye area; the small bags which started to show have vanished. I do use coconut oil as lubricant.</li>
            <li> No miracles but not enough time to see if it really works</li>
            <li> I use the product for about 10 days no one seems to notice the difference. except for one individual that went on vacation for 10 days. he asked me what I had been doing. he said I look rested and fresh. so the results or gradual but very good.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a while and didn&#x27;t notice any difference, so I quit using it.</li>
            <li> too much money, I tried did not do any good the device was low frequency.  Wishful thinking, did not do me any good.</li>
            <li> This product is super Great . Makes your skin youthful and look fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It really works. My dermatologist was amazed at the difference my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;After, using this product for 1 week.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Would recommend to anyone without problem. This was for a gift but the comments was good.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month.  Don&#x27;t see any change.  Not worth the money and definitely wouldn&#x27;t spend more.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast delivery! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Took a picture of my face.  Used this religiously for a month.  Took another picture.  No change.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money as claimed benefits never manifested themselves.  I guess if you can afford to buy some air time and move some units, anyone can sell snake oil...</li>
            <li> i am a male in my 40&#x27;s i know alot about home devices. this wand works great with any lotions or what I use is Bio OIl. The products that they give you with the wand are garbage. They are worthless.&lt;br /&gt; YOu just need a great lotion to glide the wand and a good  witch hazel toner after ward. it workes great after a clean scrubbing with my nutrisonic brush.&lt;br /&gt; i have noticed my sun spots disappearing my wrinkles between my eyes have diminished and over al skin texture is glowing. All these reviews complain about the smell it smells like a dry cleaner and it even states so , So get over it. it is a clean oxygenating smell. BIG DEAL. now the sagging skin on my neckline that is going to need a stronger device. I always use the machine on HIGH because i am a man and our skin is denser and can handle it. I do turn it down around the eyes. but for the 100 bucks it works.  it will not give you a face lift but it will make your crows feet and fine lines and  make your skin glow WORTH EVERY PENNY you just have to know what you are doing!</li>
            <li> I have had derma wand for over 2months.  Very disappointed.  Could not see any improvements of my fine lines under my eyes.  I guess , if it is too good to be true.  !!!  Sorry I purchased this item</li>
            <li> Love it... can see a different in my eye lids and have only been using a week..  That was my main area of concern..  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product September 7, 2014. It is January 5, 2015 and it no longer works. I wish I had paid more attention to the return policy. I am very disappointed. I also wish I had purchased this from a vendor that believed their product enough to gauruntee it for a generous period of time. This is the first time this has occurred in my long history of buying from Amazon :(</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel good, but if you are looking to see less wrinkles, you need not try this for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and have been dealing with cystic acne for over a year.  Dermatologist has been prescribing topical treatments, but they haven&#x27;t been working.  In fact, nothing I have purchased to help has worked (prescriptions, over-the-the counter and home made remedies).  I went to a salon and had one of these treatments done and was very impressed.  Found this tool on Ebay for $75 and couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  A new cyst popped up on my face two days ago, and this device has already dried it up!  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a very long time.  If you&#x27;re dealing with acne and haven&#x27;t had success with anything else, order this!!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and they loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I can already see the change on her skin it works</li>
            <li> Did not see results right away, however my pores do seem to be smaller and that&#x27;s a big plus. I&#x27;m not sure if it works as well  on dark skin as well as it does on light skin.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few weeks but it makes my skin feel fresh and rejuvenated.  I try to use it every day and can tell my face is a little more perky.  I plan to keep using it and hope to see more improvements within a few more weeks.  I think you have to give it time and keeping using it faithfully.</li>
            <li> The product is still in the box. I cannot rate it as I haven&#x27;t tried it as yet. This reminds me to take it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my face looked after the first treatment!  It glowed and I looked well rested, brows were higher, puffiness under eyes diminished.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like in 30 days.  This product is well worth the money, especially as the kit came with a pre-treatment cleanser and a facial cream.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Good I have not seen results yet.it is to soon .</li>
            <li> Great product, it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Dermawand for about 3 weeks now.  but only once a day, instead of the 2 times a day as suggested by the manufactor.  I do not see much results in the fine lines that I have, but I have seen a wonderful improvement&lt;br /&gt;in the size of my pores,  And I believe it has helped with newly formed pimples to heal faster.  So for me, this has been a useful purchase.</li>
            <li> Rest in piece derma wand.  It&#x27;s was a short fruitless life...</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is working.  Only used it three days so far.  Will post again after a few weeks and let you know.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I love it yet as I just haven&#x27;t used it enough. I do have a pretty recent stitch area on my hand that is closed up, but still very red. I&#x27;ve been using this device on it for about two weeks and i gotta admit, the redness is fading (much faster than my really pale Irish skin would normally do). Going to keep going with this solution and hope for the best. There are certainly other old scars that may benefit from this too, but right now, I&#x27;m just going to assume it won&#x27;t have supreme effect on old scars, but may make them a bit less visible...</li>
            <li> i think it works but i cant be sure till i try it for at least a month so ya</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was skeptical when I purchased this product, however I have used the product for almost thirty days now and I can see an incredible difference in my skin.  My friends have also commented on how good my skin looks.  My face seems to look more refreshed, tighter, younger, smooth, and clearer looking skin.  I have know idea how this product works all I know is that it does work.  It is defintely worth the money.[[ASIN:B004R6NYGK Dermawand Deluxe Retail Kit with 4 Derma Vital Skincare Products - Derma Wand For Wrinkles  Puffy Eyes  Saggy Skin  Non-Surgical Face Lift]]</li>
            <li> and sure beats the price of salon laser therapy.  I have done both and this is a great product for maintenance.</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY IMPROVEMENTS BEEN USING TWICE A DAY FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW THE SKIN FACIAL LOTIONS ARE GOOD BUT THE IMPROVEMENT ON FINE LINES AND MINIMIZING PORE SIZE IS NOT EVIDENT AND THATS PUTTING IT NICELY JUST WAISTED 125.00 FOR VANITY OH WELL GO FIGURE THANK YOU SALLIE RAE</li>
            <li> The product was much bigger and less effective then my first buy. The cap is loose and not a good fit. Use the highest range and still I feel no results. I gave my old one which was a lot smaller and lighter to my Mom..and not sure which one I brought but It was not through this vendor. Wanted so many time to return it but got ride to the box that it came from. Lesson learned--keep your box! Guess I got a lemon 😤</li>
            <li> Good gadget to have but not a facelift! It definitely does stimulate and the hydra quench, lip product + mist helped me enough to justify the kit. Pre-face worthless</li>
            <li> Dermawand is wonderful! i&#x27;ve used it for a few days now and i love the way it stimulates my skin-it really is relaxing and the mild smell is nice, like fresh from the dry cleaner smell which does not linger. i can see and instant lifting effect to my eyebrows and am looking forward to the long term effect. The creams are nice-no fragrance which is important to me, hate smelly cosmetics! My skin feels fresh! i am 53 and have always taken good care of my sensitve skin, this device is such a treat!</li>
            <li> One of the best beauty product I ever purchased!!  Using it on a regular basis has really made a difference in removing wrinkles from around the eyes &amp; mouth.  I even lost the forehead frown lines. I started getting droopy cheeks &amp; even that subsided.  A friend of mine moved away &amp; see her only a few times a year &amp; when she saw me this past winter thought I had surgery.  She was totally amazed when I told her my little secret.  I would highly urge the use of this product, you too will benefit from using the Derma Wanda.....</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  the instructions are easy to understand however it is best to view the CD first before the pamphlet.  Following the directions to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in the firmness of my skin.  Very disappointed in this product.  Hope the manufacturer takes this feedback seriously and makes improvements.</li>
            <li> Yes, the results are temporary but it works a lot better than the lotions and potions that promise temporary results.  My face and neck looks ten years younger immediately.  I would order this product again and would definitely recommend it to my friends.  It even works on deep wrinkles.  I wouldn&#x27;t order the products that ship with it; but substituting my own products really gave a dynamite result.  Wish I had time to do it twice a day, but just once seems, for me, to work very well.</li>
            <li> love how it stimulates my skin, however, i&#x27;m not really seeing the results that were promised.  Hopefully after another week, i will feel different about this product.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd derma wand. The first one I had fell on the floor and the top of the wand smashed. The first one seemed to have so much more power. This new one definitely has a weaker current. I had expected it to be an improvement over the older one. Maybe something is wrong with this?</li>
            <li> After reading all kinds of good reviews online and that of Dr. Oz, I thought I would give this a try.  I was going to follow the directions to a T for a full month and see if I got results.  Unfortunately, I only used it 3 times and each time got a dull headache that lasted for hours.  I thought it might be a fluke after the first time, but after the 2nd and 3rd times I knew it was the Dermawand.  I have since googled &amp;#34;Dermawand and headache&amp;#34; and have found others who had the same reaction, although I don&#x27;t think it is a common complaint.</li>
            <li> I was really skepticle...at first only. Now I am sold on this!! At first I was only using on the lowest level in all areas of my face. Once I turned it up (except the eye area and just above my lips) I saw results. At first my pores shrunk. One of my eyebrows is lower than the other, but the Dermawand really helped raise both to an even level. Yes that is temporary if you don&#x27;t use it regularly. I did not take it on a 6 day trip and I found out quickly what a difference it makes to my appearance. I&#x27;m back to using it about 3 minutes am &amp; pm w/my moisturizer. Just this morning my mouth fell open when I realized the fine crow&#x27;s feet had disappered. Deep ones still there, but I&#x27;ll take it. I am 64, so maybe I can&#x27;t expect miracles, but I will continue. Wish I had taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture. There was a coupon for $50 off another for a friend. I may use it for a gift.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dermawand almost two weeks and I can already see a difference in my skin. It is glowing and looks healthier. I use it religiously every morning and every night. I use the highest level except around my eyes and on my lips. I am even using it on my thinning hair. We&#x27;ll see how that goes. After the first week I am so pleased with how my skin looks that I am not using make-up, just moisturizer when I go out. I am 61 and I have always felt that the older you get the more make-up just makes you look older, so I am very pleased. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference in lines and wrinkles, but my skin is definitely feeling tighter. I am willing to put in the time to use this as I am happy with the effect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product .....use it twice/day for best results!</li>
            <li> I am happy so far with the overall product and skin care kit. I have not seen any results yet but it is too soon for that.</li>
            <li> I am very much into looking as good as possible but found I could not keep this up. Also there was the feeling of a drag on my skin unless really, really creamed. Probably my fault but tough to use for me.</li>
            <li> I use the dermawand at night after I&#x27;ve applied my night cream. I think my skin looks brighter and is more moisturized. I do notice a difference if I skip a few days ...not as glowing. I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> The dermawand it good, and the products are also.  I do have a complaint.  The directions are not clear.  The dvd they sent was just a basic one, and not the one on described in the ad.  I had called to get the other dvd.  The first time I called was a month ago, and they said they would send it that week.  I still have not received it.  I called again, and they said they were out.  After some discussion they said they would send it - I am not happy at all with their customer service, they did not handle the problem, and were rude.</li>
            <li> I tried the derma wand &amp; it didn&#x27;t do what it advertised it would do. Having to do this every day morning &amp; evening forever seemed too much for the results I didn&#x27;t get. I&#x27;m glad I bought it on amazon.com because I got a speedy refund! Thanks amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Useless hype. I got sucked in by advertising. Does nothing. I should have known better, but the ads were very convincing. Save your money and time.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter-in-law, and she reports that she absolutely loves it! So based on her enthusiasm, I&#x27;d say it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful as this wand can break blood vessels in your face.&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly at first till your skin gets use to this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using around my eyes and lips for three days now, and I can already see an improvement. I can&#x27;t believe the lines on my lips are disappearing. I was thinking about getting botox for lips not anymore. It does take a little patience, so if you don&#x27;t have any this product may not be for you. I use once a day before I go to bed for about 5min. for each section with my normal cleansing ritual. I&#x27;m only on level 2 until my skin builds up a tolerance, and I know if I continue to use my lines and puffiness will be gone. I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m still in the process of using it. I will give another review in about 3 weeks with the progress.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the infocommercials.  It was a waste of money and time.  Fifteen minutes a day did nothing, nada, so I amped it up to 20 minutes after two weeks.... still nothing.  Same-oh-wrinkles, no plumping of skin as the infocommercials promised.  I used it faithfully, daily, for 45 days - took pictures and.... no one, 13 friends and family members saw no difference, not only from the pictures but also from looking at my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap fix because you can&#x27;t afford laser from a plastic surgeon - don&#x27;t look here. I would recommend you save your money until you can talk to a plastic surgeon, many times they will offer a payment plan.  Better to pay a little more than to get stuck with a paper weight.  okay, it is pink.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister cause she fell in love with mine! It dose work! and fast and the more you us it the better it get!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  I used it faithfully for three weeks and saw no difference.&lt;br /&gt;Should have used my money skin care lotion.</li>
            <li> After using the derma wand for one week a friend asked me how much weight I had lost...because my face was tighter and thinner.  It really does work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect immediate gratification.  Continued use is the key.  So get a good lotion to use as the slide medium, set a routine and stick with it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was for muscle toning but it&#x27;s only for stimulating skin circulation.  I can give myself a facial massage to do that.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  After a quick initial use .... I received compliments on my skin from my co workers!  Noticed a difference in skin right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service after first receiving a defective wand .... they were helpful in replacing immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
            <li> It really works! I did not think it would work but it really really did &amp; does work! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Does not work as stated.</li>
            <li> Did not come with everything it said.  Cheap made.  Already had to send back to replace bulb - which of course is NOT covered by warranty.  You have to send a check for $25.00 to cover the \\&quot;shipping\\&quot; for them to send back to you - plus pay to ship it to them yourself.  Not a wise purchase.</li>
            <li> Came very fast and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I loved it! I have been using it since January of this year.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully using this product but have not seen any results. very dissatisfied and dissappointed with what seemed to be a nice alternative to cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> Great kit, works like stated.</li>
            <li> Just awesome, feel younger every day.</li>
            <li> Love it, it actually works!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it. Lots of negative blogs online but we will give it a positive try.</li>
            <li> Fantastic purchase, works great! My fine lines are disappearing!!!!</li>
            <li> very good...and faster delivery...thanks</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even bother buying it just a waste of moneyI&#x27;ve had it for 3 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t done any noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about buying it for a couple of years now. It is a very good product. I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to move the wand over my face, even with the cream they supplied.  I get more tingling from my rotating scrub brush than from this wand.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Not a &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; reviewer and skeptical. I purchased Dermawand on Amazon because I knew the return would be easy. I am 53, light complexion. I was beginning to show lines around my eyes, lower lids and mouth lines. Pore size was increasing and some small discolorations in skin tone. I mention all of this to help those reading the reviews. Did a lot of research on this to make sure it was safe. Watched the dvd and had the pamphlet handy as I began the first use. EASY to apply. I used this product with my own moisturizer because I am sensitive to some ingredients. Began at level 3 and have increased to level 7 except around eyes.  I am amazed.....when my husband says he can see a difference in my skin and a firmness in my face I am a believer. He does not offer compliments if not due! The first thing I noticed was the change in the firmness and shrinking of pores. This occurred after 3 days of application using once a day. After two weeks my lids are higher, lines around mouth almost gone and discoloration of skin and tone is so improved that I could go without makeup! It even helped heal the minor break outs I had on my chin! I use the dermawand every other day in the mornings. I cannot believe this works and look forward to continued improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift. Recipient seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Derma Wand makes my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Derma Wand for a month now and I don&#x27;t see one bit of difference. I will try it for another month.</li>
            <li> Worked three times!!!</li>
            <li> It burned my face it may be the cream. But I had to stop using it till my face held .</li>
            <li> The Lady a loves it!!</li>
            <li> I use the Derma Wand twice a day while watching T.V.I lost 18 lbs. in the last 5 months and my face has paid the consequences.Of course I am retired and have more time on my hands than others, but if you use the Derma Wand faithfully ones a day I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see results. I give my face a real workout with Derma Wand by using it for more&lt;br /&gt;than one hour each time and I am seeing results.It is a lot cheaper than going to the Spa and paying $200.00 or $300.00 like I used to do.</li>
            <li> Is a little tedious to do the treatment in the morning, so I only use it once a day.  It doesn&#x27;t show the improvement yet, but I like the way my face is coming along.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and I feel refreshed when I am finished.  The time needed to complete the treatment is short but I feel very effective.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised on TV and was very skeptical about it.  I read good and bad reviews and decided to try it for myself.  After one month, I have grown to love this product because it feels good on my skin.  I look forward to using it as well as seeing the glow of its use.</li>
            <li> Nevera hoy the nevó slimmer Theatro I país for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product really lives up to the standard of the advertisement ,I,m still yo see any improvement</li>
            <li> I have had my Dermwand for 6 weeks now and see noticeable improvement.  I have no complaints about the skin care products that came with it although I read a lot of negative reviews on those but they seem decent.  I did follow the DVD and it did take many viewings and pausing in the beginning so it was more than the 5 minutes the ad suggested it was more like 15 minutes.  But now that I feel more comfortable and capable I do it for about 3 minutes in the morning and 3 minutes at night, this is easier and still gives results and personally I&#x27;m not that patient about standing in front of the mirror, I do that circular motion upward around the face one time and then I go right to the chin and jaw, then nose to ear following the cheek bone, then the neck to chin  and save the eyes for last.,  I did get some Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic acid since I had read some good reviews from dermawand users.  I am going to say it only works if you use it daily and it&#x27;s not an over night magic cure,  but there is definitely improvement in sagging lines from the nose to chin and under my jaw.  I&#x27;m 54 and wanted to slow down the aging process a bit.  My skin is a little read after each treatment but that quickly goes away.  My bottom line is that I am satisfied and wished I purchased this in my 40&#x27;s!  PS. it has reduce the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> Used the dermawand twice a day for a month and it did absolutely nothing.  Also the skin products that come with it are junk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very small area to work with and takes a very long time to use making it tediously slow.</li>
            <li> It is not what l expected, there is no difference. If u have really sensitive skin the creme is terrible for you</li>
            <li> Great product. Gets the blood flowing. My skin Is pretty tight but when I turned 40 and noticed my cheeks didn&#x27;t look the same. I started to used my machine and in a 1 week I saw a difference.  I was only doing this process once a day. If you have alot of sagging then please follow the instructions.  The exercises are key.</li>
            <li> Works and seems t o stimulate my skin.  That said I&#x27;m keeping the jury out on effectiveness as I&#x27;ve only had it 3 weeks.  I took before front and side selfies. After 6 weeks I&#x27;ll do it again and compare</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results. Diligence (using the wand twice a day) is the key. Those lines didn&#x27;t appear in a day; they aren&#x27;t going to disappear in a day! Noticeable difference!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and wait for results.</li>
            <li> I love the dermawand. I have waited to put in my review because I wanted to give it a fair chance to see if it made a difference. Yes, the dermawand definitely makes my face look more alive &amp; my skin glows. I have seen a great lifting effect on my nasal labial folds &amp; the 11 lines between eyes. Brought my eyes upward slant again. Also above the eyes although it is only temporary, but I&#x27;ll take that. I have noticed that the longer I use it, the longer the results last. It is definitely cumulative. I can really feel the higher frequencies. I don&#x27;t know why the negative reviews, but I believe that it takes at least one full month of regular use to give a product a fair chance. I did notice results almost immediately, especially the eye area lifted. The more I used it, the longer the results lasted. I am thrilled that I came across this device!!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day. I do see a difference. My flabby neck seems smaller and my marionette lines also seem smaller. I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t the 9 setting yet. I use about a 7. I like the after moisture riser.  Smells a little weird but u get use to it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me like shown on tv with the eye brow area-disappointed</li>
            <li> Gives me a healthy glow right after using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the website - would have been much cheaper to purchase from Amazon directly. The product is time consuming; takes longer than the 3-5 minutes each morning and each evening they advertised. It becomes very cumbersome. Despite this, I have used it for approx 2 months now faithfully. The only improvement I have noticed is the slight eye lift however it is not permanent and lasts a day at most and then the \\&quot;eye exercise\\&quot; with the derma wand must be performed again to acheive the result. It takes me approx 15-20 to go over my entire face as well as perform thw \\&quot;spa exercises\\&quot; they recommend with the derma wand.  For me, I just am not willing to commit to using it every morning and every night for the rest of my life for the minimal results I am experiencing. Overall, I would rate it a one star however gave it a two stars because I have noticed the slight but temporary eye lift.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, noticed tightness of skin  within first week in upper eye lids.  Use large amounts of face serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to see if I like this product  I haven&#x27;t got to use it a lot but so far I think it makes my skin rejuvenated and gives it a glow.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it did anything or not but it was worth a try and easy to send back.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet.</li>
            <li> I watched videos on this product for about a month on TV then decided to buy, all along knowing it was to good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;I was  a beauty operator and have worked with some eletralis items.  Anyway, I hoped it would work, it did nothing but plump up my face in the area that I used it, it did not take any lines away, just plumped.  My skin was red and I started to breakout.  I don&#x27;t know if it was from the creams or the wand itself.  I would not recommend it and have returned the product for a refund, but I have to pay for the shipping back to them.  That&#x27;s not right, it is within the 30 days.</li>
            <li> I have been only using it just for three weeks and So far I like it...we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
            <li> It broke within the second week I bought it.</li>
            <li> Yes it worked the first time...and only time I could use it . The lamp burst. The mechanism of action using muscle stimuli with low voltage isn&#x27;t hard to comprehend and I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but I was impressed with the &#x27;first time&#x27; use. Took me a little while to contact the seller. Offered to return it, pay for service of the wand.  Just didn&#x27;t want to have to buy a complete new wand. Got a reply back I would receive a call on the following Tuesday (with date of call listed). No call. This product would be effective with dedicated use. Can&#x27;t use something that&#x27;s broke. And don&#x27;t trust a seller with less than ethical practices. Would buy it again, however will look to other vendors/representatives.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month but I don&#x27;t see a big improvement yet.  I will continue to use it and relay another review at a later date if I see any change.  I&#x27;m  not giving it a full review until later.</li>
            <li> By the TV commercial on Dermawand, I was expecting to buy the miracle product for the century. It is about two months already I am using Dermawand and I don&#x27;t see any results yet. The pre-face skin care can&#x27;t be used by itself because the Dermawand tool doesn&#x27;t move how it is supposed to be. It sticks on your skin preventing the massage movements.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Dermawand on Amazon.com only a month ago. I was enjoying some good results, using as directed (2 x daily). Last week, it stopped working - as in the electrical stimulation feeling stopped working. Only the light is on and just very faintly glows. I took good care of product, did not drop it and put it in its bag after use. I had read of this same issue occuring in at least one other review prior to my purchase. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. I certainly don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new Dermawand every month. I did really like the Dermawand until it no longer functioned and for the price, it&#x27;s longevity is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet.  Iam the one that is bad the product arrived quickly. It is a nice item at a nice price</li>
            <li> Great product, bought it for my mother and she loves it</li>
            <li> Used it for 30 days, saw no difference in my skin. Also, took so long for the process. It&#x27;s okay I guess if you have nothing else to do.</li>
            <li> I just started using it, but it seems worth the price.  Ask me again in a month.</li>
            <li> Wasnt sure the infomercial was true but wanted to try it out. I&#x27;m happily surprised that it actually works as promised.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old &amp;#34;ozone machines&amp;#34; of the 50&#x27;s.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything for you, save your money and buy a good face cream</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, using it weekly, instructional directions were clear, trying on some problem areas, time will tell how well it works for that</li>
            <li> High Frequency is 100...... times better then this primitive \\&quot;skin care equipment\\&quot; and cost almost the same. If you want a good result... especially for acne, you have to buy HF, but not this \\&quot;for home use\\&quot; think....</li>
            <li> This is apparently an older version of the one being advertised on TV. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if I will experience the results advertised, but slightly disappointed in the product itself.</li>
            <li> I waited to review until I had used product for a while. I am very pleased. It does help skin tighten up and wrinkles are fading. If I had one criticism it is that it scared me at first. It sounds like a bug zapper. Lol. Now I do not even notice. Thanks Dermawand.</li>
