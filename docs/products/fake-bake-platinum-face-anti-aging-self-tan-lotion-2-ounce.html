            <li> The color does not last and it takes FOREVER to dry.  </li>
            <li> I use this on days when I don&#x27;t want to mess with actual foundation and it gives me some all over color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only caution you to wash your hands after use- or @ least apply regular, non-tanning lotion to your hands and arms to help it not streak on your hands.</li>
            <li> so must be very careful around eyebrows and hairline</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not neatly as dark</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this formula does show in your pores, unlike the original Fake Bake Face.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using the other from now on.</li>
            <li> or they are a little orange.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to dab it on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get it to build up this way.</li>
            <li> The unisex fake bake is a little drying to my face that is why I tried it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed cause I really like the Fake Bake that is for the body that comes in the brown bottle.</li>
            <li> I use fake bake on my body and usually put some on my face</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product did not see any tanning results</li>
            <li> This made me look weird and orange.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I broke out in a rash and started sweating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to make a mistake with and never looks orange.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great color and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product works relatively good. Color is DECENT. smell is BEYOND GROSS</li>
            <li> This made me look weird and orange. Disappointed cause I really like the Fake Bake that is for the body that comes in the brown bottle. But skip on this face product and use  the one for the body on the face. I did and looked way better.</li>
            <li> Love it, have been using for years, a very natural look.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it! This is the best product for evening facial complexion without turning you orange.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner on the market. Give it a try!!!! It&#x27;s almost impossible to make a mistake with and never looks orange.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars but didn&#x27;t for only one reason. This stuff gives a great tan, until you wash your face, then it&#x27;s gone! The only way to keep the tan for more than a day is to not wash your face with any kind of cleanser, just water. I can&#x27;t always do that, on days I wear makeup the cleanser is necessary. It&#x27;s hard to get it to build up this way. But other than that, the color is very natural, no orange in sight! Leaves skin smooth and silky. I just wish that it didn&#x27;t fade so quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- it&#x27;s not greesy or &#x27;orange&#x27; looking @ all... My face looks so healthy- just enough glow. I&#x27;d only caution you to wash your hands after use- or @ least apply regular, non-tanning lotion to your hands and arms to help it not streak on your hands. :D I&#x27;ll definately purchase again- I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Came i  tube not what it was supposed to be</li>
            <li> Good color but I don&#x27;t say that for the scent</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  Cannot even compare to the FakeBake Flawless spray I bought.  Should be discontinued and I should have requested my money back.  Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Smells great and feels great with a natural looking color!</li>
            <li> This stuff is gabage.  It colors EVERYTHING but your skin where you want it.  The color does not last and it takes FOREVER to dry.  Loreal Sublime Bronze works just as well, is cheaper and is easier to apply</li>
            <li> I use fake bake on my body and usually put some on my face so I thought I would order the face version. It&#x27;s not neatly as dark and it&#x27;s a cream so I&#x27;m not able to dab it on like I do the body spray with the mat (so my face looks bronzed and not just tanned). I think I will use it but I probably won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> I love the Fake Bake Products and decided to try this for the face. Unfortunately, I broke out in a rash and started sweating. So if you are super sensitive to products. I would try something else. I am going to try the regular Fake Bake for the face and see if that is better.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product did not see any tanning results</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this formula does show in your pores, unlike the original Fake Bake Face.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using the other from now on.</li>
            <li> This is my  favorite face tanner.</li>
            <li> Wash your hands and put on gloves or it will stain your hands a nice shade of brown. love it !</li>
            <li> This product works like it&#x27;s supposed to. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t streak.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give you super dark color right away, so you can achieve a good color that works for your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;IS NOT ORANGY. thank goodness. ;)</li>
            <li> The coloring for the most part is great, the smell inst so great, but i don&#x27;t think that really matters? The only thing I&#x27;m not feeling 100% is the lack of time the color lasts, but just my opinion. Give it a try - the price is pretty good for what you&#x27;re gonna find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> With silver hair I need a good moisturizing product that give me some extra color without looking artificial.  I have been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The unisex fake bake is a little drying to my face that is why I tried it.The gel comes out a brown cream tint which was different from the gel. I&#x27;m a natural blonde so must be very careful around eyebrows and hairline or they are a little orange. If anyone has suggestions on how to prevent that would be great.</li>
            <li> Works very well to tan, but it leaves you feeling hot and oily all day.</li>
            <li> I use this on days when I don&#x27;t want to mess with actual foundation and it gives me some all over color.  Easy to use,  wash hands thoroughly afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face tan since last summer.This is my second time purchasing as my first supply was running out .I do not wear foundation makeup and this helps me to have some color all year round ,as well as makes my skin look great .Its easy to use and dries very quickly .I love it .</li>
            <li> I love it.... and it has age reducing properties for your skin such as stem cells.  Also works VERY well and looks extremely natural.  Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was excellent, no problems and quick ship!!!&lt;br /&gt;Works quickly also, and the color guard can then be washed off.  Has absolutely NONE of that &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell!!!!</li>
            <li> has a good texture but my skin breaks out from it and the smell is pretty funky</li>
