            <li>I love love love....</li>
            <li>This is perfect for the teenage bathroom counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this carousel.</li>
            <li>Very tidy and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  </li>
            <li>My wife absolutely LOVES IT!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this organizer, and it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, although your brushes don&#x27;t fit in the middle, for me putting them in a bottom compartment of the carousel was perfect :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space, keeps items handy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of some pretty good, strong metal and</li>
            <li>I love how it spins so easily for easy access</li>

            <li>so items are easily found and reached.</li>
            <li>It holds quite a bit, and everything is organized and easy to reach.  </li>
            <li>No matter how I tried to keep things neat in drawers, I would find myself leaving make up out on the counter to find things easily.  </li>
            <li>Now I can locate even my smallest of items since it spins and contents of each compartment are easily seen.</li>
            <li>Turns easily.</li>
            <li>Great Christmas present to help organization for a grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to get to my makeup now while its in the compartments in this carousel.</li>
            <li>but I actually liked it better white; nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>but  it held my brushes just fine</li>
            <li>I bought a second one just hours after the first one arrived , because it was so perfect for my crowded bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I love how it swivels and it is very pretty on my counter.</li>
            <li>Would love if this came in multiple colors :) helps organize my makeup better and keeps my bathroom clean and tidy</li>
            <li>It is also user friendly and convenient and easily stored.</li>
            <li>but looks great on white furniture.</li>
            <li>All my cosmetics fit in it and it keeps my vanity from looking cluttered.</li>
            <li>Spins smoothly.</li>
            <li>This holds so much of my make up without taking up a lot of space, the carousel is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>in all its nice but not for what I really needed,which was to organize my cosmetics neatly.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) For me, this was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It spins really smoothly and seems well made.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how good the quality is.</li>
            <li>it allows for all of my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to be right at hand.. and the tiers are just what the doctor ordered:)</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>This cosmetic carousel does a fantastic job at keeping my makeup and beauty products organized and easily accessible.  </li>
            <li>This is literally the perfect little organizer!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to organize my makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product!</li>
            <li>This is such a neat and handy product!  </li>
            <li>helped to clean up bathroom counter</li>
            <li>they&#x27;ll fall right out!</li>
            <li>The Carousel is very convenient, holds a lot of make-up, it is easy to get to- and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great organizer, but I wish the center had a cup for makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>This organizer really simplifies things - much more than a stationery organizer could</li>
            <li>it hold so many things that I had out and in two dif make up bags, not it&#x27;s very organized.</li>
            <li>It saves so much space on my counter top.</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to anyone that wants to have everything handy and organized, especially when you are rushing and you quickly put it away!</li>
            <li>I can fit quite a bit in each area and it fits right into the corner of my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s perfect on my makeup desk and it&#x27;s great for minimizing clutter of smaller makeup products!</li>
            <li>I also like that it is a carousel, and I can quickly locate items by turning it.</li>
            <li>It is a good start to get organized but a few more steps needed</li>
            <li>Love my new caddy.</li>
            <li>I love this cosmetic carousel, I have it on my bathroom sink and it holds and organizes all of my daily use products for quick, easy access.</li>
            <li>It easily holds all I need to get ready for the day or evening.</li>
            <li>I am able to keep my makeup in a smaller area and grab just what I want easily.  </li>
            <li>A bit small for the items to fit in but otherwise very handy and sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is a great organizer but the picture is a little deceiving.</li>
            <li>was worth.  </li>
            <li>Soon after, the price dropped to $23 and it is well worth that.</li>
            <li>but I fit all and more of my daily make up</li>
            <li>Turns nice, holds several items well.</li>
            <li>Useful everyday...every day.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s worth a lot.</li>
            <li>but it still so useful and helpful.</li>
            <li>I dont feel it was worth 25.00 and the price should be lowered.  </li>
            <li>takes up little space and very handy</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as it states, easily spins and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It spins easily and keeps stuff organized that would normally clutter the counter.</li>
            <li>and keeps my makeup right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hold very large jars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at keeping things organized on my vanity, everything from eye-make up, to lip products, small face creams, even my contacts and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit small, and the colour isn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
            <li>It holds lots of stuff and, surprisingly, takes up little space.</li>
            <li>Came back to this one and glad I did.</li>
            <li>I searched forever for somehting to organize my most used daily cosmetics and found this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to get my makeup organized.</li>
            <li>Love this carousel, has just enough space for everything you need!</li>
            <li>Finally, I have found something to use on my counter top that is vertical to hold my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a small area, use it in my tiny bathroom and saves lots of space....</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I do wish that the space between the top and bottom bins was bigger.  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured and seems well made.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that it is functional in the way it spins around -- it will be useful to keep my jewelry straight, so I will keep it.  </li>
            <li>I love it, finally I organized my cosmatics</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s bigger and more cart on it...</li>
            <li>really like it!</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY as pictured and described.</li>
            <li>It has six total baskets with three on top and three on bottom.</li>
            <li>however I should note to double check dimensions before purchasing and make sure they fit your products properly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something cute for my long bathroom counter where I could store q-tips, hair bands, and make-up</li>
            <li>One basket can easily hold several tubes of mascara, eyeliner, lipgloss, and lipstain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;overall, a nice addition to my make up mess.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>It is so nice to find my makeup with a little twerle.</li>
            <li>That was a little frustrating, but once I got it, my lipsticks, concealers, and mascaras fit perfectly in it.</li>
            <li>I really like the carousel</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>but she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Very well designed.</li>
            <li>very tiny,dissapointed</li>
            <li>I never pay this much for something like this.</li>
            <li>It saves so much space in her bathroom.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is a carousel</li>
            <li>My whole life I have \\&quot;spread</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and holds ALOT.  </li>
            <li>None of my hairbrushes fit in the middle.</li>
            <li>Very efficient way to hold my make-up</li>
            <li>It very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>The shelves are a bit warped so the makeup does not stand up straight, however I just lay them on their sides and have no problems.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would also make another larger size because this really comes in handy and a larger size would work for some of the lotions I have.  </li>
            <li>This really helped.</li>
            <li>I thought this was very well made and have appreciated it every day since it arrived.  </li>
            <li>It holds more than I expected.</li>
            <li>This is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and no need to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It really helped me organize my makeup</li>
            <li>I really like the carousel and the quality</li>
            <li>Very posh looking.</li>
            <li>I can fit my entire collection of makeup in this one organizer.</li>
            <li>This is very helpful with organizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take up a fair amount of counter space, so if you don&#x27;t have a larger sink you might use it on your dresser or some other table.</li>
            <li>Love this little organizer...not as big as I expected, but I&#x27;m still able to chock it full of items.  </li>
            <li>Unless you have a comb that has a long skinny handle it will fit.</li>
            <li>I love this cosmetic carousel, it works well for all my cosmetic, just the right size for my counter top and no more mess.</li>
            <li>It fits all of my everyday items and allows me to easily get to what I need!</li>
            <li>It is larger than I thought, but for the most part it definitely helps eliminate the clutter.</li>
            <li>but then the area that would have a handle (Middle top) is also some &#x27;drop in&#x27; holes for brushes or such.  </li>
            <li>Because it turns so well and holds so much, I&#x27;m going to buy a few more for scrapbooking supplies.</li>
            <li>It cleared up a lot of counter space and allows me quick access to items I use daily.</li>
            <li>Holds heaps of product, just make sure your brushes are tall enough for the middle section.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I just feel the price was too high for this product.</li>
            <li>The middle section is not that spacious to fit brushes but there is a slot sort of that can easily hold a few longer eye makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a little counter top organization.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it for cosmetics, but with a little imagination it could be used for craft rooms, kitchen pantry, etc.</li>
            <li>I say this because in the picture it shows hair brushes can fit in the center.</li>
            <li>It cannot hold anything of any substantial weight, so good for smaller items of makeup, small jars, and such.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going a few more for gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>, the lower part is too close to the top so tall items do not fit.</li>
            <li>but it does its job, just wished it held a few more things.</li>
            <li>I found the color of this very dingy looking dark cream -- when I imagined using it on my white vanity or dresser top, in a room with white trim, and it really looks very dingy.  </li>
            <li>Fits on her sink and not only does she love it but everyone who visits her little room wants one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted - the only downside is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of room for my longer/taller eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>I may end up getting another one of these for more of my facial creams and other beauty supplies.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because it would be even more useful if it were a little larger with the capacity to hold larger and taller items.</li>
            <li>It helped me to organize my bathroom counter and made it so easy to find the cosmetics that I use everyday.  </li>
            <li>that the other reviews are right, I only use the center portion for tall combs and nail files, it&#x27;s very easy for small and short combs or make up brushes to get lost in between, and not enough room/width for full size brushes to fit.</li>
            <li>Fantastic little caddy.</li>
            <li>Granted, I have a lot (make-up addict) but the slot at the top didn&#x27;t hold all my brushes, they fit in this carrier awkwardly.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li>I put this carousel on my small bathroom counter top that was always filled with small makeup samples.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as useful as expected.</li>
            <li>The baskets themselves are only about 3 inches by 2 inches, barely big enough to hold pretty much anything except cotton balls.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to hold large items, such as bare minerals containers, eye palettes or blush palettes.</li>
            <li>Other than that - this make-up carousel is not cheaply made and made things much more organized than throwing it all in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li>then we put Qtips and toothpaste in the others for general use.  </li>
            <li>but it is no where near as big as the picture suggest.  </li>
            <li>The compartments on the botom are not easily visible (when in a hurry) because the top ones tend to slightly hide them when you&lt;br /&gt;put</li>
            <li>It helps with all your pretty little makeup and keeps it all organised.</li>
            <li>and I sometimes have my smaller brushes get lost (I mostly combat that by using the very center that has a small gap between the bars used to help turn the carousel).</li>
            <li>The center has a place for holding brushes but realistically you need pretty long brushes in order for them to not get lost in the middle.</li>
            <li>My bathroom counter was always a mess when I was in a hurry to get ready to go somewhere.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend as a very clever way to organize the messy counters.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to organize items until I received the carousel and started putting things in it from my counter.</li>
            <li> i love the idea of rotating an just getting what i need in one place.</li>
            <li> and i use the products more because I can find them now.  </li>

            <li> This is perfect for the teenage bathroom counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this carousel.</li>
            <li> Very tidy and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  </li>
            <li> My wife absolutely LOVES IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this organizer, and it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, although your brushes don&#x27;t fit in the middle, for me putting them in a bottom compartment of the carousel was perfect :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much space, keeps items handy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of some pretty good, strong metal and</li>
            <li> I love how it spins so easily for easy access</li>

            <li> so items are easily found and reached.</li>
            <li> It holds quite a bit, and everything is organized and easy to reach.  </li>
            <li> No matter how I tried to keep things neat in drawers, I would find myself leaving make up out on the counter to find things easily.  </li>
            <li> Now I can locate even my smallest of items since it spins and contents of each compartment are easily seen.</li>
            <li> Turns easily.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas present to help organization for a grand daughter.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to get to my makeup now while its in the compartments in this carousel.</li>
            <li> but I actually liked it better white; nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> but  it held my brushes just fine</li>
            <li> I bought a second one just hours after the first one arrived , because it was so perfect for my crowded bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I love how it swivels and it is very pretty on my counter.</li>
            <li> Would love if this came in multiple colors :) helps organize my makeup better and keeps my bathroom clean and tidy</li>
            <li> It is also user friendly and convenient and easily stored.</li>
            <li> but looks great on white furniture.</li>
            <li> All my cosmetics fit in it and it keeps my vanity from looking cluttered.</li>
            <li> Spins smoothly.</li>
            <li> This holds so much of my make up without taking up a lot of space, the carousel is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> in all its nice but not for what I really needed,which was to organize my cosmetics neatly.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) For me, this was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It spins really smoothly and seems well made.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how good the quality is.</li>
            <li> it allows for all of my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to be right at hand.. and the tiers are just what the doctor ordered:)</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic carousel does a fantastic job at keeping my makeup and beauty products organized and easily accessible.  </li>
            <li> This is literally the perfect little organizer!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to organize my makeup.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product!</li>
            <li> This is such a neat and handy product!  </li>
            <li> helped to clean up bathroom counter</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll fall right out!</li>
            <li> The Carousel is very convenient, holds a lot of make-up, it is easy to get to- and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer, but I wish the center had a cup for makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This organizer really simplifies things - much more than a stationery organizer could</li>
            <li> it hold so many things that I had out and in two dif make up bags, not it&#x27;s very organized.</li>
            <li> It saves so much space on my counter top.</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it to anyone that wants to have everything handy and organized, especially when you are rushing and you quickly put it away!</li>
            <li> I can fit quite a bit in each area and it fits right into the corner of my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s perfect on my makeup desk and it&#x27;s great for minimizing clutter of smaller makeup products!</li>
            <li> I also like that it is a carousel, and I can quickly locate items by turning it.</li>
            <li> It is a good start to get organized but a few more steps needed</li>
            <li> Love my new caddy.</li>
            <li> I love this cosmetic carousel, I have it on my bathroom sink and it holds and organizes all of my daily use products for quick, easy access.</li>
            <li> It easily holds all I need to get ready for the day or evening.</li>
            <li> I am able to keep my makeup in a smaller area and grab just what I want easily.  </li>
            <li> A bit small for the items to fit in but otherwise very handy and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer but the picture is a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> was worth.  </li>
            <li> Soon after, the price dropped to $23 and it is well worth that.</li>
            <li> but I fit all and more of my daily make up</li>
            <li> Turns nice, holds several items well.</li>
            <li> Useful everyday...every day.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s worth a lot.</li>
            <li> but it still so useful and helpful.</li>
            <li> I dont feel it was worth 25.00 and the price should be lowered.  </li>
            <li> takes up little space and very handy</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as it states, easily spins and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It spins easily and keeps stuff organized that would normally clutter the counter.</li>
            <li> and keeps my makeup right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold very large jars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at keeping things organized on my vanity, everything from eye-make up, to lip products, small face creams, even my contacts and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small, and the colour isn&#x27;t very nice.</li>
            <li> It holds lots of stuff and, surprisingly, takes up little space.</li>
            <li> Came back to this one and glad I did.</li>
            <li> I searched forever for somehting to organize my most used daily cosmetics and found this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to get my makeup organized.</li>
            <li> Love this carousel, has just enough space for everything you need!</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found something to use on my counter top that is vertical to hold my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for a small area, use it in my tiny bathroom and saves lots of space....</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I do wish that the space between the top and bottom bins was bigger.  </li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured and seems well made.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that it is functional in the way it spins around -- it will be useful to keep my jewelry straight, so I will keep it.  </li>
            <li> I love it, finally I organized my cosmatics</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s bigger and more cart on it...</li>
            <li> really like it!</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> It has six total baskets with three on top and three on bottom.</li>
            <li> however I should note to double check dimensions before purchasing and make sure they fit your products properly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something cute for my long bathroom counter where I could store q-tips, hair bands, and make-up</li>
            <li> One basket can easily hold several tubes of mascara, eyeliner, lipgloss, and lipstain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;overall, a nice addition to my make up mess.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality</li>
            <li> It is so nice to find my makeup with a little twerle.</li>
            <li> That was a little frustrating, but once I got it, my lipsticks, concealers, and mascaras fit perfectly in it.</li>
            <li> I really like the carousel</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> but she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Very well designed.</li>
            <li> very tiny,dissapointed</li>
            <li> I never pay this much for something like this.</li>
            <li> It saves so much space in her bathroom.</li>
            <li> I really like that it is a carousel</li>
            <li> My whole life I have \\&quot;spread</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and holds ALOT.  </li>
            <li> None of my hairbrushes fit in the middle.</li>
            <li> Very efficient way to hold my make-up</li>
            <li> It very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> The shelves are a bit warped so the makeup does not stand up straight, however I just lay them on their sides and have no problems.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would also make another larger size because this really comes in handy and a larger size would work for some of the lotions I have.  </li>
            <li> This really helped.</li>
            <li> I thought this was very well made and have appreciated it every day since it arrived.  </li>
            <li> It holds more than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and no need to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It really helped me organize my makeup</li>
            <li> I really like the carousel and the quality</li>
            <li> Very posh looking.</li>
            <li> I can fit my entire collection of makeup in this one organizer.</li>
            <li> This is very helpful with organizing.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take up a fair amount of counter space, so if you don&#x27;t have a larger sink you might use it on your dresser or some other table.</li>
            <li> Love this little organizer...not as big as I expected, but I&#x27;m still able to chock it full of items.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have a comb that has a long skinny handle it will fit.</li>
            <li> I love this cosmetic carousel, it works well for all my cosmetic, just the right size for my counter top and no more mess.</li>
            <li> It fits all of my everyday items and allows me to easily get to what I need!</li>
            <li> It is larger than I thought, but for the most part it definitely helps eliminate the clutter.</li>
            <li> but then the area that would have a handle (Middle top) is also some &#x27;drop in&#x27; holes for brushes or such.  </li>
            <li> Because it turns so well and holds so much, I&#x27;m going to buy a few more for scrapbooking supplies.</li>
            <li> It cleared up a lot of counter space and allows me quick access to items I use daily.</li>
            <li> Holds heaps of product, just make sure your brushes are tall enough for the middle section.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I just feel the price was too high for this product.</li>
            <li> The middle section is not that spacious to fit brushes but there is a slot sort of that can easily hold a few longer eye makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a little counter top organization.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it for cosmetics, but with a little imagination it could be used for craft rooms, kitchen pantry, etc.</li>
            <li> I say this because in the picture it shows hair brushes can fit in the center.</li>
            <li> It cannot hold anything of any substantial weight, so good for smaller items of makeup, small jars, and such.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going a few more for gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> , the lower part is too close to the top so tall items do not fit.</li>
            <li> but it does its job, just wished it held a few more things.</li>
            <li> I found the color of this very dingy looking dark cream -- when I imagined using it on my white vanity or dresser top, in a room with white trim, and it really looks very dingy.  </li>
            <li> Fits on her sink and not only does she love it but everyone who visits her little room wants one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted - the only downside is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of room for my longer/taller eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> I may end up getting another one of these for more of my facial creams and other beauty supplies.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because it would be even more useful if it were a little larger with the capacity to hold larger and taller items.</li>
            <li> It helped me to organize my bathroom counter and made it so easy to find the cosmetics that I use everyday.  </li>
            <li> that the other reviews are right, I only use the center portion for tall combs and nail files, it&#x27;s very easy for small and short combs or make up brushes to get lost in between, and not enough room/width for full size brushes to fit.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little caddy.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have a lot (make-up addict) but the slot at the top didn&#x27;t hold all my brushes, they fit in this carrier awkwardly.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li> I put this carousel on my small bathroom counter top that was always filled with small makeup samples.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as useful as expected.</li>
            <li> The baskets themselves are only about 3 inches by 2 inches, barely big enough to hold pretty much anything except cotton balls.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to hold large items, such as bare minerals containers, eye palettes or blush palettes.</li>
            <li> Other than that - this make-up carousel is not cheaply made and made things much more organized than throwing it all in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li> then we put Qtips and toothpaste in the others for general use.  </li>
            <li> but it is no where near as big as the picture suggest.  </li>
            <li> The compartments on the botom are not easily visible (when in a hurry) because the top ones tend to slightly hide them when you&lt;br /&gt;put</li>
            <li> It helps with all your pretty little makeup and keeps it all organised.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes have my smaller brushes get lost (I mostly combat that by using the very center that has a small gap between the bars used to help turn the carousel).</li>
            <li> The center has a place for holding brushes but realistically you need pretty long brushes in order for them to not get lost in the middle.</li>
            <li> My bathroom counter was always a mess when I was in a hurry to get ready to go somewhere.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend as a very clever way to organize the messy counters.</li>
            <li> But eventually, there was so much on the counter top, it wasn&#x27;t easy to find anything and was an awful mess!  </li>
            <li> I judged based on picture alone and a lot of things that I thought would fit look a little awkward but other than that it does fit A TON of stuff.</li>
            <li> so it is going to last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> so it will last a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bulkier than expected &amp; the baskets don&#x27;t hold as much as I thought they would.</li>
            <li> The center for the brushes&lt;br /&gt;is not deep enough for long brushes,they stick out.</li>
            <li> If you are planning to use it on a white tabletop or white counter, keep in mind that it is a dark almost beige cream color.  </li>
            <li> Some people commented that it was smaller than expected, check dimensions.</li>
            <li> But I contemplated a long while and searched everywhere.</li>
            <li> The center where you can put brushes/pencils was so deep that I couldn&#x27;t get my items out.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for that minor inconvenience I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand an earlier review saying there isn&#x27;t enough room, I was thinking it would hold LESS when I suggested it as a gift idea.</li>
            <li> This does not fit certain square or round  </li>
            <li> The compartments are not deep enough to hold brushes up without the laying down flat and the brush holder in the middle is too small.</li>
            <li> I just wish it were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Just looks a little too cluttered for out in the open.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little bigger and sturdier</li>
            <li> I use it for papercrafting supplies in the center of my workshop table.</li>
            <li> The only drawback for me is the center section where brushes and such go is too deep and my products are hard to get to, or they fall through the sides and are hard to retrieve.  </li>
            <li> Was purposely looking for something to go with my black and cream theme, so don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for something stark or pearly white.</li>
            <li> It has several small baskets that allow to keep my make off of the counter.</li>
            <li> My complaint is, doesn&#x27;t hold long makeup brushes well, and limited space for them.</li>
            <li> and it was getting hard to manage the ones I was using daily</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the center is a little tall</li>
            <li> But, the entire thing does turn, so you can at least use this</li>
            <li> You can get it almost half price at qvc.</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I recommend this for makeup divas like me who acquire lots of little bottles,but have no place to put them.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;bins&#x27; are a little close together</li>
            <li> be prepared to dig for those little items though..</li>
            <li> It looked big on picture but when we received it I was disappointed, the item was pretty small.</li>
            <li> can hold my little perfumes and deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for my computer desk to hold all my pens, little pc supplies, scraps of paper, etc.</li>
            <li> I use it for just my everyday products to get out the door - holds it all.</li>
            <li> It holds your everyday essentials and some</li>
            <li> well i used it for my make-up stuff which are the everyday that i use.</li>
            <li> i have 2 girls and got this for their messy bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The baskets are a little small</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, it&#x27;s on the small size</li>
            <li> as usual, they will always fall to the bottom and have to be dug out...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this was going to be</li>
            <li> It is  a  bit small  </li>
            <li> This small organizing unit is just as described and fits into a small space on my dresser.  </li>
            <li> If you have lots of stuff sprawled around your bathroom counter and no more room, this is the answer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to set on my very small bathroom counter to organize my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have a very small bathroom, and now I don&#x27;t know how I made it without this thing.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed at the size but used it for smaller items.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of a cluttered bathroom counter like I was, this will help keep you organized.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive to keep and be annoyed with.</li>
            <li> Like some have said, the hairbrush is unrealistic.</li>
            <li> Why is amazon so expensive?</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed .</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed by the finish.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look bad at all!</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Insane that this company sells it for $31??  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The carousel appeared larger in the illustration. I was a bit disappointed at the size but used it for smaller items.</li>
            <li> This looks good on my bathroom counter.  Holds a lot of items and keeps them organized.  I also like that it is a carousel, and I can quickly locate items by turning it.</li>
            <li> I really like the carousel but it doesn&#x27;t hold very large jars.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a while. Our bathroom countertop is not the longest and so I needed something that would decrease the clutter and this seemed to do the trick. It is larger than I thought, but for the most part it definitely helps eliminate the clutter.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she really likes it.  It cannot hold anything of any substantial weight, so good for smaller items of makeup, small jars, and such.&lt;br /&gt;For her uses, it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It does take up a fair amount of counter space, so if you don&#x27;t have a larger sink you might use it on your dresser or some other table.</li>
            <li> I love it. Do wish they made one a bit bigger but I love this.</li>
            <li> This has turned out to be a perfect way to organize my make-up.  I am able to keep my makeup in a smaller area and grab just what I want easily.  I paid $30 which was a bit more than I thought is was worth.  Soon after, the price dropped to $23 and it is well worth that.</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;nifty&amp;#34; as named. It shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.  This fits perfectly under my sink in the cabinet, but is not so huge that you couldn&#x27;t put it on a counter. I love it and use it for cosmetics, but with a little imagination it could be used for craft rooms, kitchen pantry, etc. Some people commented that it was smaller than expected, check dimensions. I can think of so many uses, I may get others! Very happy.</li>
            <li> It does keep everything organized and easy to get to. I just wish it were a little bigger. It has eliminated all the clutter though.</li>
            <li> picture always look nicer than the product it self.  Looks like something you will see from Christmas Tree shop</li>
            <li> Great for my sewing room!</li>
            <li> Purchased this about 6 months ago and I still use it for my make up. The rotation makes it so simple and convenient. The baskets are a little small but I fit all and more of my daily make up so its perfect if you want it for that</li>
            <li> I ordered the organizer because I wanted to save space while having all of my cosmetics close at hand on my vanity. it is much smaller than I imagined, but it has made a difference. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because it would be even more useful if it were a little larger with the capacity to hold larger and taller items.</li>
            <li> I purchased this organizer for my teenage granddaughter&#x27;s dresser so that she has a place for her cosmetics, nail polish, hair clips, and brushes.  It is perfect with lots of bins for everything; also, it spins to make everything easily available.  Off-white color but looks great on white furniture.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely LOVES IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, it&#x27;s on the small size but she really likes it.</li>
            <li> All my cosmetics fit in it and it keeps my vanity from looking cluttered. Very well designed.</li>
            <li> Sturdy organizer. Spins smoothly. I use it for papercrafting supplies in the center of my workshop table. A little pricey but it&#x27;s a quality piece and comes assembled.</li>
            <li> I bought this to set on my very small bathroom counter to organize my makeup.  It works well and also can be used to hand earrings on.</li>
            <li> Great product and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer, but I wish the center had a cup for makeup brushes. I like that it turns. Seems like good quality, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little caddy. Perfect for my makeup and skin care stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this! My boyfriend bought it for Christmas and I was so excited to organize my makeup. It spins which makes it easier to access everything. I separated my makeup into what I put on my face. It&#x27;s good for compacts, blushes, and just about everything else.</li>
            <li> My makeup has never been so organized....I plan on getting a second carousel. I recommend this for makeup divas like me who acquire lots of little bottles,but have no place to put them.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother who had make up strewn all over her vanity.  It&#x27;s a little bulkier than expected &amp; the baskets don&#x27;t hold as much as I thought they would.</li>
            <li> Love it.  This holds so much of my make up without taking up a lot of space, the carousel is a nice touch.  Not just for make up it can be used for office, kitchen etc.</li>
            <li> Awesome item for a great price however I should note to double check dimensions before purchasing and make sure they fit your products properly. I judged based on picture alone and a lot of things that I thought would fit look a little awkward but other than that it does fit A TON of stuff.</li>
            <li> Turns nice, holds several items well. My complaint is, doesn&#x27;t hold long makeup brushes well, and limited space for them. Don&#x27;t expect to hold large items, such as bare minerals containers, eye palettes or blush palettes. If you have those, there&#x27;s not enough room.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as it states, easily spins and is very sturdy. The only downside is the middle part where brushes are supposed to be held - they fall out.</li>
            <li> very tiny,dissapointed</li>
            <li> The compartments are not deep enough to hold brushes up without the laying down flat and the brush holder in the middle is too small.</li>
            <li> Came in solid packaging (almost overkill), and was fully assembled.  The &#x27;bins&#x27; are a little close together and it would be nice if either the top or the bottom ones could be rotated.  Also it would also be nice to have some kind of handle...but then the area that would have a handle (Middle top) is also some &#x27;drop in&#x27; holes for brushes or such.  so,  it depends on the function and location you plan to use.  But, the entire thing does turn, so you can at least use this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, a nice addition to my make up mess.  be prepared to dig for those little items though..as usual, they will always fall to the bottom and have to be dug out...but then that is Gravity for you!</li>
            <li> I liked it, I just didn&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s a bit small, and the colour isn&#x27;t very nice. Again, liked it, didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent organizer. I have been able take everything from my bathroom counter and put it into this carousel. It is so handy and I would recommend as a very clever way to organize the messy counters.</li>
            <li> This organizing carousel is perfect for what I need. It was just as described, and meets my expectations in every way.</li>
            <li> This is literally the perfect little organizer! It fits all of my everyday items and allows me to easily get to what I need! The middle section is not that spacious to fit brushes but there is a slot sort of that can easily hold a few longer eye makeup brushes. Just beware: line them up perfectly or else they&#x27;ll fall right out!</li>
            <li> I never pay this much for something like this. But I contemplated a long while and searched everywhere. Came back to this one and glad I did. Useful everyday...every day.  That&#x27;s worth a lot.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best things ever invented. Seriously. Just get one. You wont be disappointed! Holds soooooo much more than i thought it would!</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as useful as expected. I ended up getting vanity N beauty organizer with drawers and storage for next to the sink. This one I will keep under the sink for odds and ends. Just looks a little too cluttered for out in the open.</li>
            <li> I searched forever for somehting to organize my most used daily cosmetics and found this. I was so egar to recieve it ,well it came and I was disappointed . The center for the brushes&lt;br /&gt;is not deep enough for long brushes,they stick out. The compartments on the botom are not easily visible (when in a hurry) because the top ones tend to slightly hide them when you&lt;br /&gt;put your items inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all its nice but not for what I really needed,which was to organize my cosmetics neatly. This does not fit certain square or round  powder/blush/eyehshadow cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have returned it BUT my hubby thru the box out !!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Exactly what I needed to get my makeup organized. My friend loved mine so much she ordered one for herself.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 year old daughter. It saves so much space in her bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it to anyone that wants to have everything handy and organized, especially when you are rushing and you quickly put it away!</li>
            <li> Love this carousel, has just enough space for everything you need! I have already recommended this to all of my friends and family!</li>
            <li> This is a great space saver! If you are tired of a cluttered bathroom counter like I was, this will help keep you organized. I really like that it is a carousel so items are easily found and reached.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I bought one and ended up ordering another.  It holds quite a bit, and everything is organized and easy to reach.  I can even picture this on a workbench or on a desk holding staples, post-its, scissors, tape, etc.  In a kitchen, it would hold all sorts of gadgets, and in a kid&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> QVC sells it for $19!!!  Insane that this company sells it for $31??  Do not buy from here.  Great caddy too - I use it for just my everyday products to get out the door - holds it all.</li>
            <li> Glad I came across this. It does all it said and even more. Totally pleased with the product I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found something to use on my counter top that is vertical to hold my makeup.  My whole life I have \\&quot;spread out\\&quot; with make up on counter tops.  No matter how I tried to keep things neat in drawers, I would find myself leaving make up out on the counter to find things easily.  But eventually, there was so much on the counter top, it wasn&#x27;t easy to find anything and was an awful mess!  I might actually buy another one just in case.  lol</li>
            <li> Perfect for a small area, use it in my tiny bathroom and saves lots of space....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small this was going to be so I tried to cancel my order the next day, and I was messaged back saying they would not send it and refund me the money. The money was never refunded and the item still came. That was a little frustrating, but once I got it, my lipsticks, concealers, and mascaras fit perfectly in it. It is  a  bit small  so consider the measurements.</li>
            <li> Mom loved it! It&#x27;s made of some pretty good, strong metal and the carousel feature works perfectly. Really nice for a sm-med sized dresser.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of sample sized and travel sized products from my subscriptions to Birchbox, Ipsy, etc. and it was getting hard to manage the ones I was using daily, this is absolutely perfect and I have so much stuff shoved into it. This isn&#x27;t ideal for full sized hair products but it will hold full sized make up products.</li>
            <li> My parents use this to keep their glasses , pills, etc. organized.  Great space saver.  I will probably order one for myself.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect cosmetic organizer.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and holds ALOT.  It is white metal, not silver like it looked in the picture - but I actually liked it better white; nice surprise.  Very high quality so it is going to last for a long time.  Because it turns so well and holds so much, I&#x27;m going to buy a few more for scrapbooking supplies.</li>
            <li> This carousel keeps my cosmetics organized, I can see everything, and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my vanity. I love it!</li>
            <li> For me, this is absolutely necessary. It cleared up a lot of counter space and allows me quick access to items I use daily. Like some have said, the hairbrush is unrealistic. None of my hairbrushes fit in the middle. My makeup brushes and a pair of scissors do though. &#x3D;) For me, this was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This organizer really simplifies things - much more than a stationery organizer could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems sturdy enough.  Hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer.  It fits all of my daily makeup and face products perfectly.  I like how you can spin it around and that mechanism works great.</li>
            <li> Great product. It has a lot of space for a compact organizer. It is so nice to find my makeup with a little twerle.</li>
            <li> Very efficient way to hold my make-up</li>
            <li> Got this for my married daughter who has small bathroom. Fits on her sink and not only does she love it but everyone who visits her little room wants one.</li>
            <li> Great organiser. Save tons of space.</li>
            <li> I love this cosmetic carousel, it works well for all my cosmetic, just the right size for my counter top and no more mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted - the only downside is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of room for my longer/taller eyeshadow brushes. Granted, I have a lot (make-up addict) but the slot at the top didn&#x27;t hold all my brushes, they fit in this carrier awkwardly. Other than that - this make-up carousel is not cheaply made and made things much more organized than throwing it all in my make-up bag. I really like it!</li>
            <li> nice, but not as spacious as it seemed</li>
            <li> I was looking for something cute for my long bathroom counter where I could store q-tips, hair bands, and make-up and this is the perfect solution.  I like the way it spins and the color is neutral.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!! It&#x27;s perfect for organizing my make up, and easy to find what I need.  I wish I would have bought two!!</li>
            <li> Very useful. I use it for cosmetics.</li>
            <li> If you need a make up organizer order this one! I love this thing. It very sturdy and well made. I was really surprised at how good the quality is. It has several small baskets that allow to keep my make off of the counter. I&#x27;m going a few more for gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I needed some order in my life and this fits the need. It holds lots of stuff and, surprisingly, takes up little space. Now I can locate even my smallest of items since it spins and contents of each compartment are easily seen.</li>
            <li> I  purchased two of these items.. I like the individual bins and the fact that it spins.  I do wish that the space between the top and bottom bins was bigger.  There are not a lot of things that you can put in the bottom.</li>
            <li> Love it soo much fits rite on my stand and holds all myy make up perfectly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this cosmetic carousel!  It holds all my makeup I use on a daily basis as well as all my brushes.  The shelves are a bit warped so the makeup does not stand up straight, however I just lay them on their sides and have no problems.  Great for my dorm room.</li>
            <li> It looked big on picture but when we received it I was disappointed, the item was pretty small.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, keeps everything organized. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is an ok makeup organizer. I really wish it was bigger. Nice that it spins. Got 2 of them. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> JUST OKAY. SHELVES COULD HAVE BEEN TALLER AND MORE SEPARATED</li>
            <li> Very nice. Does the job!</li>
            <li> I may end up getting another one of these for more of my facial creams and other beauty supplies.  I just wish they would also make another larger size because this really comes in handy and a larger size would work for some of the lotions I have.  They currently have to lean inside it because they are taller than what the organizer holds.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers wrote that the middle part doesn&#x27;t hold the brushes but  it held my brushes just fine, the lower part is too close to the top so tall items do not fit. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product!</li>
            <li> I use to have a bathroom counter with makeup everywhere and a cosmetic bag that I could never find anything in. This really helped. It holds your everyday essentials and some</li>
            <li> Loved it perfect for my daughter will probably get more for Christmas just what we needed Serves it purpose and compact</li>
            <li> I thought this was very well made and have appreciated it every day since it arrived.  It helped me to organize my bathroom counter and made it so easy to find the cosmetics that I use everyday.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this cosmetic carousel, I have it on my bathroom sink and it holds and organizes all of my daily use products for quick, easy access. It looks exactly as pictured and seems well made.  I like the cream color, it&#x27;s a nice neutral color.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a little counter top organization.</li>
            <li> It was just the correct size and met the requirements. It is also user friendly and convenient and easily stored.</li>
            <li> This small organizing unit is just as described and fits into a small space on my dresser.  It holds a nice variety of cosmetic items and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> love it  and my nieces love them also, i will recommend it to friends. deliver on time for the nieces</li>
            <li> Great way to rid clutter on your counter. I love this carousel more than I imagined I would. Turns easily. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to organize items until I received the carousel and started putting things in it from my counter. It holds more than I expected.</li>
            <li> What a joy this organizer is! it allows for all of my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to be right at hand.. and the tiers are just what the doctor ordered:) I would recommend this to all who need a place for all of their &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;..This is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and no need to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;This product  rates a ten star with me.</li>
            <li> I found the color of this very dingy looking dark cream -- when I imagined using it on my white vanity or dresser top, in a room with white trim, and it really looks very dingy.  I probably should have realized that by the picture.  If you are planning to use it on a white tabletop or white counter, keep in mind that it is a dark almost beige cream color.  Aside from that it is functional in the way it spins around -- it will be useful to keep my jewelry straight, so I will keep it.  I was just disappointed by the finish.</li>
            <li> Very tidy and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  Everything is very handy and all of my makeup items including comb and scissors fit neatly in this stand.</li>
            <li> I love it, finally I organized my cosmatics</li>
            <li> product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> its neat and nice...i love the idea of rotating an just getting what i need in one place. well i used it for my make-up stuff which are the everyday that i use. though, i wish there is a product like this that&#x27;s bigger and more cart on it...</li>
            <li> I put this carousel on my small bathroom counter top that was always filled with small makeup samples.  It really helped me organize my makeup and i use the products more because I can find them now.  I really like the carousel and the quality is above my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic holder for beauty supplies!! I love how it spins so easily for easy access</li>
            <li> I returned this the same day I received it.  The shelves were so short that none of my cosmetics stood up.  The center where you can put brushes/pencils was so deep that I couldn&#x27;t get my items out.  I wish this would have worked but it was too expensive to keep and be annoyed with.</li>
            <li> She love it she happy that i like it .bijdskjcdsbcjkbsddskd jjdjbd jjdjkd djjdbhd dhgdfd hdjkkd jjfhbdhd ujdkkdjd hhdjkdhd jjdkkdj kmd</li>
            <li> product as describd. Great size and really like it! May get another one. Product arrived on time. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> love this great products!!!!!</li>
            <li> It did seem much bigger in the picture but I still love it. It may not be as big as Iwould have wanted but it still so useful and helpful. It helps with all your pretty little makeup and keeps it all organised.</li>
            <li> worked well at such a low price</li>
            <li> it holds all my makeup</li>
            <li> Great item! Everything fits perfectly and organized. Just as advertised. Would buy another one for the guest bathroom. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little bigger and sturdier but it does its job, just wished it held a few more things.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! Well made turns great. Big buckets for all of your cosmetics!</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY as pictured and described. It is a perfect fit for my cosmetics and my bathroom space. Love that it rotates smoothly!</li>
            <li> Great Christmas present to help organization for a grand daughter.  It is a good start to get organized but a few more steps needed</li>
            <li> It deemed biggger to me on picture display but its still nice. can hold my little perfumes and deodorant. it&#x27;s nice. Nice purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift, to help her try &amp; organize her make up &amp; it is great!</li>
            <li> Was purposely looking for something to go with my black and cream theme, so don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for something stark or pearly white. It&#x27;s great at keeping things organized on my vanity, everything from eye-make up, to lip products, small face creams, even my contacts and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the other reviews are right, I only use the center portion for tall combs and nail files, it&#x27;s very easy for small and short combs or make up brushes to get lost in between, and not enough room/width for full size brushes to fit.</li>
            <li> Heck yeah. This thing is awesome. I bought a second one just hours after the first one arrived , because it was so perfect for my crowded bathroom counter. Love the cream colored coating over the metal. Very posh looking.</li>
            <li> I love it! Doesn&#x27;t take up much space, keeps items handy! Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a great organizer but the picture is a little deceiving. I say this because in the picture it shows hair brushes can fit in the center. Not true. Unless you have a comb that has a long skinny handle it will fit. over all its great.</li>
            <li> This is such a neat and handy product!  I am very pleased with the use of it and the looks of it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift to organize my cosmetics, but I&#x27;m using it to corral my craft supplies. Specifically, it holds lots of my bead containers and tools and I can see what I have. It spins really smoothly and seems well made. I&#x27;m considering getting another one.</li>
            <li> Uses more space then anticipated, but great product.  Holds heaps of product, just make sure your brushes are tall enough for the middle section.</li>
            <li> As of writing this, it&#x27;s 1-23-14, and qvc is selling this for 19.96 plus shipping and handling. Even with the shipping and handling added in, it&#x27;s cheaper buying it elsewhere. Why is amazon so expensive? Just thought I&#x27;d give everyone a heads up. You can get it almost half price at qvc.</li>
            <li> Love this little organizer...not as big as I expected, but I&#x27;m still able to chock it full of items.  Sturdy and turns well.  Great product for all the bathroom makeup clutter!!</li>
            <li> If you have lots of stuff sprawled around your bathroom counter and no more room, this is the answer.  got all the face cleansers, makeup, brushes, everything in there.  Now i actually have counter space.  Awesome</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this organizer, and it did not disappoint. It has six total baskets with three on top and three on bottom. The center has a place for holding brushes but realistically you need pretty long brushes in order for them to not get lost in the middle. I am really impressed with how much each basket can hold. I can fit my entire collection of makeup in this one organizer. One basket can easily hold several tubes of mascara, eyeliner, lipgloss, and lipstain. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> This caddy seems like it would be big enough to hold a lot of stuff, but not so. The baskets themselves are only about 3 inches by 2 inches, barely big enough to hold pretty much anything except cotton balls. Plus, it wobbles and mine actually creaks. I just stopped using it altogether.</li>
            <li> I recieved the white version of this makeup carousel for my birthday over a year ago and I still love it. I can fit quite a bit in each area and it fits right into the corner of my bathroom sink. I don&#x27;t understand an earlier review saying there isn&#x27;t enough room, I was thinking it would hold LESS when I suggested it as a gift idea. My only complaint would be that the center is a little tall and I sometimes have my smaller brushes get lost (I mostly combat that by using the very center that has a small gap between the bars used to help turn the carousel). This is a great was to keep your favorite makeup products within reach.</li>
            <li> it hold so many things that I had out and in two dif make up bags, not it&#x27;s very organized.</li>
            <li> I have a very small bathroom, and now I don&#x27;t know how I made it without this thing.  It is a god send. The baskets are not very big, but can hold my 8 eyeshadows in one basket, My make up and lipstics.  Its great.</li>
            <li> This product held all of my make up but it is no where near as big as the picture suggest.  I dont feel it was worth 25.00 and the price should be lowered.  It is made out quality material so it will last a long time but I just feel the price was too high for this product.</li>
            <li> takes up little space and very handy</li>
            <li> Love my new caddy. My cosmetic stuff is so much more organized now. I am very glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> helped to clean up bathroom counter and i really enjoy being able to see my things and keep them neat</li>
            <li> This is very helpful with organizing. A bit small for the items to fit in but otherwise very handy and sturdy.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it! Thanks.</li>
            <li> i have 2 girls and got this for their messy bathroom.  they now have their makeup, hair scrunchies , pimple cream and barettes in it and the bathroom is a lot neater!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s perfect on my makeup desk and it&#x27;s great for minimizing clutter of smaller makeup products!</li>
            <li> very nice gifts loved them</li>
            <li> I love this carousel. It keeps my bathroom items in one place and off the counter. I love how it swivels and it is very pretty on my counter.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail and started putting my makeup in the same day! I absolutely love it, although your brushes don&#x27;t fit in the middle, for me putting them in a bottom compartment of the carousel was perfect :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m even able to put an eyeshadow palette on the bottom and it doesn&#x27;t look bad at all! I love love love.... Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Organizer is very good. My friend had one and I just had to get one. It&#x27;s great. and keeps my makeup right at my fingertips.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for organizing make up. It spins easily and keeps stuff organized that would normally clutter the counter. You will love how easily accessible it makes products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for my computer desk to hold all my pens, little pc supplies, scraps of paper, etc. Oh, and yeah, I do have one bottle of nail polish in one of the holders! Very sturdy design; great product; highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Great way to clean up my counter space.  Everyone in my family has their own spot then we put Qtips and toothpaste in the others for general use.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!! It saves so much space on my counter top.</li>
            <li> My bathroom counter was always a mess when I was in a hurry to get ready to go somewhere. This Carousel looks good on my counter top and easy to pick up and store somewhere if I need to clear my counter top if company coming, etc. It easily holds all I need to get ready for the day or evening.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic carousel does a fantastic job at keeping my makeup and beauty products organized and easily accessible.  The only drawback for me is the center section where brushes and such go is too deep and my products are hard to get to, or they fall through the sides and are hard to retrieve.  If it weren&#x27;t for that minor inconvenience I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The Carousel is very convenient, holds a lot of make-up, it is easy to get to- and easy to use. Gets rid of all the clutter on the vanity.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the teenage bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;It eliminates the need for pick up each morning!&lt;br /&gt;Love the design as well</li>
            <li> I love this carousel. I use it in my restroom counter with all my make up. It is so easy to get to my makeup now while its in the compartments in this carousel. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> There is plenty of room to put brushes, cosmetics, hair clips and nail polish. The cream color works with the color of my room.</li>
            <li> Great product. Can be used to store a number of items. I use it for my makeup and it keeps everything neat and organized in a cite, trendy way. Love that it rotates!</li>
            <li> Would love if this came in multiple colors :) helps organize my makeup better and keeps my bathroom clean and tidy</li>
