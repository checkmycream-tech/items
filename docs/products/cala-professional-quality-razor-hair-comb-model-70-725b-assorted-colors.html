            <li> ... total drag!</li>
            <li> When I set it on really tight, sometimes it works and sometimes I have to go over the area numerous times.</li>
            <li> Product lacks precision in assembly, blades misaligned and comb teeth not as uniform as I expected a pro tool to be.</li>
            <li> As an older man my hair is stating to thin</li>
            <li> Even with a sharp razor, this thing will pull your hair.  </li>
            <li> The flimsy plastic teeth are very rough.  </li>
            <li> Its a regular electrical razor in a poor quality piece of plastic. ...</li>
            <li> Takes practice and you must go slow, but it works.  </li>
            <li> razors aren&#x27;t tightly secured :(</li>

            <li> It does what it says.  I  love it.  My hair looks great.</li>
            <li> It is inaccurate in its measurements.  When I set it on really tight, sometimes it works and sometimes I have to go over the area numerous times.</li>
            <li> This razor comb works like a charm. It makes it easy to keep my hair the way I like it.</li>
            <li> Even with a sharp razor, this thing will pull your hair.  The flimsy plastic teeth are very rough.  I took a nail file and filed each plastic spur off, but it was still unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Good but not excellent for our cats</li>
            <li> This was a gift for girl who cuts my hair. She said she will use it.</li>
            <li> This probably works great for somebody who knows what they are doing. I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Excellent tool-- saving money trimming my own hair</li>
            <li> Very cheap and does not cut. It just drags right  across all  the hair... total drag! I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Product lacks precision in assembly, blades misaligned and comb teeth not as uniform as I expected a pro tool to be.</li>
            <li> Have used this for 3 months now.  Takes practice and you must go slow, but it works.  As an older man my hair is stating to thin so I just want to clean around the ears and neck.  Don&#x27;t need a G I hair cut every barbar is trying to give me.  Saved near $50 so far and noone has made any wise cracks yet.</li>
            <li> razors aren&#x27;t tightly secured :( they dont cut smoothly and can cause split ends</li>
            <li> works great for trim ups</li>
            <li> Its a regular electrical razor in a poor quality piece of plastic. ...Had rust on razor when I opened package. ....</li>
