            <li>I recently took 2 of the go palettes on my Hawaiin vacation and it made traveling with beautiful makeup so easy!</li>
            <li>The brand is interesting because they have many different palettes, lots to choose from, and the price is great for the dozen colors.  </li>
            <li>Nice colors, last a good while.</li>
            <li>Really great dark smokey colors in this handy makeup case.  </li>

            <li>The colors have a nice selection of shimmery and matte, and they complement each other nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not that happy with this product, and I would look into a Shany color palette instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks really great when you wet the brush then</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this shadw palette needed some colors for autmn/winter months and their very pigmented som matte</li>
            <li>Overall, good value and price for this palette.</li>
            <li>so I can see the full array in front of me.</li>
            <li>the colors pop, they blend good together, they last all day, plus when i recieved this pallette none of my pops were broke or cracked, i DO recommend, oh, and its travel size, so you can bring it on the go!</li>
            <li>These shadows are surprisingly pigmented for such an inexpensive product!  </li>
            <li>The purple tones go great with my olive skin tone, and are extremely pigmented.  </li>
            <li>The black is richly pigmented, and I had great success using it with an eyeliner brush.  </li>
            <li>.They are smooth, go on very nicely,and</li>
            <li>.It&#x27;s definitely worth the price for these pretty ,usable,in a sweet portable compact ,colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This pallet is practical, it wont blow you away, but its nice and simple.</li>
            <li>the colors are fun to work with.</li>
            <li>The third column and the first one of the last column are kind of nude colors with a warm tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the colors on this palette and they are pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li>It was pretty inexpensive, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>love the blue hues.</li>
            <li>Looks really pretty on brown eyed ladies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I love this palette so much that I ordered a few more sets.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try out some eye shadows from Coastal Scents, I bought a brush set from them few weeks ago and loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got many compliments when I wore the light aqua on my lid, blending it into the orchid/lavendar crease and black outer \\&quot;v\\&quot; for a smoky look.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very, very nice and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>When used with a wet brush you can really pack on a high level of saturation with the colors, but applied normally it is better for a wash of color and a simple, every-day kind of look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be de-potting all my Go-Palettes into a large Z-palette</li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give this a perfect 5/5 is because I wish the palettes were a little bigger.  </li>
            <li>This eye shadow is really flaky.</li>
            <li>The blues are very pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t have a lot of use for the lighter teals and purples.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of getting another &amp;#34;city&amp;#34; very soon.</li>
            <li>Since eye shadows should be trashed after several months, having relatively small amounts, as in this palette, is a great idea.</li>
            <li>choose this one because I liked that it both had natural colors and some extreme colors!</li>
            <li>These colors are nicely pigmented with very little fall out.  </li>
            <li>I love this little palette and hope to purchase another one of the series.  </li>
            <li>Soft and very blendable.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only palette you need for travel because of the versatility of having neutral shades, with outdoor fresh shades as well as smoky jewel tones.  </li>
            <li>For some reason when looking at the picture I imagined that the palette was larger, but when it arrived the case was slightly larger than a thick wallet, which I find ideal for packing away.  </li>
            <li>Within a few weeks the light blue busted inside the case and is now all over the rest of the colors, and when worn, the colors crease quickly and do not like to adhere to the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and these palette did not cause any problems at all.</li>
            <li>This palette is so unique - the left half offer purple toned shades, and the right is made up of matte earth tones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very travel friendly as well since it is so small and contains an array of colors.</li>
            <li>I really like the different combinations of color choices.</li>
            <li>And Paris offers a range of cold-warm colors but are generally dark and less colorful than London.  </li>
            <li>One doesn&#x27;t need to use too much because a little is noticeable and lasts throughout the day.</li>

            <li> The colors are very deep and vibrant, but a little flaky if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I had waited so long to get it</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, when I used this a had a slight allergic reaction my eye lids got a little puffy and itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow brand is really not what it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li> (I have extremely oily lids) after about 7 hours.</li>
            <li> The colors pictured are almost spot on, if not exact.</li>
            <li> only small problem I had was one of the eyeshadow pop out the palette</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because there was no brush and because the individual colors are very small</li>
            <li> Four stars with the only complaint of creasing since I tend to wear eyeshadows for at least 12 hours a day.  </li>
            <li> I received this color palette a few days ago , it arrived just in time for my birthday!!They were packaged and bubble wrapped and they were intact when I got them.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes ,so I get to mix and match all the colors</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that the dark purple was broken when delivered to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but this palette did not deliver for me.</li>
            <li> I felt that the darker colors lacked pigment and were a little difficult to blend.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is terribly crumbly - it gets everywhere, and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> even though I use base all the time, I think if I were in a rush I could use the colors without base and it would be just fine</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was choosing among all the go palettes from coastal scents and I decided that I want a bit of black/browns and a bit of colors. This one is the perfect combo. If you want nude colors, Cairo is a good choice. Beijing is consisted of warms. And Paris offers a range of cold-warm colors but are generally dark and less colorful than London.  I&#x27;ve used all the colors on this palette and they are pretty pigmented. The first column are mint/turquoise and together they create a great look. The second column is purples. They are really really gorgeous. The third column and the first one of the last column are kind of nude colors with a warm tone. The last two are blacks with the second to last one having some shimmers. Even though the longevity of these shadows isn&#x27;t perfect - it creases a little bit (I have extremely oily lids) after about 7 hours. It&#x27;s not too visible in my opinion. But you can get away with using eyeshadow primers.  I am pretty happy about the palette and it meets my expectation from seeing all the swatches and reviews. Nothing can beat this price! It&#x27;s very travel friendly as well since it is so small and contains an array of colors. Four stars with the only complaint of creasing since I tend to wear eyeshadows for at least 12 hours a day.  Also recommended: try Maybelline&#x27;s Color Tattoo. I have some as well and they DON&#x27;T crease at all in a day! Really amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I received this color palette a few days ago , it arrived just in time for my birthday!!They were packaged and bubble wrapped and they were intact when I got them. I couldn&#x27;t wait to play with the colors. They are perfect, even prettier than the picture. Perfect for my skin and eyes. I have green eyes ,so I get to mix and match all the colors .They are smooth, go on very nicely,and even though I use base all the time, I think if I were in a rush I could use the colors without base and it would be just fine .It&#x27;s definitely worth the price for these pretty ,usable,in a sweet portable compact ,colors. I would order them again!</li>
            <li> Nice colors, I love it!</li>
            <li> This eye shadow is really flaky. I hate it.  It gets everywhere.  i do not  recommend it. The colours are nice though.  but it is so crumbly it is not useable.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this shadw palette needed some colors for autmn/winter months and their very pigmented som matte some shimmer&lt;br /&gt;but all wonderful and this seller gave swatches of wha colors look like on different tones fabulous i love it!! gonna buy the thers gotta haves!</li>
            <li> This palette is just lovely for a smokey eye. The colors are very deep and vibrant, but a little flaky if that makes sense. Overall, good value and price for this palette. Going to buy more!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, when I used this a had a slight allergic reaction my eye lids got a little puffy and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors vary from shimmery to matte and have fairly good pigmentation. The blues are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the dark purple was broken when delivered to me. I had waited so long to get it I didnt think there was a point in asking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pallet is practical, it wont blow you away, but its nice and simple.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow brand is really not what it&#x27;s made out to be. Within a few weeks the light blue busted inside the case and is now all over the rest of the colors, and when worn, the colors crease quickly and do not like to adhere to the skin. I&#x27;m really not that happy with this product, and I would look into a Shany color palette instead.</li>
            <li> Need to use a lot to get color to show.  It was pretty inexpensive, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try out some eye shadows from Coastal Scents, I bought a brush set from them few weeks ago and loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I choose this one because I liked that it both had natural colors and some extreme colors! and these colors fit my color pallet perfectly (i have red hair and blue eyes).&lt;br /&gt;The shadows have absolutely GRATE quality, they lay beautiful and the colors are really bright and they don&#x27;t fade!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and it is pigmented pretty well. Doesn&#x27;t come with brush though ..love the blue hues. The end</li>
            <li> I love these colors.  Giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because there was no brush and because the individual colors are very small</li>
            <li> The colors pictured are almost spot on, if not exact. The pigment is good without any fallout. The only issue I did have with this palette is the sizing in the picture looks much bigger to me. I was seeing an almost quarter size eyeshadow pan, in reality it is a dime sized pan. I am still happy with the purchase. I do like the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but this palette did not deliver for me. I felt that the darker colors lacked pigment and were a little difficult to blend. I&#x27;m not a fan of frosted shadows so I really didn&#x27;t have a lot of use for the lighter teals and purples. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I love this little palette and hope to purchase another one of the series.  These colors are nicely pigmented with very little fall out.  You can pat them on lightly for a daytime look or layer them for some gorgeous evening looks.  I got many compliments when I wore the light aqua on my lid, blending it into the orchid/lavendar crease and black outer \\&quot;v\\&quot; for a smoky look.  The palette is the perfect size to slip into a purse and it&#x27;s the only palette you need for travel because of the versatility of having neutral shades, with outdoor fresh shades as well as smoky jewel tones.  So glad I bought it</li>
            <li> The colors are very, very nice and they last a long time. They make brown eyes pop! One doesn&#x27;t need to use too much because a little is noticeable and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This palette is so unique - the left half offer purple toned shades, and the right is made up of matte earth tones.  The purple tones go great with my olive skin tone, and are extremely pigmented.  I&#x27;m going to be de-potting all my Go-Palettes into a large Z-palette so I can see the full array in front of me.</li>
            <li> Really great dark smokey colors in this handy makeup case.  The brand is interesting because they have many different palettes, lots to choose from, and the price is great for the dozen colors.  Since eye shadows should be trashed after several months, having relatively small amounts, as in this palette, is a great idea.</li>
            <li> the colors pop, they blend good together, they last all day, plus when i recieved this pallette none of my pops were broke or cracked, i DO recommend, oh, and its travel size, so you can bring it on the go! i love it</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter, mostly to play with and practice with. It was inexpensive, and well received. She loves it. I really like the different combinations of color choices. I have ordered myself some.</li>
            <li> the colors are fun to work with. Blends very nicely. Comes in a sturdy case. Packed nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, last a good while. Looks really pretty on brown eyed ladies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good guality  Coastal Scents makes a good eyes shadow for sure</li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give this a perfect 5/5 is because I wish the palettes were a little bigger.  Otherwise, I love the colors and would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Colors look wonderful!!!!  Didn&#x27;t break up during shipment like most do.  I&#x27;ve used every color and they all compliment my skin tone.  If you combine this with ELF eye primer it will last all day.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  The eyeshadow is terribly crumbly - it gets everywhere, and doesn&#x27;t last long.  I only used it once or twice - I would never travel with it, as it is horrid.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and these palette did not cause any problems at all. The colors are vibrant and very easy to blend. I love this palette so much that I ordered a few more sets. Very happy with the purchase. Highly recommend this product! THis one was my favorite! Great colors!</li>
            <li> This is a really good eyeshadow palette and the shadows have good pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks really great when you wet the brush then apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small problem I had was one of the eyeshadow pop out the palette</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with every coastal scents pallette I have purchased. I recently took 2 of the go palettes on my Hawaiin vacation and it made traveling with beautiful makeup so easy!</li>
            <li> For some reason when looking at the picture I imagined that the palette was larger, but when it arrived the case was slightly larger than a thick wallet, which I find ideal for packing away.  Each eyeshadow is about dime sized.  The size of the case is nice for travel, and the mirror is a nice addition - It seems like a good kit to bring on a vacation.  The colors have a nice selection of shimmery and matte, and they complement each other nicely.  They will smudge and slide on oily skin over time, so a primer is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigmentation in the colors varies with each shade and tint.  The black is richly pigmented, and I had great success using it with an eyeliner brush.  When used with a wet brush you can really pack on a high level of saturation with the colors, but applied normally it is better for a wash of color and a simple, every-day kind of look.</li>
            <li> These shadows are surprisingly pigmented for such an inexpensive product!  The colors are beautiful and long-wearing, too.  This palette would be an all-in-one if it had a subtler highlight color, but that&#x27;s the only drawback I can find. Love this palette so much!</li>
            <li> I love this palate.  I originally bought it for the beautiful teal shades, but it turns out that all the shadows are lovely.  Soft and very blendable.  The matte black shade is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting another &amp;#34;city&amp;#34; very soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup palette for a friend.  These colors are very nice and the box it comes in is so cute.  Very great product for the price.</li>
