            <li>I love the little gold flecks in this polish.....</li>
            <li>They dry super fast.</li>
            <li>I love Essie products and used this with Essie&#x27;s base and quick drying top coat.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 5 year old niece so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel like a child wearing it.</li>

            <li> Thought this would be a flat gloss and not one with a glittery finish.  </li>
            <li> is the brush is alittle too wide.</li>
            <li> The picture does not accurately reflect this... will upload a photo shortly.</li>
            <li> Not a large amount, but there is some in it.</li>
            <li> so it turned out to be POLLY POCKET PINK!</li>
            <li> Only complaint</li>
            <li> I also use  Essie cuticle oil, base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> It has a slight silver sparkle to it that is hard to see online.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a small one-</li>
            <li> Received a few compliments on it already!</li>
            <li> It was also extremely thick.</li>
            <li> Overall, you cant go wrong with Essie!</li>
            <li> Seriously this color is a must for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> It was just bad.</li>

            <li> this product is really great. i love essie nail polish it is one of my favorites. received the item in great time</li>
            <li> Essie is always spot on with their colors. No matter the shade you can find every color with this brand. I originally tried this color at the nail shop and I haven&#x27;t changed brands since. Excellent color, durability, and brand!</li>
            <li> So cute.....added a little glitter over top......Only one coat need for full coverage.  The price was really awesome too!! Perfect for a little girl first nail polish</li>
            <li> The color is deceiving... it was a bit darker than the picture so it turned out to be POLLY POCKET PINK! I gave it to my 5 year old niece so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel like a child wearing it. It was also extremely thick. It didn&#x27;t spread well, and it dried to fast so that my fingers looked goopy. It was just bad.</li>
            <li> This is a great spring color. I love Essie polishes especially when you can get it at a great price!</li>
            <li> Beautiful pink color with shimmer, Great girly color. Opaque, only 2 coats needed to achieve bottle color. All season color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color that is just the right mix of pink and purple! Will be my go to for spring and summer!</li>
            <li> Essie Nail Polish is the best!  Glossy and beautiful colors and many choices.  This color is yet another great one.  Essie is the best nail polish, far better than others, and it&#x27;s the only brand I buy!</li>

            <li> Seriously this color is a must for spring and summer. The color has some shimmer to it but its nothing to explosive if you aren&#x27;t into glitter polishes. Very nice durability on my nails and the color pay off is great. One coat did the trick with this color so definitely a good polish.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a flat gloss and not one with a glittery finish.  would prefer it not have the frost effect.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I were surprised that this item has glitter in it. Not a large amount, but there is some in it. The picture does not accurately reflect this... will upload a photo shortly. The colour is nice though, and it&#x27;s a nice pink. Haven&#x27;t used it quite yet.</li>
            <li> I have several Essie polishes and love them all.They dry super fast.Only complaint and it&#x27;s a small one-is the brush is alittle too wide.Otherwise the polishes are wonderful The color is pretty and gets me compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  Two coats is perfect for full coverage color.  Perfect spring/summer pink!!  Highly recommended.  I love the little gold flecks in this polish.....had a manicure in this color and had to add it to my collection.</li>
            <li> This polish is great.  It goes on nice and smooth. I also use  Essie cuticle oil, base coat and top coat. The polish lasts over a week and that is with cleaning and gardening.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this color from Walgreens for $8. If I would have none it would have been cheaper on Amazon, I would have totally purchased it on here. Anywho, great color. Its actually more \\&quot;pink\\&quot; than I expected it to be because it actually looks more purple in the store. Either way, I am impressed by how great and easy it applies. I needed only two coats and it came out great. It has a little shimmer to it as well, which I what I liked about it. Overall, you cant go wrong with Essie!</li>
