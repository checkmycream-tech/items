    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Theses stencils are awesome.</li>
            <li>When I go shopping for makeup the people working the makeup counter always ask how do I do my eyebrows because they look so perfect</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good eyebrow stencil you should try these!!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>so I will just say, it&#x27;s great having eyebrows!  </li>
            <li>and I went through them all and chose which was the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Great stencil...need to trim with scissors for more accuracy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also never felt good about the results I was getting filling them in on my own.  </li>
            <li>These are the best shape for my face and the right size.  </li>
            <li>The classic stencil frames my face perfectly.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the photos and the arch options are great.</li>
            <li>I suppose, more of a user error.</li>
            <li>You can hold it over your brow and use eyeshadow for an instant, perfect even brow.</li>
            <li>My brows are somewhat sparse but the shape is still visible and easy to replicate.</li>
            <li>The stencil was easy to use with my eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>This will make putting on eyebrows easily.</li>
            <li>These are not the solve all I was looking for and will continue on my perfect brow saga, with a little effort and time these could probably work for someone, however I am looking for something I take to immediately as I do not have the time to dally with my eyebrows for hours.</li>
            <li>These are a great, simple idea well executed.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I love them so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially if you have no confidence in your ability to put on good brows.</li>
            <li>I knew right away that it would be the right one.</li>
            <li>I lost my eyebrows after my first cycle of chemo.</li>
            <li>I would pay more if the stencil was wider and bigger.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried eyebrow stencils, and for me, they didn&#x27;t work out too well.</li>
            <li>These work exactly as described.</li>
            <li>In the future I will look for coloured stencils as I&#x27;m sure it will be much easier to see exactly where they are being placed.</li>
            <li>Although comes in package of four, three are way to large.</li>
            <li>They come in a nice re -  sealable little packet.</li>
            <li>They were very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The above questions don&#x27;t really fit the product</li>
            <li>Perhaps could use for stage makeup, but not for normal wear.</li>
            <li>I have used these eyebrow stencils for many years and use them everyday.  </li>
            <li>Great stencils if you want cartoonishly thick, six inch long eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so it looks normal.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to clean it before you turn it over to do the other side</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for anyone with thinning brows, or anyone having trouble getting them the right shape.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time actually seeing the precise placement because of this.</li>

            <li> The stencils are stiff and difficult to use, but if you have patience, the eyebrows look good</li>
            <li> Also, priced a little high.</li>
            <li> I even bought several backups just in case I loose the one I am using now.</li>
            <li> They need to make one that is a little wider for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> The results were awful, one eyebrow was perfectly centered while I could never get the other, hah!</li>
            <li> Also, for me, I think I would only use one out of the four stencils, as the other three seem to be to big/full and I prefer a slim brow.</li>
            <li> All the stencils are a little on the short side.  </li>
            <li> As is, I have to add a little extra at the end of my eyebrow</li>
            <li> I have bought other eyebrow stencils in the past but they were always too big for my face.</li>
            <li> I probably should&#x27;ve given the product a higher rating as there is nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> its really hard to hold it in place and do your eyebrows at the same time.</li>
            <li> $4.00.(They have been out of stock there for a few months).</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll have a mess!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are way bigger than anyone&#x27;s eyebrows I&#x27;ve ever seen...</li>
            <li> I lost my eyebrows after my first cycle of chemo. Theses stencils are awesome.</li>
            <li> Too Unnatural looking. Although comes in package of four, three are way to large. Perhaps could use for stage makeup, but not for normal wear. Also, priced a little high. I usually get at Walmart for @ $4.00.(They have been out of stock there for a few months).</li>
            <li> My brows are somewhat sparse but the shape is still visible and easy to replicate.The stencil was easy to use with my eyebrow pencil. The classic stencil frames my face perfectly. I knew right away that it would be the right one. After using it, my brows look shaped and well groomed but not too thick. It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have used these eyebrow stencils for many years and use them everyday.  I love them so much I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without them. I have bought other eyebrow stencils in the past but they were always too big for my face. These are the best shape for my face and the right size.  When I go shopping for makeup the people working the makeup counter always ask how do I do my eyebrows because they look so perfect and it&#x27;s because of these stencils.  I even bought several backups just in case I loose the one I am using now. If you are looking for a good eyebrow stencil you should try these!!</li>
            <li> Great stencil...need to trim with scissors for more accuracy.</li>
            <li> The stencils were stiff plastic material and very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> this is a stencil to shape non existent eyebrows. works like a charm</li>
            <li> Great stencils if you want cartoonishly thick, six inch long eyebrows. If you use a sharpie to do your brows these are the miracle you&#x27;ve been searching for!</li>
            <li> All the stencils are a little on the short side.  They need to make one that is a little wider for a more dramatic look. As is, I have to add a little extra at the end of my eyebrow so it looks normal.  I would pay more if the stencil was wider and bigger.  I would recommend buying an eye shadow to use with it instead of an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried eyebrow stencils, and for me, they didn&#x27;t work out too well. The problem I found with these stencils have to do with the fact that they are on a clear/transparent piece of plastic. I had a hard time actually seeing the precise placement because of this. In the future I will look for coloured stencils as I&#x27;m sure it will be much easier to see exactly where they are being placed. Also, for me, I think I would only use one out of the four stencils, as the other three seem to be to big/full and I prefer a slim brow.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase. This will make putting on eyebrows easily. Looks exactly like the photos and the arch options are great.</li>
            <li> I probably should&#x27;ve given the product a higher rating as there is nothing wrong with it I suppose, more of a user error. I had never used an eyebrow stencil and tried it with the Lorac &amp;#34;Take a Brow&amp;#34; kit. The results were awful, one eyebrow was perfectly centered while I could never get the other, hah! These are not the solve all I was looking for and will continue on my perfect brow saga, with a little effort and time these could probably work for someone, however I am looking for something I take to immediately as I do not have the time to dally with my eyebrows for hours.</li>
            <li> The stencils are stiff and difficult to use, but if you have patience, the eyebrows look good</li>
            <li> These work exactly as described. There&#x27;s a shape for everyone. They were very inexpensive. They come in a nice re -  sealable little packet. You can hold it over your brow and use eyeshadow for an instant, perfect even brow. You can use a sharpened pencil to give the appearance of individual hairs. These are a great, simple idea well executed. I highly recommend them for anyone with thinning brows, or anyone having trouble getting them the right shape. Just remember to clean it before you turn it over to do the other side or you&#x27;ll have a mess!</li>
            <li> The above questions don&#x27;t really fit the product so I will just say, it&#x27;s great having eyebrows!  I have two scars I got as a child on my brows and they have never grown in correctly.  I&#x27;ve also never felt good about the results I was getting filling them in on my own.  This way I just stick the stencil on my brow, fill it in and voila!  The only difficulty is getting the stencil level on both sides of your brows but that&#x27;s a human mistake.  There are 4 stencils in the package and I went through them all and chose which was the best for me.  I highly recommend this product, especially if you have no confidence in your ability to put on good brows.</li>
            <li> its really hard to hold it in place and do your eyebrows at the same time.</li>
