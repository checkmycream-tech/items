    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;I was so impressed I decided to try it for 1 week.</li>
            <li>Very impressed by the product.</li>
            <li>works perfect</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>It works perfectly just as good as the whitestrips.</li>
            <li>well i just pushed all of it to the bottom and cut a hole like im frosting a cake almost lol and used it that way...</li>
            <li>til you get your results lol</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>This works great for me &amp; hope it will for you too.</li>
            <li>ya go lol :P</li>
            <li>I will say, this works amazingly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have another to give a good review.</li>
            <li>I continued to use it for 1 week to give it a fair review.</li>
            <li>cause I feel like the tray doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job with keeping saliva out.</li>
            <li>me sensitivity wise.</li>
            <li>and i intend to purchase more and give as gifts......</li>
            <li>more like 5 min twice a day</li>
            <li>it is better off to go to the store</li>
            <li>and but the 3d whitening strips that they show on tv they work so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this system.  </li>
            <li>But at the end of the day I can&#x27;t complain I&#x27;m pleased with my investment and results.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to make  sure that saliva doesn&#x27;t get into contact with the gel.</li>
            <li>This makes me even more paranoid</li>
            <li>Try using petroleum jelly around the gums if you see it causes a burning sensation to prevent this but make sure to keep it away from the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Also, I make sure to follow the directions and not overly fill the tray but keep product even.</li>
            <li>glad i found this</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Since it was cheap, and the reviews so good, I purchased the system and it really works!</li>
            <li>MANY THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions are easy</li>
            <li>Things were fine</li>
            <li>I stumbled on this product on amazon,  read all the great reviews and decided to head out to my local dollar tree to buy one.  </li>
            <li>but I ordered a led teeth whitening light.</li>
            <li>The tray is rubber, and comfortable in your mouth.</li>
            <li>and It was just a gut feeling purchase because of how cheap it was</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth lightly before applying and do a thorough brushing after.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>It shipped in just one day, but I would have been fine waiting for three to five days if it meant I was getting the full</li>
            <li>you will be on your way to a whiter smile!</li>
            <li>great price for the priduct not much to say about it</li>
            <li>And the gel is very gentle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth 99 cents and ended up paying close to $10 for each with shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>I used the dazzling White pen and the light white</li>
            <li>but I remove the tray quickly, rinse, rub product off the teeth really well, rinseagain, floss &amp; then brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was away for some weeks (went to see my first grandchild, Yea!)and he came out to visit me, i noticed his teeth were \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;</li>
            <li>well first of the oackage is a plastic bag</li>
            <li>I love the short time frame for use.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 packs since it&#x27;s only a buck each to make sure</li>
            <li>I used the dazzling White pen first along with Colgate Optic White toothpaste and rinse.</li>
            <li>The first two times I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use the Natural White gel again tomorrow with the light for 20 minutes and with better results I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li>and i used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>From the first use yes they are whiter than when i started</li>
            <li>Noticed a lot of reviews on many different sites show people using this product more than the intended times per day, minutes, or total days recommended.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I know if I used it more I would see a big difference.</li>
            <li>Tastes funny, lightened?</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>and my teeth are already SO much whiter.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing in 1 week.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable difference already.</li>
            <li>My suggestion if your budget does allow much run don&#x27;t walk to Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li>It just nudges at my gums and makes me feel really paranoid about the process.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>, well it works I&#x27;ve been using it for two days straight twice a day</li>
            <li>I just insert mouthpiece &amp; rub front panel really well in order to disperse the product evenly on the teeth.</li>
            <li>The 5th day really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>I have 9 days more to go &amp; expect the whitening process to slowly but surely continue without major inconvenience or discomfort.</li>
            <li>well very well for the time frame at present), &amp; hope will continue to slowly but surely lighten more.  </li>
            <li>Hey I can live with that!</li>
            <li>I bought the Natural White 5 minute whitening gel the same time I bought the dazzling White pen at Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li>Today I used the Natural White 5 minute whitening gel with the led light and</li>
            <li>wow I only had the gel on my teeth for literally 5 minutes with the light and my teeth whitened 1 shade.</li>
            <li>I went back and bought 4 tubes after the first week!</li>
            <li>Its all natural and really whitens tour teeth with out doing yhen</li>
            <li>I reached in the package only to find the gel had exploded out of the cap and made a nice mess.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know if it&#x27;s under a new name, or if there is anything out there comparable?</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t count that against the product though since its pretty much inevitable.</li>
            <li>no regrets thanks</li>
            <li>why not\\&quot; I came home with total lack of faith and after the first two days I saw visible results.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine bought some as well near Nashville and had the exact same results I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married soon and was about to pay $140 to have my teeth professionally whitened, but decided to try the Natural White again before I paid all that money</li>
            <li>After the 2nd day I saw a very noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>so do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>The box claimed some people may be sensitive to the whitening strips, but that it won&#x27;t harm your teeth.</li>
            <li>With this product (the 5 minute natural tooth whitening system) I never got that shock of pain.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, and the Whitestrips just made my mouth and teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve left in my mouth for 20 minutes at a time, twice a day, for four days, and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.</li>
            <li>Oh amdi am also really young.</li>
            <li>Pls note: I am not expecting veneer or capped teeth whiteness as my tooth enamel is not in that range and never will be but is naturally a combo of varying shades &amp; has always been the case.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m known to have sensitive gums and teeth so that may not be a problem for others.</li>
            <li>I never thought it would actually work, seeing as it is so cheap compared to other teeth whitening products that are $30 or $40.</li>
            <li>The tray works just fine for me as I have a small mouth -</li>
            <li>Buy the Lavoris whitening rinse, the Natural White Radiant White Extreme toothpaste, Natural White 5 minute whitening gel, order a led whitening light follow the directions and work out a plan that works for you.</li>
            <li>I have been using this, along with \\&quot;Natural White Sensitive Extreme\\&quot; toothpaste that I also got for $1 at the Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li>Well I can say I am pleasantly surprised at the results I&#x27;ve received in only five applications.</li>
            <li>The only con is that when putting the mouth tray in it sort made my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>I will maintain the results using whitening rinse prior to brushing, &amp; toothwhitening pen as this product procedure is not recommended for very frequent use) though probably every 6 months will repeat treatment ONLY IF Dentist oks</li>
            <li>Due to tooth sensitivity, I&#x27;ve used toothpaste particular to this issue for years.</li>
            <li>so I really needed to brighten my teeth as I had noticed them yellowing quite a bit but wanted to try something different as the whitening strips have such varying reviews &amp; have gotten very pricy in last few years, and frankly, I just wasn&#x27;t up to the time it takes for whitening on a daily basis for weeks, having to deal with the mess, and time it takes per session.</li>

            <li> Due to tooth sensitivity, I&#x27;ve used toothpaste particular to this issue for years.</li>
            <li> so I really needed to brighten my teeth as I had noticed them yellowing quite a bit but wanted to try something different as the whitening strips have such varying reviews &amp; have gotten very pricy in last few years, and frankly, I just wasn&#x27;t up to the time it takes for whitening on a daily basis for weeks, having to deal with the mess, and time it takes per session.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62, so my teeth have had a long time to age.</li>
            <li> Had slight irritation of the area of skin that attaches your upper gum and inside upper lip, but I just stop for 2 days and restart and all is well.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this over any other teeth whitening solution.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer I got this at the Dollar Tree for only $1.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how well it whitens, and maybe get this up to a four star, but due to the loss of whitening gel mentioned above it won&#x27;t reach five.</li>
            <li> 30 days before starting this whitening procedure (or any other) to prevent this problem with whitening products</li>
            <li> This worked for a minor change in shading, but to say that it actually whitens, that&#x27;s not true.  </li>
            <li> Between the two products combined my teeth are already a few shades whiter after only 4 days of use so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that a few years ago, when I did use Crest Whitening Strips, they always gave me a sudden shock of pain while I&#x27;d wear them.</li>
            <li> each so no big loss, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> As for sensitivity, at times you will feel sensitivity but not like other brands that i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> However those other brands have whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> so if you have a small mouth you might want a thinner one and also it doesnt reach all the way to the back of the mouth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I stumbled on this product on amazon,  read all the great reviews and decided to head out to my local dollar tree to buy one.  I will say, this works amazingly! Its my 3rd day and I can notice my teeth get one shade whiter every day. And the gel is very gentle! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums or burn in any way! Plus, it tastes like nothing. The costitency of the product feels weird. But for a dollar? Hey I can live with that!</li>
            <li> My husband purchased the 5 Minute Whitener from Dollar Tree. I was away for some weeks (went to see my first grandchild, Yea!)and he came out to visit me, i noticed his teeth were \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed I decided to try it for 1 week. After the 2nd day I saw a very noticeable difference.  This really does work.</li>
            <li> This item costs only a dollar at my local dollar tree store and I have only used it twice and my teeth are already SO much whiter. I definitely recommend this over any other teeth whitening solution.</li>
            <li> I bought this for 1 us in ny, brooklyn.....started to use it reluctantly......was amazed that the thing did make my teeth whiter....hmmmmmmmm.............dont need to go to the dentist anymore and i intend to purchase more and give as gifts......NEAT PRODUCT!!!....MANY THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> well first of the oackage is a plastic bag and so in the mail something bot put ontop of it and the stuff in the tube exploded and it was all over.... well i just pushed all of it to the bottom and cut a hole like im frosting a cake almost lol and used it that way... 5 min my @$$ more like 5 min twice a day til you get your results lol.. it is better off to go to the store and but the 3d whitening strips that they show on tv they work so much better. so do not waste your money.  that or if you are that concerened go to your dentist and get a whiteing treatment. lol</li>
            <li> I love this system.  My teeth are very sensitive.  This product does not leave my teeth hurting and yet get them whiter.  I love the short time frame for use.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer I got this at the Dollar Tree for only $1. I never thought it would actually work, seeing as it is so cheap compared to other teeth whitening products that are $30 or $40. I have been using this, along with \\&quot;Natural White Sensitive Extreme\\&quot; toothpaste that I also got for $1 at the Dollar Tree. Between the two products combined my teeth are already a few shades whiter after only 4 days of use so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add that a few years ago, when I did use Crest Whitening Strips, they always gave me a sudden shock of pain while I&#x27;d wear them. The box claimed some people may be sensitive to the whitening strips, but that it won&#x27;t harm your teeth. I stopped using them because the shock felt as if my teeth were being drilled into (that&#x27;s the type of pain I felt). So I thought I could never use a whitening product again until I found the 5 minute whitening gel at the Dollar Tree. With this product (the 5 minute natural tooth whitening system) I never got that shock of pain. That&#x27;s a definite plus!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the local Dollar Tree after seeing reviews here. I bought 3 packs since it&#x27;s only a buck each to make sure if I had a bad batch I&#x27;d have another to give a good review. This stuff does not work. It&#x27;s like putting vaseline in your mounth, and tastes about like it too. I continued to use it for 1 week to give it a fair review. It did absolutely nothing in 1 week. Absolutely disgusting, and 0 results. A friend of mine bought some as well near Nashville and had the exact same results I did. Thankfully, it&#x27;s only a buck each so no big loss, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This worked for a minor change in shading, but to say that it actually whitens, that&#x27;s not true.  As for sensitivity, at times you will feel sensitivity but not like other brands that i&#x27;ve tried.  However those other brands have whitened my teeth.  By the way I ordered two of these and was charged shipping and handling for separate orders, when they came in the same package.  It&#x27;s worth 99 cents and ended up paying close to $10 for each with shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Since it was cheap, and the reviews so good, I purchased the system and it really works! I&#x27;ve been at it, twice a day, for a few days a week, for about a month. Had slight irritation of the area of skin that attaches your upper gum and inside upper lip, but I just stop for 2 days and restart and all is well. Very noticeable difference already. I&#x27;m not a smoker and I don&#x27;t drink wine. Just very occasional diet colas. I&#x27;m 62, so my teeth have had a long time to age. This still works. It appears discontinued. Does anyone know if it&#x27;s under a new name, or if there is anything out there comparable? Such a shame if it disappears.</li>
            <li> Came in quickly&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are easy&lt;br /&gt;Just started using it so I hope it works well&lt;br /&gt;I would order it again</li>
            <li> I bought this at The Dollar Tree. I have sensitive teeth, and the Whitestrips just made my mouth and teeth hurt. This product is simple to use and doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity. I noticed a difference after one use. If you find the tray uncomfortable, try another. For $1, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at dollar tree after reading some reviews on here and decided why not, it&#x27;s only a dollar. Well I can say I am pleasantly surprised at the results I&#x27;ve received in only five applications. I would say my teeth have whitened at least 4-6 shades. Only downfall is the gel isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;tasteful\\&quot; as other expensive brands but it still gets the job done. It also seems to burn your tongue if you happen to touch the gel with your tongue. For this, I am giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> OMG! I bought the Natural White 5 minute whitening gel the same time I bought the dazzling White pen at Dollar Tree. I used the dazzling White pen first along with Colgate Optic White toothpaste and rinse. Things were fine but I ordered a led teeth whitening light. The first two times I used it I used the dazzling White pen and the light white so-so results. Today I used the Natural White 5 minute whitening gel with the led light and wow I only had the gel on my teeth for literally 5 minutes with the light and my teeth whitened 1 shade. I ordered some Dr Songs 44% gel by the time it arrives I may not need it. I&#x27;m going to use the Natural White gel again tomorrow with the light for 20 minutes and with better results I&#x27;ll post an update. But at the end of the day I can&#x27;t complain I&#x27;m pleased with my investment and results. My suggestion if your budget does allow much run don&#x27;t walk to Dollar Tree. Buy the Lavoris whitening rinse, the Natural White Radiant White Extreme toothpaste, Natural White 5 minute whitening gel, order a led whitening light follow the directions and work out a plan that works for you. You won&#x27;t be sorry for less than 10 bucks you will be on your way to a whiter smile!</li>
            <li> However since I lost out on one or two applications I have to mark it down. I reached in the package only to find the gel had exploded out of the cap and made a nice mess. It shipped in just one day, but I would have been fine waiting for three to five days if it meant I was getting the full product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it now, and just a warning, don&#x27;t let your tongue hit it, as expected, it tastes awful. I don&#x27;t count that against the product though since its pretty much inevitable. The tray is rubber, and comfortable in your mouth. We&#x27;ll see how well it whitens, and maybe get this up to a four star, but due to the loss of whitening gel mentioned above it won&#x27;t reach five.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of this system awhile ago and have used it all up. It works perfectly just as good as the whitestrips.</li>
            <li> The tray system is incedibly uncomfortable for me. It just nudges at my gums and makes me feel really paranoid about the process. The instructions say to make  sure that saliva doesn&#x27;t get into contact with the gel. This makes me even more paranoid cause I feel like the tray doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job with keeping saliva out. I&#x27;ve left in my mouth for 20 minutes at a time, twice a day, for four days, and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change. I don&#x27;t think I can keep using the uncomfortable tray anymore, I&#x27;ll probably try a different solution.</li>
            <li> I just got this and i used it for the first time. The mouth guard thing is a little bulgy so if you have a small mouth you might want a thinner one and also it doesnt reach all the way to the back of the mouth. When i started reading the reviews for this product some of them talked about how it burned snd sometimes bleached their gums. Well i put a little petroleum jelly on my gums to protect them and i had no burning or bleaching at all. From the first use yes they are whiter than when i started but i dont know if this is as white as they get. I can report back to you guys in a week of using it and then tell you if its a big difference. Oh and i dont smoke. Idk why i put that in but i felt it was necessiary lol. Oh amdi am also really young. I dont know if that factors in to any thing but yeahhh there ya go lol :P</li>
            <li> great price for the priduct not much to say about it tho it was a small purchase no regrets thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the dollar tree and I had some coffee stains on my teeth ams this stuff really works. Stains are gone. And I didnt pay an arm and a leg for it. Try it you want be sorry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few years ago, used it for a few days and it worked. I&#x27;m getting married soon and was about to pay $140 to have my teeth professionally whitened, but decided to try the Natural White again before I paid all that money, well it works I&#x27;ve been using it for two days straight twice a day and it&#x27;s doing the job. It says for 5 minutes but I leave it on longer. For a dollar you can&#x27;t beat that. I purchased it at the Dollar Tree!</li>
            <li> We have tried a number of different types of whitening gels.  I don&#x27;t want the fake-looking white teeth that I see so often.  I want something that will keep away stains, keep my teeth a natural-white color, and something that doesn&#x27;t take a long time or taste awful.  This is the product that does that for me.  I can use the tray while I am showering and brush afterwards.  Done!  Sometimes I just use it with my toothpaste and brush.  That&#x27;s it.  It is simple, inexpensive and it works.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, and burned my gums.</li>
            <li> Due to tooth sensitivity, I&#x27;ve used toothpaste particular to this issue for years. Suggest anyone intending to use this product start using one about 2 weeks - 30 days before starting this whitening procedure (or any other) to prevent this problem with whitening products. I am a 2-3 cup of coffee a day drinker and have smoked on &amp; off for years. Also, haven&#x27;t used whitening strip or other whitening products(except for toothpaste with whitener &amp; Listerine Whitening Rinse for maintenance which I must say, makes a difference in just 60 days but stopped it to try this). Overkill not recommended during use of this product to avoid possible unpleasant experience. I&#x27;d not used whitening strips in over 2 years so I really needed to brighten my teeth as I had noticed them yellowing quite a bit but wanted to try something different as the whitening strips have such varying reviews &amp; have gotten very pricy in last few years, and frankly, I just wasn&#x27;t up to the time it takes for whitening on a daily basis for weeks, having to deal with the mess, and time it takes per session. Anything faster or stronger is not an option for me sensitivity wise. Noticed a lot of reviews on many different sites show people using this product more than the intended times per day, minutes, or total days recommended.  It is for MAX 14 days to be applied 2x per day (am &amp; pm) for a total of 5 minutes per application. Try using petroleum jelly around the gums if you see it causes a burning sensation to prevent this but make sure to keep it away from the teeth.  The tray works just fine for me as I have a small mouth - I just insert mouthpiece &amp; rub front panel really well in order to disperse the product evenly on the teeth. Also, I make sure to follow the directions and not overly fill the tray but keep product even. Perhaps those that get it unto their gums overfill the tray? It doesn&#x27;t taste aweful just not pleasant but I remove the tray quickly, rinse, rub product off the teeth really well, rinseagain, floss &amp; then brush my teeth. I DO NOT FLOSS PRIOR TO USING IT! Think this may cause possible burning if done after flossing. Results:  The 5th day really noticed a difference.  Think if you follow the advise herein you might do well with it.  I have 9 days more to go &amp; expect the whitening process to slowly but surely continue without major inconvenience or discomfort. My Mother even noticed the difference though slight (but well very well for the time frame at present), &amp; hope will continue to slowly but surely lighten more.  Pls note: I am not expecting veneer or capped teeth whiteness as my tooth enamel is not in that range and never will be but is naturally a combo of varying shades &amp; has always been the case. I do not want wonders at the expense of my tooth enamel, gums, inconvenience, or pain. This works great for me &amp; hope it will for you too. Very impressed by the product. (PS: I will maintain the results using whitening rinse prior to brushing, &amp; toothwhitening pen as this product procedure is not recommended for very frequent use) though probably every 6 months will repeat treatment ONLY IF Dentist oks the frequency I intend to use it. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something that would whiten my teeth and not only did this not work but it was annoying to use. Wish it did something because you can&#x27;t beat the price...</li>
            <li> doesnt work point blank period.</li>
            <li> works perfect glad i found this i recommended it to some friends of mine  i love this product thank you</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT THAT I WOULD NOT  TELL ANYONE TO BUY BECAUSE IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME BUT IF ANYONE WANT TO BUY THEY ARE ON THERE ON</li>
            <li> It really works! Its all natural and really whitens tour teeth with out doing yhen any such harm what so ever</li>
            <li> I used this only for a couple days, 2-3 times a day for about 5-10mins each time, and I&#x27;ve seen results already! I never thought it would work and It was just a gut feeling purchase because of how cheap it was and I&#x27;ve already tried everything so I said \\&quot;ehh, why not\\&quot; I came home with total lack of faith and after the first two days I saw visible results. Its tastes as though the same stuff they use on Crest whitestrips but without the price! The only con is that when putting the mouth tray in it sort made my teeth sensitive but I&#x27;m known to have sensitive gums and teeth so that may not be a problem for others. Other than that this product blew my mind and I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple days! \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; is definatly not the case here!</li>
            <li> Like everyone else bought at the dollar tree thinking why not its a dollar. I went back and bought 4 tubes after the first week!</li>
            <li> I have used this tooth whitening gel for about 15 years now. I simply apply with my fingers and leave on for about 10 minutes, usually when I am in the shower. I brush my teeth lightly before applying and do a thorough brushing after.&lt;br /&gt;Using once a week is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use strips as they make my teeth ache almost immediately. This does not.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
            <li> I guess it works alright. I know if I used it more I would see a big difference. So that being said it does what it says</li>
            <li> Tastes funny, lightened? Not really. But I only do this once a day so eh. But I guess it lightened my teeth a little t least.</li>
