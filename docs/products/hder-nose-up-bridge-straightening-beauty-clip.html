    <ol>
            <li>I wish them the best of luck!</li>
            <li>and happy that the product worked!!!</li>
            <li>Love the item!!!</li>
            <li>my nose broke out of this thing like the incredible hulk.</li>
            <li>and i love how it turned out! :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;m seeing results.</li>
            <li>it is fairly noticeable.</li>
            <li>Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it would have cost me more!</li>
            <li>You gotta position it your own way</li>
            <li>Liked the product.</li>
            <li>I used the nose clip as well as applying some castor oil with warm compresses applied to my nose.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to see if it would have worked though...  </li>
            <li>, I honestly don&#x27;t think there is anyway to alter your nose bridge.</li>
            <li>to kind of even them out.</li>
            <li>and I had a nice form.</li>
            <li>(that one is very comfortable to use)</li>
            <li>They were very concerned and offered beautiful customer service in spite of. :-)  </li>
            <li>OK reasons</li>
            <li>(Because that would be hilarious).</li>
            <li>I use it 30-45 minutes a day, before bed, and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>thank you :)</li>
            <li>but actually it&#x27;s more for pinching the lower nose area to make it seem like it&#x27;s getting thiner</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s how it does its magic</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>This product will work... if I can eventually stand to use it more than 4 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>but i love it...</li>
            <li>I see in the blog that it has helped many people.  </li>
            <li>I like it WAY better than the nose</li>
            <li>The longer you can stand it the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews like \\&quot;It snapped in half!\\</li>
            <li>Now: bridge and more even nostrils.</li>
            <li>Straightening doesn&#x27;t change the wideness but it in a sense creates greater length and thus disguising the wideness.   </li>
            <li>ok so this item does work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I eventually got one.</li>
            <li>a good way to get around that is to use rubbing alcohol on your skin first.</li>
            <li>The nose up is a good product and is not useless.</li>
            <li>You will have to make sure your face is washed and oil free to received the desired result.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an original version that appears to better.</li>
            <li>so note that It can crack extremely easily.</li>
            <li>BUT it gives very very quick results.</li>
            <li>It may work just fine if you have a itty bitty nose</li>
            <li>Super like and love the item</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge nose difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I tried this simple gadget.</li>
            <li>The product is made to look as if it should have some sort of silicone grip so that it can be comfortable on the nose</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>I think it works because my nose looks straighter, and its cheap and affordable.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless it is a cheap product so you can experience it as well instead of having someone telling to avoid doing it</li>
            <li>purchase came fast, and in excellent condition, i would definitely recommend this seller..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it will do the job and be much comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more successful with it when I turn it upside down that way</li>
            <li>it slides right off!</li>
            <li>It would be better if those inside part have cousy, its inside part is very pointy and hurts after couple mintues.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit right on my nose</li>
            <li>and I can place it many different ways on my nose without comfort and still be able to breath--because of that</li>
            <li>you just have to keep it on for about an hour a day to see QUICK results.</li>
            <li>It really hurts and slides off easily..</li>
            <li>The pictures and the promising description makes it sound like it&#x27;ll work</li>
            <li>Whether it works for you or not, it&#x27;s probably worth a shot because of</li>
            <li>I just had to laugh.</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>I am looking at it right now</li>
            <li>im assuming that its not even the right product.   </li>
            <li>It slid right off of my nose.  </li>
            <li>right that I have because it clips on tighter</li>
            <li>This nose clip is simple and great design applies just enough pressure</li>
            <li>So far it lays on my nose just fine and stays.</li>
            <li>I had a good nose(my mom would pinch my nose as a little kid</li>
            <li>First of all, the product shown here in the image is not what you get.</li>
            <li>the pretty picture</li>
            <li>Even though i look funny with i wear it</li>
            <li>SURE you do the following</li>
            <li>: if you are using it like me to make your nose smaller (or not) make sure that when you place it on your nose--your nostrils are symmetric.</li>
            <li>The first nose up</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on how they never noticed that i had such a pretty nose shape before.</li>
            <li>Broke when putting over nose first time.</li>
            <li>Broke after first time use.</li>
            <li>I personally had surgery for my nose and use this tool to straighten the cartilage out even more than the surgery has done.</li>
            <li>so I did not recieve mine at first.</li>
            <li>It just slips off and makes a funny noise.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest and as this product really did make my nose narrower, you would have to use this every single day to see the results--meaning if you stopped using it</li>
            <li>I have seen a positive change and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I was originally looking into a nose job because I&#x27;m a major perfectionist about certain things.</li>
            <li>Lol, I am typical asian and I have A FRIGGAN BRIDGE now.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think this product is a straight rip off of nasofix.</li>
            <li>I got it really cheap so to send it back</li>
            <li>i really dont care what color it is</li>
            <li>This thing does not stay on your nose and really does nothing.</li>
            <li>Cheap packaging, all instructions were in Chinese and had to look at pictures to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I give it 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t straight my nose at all.</li>
            <li>Well from my experience it really does work</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>This is absolute junk.</li>
            <li>I can keep it on for much longer</li>
            <li>, I really do like it.</li>
            <li>If your nose is more than 4 cm wide then don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>SO IF YOU WANT A STRAIGHT NOSE, DON&#x27;T GET THIS.</li>
            <li>This really helped to orient the straightness of my bridge, while the nose clip(nose</li>
            <li>/&gt;i ended up getting real rhinoplasty.</li>
            <li>It came off too much, basically.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t wanted to keep seeing if it works since I just wanted to experiment but without hurting myself.</li>
            <li>so it didnt fit like the Asian lady on the box.</li>
            <li>but I really think this thing might work it pushes on the cartilage</li>
            <li>so if you wear it over and over it will put it straight.</li>
            <li>They wanted to help correct the situation and refunded me back in full.</li>
            <li>ok if you bought this put a cloth down on ur nose</li>
            <li>Overall, it is price worthy though.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if you are a adult, this could only fit a child</li>
            <li>and it actually made my nose more flat than what I was born with.</li>
            <li>The top and bottom of the holding plastic has little edges that prevent the pads from being taken off or changed, something the package claims it can do.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic thats not very flexible</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t stretch it so far and be gentle with it.   </li>
            <li>Some people were just too rough with it or had a huge nose.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal shape.</li>
            <li>Most likely harder than the white/clear cushion.</li>
            <li>the rubber was very soft</li>
            <li>Next, I have ordered this item before with no issues it was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>however, the second time (I had lost the first)</li>
            <li>(like they had said to make up for the first order) the second time.</li>
            <li>The silicone pad is removable and can be flipped accordingly depending on the size of your nose or how tight you want it to fit.</li>
            <li>I promise you that you will not get any results others than having three large red dots on both sides of your nose for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>no less!</li>
            <li>but I recommend the hard one if you can stand it :)</li>
            <li>Do not waste the money on this nose pincher.  </li>
            <li>maybe thats why they say to wear for a complete month or two??</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and a waste of your money.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit my nose at all and was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li>It has given me a more defined bridge and a pointier tip whereas before I had a relatively flat and round nose.  </li>
            <li>It will not work on people with VERY broad noses.</li>
            <li>I had ordered back in the beginning of march so was dissapointed when I had expected two products because of the overall experience, but o well at least the problem was fixed quickly :)</li>
            <li>So many negative reviews here,saying this is for smaller nosed people.</li>
            <li>While these devices will most likely never deliver rhinoplasty results, it will probably help to subtly shape your nose.</li>
            <li>Right now it feels really really tight</li>
            <li>it doesnt come like that light pink with clear little circly ends,</li>
            <li>Even as a white elephant gift, it is a great disappointment (and totally hate-able).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see results only after one week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll edit this review if anything changes, but thus far, I have enough evidence to conclude that this product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My only concern is my nose goes back to normal after a day...</li>
            <li>I use it upside down on my nostrils, hugging around the tip, aligned with my bridge(which is much sharper now with the noseright/jiahe clip~!)</li>
            <li>and it will start to change your nose significantly if worn at least 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is important to know because it does take time however, if you seriously are discontent with your nose</li>
            <li>What was I even thinking in purchasing something this cheap and ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Plus the completely inept plastic surgeon actually made the tip of my nose appear larger at the tip.   </li>
            <li>Let me say I am African American,so naturally my nose is a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>It is also tiny and barely resembles the image.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry, but if you have a huge nose this is not going to work for you!</li>

            <li> They were very concerned and offered beautiful customer service in spite of. :-)  </li>
            <li> OK reasons</li>

            <li> I use it 30-45 minutes a day, before bed, and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thank you :)</li>
            <li> but actually it&#x27;s more for pinching the lower nose area to make it seem like it&#x27;s getting thiner</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s how it does its magic</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews like \\&quot;It snapped in half!\\</li>
            <li> Now: bridge and more even nostrils.</li>
            <li> Straightening doesn&#x27;t change the wideness but it in a sense creates greater length and thus disguising the wideness.   </li>
            <li> ok so this item does work</li>

            <li> worth every penny</li>
            <li> I am looking at it right now</li>
            <li> im assuming that its not even the right product.   </li>
            <li> It slid right off of my nose.  </li>
            <li> right that I have because it clips on tighter</li>
            <li> This nose clip is simple and great design applies just enough pressure</li>
            <li> So far it lays on my nose just fine and stays.</li>

            <li> SURE you do the following</li>
            <li> : if you are using it like me to make your nose smaller (or not) make sure that when you place it on your nose--your nostrils are symmetric.</li>
            <li> The first nose up</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>

            <li> I can keep it on for much longer</li>
            <li> , I really do like it.</li>
            <li> If your nose is more than 4 cm wide then don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> SO IF YOU WANT A STRAIGHT NOSE, DON&#x27;T GET THIS.</li>
            <li> This really helped to orient the straightness of my bridge, while the nose clip(nose</li>
            <li> /&gt;i ended up getting real rhinoplasty.</li>
            <li> It came off too much, basically.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t wanted to keep seeing if it works since I just wanted to experiment but without hurting myself.</li>
            <li> so it didnt fit like the Asian lady on the box.</li>
            <li> but I really think this thing might work it pushes on the cartilage</li>
            <li> so if you wear it over and over it will put it straight.</li>
            <li> They wanted to help correct the situation and refunded me back in full.</li>
            <li> ok if you bought this put a cloth down on ur nose</li>
            <li> Overall, it is price worthy though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you are a adult, this could only fit a child</li>
            <li> and it actually made my nose more flat than what I was born with.</li>
            <li> The top and bottom of the holding plastic has little edges that prevent the pads from being taken off or changed, something the package claims it can do.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic thats not very flexible</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t stretch it so far and be gentle with it.   </li>
            <li> Some people were just too rough with it or had a huge nose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal shape.</li>
            <li> Most likely harder than the white/clear cushion.</li>
            <li> the rubber was very soft</li>
            <li> Next, I have ordered this item before with no issues it was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> however, the second time (I had lost the first)</li>
            <li> (like they had said to make up for the first order) the second time.</li>
            <li> The silicone pad is removable and can be flipped accordingly depending on the size of your nose or how tight you want it to fit.</li>
            <li> I promise you that you will not get any results others than having three large red dots on both sides of your nose for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> no less!</li>
            <li> but I recommend the hard one if you can stand it :)</li>
            <li> Do not waste the money on this nose pincher.  </li>
            <li> maybe thats why they say to wear for a complete month or two??</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit my nose at all and was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It has given me a more defined bridge and a pointier tip whereas before I had a relatively flat and round nose.  </li>
            <li> It will not work on people with VERY broad noses.</li>
            <li> I had ordered back in the beginning of march so was dissapointed when I had expected two products because of the overall experience, but o well at least the problem was fixed quickly :)</li>
            <li> So many negative reviews here,saying this is for smaller nosed people.</li>
            <li> While these devices will most likely never deliver rhinoplasty results, it will probably help to subtly shape your nose.</li>
            <li> Right now it feels really really tight</li>
            <li> it doesnt come like that light pink with clear little circly ends,</li>
            <li> Even as a white elephant gift, it is a great disappointment (and totally hate-able).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see results only after one week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll edit this review if anything changes, but thus far, I have enough evidence to conclude that this product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My only concern is my nose goes back to normal after a day...</li>
            <li> I use it upside down on my nostrils, hugging around the tip, aligned with my bridge(which is much sharper now with the noseright/jiahe clip~!)</li>
            <li> and it will start to change your nose significantly if worn at least 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is important to know because it does take time however, if you seriously are discontent with your nose</li>
            <li> What was I even thinking in purchasing something this cheap and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Plus the completely inept plastic surgeon actually made the tip of my nose appear larger at the tip.   </li>
            <li> Let me say I am African American,so naturally my nose is a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> It is also tiny and barely resembles the image.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but if you have a huge nose this is not going to work for you!</li>
            <li> Also after I wash my face, and my skin is &#x27;tight&#x27; my nose is smaller but gets a little &#x27;fatter&#x27; or normal sized when my skin&#x27;s moisture returns to normal.</li>
            <li> I had a .. A ,&amp;#34; mario&amp;#34; nose back then now its small and straight</li>
            <li> I put 2 because I could not withstand it for long enough to prove whether it worked,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping my results will be long lasting and not revert after a day or so</li>
            <li> It is painful to use, and I don&#x27;t know whether this is something that should be sold for medical reasons (if it does what it claims to do than it should be under a supervision of a doctor kind of like braces).</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t then your nose will end up with one nostril bigger or shaped differently than the other.</li>
            <li> I tried using this post upper jaw surgery after my nose became crooked due to the procedure.</li>
            <li> So I bought this, not really to fix the bridge of my nose but rather to alter the use to make my nose smaller.</li>
            <li> And will not fit a adult nose or even stay on..</li>
            <li> One side is a tiny bit fatter than the other.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear; I love how much I hate this product.</li>
            <li> After having broken my nose in a fall, I was interested in this device as a way to straighten the bump in my nose.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and had to wear it upside down because my nose is a German nose</li>
            <li> The plastic is a hard tough plastic that breaks extremely easily</li>
            <li> The package was in Japanese and I was not sure how to switch the pads to make them both the same.</li>
            <li> It helps to have a little foam padding such as ear bud covers under the pressure points.  </li>
            <li> Also if you use it to make your nose smaller and don&#x27;t need to fix the bridge of your nose--you will have to play with it a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to distinguish which one has the soft plactic or the hard....</li>
            <li> ; there is the same nose up but with a hard plastic (quite uncomfortable)that I ended up getting the second time</li>
            <li> The material of this product contains a hard plastic which cracked and shortly thereafter it broke in two pieces, the same day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it will not make your nose any smaller.</li>
            <li> not really what I expect it.</li>
            <li> Over ten times a day coupled with one hour periods will leave marks on and around your nose because this product can be harsh on the nose if used way too often in one day.</li>
            <li> and if you decide to get it anyways BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> There were absolutely no directions delivered with it.</li>
            <li> Its completely pink, with the plastic cushion part pink as well.</li>
            <li> Before:no bridge and wide nostrils.</li>
            <li> instead of (___) wide nose,   you grow yourself :  -||-  (  ) this.</li>
            <li> so it appears not as wide.</li>
            <li> it felt like i put my face in one of those vice grips from high school shop class and just cranked it until i got tired.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic you see with the three round circles is a hard plastic and is painful plus it slips off and the plastic is so cheap and not soft</li>
            <li> nope it comes like all one color dark pink.</li>
            <li> but it will NOT work if your nose is too wide!</li>
            <li> Other than surgery</li>
            <li> One side was the longer pads, the other side was the shorter pads.</li>
            <li> The site I bought it on only claimed to give you a pointy small nose, not straighten anything.</li>
            <li> If you have an oily nose, (like i do during summer) i would recommend to use a little rubbing alcohol and then use baby powder to dry it before placing this item, when i do this the clip stays in place without sliding!&lt;br /&gt;**I</li>
            <li> After couple use it will just expand and hard to keep on same place...</li>
            <li> I use this one its hard to open and put it on my nose.</li>
            <li> At least it was only a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> it way too expensive and much to stressful for me to do it again.</li>
            <li> Was not worth returning</li>
            <li> but the average person will experience some discomfort using this product.</li>
            <li> The seller contacted me saying that they would send me the one I ordered plus an extra for the inconvenience and had asked me to errase my negative comment previously.</li>
            <li> so that was a let down...</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in the bridge of her nose, but her nose does look slightly slimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for less than $2 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> for about a half week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but enjoy trying \\&quot;gimmick products \\&quot; if the science behind them makes sense.</li>
            <li> It kinda hurts to have this on too because its tight</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s super ugly.  </li>
            <li> This is not worth buying!</li>
            <li> When I received it, the little nose pads were set to un-even sides.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit weirded out but flattered.</li>
            <li> Altho the nose up clip here does help to soften the nostril tissue and eventually decrease its form a little bit.   </li>
            <li> then when you take it off you have little circles engraved in your nose from the rubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it broke when I tried to turn the little dots to change the pressure amount.</li>
            <li> It is too little and can harm you a little.</li>
            <li> So I put it on for abut 5 mins it hurt a little</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this.    </li>
            <li> I think this is something that has to be maintained everyday, just like a retainer.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and monet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less than five bucks!).</li>
            <li> I wore it continuously for at least 6 hours a day while I did housework  and other things at home.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this in the mail today,yes it can be a bit painful at first.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time but found the clip to be very tight and not too flexible.</li>
            <li> this tool only succeeded in making my nose hurt so bad only after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> or it would come with small piece of cloth</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of this device&#x27;s actual utility but decided to give it a try anyway.  </li>
            <li> I just received it today, and the nose up bridge was too small, I just couldn&#x27;t breathe with it.</li>
            <li> Waste!</li>
            <li> Not sure why they made this.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> the  clip  is  too small  </li>
            <li> I know the small details about myself.</li>
            <li> However, sadly enough, this product was unable to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to breath when you have it on, i had to breath through my mouth.</li>
            <li> Hard plastic and not rubber against your nose.</li>
            <li> It is hard and it flies off when I&#x27;m trying to wear it according to images on Amazon.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think this product would come in a package that has a picture and a description at least...</li>
            <li> It takes time to see any difference you gotta wear it for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> At least 15 minutes a day, every day.</li>
            <li> he  sucks his  thum and flatten  his  bridge .</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what happened to me, so I no longer bother with it.</li>
            <li> have a small nose but rather \\&quot;chubby\\&quot; by the nostrils, and this has made it slimmer!</li>
            <li> I felt ridiculous wearing it around the house.</li>
            <li> It is not good for my nose, Maybe it&#x27;s not my type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable to leave on and a bit hard to put on, leaves marks after you take it off.</li>
            <li> Broken.</li>
            <li> I have a thin nose but wanted thinner nostrils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for approximately 30 min.</li>
            <li> It is inflexible.  </li>
            <li> This is hard and painful.</li>
            <li> Useless and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> So weird, doesn&#x27;t even stay out on the nose</li>
            <li> It will just irritate you skin and make you feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> , this is Extremely useless.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product.</li>
            <li> Just leaves awful red circular marks from the pressure, but they eventually go away</li>
            <li> Hmm, if you can stand the absurd pain this causes you when you put it on then maybe it will work..</li>
            <li> It was useless to me.</li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> Just useless.</li>

            <li> but it pinched it so hard i jut threw the crap out</li>
            <li> It is very painful to wear and even though I continued to wear it for a few weeks I could see no change at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s absolutely useless!</li>
            <li> and it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> it hurts really bad to use it  4)</li>
            <li> and you receive even distribution of pressure to both sides of the nose without it being too painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am looking at it right now but i tried it once and didnt like it. I am not throwing it out, i may try it again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I would give this product -1,000,000 stars if I could. First of all, the product shown here in the image is not what you get. The plastic is a hard tough plastic that breaks extremely easily and it is very uncomfortable. In fact, I think this product is a straight rip off of nasofix.</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying! I got it really cheap so to send it back it would have cost me more! Save your self the money and time!   OK reasons I hate it..   1)see the pretty picture it doesnt come like that light pink with clear little circly ends, nope it comes like all one color dark pink. i really dont care what color it is but im assuming that its not even the right product.   2)you put it on for like 5-10 min and it indents circles into your nose   3) it hurts really bad to use it  4) it just doesnt work   ok if you bought this put a cloth down on ur nose then this it helps with the indents but its not supposed to dot that or it would come with small piece of cloth</li>
            <li> What was I thinking?  Useless and ineffective.  Do not waste the money on this nose pincher.  Leave your nose alone!  You don&#x27;t need to pay for a product that will leave a scar!</li>
            <li> Bought it and it doesn&#x27;t work. It is painful to use, and I don&#x27;t know whether this is something that should be sold for medical reasons (if it does what it claims to do than it should be under a supervision of a doctor kind of like braces).</li>
            <li> This thing does not stay on your nose and really does nothing. It also leaves marks on your nose, they do go away, but it takes some time.  Cheap packaging, all instructions were in Chinese and had to look at pictures to figure out how to use it. I do not recommend this and I also found it for 99 cents on E-bay. Don&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s absolutely useless!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product (around 1 month ago) and used it 5 times or so. This product helps shape the bridge of my nose. It will not work on people with VERY broad noses.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item thinking it would work, but it didn&#x27;t.  It slid right off of my nose.  Maybe my nose is hopeless?  At least it was only a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve taken a before picture, cause Now there&#x27;s a big difference!  You gotta position it your own way and it will start to change your nose significantly if worn at least 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of this device&#x27;s actual utility but decided to give it a try anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised to see results only after one week.  It has given me a more defined bridge and a pointier tip whereas before I had a relatively flat and round nose.  While these devices will most likely never deliver rhinoplasty results, it will probably help to subtly shape your nose. Whether it works for you or not, it&#x27;s probably worth a shot because of it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> So weird, doesn&#x27;t even stay out on the nose</li>
            <li> I just received it today, and the nose up bridge was too small, I just couldn&#x27;t breathe with it. oops goes to the trash..</li>
            <li> I started using for 15 minutes and adjusting the clips from smallest to largest with some change.  I am now using it for 30 minutes several times a day.   It helps to have a little foam padding such as ear bud covers under the pressure points.  It has softened the scar tissue in my nose from rhinoplasty and straightened the bridge.  I have seen a positive change and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with buying a \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; nose clip. It will just irritate you skin and make you feel uncomfortable. I felt ridiculous wearing it around the house. It made me realize I am just wasting my time. You can&#x27;t breath while wearing it and it slips off. I wouldn&#x27;t expect results unless you somehow wore this 24 hours a day. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> just awful..It is not flexible at all...</li>
            <li> Liked the product. However, if you have oily skin, it will slip off. You will have to make sure your face is washed and oil free to received the desired result.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear; I love how much I hate this product. I bought this for a white elephant gift. Even as a white elephant gift, it is a great disappointment (and totally hate-able).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product images are misleading. You&#x27;d think this product would come in a package that has a picture and a description at least...maybe some instructions? (Because that would be hilarious). But, no, it is just a tiny piece of plastic in an unmarked plastic bag. Now I have to print off something to explain what this W.E. gift is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.- It is also tiny and barely resembles the image.</li>
            <li> * If you have an oily nose, (like i do during summer) i would recommend to use a little rubbing alcohol and then use baby powder to dry it before placing this item, when i do this the clip stays in place without sliding!&lt;br /&gt;**I have a small nose but rather \\&quot;chubby\\&quot; by the nostrils, and this has made it slimmer! I use it 30-45 minutes a day, before bed, and absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I also used the nose huggies (the blue clips) purchased through ebay about a year ago but they were terrible!!&lt;br /&gt;My purchase came fast, and in excellent condition, i would definitely recommend this seller..thank you :)</li>
            <li> This simple gadget works! I had a rhinoplasty with some scar tissue build up. Plus the completely inept plastic surgeon actually made the tip of my nose appear larger at the tip.   Costly no less! Anyhow, instead of undergoing a revision rhinoplasty. I decided to try an alternative approach to fix my botched nose job. Since reshaping the nose(cartilage is 75% water and can be simply reshaped. We&#x27;ve seen this done historically. So,evidence exists showing that yes in fact it is possible! I used the nose clip as well as applying some castor oil with warm compresses applied to my nose. This aids in dissolving scar tissue If you have scar tissue build up you can also take Serrapeptase which dissolves scar tissue. I wear the nose clip daily for 30-45 minutes, while I&#x27;m at my computer working.  This nose clip is simple and great design applies just enough pressure and you receive even distribution of pressure to both sides of the nose without it being too painful. Please do overpay. I think it shouldn&#x27;t be over $10.00. I bought mine for under 5.00! My nose is getting smaller it is fairly noticeable. Rhinoplasty revision surgery was  not the answer for me for one thing it way too expensive and much to stressful for me to do it again. The nose clip worked to make my nose smaller . I was patient and diligent about it. I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;m seeing results.I also realize everyone is different, but it worked for me I&#x27;m happy I tried this simple gadget.</li>
            <li> The pictures and the promising description makes it sound like it&#x27;ll work but Definitely listen to those who actually brought it and tried it, this is Extremely useless. It&#x27;s uncomfortable to leave on and a bit hard to put on, leaves marks after you take it off. It&#x27;s hard to breath when you have it on, i had to breath through my mouth. I wasted money on this.    It promise a bridge but actually it&#x27;s more for pinching the lower nose area to make it seem like it&#x27;s getting thiner but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Waste! My nose is way too big for this I guess. You could have used a clothes line pin and received the same results!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even stay on as soon as I put it in position it slides right off! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> This is a useless product. Not sure why they made this. Now I know why the price of this product is so low because it doesnt work at all. Dont even bother to look at it, worthless product</li>
            <li> It is not good for my nose, Maybe it&#x27;s not my type. My nose do not like it!    I give it 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t straight my nose at all.</li>
            <li> The product is made to look as if it should have some sort of silicone grip so that it can be comfortable on the nose but this is a lie. The clear plastic you see with the three round circles is a hard plastic and is painful plus it slips off and the plastic is so cheap and not soft so note that It can crack extremely easily. I rather invest in Nasofix, which I think this product is a rip off of.</li>
            <li> I have no Idea how this would have worked. I literally scarcely removed it from the package and...snap. Broken. I just had to laugh. Would have been nice to see if it would have worked though...  As an amendment: 1/24/12  I was contacted by HDE- They wanted to help correct the situation and refunded me back in full. They were very concerned and offered beautiful customer service in spite of. :-)  I wish them the best of luck!</li>
            <li> Awful pinches hurts can&#x27;t wear</li>
            <li> Some of you are saying it doesn&#x27;t and it does work. Well from my experience it really does work but it will NOT work if your nose is too wide! It takes time to see any difference you gotta wear it for at least 2 weeks. It kinda hurts to have this on too because its tight but that&#x27;s how it does its magic its reshaping your nose!</li>
            <li> Chinese item ... Not helpful</li>
            <li> There are two sides to this nose clip. The silicone pad is removable and can be flipped accordingly depending on the size of your nose or how tight you want it to fit. It is recommended that you use this clip about 15 minutes a day to achieve maximum results. I purchased this for my sister whom has been bothered by her Asian nose but never wanted to opt through surgery. I have not noticed any difference in the bridge of her nose, but her nose does look slightly slimmer. I think this is something that has to be maintained everyday, just like a retainer.  Other than surgery, I honestly don&#x27;t think there is anyway to alter your nose bridge.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it will not make your nose any smaller. Just leaves awful red circular marks from the pressure, but they eventually go away</li>
            <li> It was okay. After couple use it will just expand and hard to keep on same place... It would be better if those inside part have cousy, its inside part is very pointy and hurts after couple mintues. Overall, it is price worthy though.</li>
            <li> I use this one its hard to open and put it on my nose. and its broke already. never buy again</li>
            <li> I got mine on ebay. I have a thin nose but wanted thinner nostrils. It really hurts and slides off easily.. a good way to get around that is to use rubbing alcohol on your skin first. I&#x27;ll probably use a cotton pad underneath so it isn&#x27;t too sore during and after. This product will work... if I can eventually stand to use it more than 4 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived in the mail it looked nothing like the picture...it looked like a clothes pin scissors....so that was a let down...But I still tried it anyway for about a month no results except for my nose hurting....one day I took it off and just threw it away and decided if I needed to I would just go get cosmetic surgery for my nose. :/</li>
            <li> not really what I expect it.</li>
            <li> Hurts like a mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squeeeeeezes the bridge like it&#x27;s trying to asphyxiate me and then snaps off and flies across the room. Plus, it&#x27;s super ugly.  I put 2 because I could not withstand it for long enough to prove whether it worked,</li>
            <li> Love the item!!! Even though i look funny with i wear it but i love it... Super like and love the item</li>
            <li> BE WARNED:  Don&#x27;t make the mistake of overusing it like I did.  Over ten times a day coupled with one hour periods will leave marks on and around your nose because this product can be harsh on the nose if used way too often in one day.</li>
            <li> Hmm, if you can stand the absurd pain this causes you when you put it on then maybe it will work..but three of us tried it and immediately had to take it off.</li>
            <li> I had a .. A ,&amp;#34; mario&amp;#34; nose back then now its small and straight and i love how it turned out! :D</li>
            <li> Glad it was not so expensive as it did not work.  I see in the blog that it has helped many people.  Really?</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 2 months. At least 15 minutes a day, every day. Hasn&#x27;t made the bridge of my nose straighter one bit. I&#x27;ll edit this review if anything changes, but thus far, I have enough evidence to conclude that this product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it should have a picture to show how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for less than $2 on Amazon. When I received it, the little nose pads were set to un-even sides. One side was the longer pads, the other side was the shorter pads. The package was in Japanese and I was not sure how to switch the pads to make them both the same. The top and bottom of the holding plastic has little edges that prevent the pads from being taken off or changed, something the package claims it can do. I tried pulling on it and the device snapped into two pieces. I didn&#x27;t even get to try it!</li>
            <li> It hurts and doesn&#x27;t a difference.</li>
            <li> This is hard and painful. Hard plastic and not rubber against your nose. This is absolute junk. What a waste of money. Was not worth returning so I just threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I bought  this  to  help  with my son  nose becuase he  sucks his  thum and flatten  his  bridge . the  clip  is  too small  so  it  kept  sliding  out .</li>
            <li> So I bought this, not really to fix the bridge of my nose but rather to alter the use to make my nose smaller. I like it WAY better than the nose right that I have because it clips on tighter and I can place it many different ways on my nose without comfort and still be able to breath--because of that I can keep it on for much longer and I can already see the difference. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for approximately 30 min. sometimes more(15min there and 15min there) for about a half week. Plus it doesn&#x27;t leave the red marks on your nose as badely as the nose right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let me warn you...MAKE SURE you do the following: if you are using it like me to make your nose smaller (or not) make sure that when you place it on your nose--your nostrils are symmetric. If you don&#x27;t then your nose will end up with one nostril bigger or shaped differently than the other. Also if you use it to make your nose smaller and don&#x27;t need to fix the bridge of your nose--you will have to play with it a little bit.  I&#x27;m more successful with it when I turn it upside down that way it&#x27;s not pushing my nose upward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps, I really do like it. Oh and by the way I actually bought it on Ebay for $2 without shipping (although it took about 3 weeks to get here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE MARCH 19th 2011!!!&lt;br /&gt;I went to go buy another one because mine was getting a bit too worn (it doesn&#x27;t hold as well) I now realize that there are two different kinds. The first nose up I bought the rubber was very soft (that one is very comfortable to use) HOWEVER; there is the same nose up but with a hard plastic (quite uncomfortable)that I ended up getting the second time BUT it gives very very quick results. The longer you can stand it the better. I don&#x27;t know how to distinguish which one has the soft plactic or the hard....but I recommend the hard one if you can stand it :) Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So I have to be honest and as this product really did make my nose narrower, you would have to use this every single day to see the results--meaning if you stopped using it then it will eventually go back to it&#x27;s normal shape. At least that&#x27;s what happened to me, so I no longer bother with it.</li>
            <li> Hi!  I just received my Nose Up in the mail.  According to reviews I read online, the clips were adjustable. However, I can&#x27;t figure out how to adjust anything on this thing!  The package is completely in Chinese.  Can anyone help me out?  Right now it feels really really tight so I was wondering how to make it looser.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but if you have a huge nose this is not going to work for you! I&#x27;ve read so many reviews like \\&quot;It snapped in half!\\&quot; It&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic thats not very flexible (what did you expect? it&#x27;s less than five bucks!). If your nose is more than 4 cm wide then don&#x27;t get it. and if you decide to get it anyways BE CAREFUL. It was made for small nosed asians in the first place if you can&#x27;t tell by the chinese instructions. don&#x27;t stretch it so far and be gentle with it.   I have gotten many compliments on how they never noticed that i had such a pretty nose shape before. I was a little bit weirded out but flattered. and happy that the product worked!!! The site I bought it on only claimed to give you a pointy small nose, not straighten anything. only surgery can do that. SO IF YOU WANT A STRAIGHT NOSE, DON&#x27;T GET THIS. GET IT IF YOU WANT A SLIM POINTY NOSE.  The nose up is a good product and is not useless. Some people were just too rough with it or had a huge nose. or both. No offense, just stating the truth here for people to know why it isn&#x27;t working for them.</li>
            <li> After having broken my nose in a fall, I was interested in this device as a way to straighten the bump in my nose. This thing will not even stay on. It is hard and it flies off when I&#x27;m trying to wear it according to images on Amazon. There were absolutely no directions delivered with it. It is inflexible.  I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone can benefit from it. It was useless to me.</li>
            <li> Would not even stay on my nose. I tried using this post upper jaw surgery after my nose became crooked due to the procedure. No luck here</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit right on my nose</li>
            <li> Broke when putting over nose first time. Cheap</li>
            <li> I have this. Its completely pink, with the plastic cushion part pink as well. Most likely harder than the white/clear cushion. I use it upside down on my nostrils, hugging around the tip, aligned with my bridge(which is much sharper now with the noseright/jiahe clip~!) to kind of even them out. One side is a tiny bit fatter than the other. I can&#x27;t quite say it works 100% because the tissue is very dynamic. Because of the pressure it swells when you take it off. If you touch and pinch at your nose a lot it will swell and actually look fat! Also after I wash my face, and my skin is &#x27;tight&#x27; my nose is smaller but gets a little &#x27;fatter&#x27; or normal sized when my skin&#x27;s moisture returns to normal. I also have a nose roller(google it/ebay shud have it). This really helped to orient the straightness of my bridge, while the nose clip(nose right/jiahe) brings out the cartilage-the nose roller would straighten and align it. In a way &#x27;solidifying&#x27; the straightness. It works. Lol, I am typical asian and I have A FRIGGAN BRIDGE now. Before:no bridge and wide nostrils. Now: bridge and more even nostrils. My idea: creating a bridge would lengthen my nose, taking away from the wideness of the nostrils. Straightening doesn&#x27;t change the wideness but it in a sense creates greater length and thus disguising the wideness.   instead of (___) wide nose,   you grow yourself :  -||-  (  ) this. so it appears not as wide. Altho the nose up clip here does help to soften the nostril tissue and eventually decrease its form a little bit.   -I used to have a teddy bear, and I would push his button nose into my nose and it actually made my nose more flat than what I was born with. I had a good nose(my mom would pinch my nose as a little kid and I had a nice form. Destroyed it. Now I&#x27;m fixing it XD-</li>
            <li> Broke after first time use. Useless</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but enjoy trying \\&quot;gimmick products \\&quot; if the science behind them makes sense. I tried hipshrinkx after my daughter and it worked! I figured id give this a shot too. I was originally looking into a nose job because I&#x27;m a major perfectionist about certain things. I know the small details about myself. Day six I noticed a huge nose difference. I was wearing this nose clip about fourty minutes a day. My only concern is my nose goes back to normal after a day...maybe thats why they say to wear for a complete month or two??? I&#x27;m hoping my results will be long lasting and not revert after a day or so</li>
            <li> I think it works because my nose looks straighter, and its cheap and affordable.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my nose if I use it for 15 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> This product caused injury to my nose please i beg you all don&#x27;t use it it was such a nightmare!</li>
            <li> this is the dumbest invention ever. i totally got my hopes up for nothing. this tool only succeeded in making my nose hurt so bad only after 2 minutes. then when you take it off you have little circles engraved in your nose from the rubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i ended up getting real rhinoplasty. worth every penny</li>
            <li> ok so this item does work you just have to keep it on for about an hour a day to see QUICK results. I feel like this is important to know because it does take time however, if you seriously are discontent with your nose you could appreciate the outcome of this item. I personally had surgery for my nose and use this tool to straighten the cartilage out even more than the surgery has done. Next, I have ordered this item before with no issues it was delivered very fast. however, the second time (I had lost the first) something must have happend with the delivery so I did not recieve mine at first. The seller contacted me saying that they would send me the one I ordered plus an extra for the inconvenience and had asked me to errase my negative comment previously. I&#x27;ve decided to replace that one with this one. I recieved one not two (like they had said to make up for the first order) the second time. I had ordered back in the beginning of march so was dissapointed when I had expected two products because of the overall experience, but o well at least the problem was fixed quickly :) I&#x27;m just glad I eventually got one.</li>
            <li> I am not always use this,because I don&#x27;t know how to use.And nobody teach me.I never buy this again. ha</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see the results inmediately but nobody would like to walk around with the terrible marks it leaves in your nose.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and a waste of your money. Do not waste your time. It broke immediately. What was I even thinking in purchasing something this cheap and ridiculous. Just useless.</li>
            <li> my nose broke out of this thing like the incredible hulk. it felt like i put my face in one of those vice grips from high school shop class and just cranked it until i got tired.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an original version that appears to better. This one I had some problems with. It came off too much, basically. Maybe my nose is too big for it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a nose product that would enhance my nose bridge and also provide me with a smaller nose. I used this daily for about 10~30 minutes a day for over two months. However, sadly enough, this product was unable to do the trick for me. In fact, I feel as if my nose has gotten wider than before after using this product. Thus, I discontinued in using this product and here I am warning several people before buying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing my case, I would not recommend others in buying this. It may work for several folks out there, though it seems as others had the same result as I did.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and monet. Don&#x27;t be a foold. It will not work. I wonder what I was thinking when i got it and how could i expect this to work</li>
            <li> I received the product on time but found the clip to be very tight and not too flexible. It may work just fine if you have a itty bitty nose but the average person will experience some discomfort using this product. The material of this product contains a hard plastic which cracked and shortly thereafter it broke in two pieces, the same day. I ordered another one with a clothes pin type feature and I&#x27;m pretty sure it will do the job and be much comfortable.</li>
            <li> So many negative reviews here,saying this is for smaller nosed people. Let me say I am African American,so naturally my nose is a bit bigger. I just recieved this in the mail today,yes it can be a bit painful at first. But if you can withstand it and give it a chance it may work. Which is what I plan to do. So far it lays on my nose just fine and stays. I plan to sleep in it.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT i THOUGHT IT WAS</li>
            <li> it broke when I tried to turn the little dots to change the pressure amount.</li>
            <li> It is too little and can harm you a little. I really didn&#x27;t wanted to keep seeing if it works since I just wanted to experiment but without hurting myself. Nevertheless it is a cheap product so you can experience it as well instead of having someone telling to avoid doing it</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. It is very painful to wear and even though I continued to wear it for a few weeks I could see no change at all. I wore it continuously for at least 6 hours a day while I did housework  and other things at home.</li>
            <li> i thought it would help straighten my nose bone but it pinched it so hard i jut threw the crap out</li>
            <li> I just got it today and had to wear it upside down because my nose is a German nose so it didnt fit like the Asian lady on the box. So I put it on for abut 5 mins it hurt a little but I really think this thing might work it pushes on the cartilage so if you wear it over and over it will put it straight. Ill keep updating this for more info.</li>
            <li> this is too weird for  westerners</li>
            <li> This product is totally useless for me because I can&#x27;t even clamp it onto my nose. It just slips off and makes a funny noise. I threw mine away two weeks after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t. Just don&#x27;t. I promise you that you will not get any results others than having three large red dots on both sides of your nose for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t state that the there is only one size. And will not fit a adult nose or even stay on.. it doesn&#x27;t fit my nose at all and was a waste of my money. Don&#x27;t buy if you are a adult, this could only fit a child</li>
    </ol>
