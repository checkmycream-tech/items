            <li>He thinks it&#x27;s the greatest!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this razors ability to A:</li>
            <li>This item is very nice!</li>
            <li>Works great on side burns, and the settings are great.</li>
            <li>The shaver works great.  </li>
            <li>Happy customer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is Great</li>
            <li>Works great and vacuums the majority of cut hairs.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Good price, too.</li>
            <li>its good and that vaccum,</li>
            <li>Good blade guard for determining length of beard.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good product, good battery life.  </li>
            <li>All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li>The product was good product.</li>
            <li>so that took a bit of getting used to however, it fits nicely in the hand and has a nice heft to it.  </li>
            <li>though I did not use it correctly as it cut a nice hole in the beard under my chin.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I found the #3 and #4 settings effective at giving me the \\&quot;grungy\\&quot; look my girlfriend likes.</li>
            <li>Dial up the desired length and get very consistent results with great battery life and quick/easy operation.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many beard trimmers, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Neat, nice, easy to use groomer.</li>
            <li>love this trimmer now.  </li>
            <li>It gets most of them, but there are still a lot of whiskers in the sink when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>As opposed to the Rolling Stones one can get satisfaction when chasing that sexy Telly Savalas look.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to be sure you&#x27;re standing over a sink or towel when using it.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but could be better.</li>
            <li>This trimmer falls short of perfect for two reasons.    </li>
            <li>Still worlds better than the Phillips equivalent which is in my trash can as I type.    </li>
            <li>I look more like a pirate ...</li>
            <li>Brilliant for very close cuts it hums along nicely as its Titanium blades remind me gently of their permanence in a world plagued by uncertainties.</li>
            <li>The tines at the top bend and flex so easily the cut length varies dramatically with varying pressure.</li>
            <li>The trimmer settings make close trimming easy.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best shaver I have used for trimming hair located off my head!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is fairly large but was nonetheless effective at trimming detail areas.</li>
            <li>Very strong motors with consistent speed and great vacuum mechanism.</li>
            <li>Huge improvement, though.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>If you want one for travel, go with the smaller non-vacuum version but for home, this one is great.  </li>
            <li>the unit is easy to clean out after use.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is a great addition, though...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great with having that vacuum.  </li>
            <li>he said; vacuum workes great, doesn&#x27;t clog, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>(Much better) THANKS!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not user-replacable, but it&#x27;d be worth removing a couple of screws!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I still had to clean the sink a bit.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised by the vacuum capability of the trimmer as it picks up about 70% of the hair that I trim and makes cleanup a bit easier.</li>
            <li>The vacuum while a good idea works at about 75% efficiency.  </li>
            <li>Works great on other areas as well.  </li>
            <li>quick and eay to use, but don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li>Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  </li>
            <li>The product is very maneuverable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For short hair trimming, catches most in tray for easy disposal.  </li>
            <li>Feels cheap straight out of the plastic case.  </li>
            <li>The vaccum doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs - but is overall effective.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to trim my ear hairs and nose hairs with my old unit, this one is just not working for that.  </li>
            <li>Still worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful Mustache and beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have had quite a few rechargeable trimmers and this one is definitely the best that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works pretty well and it holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>The first time I</li>
            <li>This is actually my first beard trimmer</li>
            <li>I have no problems with this trimmer being that its my first.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I just purchased my 3rd Remington MB-400 in just as many years.</li>
            <li>did not realize how pleased he would be with the vacuum feature</li>
            <li>The vacuum is not 100% effective but it does eliminate a huge portion of the mess created by shaving and it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>If you just move it with minimal pressure across your facial hair, it does a great job with no drama.</li>
            <li>I trim my beard pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li>It is a great concept (I liked the vacuum idea) but very poorly executed.</li>
            <li>I have owned a previous model before this and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I love the product, its trimmer, the vacuum keeps my bathroom sink clean and its trimmings-catch is large enough for me to shave my head before emptying.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t really apply any pressure at all with the guard.  </li>
            <li>The number dial is really helpful</li>
            <li>On/off switch is in a \\&quot;counter-intuitive\\&quot; position - I sometimes have to search for it unless I&#x27;m looking straight at it.</li>
            <li>I really wish this was a cordless/corded model (one which can run on battery or AC power if plugged in);</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get very close to the blade.    </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really have a beard ...</li>
            <li>The Remington MB-400 Trimmer works as advertised, and the vacuum feature is actually pretty cool.</li>
            <li>but i do know that if your looking for a comfortable nothing fancy trim with less mess, then this is a good trimmer for you.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely say the cut and trim of the Remington is more precise- no long strands are left after using the Remington brand trimmer.     </li>
            <li>, i use it daily to keep my sexy 5&#x27;clock shadow trimmed mess free.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is very helpful, but I think it keeps you from getting a true #1 trim on the beard.  </li>
            <li>This one is similar in function and performance and hence gets full marks.</li>
            <li>The charge holds for a decent time and you can leave it charging without worrying about overcharging.  </li>
            <li>--however now he can trim his beard inside, with no mess to clean up, as opposed to sitting outside on the patio.  </li>
            <li>So, I looked for a new Remington and found the MB-400.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum worked fine when I actually figured out how to take advantage of it, but before that I had hairs all over the place.</li>
            <li>i dont know to much about trimmers in general</li>
            <li>The waste receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when I want to change the trimming depth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum is better than nothing, but still leaves a mess on the counter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a bit bulkier and a bit noisier than my old one</li>
            <li>My only real gripe is with the fact that you cannot run the trimmer using the AC adapter.</li>
            <li>he requested a replacement for his old beard trimmer</li>
            <li>Well worth the $30 I spent for this grooming tool.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t vacuum the whiskers very well.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product and it&#x27;s still a nice trimmer, but I miss my old one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t vacuum - this has served my needs better with much more rigid attachments: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The trimmer really works well, with no real problems.  </li>
            <li>The guard on this Remington is a little too flexible and I&#x27;m used to being able to push firmly against my face.  </li>
            <li>which really sucks since its Titanium (or ceramic) blades are strong enough to last a lifetime.     </li>
            <li>Vacuum works well, cuts clean, but hard to get at all close to the skin.</li>
            <li>Still have to clean up the errant facial hair but not nearly like the usual debris field.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Remington MB-400 Trimmer works as advertised, and the vacuum feature is actually pretty cool. Good price, too.</li>
            <li> This product does not trim evenly - some areas of my beard are long, others almost bare.  It left me with a stripe down the center of my chin and one side longer than the other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem seems to be that the tines used to separate the blades from your face are extremely flexible.  The slightest pressure causes them to bend resulting in uneven results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is better than nothing, but still leaves a mess on the counter.</li>
            <li> I had an ancient Remington MB-2 trimmer that lasted me well over a decade but alas, it finally died.  So, I looked for a new Remington and found the MB-400.  It&#x27;s quite a bit bulkier and a bit noisier than my old one so that took a bit of getting used to however, it fits nicely in the hand and has a nice heft to it.  I was pleasantly suprised by the vacuum capability of the trimmer as it picks up about 70% of the hair that I trim and makes cleanup a bit easier. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I read one review where the fellow was gouging out chunks of beard due to the flexible tines of the guard.  Yes, the tines in the MIDDLE are flexible but the ones on each end of the guard are not.  My one small incident of this with my moustache taught me that the secret is to make sure to NEVER press down on the guard when doing an area where the end tines are not where the pressure is being applied.  You shouldn&#x27;t really apply any pressure at all with the guard.  If you just move it with minimal pressure across your facial hair, it does a great job with no drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love this trimmer now.  The number dial is really helpful and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  If you want one for travel, go with the smaller non-vacuum version but for home, this one is great.  Now to see how long this one lasts me...</li>
            <li> The trimmer works pretty well and it holds a charge well. However, it doesn&#x27;t vacuum the whiskers very well. It gets most of them, but there are still a lot of whiskers in the sink when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> its good and that vaccum, oh man! that thing is crazy i tell ya....CRAZY it works so well...its just like vroooomm and sucking in all that nasty hair that you be shaving off and a thang you know homey????? yeah babay well that be all i gotta say about that...mmmhhhmm! buy this trimmmer!</li>
            <li> This little guy makes my mornings a breezy trim. Brilliant for very close cuts it hums along nicely as its Titanium blades remind me gently of their permanence in a world plagued by uncertainties. As opposed to the Rolling Stones one can get satisfaction when chasing that sexy Telly Savalas look.</li>
            <li> I have had quite a few rechargeable trimmers and this one is definitely the best that I&#x27;ve ever had. Very strong motors with consistent speed and great vacuum mechanism.</li>
            <li> I used this twice. The first time I though I did not use it correctly as it cut a nice hole in the beard under my chin. The second time, another disaster so I stopped immediately. Read the review from Whiteman (I wish I did before I used it). He is right on the money, you can very easily put your face next to the blade with horrible result to your look!  &lt;br /&gt;I am returning mine (I did not buy it from Amazon), you should never buy it. It is a great concept (I liked the vacuum idea) but very poorly executed. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.  Good blade guard for determining length of beard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Somewhat awkward to hold at different angles.  On/off switch is in a \\&quot;counter-intuitive\\&quot; position - I sometimes have to search for it unless I&#x27;m looking straight at it.</li>
            <li> for the price you can&#x27;t get hurt.  quick and eay to use, but don&#x27;t drop it. plastic is plastic  &lt;br /&gt;                      AH</li>
            <li> Nice product. I have owned a previous model before this and really liked it. This one is similar in function and performance and hence gets full marks. The only thing they could have improved was ergonomics.</li>
            <li> A replacement for one that would no longer hold a charge. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> This model was given to me as a gift almost two years ago.  I bought another off of Amazon because the recharge cord had a short in it, and I figured I could use a second one to keep in my travel bag.  I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the trimmer.  I like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when I want to change the trimming depth.  I use it a few times a week, and it seems that it can go for months without needing a charge.  The little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into the little holding area is not the strongest....It&#x27;s catches probably 70% of what I trim.  You&#x27;ll want to be sure you&#x27;re standing over a sink or towel when using it.  Well worth the $30 I spent for this grooming tool.</li>
            <li> The vaccum doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs - but is overall effective. Works great on side burns, and the settings are great. Don&#x27;t push down too hard though (as in ridiculously hard); the trimmer guard is a bit flimsy -- but nothing that would ruin your trim/shave unless you were crazy with it.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first beard trimmer so my experience with the competition is nonexistent. This trimmer is fairly large but was nonetheless effective at trimming detail areas. The vacuum worked fine when I actually figured out how to take advantage of it, but before that I had hairs all over the place. The length settings (#9 -&gt; #1) go from fairly long to very short. I found the #3 and #4 settings effective at giving me the \\&quot;grungy\\&quot; look my girlfriend likes. I have very little to complain about with this trimmer. My only real gripe is with the fact that you cannot run the trimmer using the AC adapter. This might be common with most shavers, but I found this to be a bit annoying. I am hoping that a long battery life will overcome the need to have the shaver corded. On a similar note, the battery of this trimmer does not appear to be user replaceable. This has provided me some long-term concern, but it&#x27;s still only been a week, so I&#x27;ll see how things go.</li>
            <li> Good product, good battery life.  Vacuum feature good and bad.  For short hair trimming, catches most in tray for easy disposal.  Longer hairs clog up everything.</li>
            <li> The product is very maneuverable and easy to use. You&#x27;re done in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with this trimmer being that its my first. i dont know to much about trimmers in general but i do know that if your looking for a comfortable nothing fancy trim with less mess, then this is a good trimmer for you. But if your looking to sculp your facial hair into a flamingo perched in a pond with kermit, well then i&#x27;de have to say look somewhere else. This one was not design with precision in mind. To elucidate it&#x27;s bulking so getting into tight areas is almost impossible without bending and flexing your face everywhich way. I like it though, i use it daily to keep my sexy 5&#x27;clock shadow trimmed mess free.</li>
            <li> I have owned many beard trimmers, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works well, cuts clean, but hard to get at all close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap straight out of the plastic case.  I give it one point for the vacuum action, but it is otherwise awkward to hold, impossible to use under your nose, and otherwise flimsy feeling.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great.  Holds a charge.  The vacuum while a good idea works at about 75% efficiency.  Still have to clean up the errant facial hair but not nearly like the usual debris field.  Works great on other areas as well.  ;)</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is very helpful, but I think it keeps you from getting a true #1 trim on the beard.  I had a titanium without the vac that broke, so I thought this would be an upgrade.  Works well, but could be better.</li>
            <li> This item is very nice! I have used the shaver quite a few times and it dosen&#x27;t compare to my old Remington. It is alot nicer and it is redesigned. (Much better) THANKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me.  One wouldn&#x27;t want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide the unit over your beard... you&#x27;re not raking, you&#x27;re trimming! &lt;br /&gt;Also the unit is easy to clean out after use.  The waste receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris.</li>
            <li> I trim my beard pretty much every day.  I&#x27;ve found the Remington trimmers to be the best in all respects.  This trimmer is no exception.  Dial up the desired length and get very consistent results with great battery life and quick/easy operation.  The vacuum is a great addition, though... because trimming the beard makes a MESS.    This trimmer falls short of perfect for two reasons.    1. It doesn&#x27;t vacuum ALL the hair.  I still had to clean the sink a bit.  Huge improvement, though.    2.  The guard on this Remington is a little too flexible and I&#x27;m used to being able to push firmly against my face.  If I do that now, it flexes and affects the trimming length.  Still worlds better than the Phillips equivalent which is in my trash can as I type.    Happy customer.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer for the hair on my head as I like my hair length at different times to be between 1/4\\&quot; and 1/2\\&quot;.  I also use it for my eyebrows, and of course to trim my bread down to 1/16\\&quot; length once a week.  It&#x27;s great with having that vacuum.  I just bought another one as mine died after 3 years of use.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my 3rd Remington MB-400 in just as many years. I love the product, its trimmer, the vacuum keeps my bathroom sink clean and its trimmings-catch is large enough for me to shave my head before emptying. But the battery is not user-replacable, and only lasts 1-year.  I really wish this was a cordless/corded model (one which can run on battery or AC power if plugged in); unfortunately when the battery dies you just can&#x27;t continue using it plugged in. Heavy *sigh*.  So you&#x27;ll be forced to buy a new one annually.... which really sucks since its Titanium (or ceramic) blades are strong enough to last a lifetime.     I wish some Chinese knock-off would offer black market batteries... yeah they&#x27;re not user-replacable, but it&#x27;d be worth removing a couple of screws!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend for Christmas and he absolutly loves it. This trimmer is Great he said; vacuum workes great, doesn&#x27;t clog, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair. He/I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Neat, nice, easy to use groomer. Gives desired result. I recommend this one to everybody with beard or french cut or side burns.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco beard trimmer and I can definitely say the cut and trim of the Remington is more precise- no long strands are left after using the Remington brand trimmer.     Only draw-back is the plastic guard is not that durable and can sometimes fall off.</li>
            <li> he requested a replacement for his old beard trimmer and I found this online--did not realize how pleased he would be with the vacuum feature--however now he can trim his beard inside, with no mess to clean up, as opposed to sitting outside on the patio.  He thinks it&#x27;s the greatest!</li>
            <li> After only about a year of moderate use the battery no longer held charge and unit ended up in trash.</li>
            <li> This unit works well for trimming my Goatee, and mustache, but The head is a little bigger thatn I would like.  I used to be able to trim my ear hairs and nose hairs with my old unit, this one is just not working for that.  When trying to shape my mustache on the edges, I have a hard time as well, because the head has to much stuff around it.  You can&#x27;t get very close to the blade.    I hope this helps.....</li>
            <li> The trimmer really works well, with no real problems.  The vacuum is not 100% effective but it does eliminate a huge portion of the mess created by shaving and it is very powerful.  The trimmer settings make close trimming easy.  The charge holds for a decent time and you can leave it charging without worrying about overcharging.  All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very nice.  The vacuum feature is something I could personally take or leave, but it&#x27;s neat to have.  The guard is not a sturdy as the one on my old MB-40 which can lead to uneven cuts and it doesn&#x27;t have the separate sideburns/mustache thingy (that&#x27;s a technical term) which I used frequently.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product and it&#x27;s still a nice trimmer, but I miss my old one.  Still worth the buy.</li>
            <li> The product was good product. It is a powerful Mustache and beard trimmer. Vacuum is not perfect but its catches about 80% of the hair. The major complaint is that the adapter stop working after one charge. Without this problem product would have gotten 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaver I have used for trimming hair located off my head! The liner is garbage in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works great and vacuums the majority of cut hairs.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this razors ability to A: vacuum up hairs or B: cut at a constant length.  The tines at the top bend and flex so easily the cut length varies dramatically with varying pressure. But I don&#x27;t really have a beard ... I look more like a pirate ... just scruffy ... maybe if I had a Chuck Norris beard this would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t vacuum - this has served my needs better with much more rigid attachments: [[ASIN:B002N5N3FE Conair GMT189RGB 13-Piece All-In-One Grooming System]]</li>
