            <li>Trimmer works great, too.</li>
            <li>and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Did not try to wash it yet, but otherwise it works great.  </li>
            <li>They were great shavers.  </li>
            <li>The philips norelco 7110X does this and its great for the bathroom</li>
            <li>Shaves great</li>
            <li>But the trimming attachment is very nice to have and it holds the charge for about a week.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pleasure to use, very nice product.</li>
            <li>and I like the spring-loaded blades which contour very nicely around the jaw and chin.  </li>
            <li>then that it does a very nice job.</li>
            <li>Very nice to use.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice shave!</li>
            <li>Since the price was so good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s before, and had a good experience with them.  </li>
            <li>everything looks good except the using time</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good cordless razor.</li>
            <li>A good product and good price.</li>
            <li>However, it is excellent when used with the 12 volt charger, available separately.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- Good function.</li>
            <li>They always give great shaves and the Norelco tradition continues through my own family.</li>
            <li>After about 3 years this razor is still giving consistently good and close shaves and the battery is still just as good as the day I got it.</li>
            <li>Good deal for $40.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works good ....</li>
            <li>Light weight and excellent feel.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver</li>
            <li>They also take a couple passes to give a good shave.     </li>
            <li>This product does a good job considering the price.</li>
            <li>3 head shaver, good grip</li>
            <li>Good product as I expect.</li>
            <li>I still get a good shave.</li>
            <li>good grips</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t get a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have always had problems getting a good close shave using electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>I went from a good shaver that lasts 4-5 months per charge to a good shaver that lasts a week to 10 days per charge.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 7110X shaver is a good product, a good value, and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>This has a nice function and very nice price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased customer.</li>
            <li>My husband was very pleased with the shaver.</li>
            <li>He was looking for a replacement for the one he had, and this one was the closest match, and ended up being better quality and a great price.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with the shave it gives, the convenience of its use - and</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for over 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>is that I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid for it, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>should have done more researching before buying it!  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying this Norelco edition!</li>
            <li>Great razor for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>Philips sure cheapend up a good product.</li>
            <li>Yet, it gives a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>The cost was very good and the product arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor, does a good job, and is quiet.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th Norelco in 40 years and by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I received this shaver yesterday and today I got the best shave of my life with no skin irritation (I have sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li>The old one lasted about 5 years and worked perfectly until the battery quit.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter, doesn&#x27;t feel as good in the hand, and has a cheap plastic feel.  </li>
            <li>It is also very light (</li>
            <li>good battery live, washable, cool and precise shaving and the best part</li>
            <li>Shaving the neck is a hassle, and you must pass it over it many times.  </li>
            <li>I love that it can just be rinsed under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Given the price, I expect a better performer.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll spend more time shaving.    </li>
            <li>Your morning routine deserves better.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 7310 because I haven&#x27;t changed blades in my 7110 in almost 10 or more years</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Buy the 7310 or better.</li>
            <li>An excellent deal especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my Braun or Remmington electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>It really holds a charge great too.</li>
            <li>and I love the portability.</li>
            <li>it appears that if you do not shave every day, shaving becomes more of a chore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for a cordless rechargeable, however the power is much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Not 2 or 3, but as many as 5 or 6 to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I love Norelco Tripleheaders, and have had a dozen of them over 25 years.  </li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t the top performers on the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to everyone I know, I pay about a tenth for batteries everyone else does, with much more convenience.  </li>
            <li>I was able to shave five days, before recharging.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>i have always been a fan of norelco razors because they work great and are fast to use.</li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user for many years.  </li>
            <li>He has had a Norelco for many years and has really enjoyed having one.  </li>
            <li>I rate many things.</li>
            <li>MUCH MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get a better product.</li>
            <li>But I already love it.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to charge it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>It also holds alot more battery charge.</li>
            <li>, I have a braun syncro (love the system,</li>
            <li>It gave a better shave but also needed more attention with cleaning the shaver, the bathroom, etc.   </li>
            <li>The reason i bought Norelco is they always have a top notch product...</li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>In fact I have one of those that gives a much better shave than this Norelco.</li>
            <li>you money and buy a better shaver.</li>
            <li>If if you can&#x27;t afford something nicer, a bag of disposable razors will do a better job.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li>We got this for our son-in-law as a Christmas gift and he said it was his favorite gift and just loves it.</li>
            <li>It cost about $100 and was a lot better than this one, better build, better design (especially the flip up trimmer), felt great in the hand, came with a nice case.</li>
            <li>I love the shaver, and it does a very good job, but I wish the charge would last more than 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I chose this shaver because it had mostly good reviews, but I think only people with peach fuzz whiskers are going to get a good shave from this.  </li>
            <li>It does work best when the hair is a bit more than rough stubble...</li>
            <li>The razor works OK, but the recharging light never blinks like the instructions say they will.  </li>
            <li>One must go over his face more than twice to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I waited to get this from Amazon with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Just bought this to replace a 15+ year old Braun, and it is definitely a great value for the money...</li>
            <li>The initial charge lasted over 7 days of shaving for me (my beard if fairly light) and it seems to do a very good job of shaving.</li>
            <li>Easy do handle e shave well</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>ORDER EASILY AND PROCESS EFFORTLESSLY.</li>
            <li>* Easy to wash with water (a killer feature at this price-point)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Cleanup is really easy.</li>
            <li>I charged it once, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Nice price, In future, I will buy good product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks good and when it works, it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Mine is still kicking strong, use it about once every 2 months.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am kind of happy with this shaver, but if you need a quick shave, go look somewhere else</li>
            <li>Other than remembering that, it is a great product and he has used it several times, happy each time!</li>
            <li>The first two gave an excellent, close, even shave and the charge lasted several weeks.  </li>
            <li>Quite a deal... works fine...</li>
            <li>The flip-out trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;steady fingers fine.  </li>
            <li>Disposable blades are fine when I shave every day, but not after two or three days&#x27; growth.</li>
            <li>Works fine...</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for a little over a year now, and am still very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>so I use a light timer on it.  </li>
            <li>Positives: holds a charge, eventually gives you a close shave, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>After receiving, the charging-complete light did not indicate that charging was done.  </li>
            <li>All in all, for the money (a fraction of what I paid for the last Norelco I had), this is a great buy.  </li>
            <li>bought cheaply when on sale for $25.</li>
            <li>Its transformer will work with most voltages, a useful feature for overseas travel.</li>
            <li>pay any attention to the \\&quot;low\\&quot; charge light.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for cheap and got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>but after 3 shaves the charge light starts to flash.</li>
            <li>and I got a free night at a b&amp;b out of it..</li>
            <li>The light does not tell you when it&#x27;s fully charged as the owners manual says it should.</li>
            <li>As the instructions state, a Norelco is meant to be glided across your face in smooth circular motions without using pressing force.    </li>
            <li>This shaver fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li>Bought it on a fantastic sale-</li>
            <li>These heads aren&#x27;t cheap, folks.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy it, add another $50 and get HQ8140 or RQ1050, it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li>Does not give as good a shave as my old one did after 25 years.</li>
            <li>It is a norelco, not as good as my old one that I paid about 100 for</li>
            <li>All in all, I would say so far, so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter, gives a smoother shave, holds a good charge, and I can wash the blades out under running water (couldn&#x27;t with the old one).  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver.  </li>
            <li>However, compared to my higher end Braun it feels cheaply made with light plastics - has a very cheap feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I think this razor is great and am totally amazed at the fact that you can rinse it clean under a water faucet..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;cleaning is very easy though with just a quick wash in hot water.</li>
            <li>Well worth considering!</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the charging light never blinks to indicate a full charge (like the manual states it would)</li>
            <li>Well worth the money though!</li>
            <li>I also like the easy way to clean it once a week by running hot water over the blades!  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>After a thorough search, Amazon offered this Norelco shaver at a better price than anyone else (including Walmart), and with free shipping - so thanks to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still cannot get a clean shave like a Gilette, But</li>
            <li>I still prefer a clean Razor shave..</li>
            <li>or so you&#x27;re supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean</li>
            <li>IT WAS EASY TO PICK OUT WHAT I WANTED, FIND THE RIGHT PRICE,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this bargain shaver for someone who may need an inexpensive rechargeable travel shaver as opposed to a full time home shaver.</li>
            <li>Despite this, I am quite pleased with the product as a whole.</li>
            <li>Just not as good as the similar Remington it replaced.</li>
            <li>This Norelco also will leave you with a face full of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>do as good of job as I thought it would actually shaving.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a nice case like my old one.</li>
            <li>This model cuts nice and close, so if you haven&#x27;t used a Norelco before, don&#x27;t go grinding this into your face with force and then complain that it skinned you alive.  </li>
            <li>It does have a nice feature that my old Norelco could not do: washable head.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a bad product i just got what I payed for</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used one that worked a little better, but this is a great shaver, escpecially for the price, i love it, easy to use, easy to clean, charges quickly and holds a charge for long period of time</li>
            <li>It is a handy feature to be able to flush out the razor under the tap and just let it dry during the day.</li>
            <li>The shave is good and it is super quiet.</li>
            <li>Better and closer shave than the older Norelco.</li>
            <li>older Norelco fully charges in an hour and will shave for 2 or 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky if it shaves for a week.</li>
            <li>Shaves great but the green indicator light which is supposed to flash when fully charged never flashes.</li>
            <li>The ability to rinse it out in water is a plus, quick and convenient.</li>
            <li>Still, I am very happy with the overall shave and definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>I needed a quick shaver.</li>
            <li>It is adequate.</li>
            <li>(most likely you&#x27;ll need to spend some more money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>At first we thought it had to be garbage because it was so light weight.</li>
            <li>, holds a charge for a couple of weeks, so overall I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This Norelco is far superior to the older model I replaced.  </li>
            <li>go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice Norelco shaver and don&#x27;t want to waste money on gimmics don&#x27;t actually provide a better shave, then this 7110x is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Norelco&#x27;s older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn&#x27;t cut grass more than 1/2\\&quot; high.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much, I like the fact that you can clean it by using running water.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;***BE WARNED and AWARE of this before you buy!  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that we can clean it under the tap with hot water....</li>
            <li>Considering the cost, great little shaver.</li>
            <li>Excellent for the money, quite a close shave, easy to use and clean...  Be careful around the mouth as it sometimes catches the skin a little...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few months, and it gives a great, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I get about a weeks worth of shaves per overnight charge.</li>
            <li>Had it for about 4 months now and it is still going strong and gives a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>I thought he should have his own Norelco because they had to run to two different bathrooms to get it.  </li>
            <li>My own Dad also owned only Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>Upgraded to this razor (actually, the 7140XL, but they&#x27;re nearly identical razors) after my old Remington died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that&#x27;s not 15 years old.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco lasts more than a week between charges, this lasts two or three days.</li>
            <li>Even when it is fully charged, it doesn&#x27;t seem that powerful.</li>
            <li>As a trade off for never cutting myself, it&#x27;s worth it.    </li>
            <li>Much better than my old National electric shavers.</li>
            <li>It did shave any better than the old one I had.    </li>
            <li>This shaver is definitely worth what I paid for it .</li>
            <li>The product was not only shipped faster than expected, but it was also in great condition and they followed up to ensure I got my order!</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a traveling razor or want to give rotaries a shot then this might be the right choice.</li>
            <li>the plastic on this one is cheap when put side by side with my older norelco made in holland.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased with it&#x27;s quietness and the fact that a full recharge only requires 8 hours.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a whole new razor for $38, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li>A good shave, but the batteries go dead quickly.</li>
            <li>On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok barely passable</li>
            <li>I just leave it charging over night when the low charge light flashes &amp; it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and you are pretty much done, or you can clean the inside with the supplied brush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why their top of the line models cost so much more, for seemingly so little difference between them and the lower priced 7110X.</li>
            <li>the old one is easy to disassemble and solder in an inexpensive replacement 2 cell battery pack if/when the NiCd battery needs replacing.</li>
            <li>Overall, so far so good.</li>
            <li>The 7110 is so quiet you sometimes can&#x27;t even hear it, gentle on the skin (even right away, which some reviews have said was not the case), and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>With the ability to clean this device under a fawcet, Norelco has moved to a new level of customer convenience.  </li>
            <li>I switched from Remington to Norelco electric razors over thirty years ago and they just work better, as big a difference in efficiency as comparing the ancient push lawn mower, to today&#x27;s rotary gasoline and electric lawn mowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver (have been using gillette sensor excel for number of years)</li>
            <li>After charging the battery, before first use, for the required 8 hours, and an 8 hour recharging every second/third day since then, I cannot get a shave for up to the indicated 25 minutes of shave time.  </li>
            <li>He still has his first one from the 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco electric shaver that I purchased was exactly as promised</li>
            <li>I can get some of the hairs out by using hot water.</li>
            <li>It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the \\&quot;Lift &amp; cut.\\</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a electronic shaver.</li>
            <li>On the first shave after fully charging, it took 8 minutes to get a \\&quot;complete\\&quot; shave</li>
            <li>The package and manual state that the charge light blinks when the cycle is complete, and that takes 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Eventually I will buy a better model of the same shaver</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I ended up doing after one week.  </li>
            <li>So, I was looking online and the cost of this product was only $20 more than replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I like better with the Norelco is that it&#x27;s quieter than the Remington.</li>
            <li>I bought the female shaver for myself and I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>it was still running pretty well.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s never been a problem because, as mentioned, you can get a shave or two after the first signal.</li>
            <li>First off, you shouldn&#x27;t be shaving anything but your face with this razor.  </li>
            <li>After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just flush the head with hot water once a week.</li>
            <li>this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.</li>
            <li>It works okay on my cheeks, chin, and upper lip, but when I brought it to my neck WATCHOUT!</li>
            <li>It takes me a long time to shave (which means I mostly go around looking unshaven), requiring many passes over the same area, and the battery charge does not last more than one shave.</li>
            <li>upgraded it a few years after the first syncro since I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can&#x27;t handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.ecommend</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean the shaving head, just one press</li>
            <li>My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front.</li>
            <li>in fact that pretty much was admitting there error</li>
            <li>I must have gotten a rotten apple because I only get maybe, at the most, 5 minutes of shave time before the red light comes on.  </li>
            <li>After buying  several shavers from Walmart  which although popular brand  named products they functioned poorly my husband is delighted with the Norelco.</li>
            <li>This one is superior the previous two, even when they were new.  </li>
            <li>The charger cord is unobtrusive, and easy to bring with, so it never bothers me that I only get 3-4 uses before it needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it is certainly look and feel a lot cheaper than my 10+ years 965RX.</li>
            <li>My older Philips shaver required recharging every 3-4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is good that the razor is still running, but the blades are hard to find.</li>
            <li>It cuts very close.  </li>
            <li>Battery life seems much shorter than advertised, which is a problem because...  3.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li>It charges up fast</li>
            <li>It does an okay job of shaving with no nicks or grabs, but it seems to take a longer time than I had expected.</li>
            <li>especially like this Philips Norelco rechargeable model since, using an available accessory, Norelco model # (e4)020417, a 12 Volt adapter cigarette lighter type extension chord-plug</li>
            <li>, my 140 Watt solar panels on the roof charge two 6 Volt deep cycle golf cart batteries, wired in series to output 12 volts, then a 12 Volt clamp-on extension chord carries the correct charging voltage through the LED lighted accessory chord to charge the razor for free using sunlight photovoltaics.  </li>
            <li>fast charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are more expensive Philips Norelco shavers out there, but unless they&#x27;re going to brew you some coffee while still giving you the same great shave, I can&#x27;t see spending the money... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li>This is giving me a very close shave on my cheeks but not so close under the chin/neck area.  </li>
            <li>and very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>This shaver works very well once you get used to the switch from razors.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and removes all of my beard growth Daily.    </li>
            <li>The shave is very close</li>
            <li>it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They sound just like my last one.  </li>
            <li>Shaves reasonably well</li>
            <li>PROUCT ARIVED VERY QUICKY AND WORKS VERY</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to shave, so</li>
            <li>It also won&#x27;t do armpits or backs or legs very well.   </li>
            <li>The 7110X is quiet, comfortable and gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li>I charge the battery for much longer than the stated 8 hours</li>
            <li>It does the job very well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt the difference with the Lift-n-Cut feature that it advertises so much</li>
            <li>it looks really fashion, I like it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the Remington is not as good as my old Norelco 7616X, but it&#x27;s a darn site better than this Norelco.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, but really only lasts about 10-15 min of shaving before you get the red flashing \\&quot;charge me\\&quot; indicator.</li>
            <li>The head is definitely flexing more than the old</li>
            <li>The motor sounds like it&#x27;s less powerful than my older model (which listed for a similar full retail price when new); even with a full charge it doesn&#x27;t sound like the blades and spinning around very fast.  </li>
            <li>Instead of buying new blades, I decided the &#x27;new&#x27; shave system might be worth the difference.</li>
            <li>Have owned other Norelco razors and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>Since I was in the market for an electric for a reasonable price, I figured a Norelco would be a decent choice.</li>
            <li>much quieter than my older norelco.    </li>
            <li>Also it is easy to clean, cost less, and has a low battery indicator light which allows you to get an indication of how much time you have left to shave before having to recharge.  </li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I&#x27;d probably buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line</li>
            <li>Well...my other Norelco is also rechargeable and rechargeable batteries loose their life after a while, so it&#x27;s nice having one with a fresh battery.      </li>
            <li>It has most of the same features as Norelco&#x27;s more expensive models, including allowing the user to clean its blade assembly with running water.</li>
            <li>If you want to upgrade your 7110x shaver... instead of buying a new one, just buy \\&quot;HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I got a \\&quot;Philips Norelco 7110X\\&quot; and it worked great and quite for first 3 weeks then started to be not so comfortable and today after only one month it shaves as bad as my older shaver was doing after one year!!</li>
            <li>I notice blades are $30 on Amazon, or you can buy a whole new razor for $29 shipped.  </li>
            <li>This razor does a much better job than the previous Norelco ( Reflex Plus 6613X )</li>
            <li>The previous model I had performed much better and charged in about an hour and the charge lasted for a week.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my older Norelco \\&quot;Quadra\\</li>
            <li>Quieter than the older Norelco.</li>
            <li>Decent.</li>
            <li>However the cord is not compatible with my older Morelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>He was using my husband&#x27;s shaver, which is an older model Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to send it back as the cost of shipping is probably gonna cost me more than the actual price of this shaver.</li>
            <li>better to use a regular razor if you need a close shave when it is still short, like 1-2 days after a close shave.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a decent shave in</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my older Norelco 965RX which can no longer hold charge.</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is significanly lighter than my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: If you want a good basic shaver for less, this is it!</li>
            <li>This one my not last near that long, I&#x27;m not that thrilled.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This new model works much better than the previous Norelco Lift-n-cut.</li>
            <li>Have to go back over face several times, does not give a clean shave the first time.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem easy to return so we kept the other two to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t seem to spin as fast as the old model, which probably contributes to its quietness, but that&#x27;s ok with me; it&#x27;s probably a little gentler on the skin as a result.  </li>
            <li>I use to shave using Gilette razor everyday for many years and that was a pain, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>Other then that is seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer to get a decent clean shave out of it than other shavers, but overall it&#x27;s worth $40 paid for it.   </li>
            <li>For just a little more than it would cost for new replacment blades for my old Norelco, I purchased the Norelco 7110X.  </li>
            <li>&quot; 6829XL that needs new heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m searching for a new razor instead of buying replacement blades.    </li>
            <li>when new and the 7310 for $25(w/rebate) on 8/27/11</li>
            <li>the new razor and blades bought for just about the cost of the blades alone...</li>
            <li>**brand new in the box</li>
            <li>So we purchased a new one for his birthday</li>
            <li>I chose to purchase a new razor rather than buy the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Now that I no longer shave every day, I decided to try a new electric.    </li>
            <li>So a year after buying it, I&#x27;m in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>This should not happen with a brand new shaver.  </li>
            <li>So why buy a new one?  </li>
            <li>if this is indicative of all new Norelco shavers or just this model, but I would have returned it if I could have.</li>
            <li>I would would say I&#x27;m about a third as happy as I was with the other one, so maybe I should have bought a more expensive model.</li>
            <li>But each time I have tried to lift the plastic blade holder, either one of the parts has broken or there is great difficulty in getting the three blades properly reset and then getting the&lt;br /&gt;holder to click.  </li>
            <li>It already looks like Amazon is not selling this item anymore as it is currently only listed as available from various Marketplace sellers.</li>
            <li>When it runs low on juice you&#x27;ll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the more expensive models do better, but for now, I&#x27;m just living with a longer shave time to get the same results.</li>
            <li>The first was purchased for about the same price about 12 years ago and worked well for its lifetime (it still works, but not well).</li>
            <li>Works as intended, and the motor is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel any significant difference when compared to other electric shavers.</li>
            <li>A long enough shaving time that I could take it to the mountains away from a charging source for a week or 2 and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Says he has experienced no hair pulling or other irritation, likely b/c he lets it grow out a little between shaves, 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>it definitely has a different feel than my old Braun (much lighter for sure), but I have to say the difference in the shave is minimal,</li>
            <li>My old Norelco required a 24 hour recharge, but it was a very old model for which I bought replacement battereies three times in its lifetime.</li>
            <li>transaction was smootha and easy, product met my expecations, delivery was on time, actually was delivered before expected time.</li>
            <li>This shaves better on wet skin than dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given the price, it is equal and/or cheaper to just buy a new razor every few years than go through the less than always successful effort to buy and replace the unit&#x27;s blades with new ones.</li>
            <li>would probably spend a little more money and get the next model</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m realizing that&#x27;s not going to work in my professional setting, so I&#x27;m definitely looking at upgrading very soon.</li>
            <li>I come home from work andf re-connect it to the power and ready for the next day.</li>
            <li>After 10 years, my trusty old Norelco died.  </li>
            <li>My old razor spoiled me-</li>
            <li>How far off can a razor be in two model #&#x27;s?</li>
            <li>It gives me a very acceptable shave, and the recharge life is no problem - around 10 days between charges when used daily.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet and shaves very close with no pulling of whiskers.</li>
            <li>Your model does not have the &#x27;charging complete&#x27; feature.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>This shaver has performed well for me, so far.  </li>
            <li>have used it for nearly two months.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my *old* Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping for a refund from&lt;br /&gt;CVS, even though eight months old.</li>
            <li>I have gotten this shaver as a replacement for an old Hitachi.</li>
            <li>Doing a complete discharge keeps the battery from developing a memory leak.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I took out the heads and placed it in my 4 year old  shaver and</li>
            <li>This is way too frequent and a hassle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor about a year ago to relace my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor two months ago to replace a 20 year old Norelco Rota-Tract.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter, shaves closer &amp; it&#x27;s lighter than the old one.</li>
            <li>If it lasts like the old one I had</li>
            <li>Gave the old one away...</li>
            <li>Very close shaves and quiet running.</li>
            <li>unlike the all metal of the old.</li>
            <li>I bought this directly from Amazon about a week ago for a blowout price.  </li>
            <li>My old shaver never took over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t nearly as handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had the razor a couple of weeks and like it so far.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I bought a new one was that the old one needed a new blade set which was about $30.  </li>
            <li>This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li>(it needed new blades which were almost same price as a new shaver).  </li>
            <li>the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  </li>
            <li>I have tried remington in the past (gave a good shave but a little too close as my skin was always irritated after the shave)</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t possible with my older shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is similar to the old which I think is much better than the version on the expensive Arcitec which is not sliding out at all to be useful.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;new\\&quot; model weighs half as much,and is so cheaply made I do not expect it to last 5 years.</li>
            <li>This model is no less powerful than my two previous Norelco razors (both of which lasted about 12 years each).  </li>
            <li>New item, fast shipper, but returned item due to it does not give as close a shave as it should.</li>
            <li>so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find.  </li>
            <li>At this point I couldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver if you have already used a rotary and know you like them and for a very simple reason: it is obsolete and buying replacement heads is almost as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li>used to have an lcd display for power which this one doesnt have, just a green and red light for power.</li>
            <li>Power can only come from the battery, so you can&#x27;t bypass it (a real bummer when the shaver is low on juice).</li>
            <li>Gave me absolutely as close a shave as a blade razor, and in the same short time!    </li>
            <li>My old Norelco was so noisy I used a different shaver (an old Braun) around my ears.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers my entire adult life (nearly 30 years).</li>
            <li>is a little bit short after a full charge.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver in july/august for around $40 in WalMart, and at first it was OK (by far not as close as a Gillete M3 Power or Fusion), but right now it irritates my skin really bad!  </li>
            <li>The 7110X is quiet, comfortable to hold and use, and gives me a close shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li>When we turned it on, you could barely hear the motor.</li>
            <li>I barely get 3 or 4 shaves out of it.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised at how quiet it is.  </li>
            <li>Not great, not terrible.</li>
            <li>The full charge only lasts a few (3, maybe 4) days.</li>
            <li>All in all not a terrible buy, but not a great find either.</li>
            <li>He did find the 8 hr fist charge annoying, and I keep reminding him that this type of battery works best when it is allowed to drain to near empty before recharging or it reduces battery life.</li>
            <li>cutting power doesnt seem as strong as older models and requires you to go back and fourth a few more times.</li>
            <li>I was looking for this exact shaver at Black Friday 06, but they had sold out (surprise).</li>
            <li>The build quality, shave and feel of this shaver is very much like one of those little travel shavers that runs on AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using the same product previously and this was an exact duplicate.  </li>
            <li>it generally took only one pass.  </li>
            <li>Better than other more expensive Norelco shavers I bought in the past.</li>
            <li>Other than feeling like junk, its decent for the money.</li>
            <li>The new Norelco 7110 is a big step down from that old model.</li>
            <li>but I am not sure if it really cut any closer than the old \\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; blades.</li>
            <li>I figured why not get a new shaver for not much more than what a new head costs.</li>

            <li> Works great on the face.  </li>

            <li> once I got it, it is a great shaver, it shave realy close like a razor.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great, too.</li>
            <li> and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Did not try to wash it yet, but otherwise it works great.  </li>
            <li> They were great shavers.  </li>
            <li> The philips norelco 7110X does this and its great for the bathroom</li>
            <li> Shaves great</li>
            <li> But the trimming attachment is very nice to have and it holds the charge for about a week.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pleasure to use, very nice product.</li>
            <li> and I like the spring-loaded blades which contour very nicely around the jaw and chin.  </li>
            <li> then that it does a very nice job.</li>
            <li> Very nice to use.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shave!</li>
            <li> Since the price was so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s before, and had a good experience with them.  </li>
            <li> everything looks good except the using time</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good cordless razor.</li>
            <li> A good product and good price.</li>
            <li> However, it is excellent when used with the 12 volt charger, available separately.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- Good function.</li>
            <li> They always give great shaves and the Norelco tradition continues through my own family.</li>
            <li> After about 3 years this razor is still giving consistently good and close shaves and the battery is still just as good as the day I got it.</li>
            <li> Good deal for $40.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works good ....</li>
            <li> Light weight and excellent feel.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver</li>
            <li> They also take a couple passes to give a good shave.     </li>
            <li> This product does a good job considering the price.</li>
            <li> 3 head shaver, good grip</li>
            <li> Good product as I expect.</li>
            <li> I still get a good shave.</li>
            <li> good grips</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t get a good close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have always had problems getting a good close shave using electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I went from a good shaver that lasts 4-5 months per charge to a good shaver that lasts a week to 10 days per charge.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7110X shaver is a good product, a good value, and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> This has a nice function and very nice price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with the shaver.</li>
            <li> He was looking for a replacement for the one he had, and this one was the closest match, and ended up being better quality and a great price.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with the shave it gives, the convenience of its use - and</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> is that I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid for it, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> should have done more researching before buying it!  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying this Norelco edition!</li>
            <li> Great razor for a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> Philips sure cheapend up a good product.</li>
            <li> Yet, it gives a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> The cost was very good and the product arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor, does a good job, and is quiet.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Norelco in 40 years and by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I received this shaver yesterday and today I got the best shave of my life with no skin irritation (I have sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li> The old one lasted about 5 years and worked perfectly until the battery quit.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter, doesn&#x27;t feel as good in the hand, and has a cheap plastic feel.  </li>
            <li> It is also very light (</li>
            <li> good battery live, washable, cool and precise shaving and the best part</li>
            <li> Shaving the neck is a hassle, and you must pass it over it many times.  </li>
            <li> I love that it can just be rinsed under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Given the price, I expect a better performer.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll spend more time shaving.    </li>
            <li> Your morning routine deserves better.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 7310 because I haven&#x27;t changed blades in my 7110 in almost 10 or more years</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Buy the 7310 or better.</li>
            <li> An excellent deal especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my Braun or Remmington electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> It really holds a charge great too.</li>
            <li> and I love the portability.</li>
            <li> it appears that if you do not shave every day, shaving becomes more of a chore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal for a cordless rechargeable, however the power is much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Not 2 or 3, but as many as 5 or 6 to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love Norelco Tripleheaders, and have had a dozen of them over 25 years.  </li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t the top performers on the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to everyone I know, I pay about a tenth for batteries everyone else does, with much more convenience.  </li>
            <li> I was able to shave five days, before recharging.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> i have always been a fan of norelco razors because they work great and are fast to use.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for many years.  </li>
            <li> He has had a Norelco for many years and has really enjoyed having one.  </li>
            <li> I rate many things.</li>
            <li> MUCH MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get a better product.</li>
            <li> But I already love it.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to charge it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> It also holds alot more battery charge.</li>
            <li> , I have a braun syncro (love the system,</li>
            <li> It gave a better shave but also needed more attention with cleaning the shaver, the bathroom, etc.   </li>
            <li> The reason i bought Norelco is they always have a top notch product...</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> In fact I have one of those that gives a much better shave than this Norelco.</li>
            <li> you money and buy a better shaver.</li>
            <li> If if you can&#x27;t afford something nicer, a bag of disposable razors will do a better job.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li> We got this for our son-in-law as a Christmas gift and he said it was his favorite gift and just loves it.</li>
            <li> It cost about $100 and was a lot better than this one, better build, better design (especially the flip up trimmer), felt great in the hand, came with a nice case.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver, and it does a very good job, but I wish the charge would last more than 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I chose this shaver because it had mostly good reviews, but I think only people with peach fuzz whiskers are going to get a good shave from this.  </li>
            <li> It does work best when the hair is a bit more than rough stubble...</li>
            <li> The razor works OK, but the recharging light never blinks like the instructions say they will.  </li>
            <li> One must go over his face more than twice to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I waited to get this from Amazon with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Just bought this to replace a 15+ year old Braun, and it is definitely a great value for the money...</li>
            <li> The initial charge lasted over 7 days of shaving for me (my beard if fairly light) and it seems to do a very good job of shaving.</li>
            <li> Easy do handle e shave well</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> ORDER EASILY AND PROCESS EFFORTLESSLY.</li>
            <li> * Easy to wash with water (a killer feature at this price-point)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Cleanup is really easy.</li>
            <li> I charged it once, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Nice price, In future, I will buy good product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks good and when it works, it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Mine is still kicking strong, use it about once every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am kind of happy with this shaver, but if you need a quick shave, go look somewhere else</li>
            <li> Other than remembering that, it is a great product and he has used it several times, happy each time!</li>
            <li> The first two gave an excellent, close, even shave and the charge lasted several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Quite a deal... works fine...</li>
            <li> The flip-out trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;steady fingers fine.  </li>
            <li> Disposable blades are fine when I shave every day, but not after two or three days&#x27; growth.</li>
            <li> Works fine...</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a little over a year now, and am still very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> so I use a light timer on it.  </li>
            <li> Positives: holds a charge, eventually gives you a close shave, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> After receiving, the charging-complete light did not indicate that charging was done.  </li>
            <li> All in all, for the money (a fraction of what I paid for the last Norelco I had), this is a great buy.  </li>
            <li> bought cheaply when on sale for $25.</li>
            <li> Its transformer will work with most voltages, a useful feature for overseas travel.</li>
            <li> pay any attention to the \\&quot;low\\&quot; charge light.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for cheap and got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> but after 3 shaves the charge light starts to flash.</li>
            <li> and I got a free night at a b&amp;b out of it..</li>
            <li> The light does not tell you when it&#x27;s fully charged as the owners manual says it should.</li>
            <li> As the instructions state, a Norelco is meant to be glided across your face in smooth circular motions without using pressing force.    </li>
            <li> This shaver fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li> Bought it on a fantastic sale-</li>
            <li> These heads aren&#x27;t cheap, folks.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, add another $50 and get HQ8140 or RQ1050, it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> Does not give as good a shave as my old one did after 25 years.</li>
            <li> It is a norelco, not as good as my old one that I paid about 100 for</li>
            <li> All in all, I would say so far, so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter, gives a smoother shave, holds a good charge, and I can wash the blades out under running water (couldn&#x27;t with the old one).  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, compared to my higher end Braun it feels cheaply made with light plastics - has a very cheap feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I think this razor is great and am totally amazed at the fact that you can rinse it clean under a water faucet..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;cleaning is very easy though with just a quick wash in hot water.</li>
            <li> Well worth considering!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the charging light never blinks to indicate a full charge (like the manual states it would)</li>
            <li> Well worth the money though!</li>
            <li> I also like the easy way to clean it once a week by running hot water over the blades!  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> After a thorough search, Amazon offered this Norelco shaver at a better price than anyone else (including Walmart), and with free shipping - so thanks to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still cannot get a clean shave like a Gilette, But</li>
            <li> I still prefer a clean Razor shave..</li>
            <li> or so you&#x27;re supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean</li>
            <li> IT WAS EASY TO PICK OUT WHAT I WANTED, FIND THE RIGHT PRICE,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this bargain shaver for someone who may need an inexpensive rechargeable travel shaver as opposed to a full time home shaver.</li>
            <li> Despite this, I am quite pleased with the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> Just not as good as the similar Remington it replaced.</li>
            <li> This Norelco also will leave you with a face full of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> do as good of job as I thought it would actually shaving.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a nice case like my old one.</li>
            <li> This model cuts nice and close, so if you haven&#x27;t used a Norelco before, don&#x27;t go grinding this into your face with force and then complain that it skinned you alive.  </li>
            <li> It does have a nice feature that my old Norelco could not do: washable head.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a bad product i just got what I payed for</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used one that worked a little better, but this is a great shaver, escpecially for the price, i love it, easy to use, easy to clean, charges quickly and holds a charge for long period of time</li>
            <li> It is a handy feature to be able to flush out the razor under the tap and just let it dry during the day.</li>
            <li> The shave is good and it is super quiet.</li>
            <li> Better and closer shave than the older Norelco.</li>
            <li> older Norelco fully charges in an hour and will shave for 2 or 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> I am lucky if it shaves for a week.</li>
            <li> Shaves great but the green indicator light which is supposed to flash when fully charged never flashes.</li>
            <li> The ability to rinse it out in water is a plus, quick and convenient.</li>
            <li> Still, I am very happy with the overall shave and definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I needed a quick shaver.</li>
            <li> It is adequate.</li>
            <li> (most likely you&#x27;ll need to spend some more money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> At first we thought it had to be garbage because it was so light weight.</li>
            <li> , holds a charge for a couple of weeks, so overall I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This Norelco is far superior to the older model I replaced.  </li>
            <li> go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice Norelco shaver and don&#x27;t want to waste money on gimmics don&#x27;t actually provide a better shave, then this 7110x is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn&#x27;t cut grass more than 1/2\\&quot; high.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much, I like the fact that you can clean it by using running water.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;***BE WARNED and AWARE of this before you buy!  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that we can clean it under the tap with hot water....</li>
            <li> Considering the cost, great little shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the money, quite a close shave, easy to use and clean...  Be careful around the mouth as it sometimes catches the skin a little...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few months, and it gives a great, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I get about a weeks worth of shaves per overnight charge.</li>
            <li> Had it for about 4 months now and it is still going strong and gives a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> I thought he should have his own Norelco because they had to run to two different bathrooms to get it.  </li>
            <li> My own Dad also owned only Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> Upgraded to this razor (actually, the 7140XL, but they&#x27;re nearly identical razors) after my old Remington died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that&#x27;s not 15 years old.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco lasts more than a week between charges, this lasts two or three days.</li>
            <li> Even when it is fully charged, it doesn&#x27;t seem that powerful.</li>
            <li> As a trade off for never cutting myself, it&#x27;s worth it.    </li>
            <li> Much better than my old National electric shavers.</li>
            <li> It did shave any better than the old one I had.    </li>
            <li> This shaver is definitely worth what I paid for it .</li>
            <li> The product was not only shipped faster than expected, but it was also in great condition and they followed up to ensure I got my order!</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a traveling razor or want to give rotaries a shot then this might be the right choice.</li>
            <li> the plastic on this one is cheap when put side by side with my older norelco made in holland.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased with it&#x27;s quietness and the fact that a full recharge only requires 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a whole new razor for $38, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li> A good shave, but the batteries go dead quickly.</li>
            <li> On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok barely passable</li>
            <li> I just leave it charging over night when the low charge light flashes &amp; it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and you are pretty much done, or you can clean the inside with the supplied brush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why their top of the line models cost so much more, for seemingly so little difference between them and the lower priced 7110X.</li>
            <li> the old one is easy to disassemble and solder in an inexpensive replacement 2 cell battery pack if/when the NiCd battery needs replacing.</li>
            <li> Overall, so far so good.</li>
            <li> The 7110 is so quiet you sometimes can&#x27;t even hear it, gentle on the skin (even right away, which some reviews have said was not the case), and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> With the ability to clean this device under a fawcet, Norelco has moved to a new level of customer convenience.  </li>
            <li> I switched from Remington to Norelco electric razors over thirty years ago and they just work better, as big a difference in efficiency as comparing the ancient push lawn mower, to today&#x27;s rotary gasoline and electric lawn mowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver (have been using gillette sensor excel for number of years)</li>
            <li> After charging the battery, before first use, for the required 8 hours, and an 8 hour recharging every second/third day since then, I cannot get a shave for up to the indicated 25 minutes of shave time.  </li>
            <li> He still has his first one from the 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco electric shaver that I purchased was exactly as promised</li>
            <li> I can get some of the hairs out by using hot water.</li>
            <li> It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the \\&quot;Lift &amp; cut.\\</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a electronic shaver.</li>
            <li> On the first shave after fully charging, it took 8 minutes to get a \\&quot;complete\\&quot; shave</li>
            <li> The package and manual state that the charge light blinks when the cycle is complete, and that takes 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Eventually I will buy a better model of the same shaver</li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I ended up doing after one week.  </li>
            <li> So, I was looking online and the cost of this product was only $20 more than replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I like better with the Norelco is that it&#x27;s quieter than the Remington.</li>
            <li> I bought the female shaver for myself and I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> it was still running pretty well.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s never been a problem because, as mentioned, you can get a shave or two after the first signal.</li>
            <li> First off, you shouldn&#x27;t be shaving anything but your face with this razor.  </li>
            <li> After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just flush the head with hot water once a week.</li>
            <li> this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.</li>
            <li> It works okay on my cheeks, chin, and upper lip, but when I brought it to my neck WATCHOUT!</li>
            <li> It takes me a long time to shave (which means I mostly go around looking unshaven), requiring many passes over the same area, and the battery charge does not last more than one shave.</li>
            <li> upgraded it a few years after the first syncro since I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li> It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can&#x27;t handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.ecommend</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean the shaving head, just one press</li>
            <li> My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front.</li>
            <li> in fact that pretty much was admitting there error</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a rotten apple because I only get maybe, at the most, 5 minutes of shave time before the red light comes on.  </li>
            <li> After buying  several shavers from Walmart  which although popular brand  named products they functioned poorly my husband is delighted with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> This one is superior the previous two, even when they were new.  </li>
            <li> The charger cord is unobtrusive, and easy to bring with, so it never bothers me that I only get 3-4 uses before it needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it is certainly look and feel a lot cheaper than my 10+ years 965RX.</li>
            <li> My older Philips shaver required recharging every 3-4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is good that the razor is still running, but the blades are hard to find.</li>
            <li> It cuts very close.  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems much shorter than advertised, which is a problem because...  3.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li> It charges up fast</li>
            <li> It does an okay job of shaving with no nicks or grabs, but it seems to take a longer time than I had expected.</li>
            <li> especially like this Philips Norelco rechargeable model since, using an available accessory, Norelco model # (e4)020417, a 12 Volt adapter cigarette lighter type extension chord-plug</li>
            <li> , my 140 Watt solar panels on the roof charge two 6 Volt deep cycle golf cart batteries, wired in series to output 12 volts, then a 12 Volt clamp-on extension chord carries the correct charging voltage through the LED lighted accessory chord to charge the razor for free using sunlight photovoltaics.  </li>
            <li> fast charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are more expensive Philips Norelco shavers out there, but unless they&#x27;re going to brew you some coffee while still giving you the same great shave, I can&#x27;t see spending the money... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> This is giving me a very close shave on my cheeks but not so close under the chin/neck area.  </li>
            <li> and very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well once you get used to the switch from razors.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and removes all of my beard growth Daily.    </li>
            <li> The shave is very close</li>
            <li> it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They sound just like my last one.  </li>
            <li> Shaves reasonably well</li>
            <li> PROUCT ARIVED VERY QUICKY AND WORKS VERY</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to shave, so</li>
            <li> It also won&#x27;t do armpits or backs or legs very well.   </li>
            <li> The 7110X is quiet, comfortable and gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> I charge the battery for much longer than the stated 8 hours</li>
            <li> It does the job very well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt the difference with the Lift-n-Cut feature that it advertises so much</li>
            <li> it looks really fashion, I like it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Remington is not as good as my old Norelco 7616X, but it&#x27;s a darn site better than this Norelco.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but really only lasts about 10-15 min of shaving before you get the red flashing \\&quot;charge me\\&quot; indicator.</li>
            <li> The head is definitely flexing more than the old</li>
            <li> The motor sounds like it&#x27;s less powerful than my older model (which listed for a similar full retail price when new); even with a full charge it doesn&#x27;t sound like the blades and spinning around very fast.  </li>
            <li> Instead of buying new blades, I decided the &#x27;new&#x27; shave system might be worth the difference.</li>
            <li> Have owned other Norelco razors and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> Since I was in the market for an electric for a reasonable price, I figured a Norelco would be a decent choice.</li>
            <li> much quieter than my older norelco.    </li>
            <li> Also it is easy to clean, cost less, and has a low battery indicator light which allows you to get an indication of how much time you have left to shave before having to recharge.  </li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I&#x27;d probably buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line</li>
            <li> Well...my other Norelco is also rechargeable and rechargeable batteries loose their life after a while, so it&#x27;s nice having one with a fresh battery.      </li>
            <li> It has most of the same features as Norelco&#x27;s more expensive models, including allowing the user to clean its blade assembly with running water.</li>
            <li> If you want to upgrade your 7110x shaver... instead of buying a new one, just buy \\&quot;HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I got a \\&quot;Philips Norelco 7110X\\&quot; and it worked great and quite for first 3 weeks then started to be not so comfortable and today after only one month it shaves as bad as my older shaver was doing after one year!!</li>
            <li> I notice blades are $30 on Amazon, or you can buy a whole new razor for $29 shipped.  </li>
            <li> This razor does a much better job than the previous Norelco ( Reflex Plus 6613X )</li>
            <li> The previous model I had performed much better and charged in about an hour and the charge lasted for a week.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my older Norelco \\&quot;Quadra\\</li>
            <li> Quieter than the older Norelco.</li>
            <li> Decent.</li>
            <li> However the cord is not compatible with my older Morelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> He was using my husband&#x27;s shaver, which is an older model Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to send it back as the cost of shipping is probably gonna cost me more than the actual price of this shaver.</li>
            <li> better to use a regular razor if you need a close shave when it is still short, like 1-2 days after a close shave.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a decent shave in</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older Norelco 965RX which can no longer hold charge.</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is significanly lighter than my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : If you want a good basic shaver for less, this is it!</li>
            <li> This one my not last near that long, I&#x27;m not that thrilled.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This new model works much better than the previous Norelco Lift-n-cut.</li>
            <li> Have to go back over face several times, does not give a clean shave the first time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem easy to return so we kept the other two to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t seem to spin as fast as the old model, which probably contributes to its quietness, but that&#x27;s ok with me; it&#x27;s probably a little gentler on the skin as a result.  </li>
            <li> I use to shave using Gilette razor everyday for many years and that was a pain, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Other then that is seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer to get a decent clean shave out of it than other shavers, but overall it&#x27;s worth $40 paid for it.   </li>
            <li> For just a little more than it would cost for new replacment blades for my old Norelco, I purchased the Norelco 7110X.  </li>
            <li> &quot; 6829XL that needs new heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m searching for a new razor instead of buying replacement blades.    </li>
            <li> when new and the 7310 for $25(w/rebate) on 8/27/11</li>
            <li> the new razor and blades bought for just about the cost of the blades alone...</li>
            <li> **brand new in the box</li>
            <li> So we purchased a new one for his birthday</li>
            <li> I chose to purchase a new razor rather than buy the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Now that I no longer shave every day, I decided to try a new electric.    </li>
            <li> So a year after buying it, I&#x27;m in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> This should not happen with a brand new shaver.  </li>
            <li> So why buy a new one?  </li>
            <li> if this is indicative of all new Norelco shavers or just this model, but I would have returned it if I could have.</li>
            <li> I would would say I&#x27;m about a third as happy as I was with the other one, so maybe I should have bought a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> But each time I have tried to lift the plastic blade holder, either one of the parts has broken or there is great difficulty in getting the three blades properly reset and then getting the&lt;br /&gt;holder to click.  </li>
            <li> It already looks like Amazon is not selling this item anymore as it is currently only listed as available from various Marketplace sellers.</li>
            <li> When it runs low on juice you&#x27;ll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the more expensive models do better, but for now, I&#x27;m just living with a longer shave time to get the same results.</li>
            <li> The first was purchased for about the same price about 12 years ago and worked well for its lifetime (it still works, but not well).</li>
            <li> Works as intended, and the motor is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel any significant difference when compared to other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> A long enough shaving time that I could take it to the mountains away from a charging source for a week or 2 and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Says he has experienced no hair pulling or other irritation, likely b/c he lets it grow out a little between shaves, 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> it definitely has a different feel than my old Braun (much lighter for sure), but I have to say the difference in the shave is minimal,</li>
            <li> My old Norelco required a 24 hour recharge, but it was a very old model for which I bought replacement battereies three times in its lifetime.</li>
            <li> transaction was smootha and easy, product met my expecations, delivery was on time, actually was delivered before expected time.</li>
            <li> This shaves better on wet skin than dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given the price, it is equal and/or cheaper to just buy a new razor every few years than go through the less than always successful effort to buy and replace the unit&#x27;s blades with new ones.</li>
            <li> would probably spend a little more money and get the next model</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m realizing that&#x27;s not going to work in my professional setting, so I&#x27;m definitely looking at upgrading very soon.</li>
            <li> I come home from work andf re-connect it to the power and ready for the next day.</li>
            <li> After 10 years, my trusty old Norelco died.  </li>
            <li> My old razor spoiled me-</li>
            <li> How far off can a razor be in two model #&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> It gives me a very acceptable shave, and the recharge life is no problem - around 10 days between charges when used daily.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and shaves very close with no pulling of whiskers.</li>
            <li> Your model does not have the &#x27;charging complete&#x27; feature.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> This shaver has performed well for me, so far.  </li>
            <li> have used it for nearly two months.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my *old* Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping for a refund from&lt;br /&gt;CVS, even though eight months old.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this shaver as a replacement for an old Hitachi.</li>
            <li> Doing a complete discharge keeps the battery from developing a memory leak.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I took out the heads and placed it in my 4 year old  shaver and</li>
            <li> This is way too frequent and a hassle.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a year ago to relace my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor two months ago to replace a 20 year old Norelco Rota-Tract.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter, shaves closer &amp; it&#x27;s lighter than the old one.</li>
            <li> If it lasts like the old one I had</li>
            <li> Gave the old one away...</li>
            <li> Very close shaves and quiet running.</li>
            <li> unlike the all metal of the old.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Amazon about a week ago for a blowout price.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver never took over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t nearly as handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had the razor a couple of weeks and like it so far.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I bought a new one was that the old one needed a new blade set which was about $30.  </li>
            <li> This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> (it needed new blades which were almost same price as a new shaver).  </li>
            <li> the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  </li>
            <li> I have tried remington in the past (gave a good shave but a little too close as my skin was always irritated after the shave)</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t possible with my older shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is similar to the old which I think is much better than the version on the expensive Arcitec which is not sliding out at all to be useful.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;new\\&quot; model weighs half as much,and is so cheaply made I do not expect it to last 5 years.</li>
            <li> This model is no less powerful than my two previous Norelco razors (both of which lasted about 12 years each).  </li>
            <li> New item, fast shipper, but returned item due to it does not give as close a shave as it should.</li>
            <li> so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find.  </li>
            <li> At this point I couldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver if you have already used a rotary and know you like them and for a very simple reason: it is obsolete and buying replacement heads is almost as much as a new razor.</li>
            <li> used to have an lcd display for power which this one doesnt have, just a green and red light for power.</li>
            <li> Power can only come from the battery, so you can&#x27;t bypass it (a real bummer when the shaver is low on juice).</li>
            <li> Gave me absolutely as close a shave as a blade razor, and in the same short time!    </li>
            <li> My old Norelco was so noisy I used a different shaver (an old Braun) around my ears.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers my entire adult life (nearly 30 years).</li>
            <li> is a little bit short after a full charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in july/august for around $40 in WalMart, and at first it was OK (by far not as close as a Gillete M3 Power or Fusion), but right now it irritates my skin really bad!  </li>
            <li> The 7110X is quiet, comfortable to hold and use, and gives me a close shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> When we turned it on, you could barely hear the motor.</li>
            <li> I barely get 3 or 4 shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how quiet it is.  </li>
            <li> Not great, not terrible.</li>
            <li> The full charge only lasts a few (3, maybe 4) days.</li>
            <li> All in all not a terrible buy, but not a great find either.</li>
            <li> He did find the 8 hr fist charge annoying, and I keep reminding him that this type of battery works best when it is allowed to drain to near empty before recharging or it reduces battery life.</li>
            <li> cutting power doesnt seem as strong as older models and requires you to go back and fourth a few more times.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this exact shaver at Black Friday 06, but they had sold out (surprise).</li>
            <li> The build quality, shave and feel of this shaver is very much like one of those little travel shavers that runs on AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using the same product previously and this was an exact duplicate.  </li>
            <li> it generally took only one pass.  </li>
            <li> Better than other more expensive Norelco shavers I bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Other than feeling like junk, its decent for the money.</li>
            <li> The new Norelco 7110 is a big step down from that old model.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it really cut any closer than the old \\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; blades.</li>
            <li> I figured why not get a new shaver for not much more than what a new head costs.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave, has a weak motor and never ever gives me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> : it consistently takes at least 3 to 5 passes (if not more) to get most of the hairs, and even then, there are usually some stragglers.  </li>
            <li> This wasnt a promblem with the previous shaver that i had, even though i have given the proper amount of time to readjust to a new shaver.           </li>
            <li> but it does seem a little lacking in power , but shaves decently</li>
            <li> It is however the quietest Norelco I have owned, and perhaps because it doesn&#x27;t buzz like an angry nest of hornets some people think it isn&#x27;t as powerful as their older Norelcos, but it is.    </li>
            <li> I typically blade shave during the week, and use an electric on the weekends for convenience, but this may become my standard if the performance stays the same as it has so far...</li>
            <li> A few years ago I would have highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd experience with Philips, and excuse my language but \\&quot;IT SUCKS\\</li>
            <li> The charge on this shaver holds long enough.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and no cord to get in the way anymore, and so quiet you can&#x27;t hear it running, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell how much charge you have left.</li>
            <li> Just tried Norelco&#x27;s online \\&quot;live\\&quot; customer support to find out how to return for service/replacement and the agents are 1) not very knowledgeable, and 2) unable to stay connected with me for more than a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li> but I was starting to press harder on my face and going over the same area 2-3+ times.</li>
            <li> The same battery bank also charges about 20 rechargeable D, AA, and AAA rechargeable common batteries using a similar DC power chord with a high quality 12 Volt DC</li>
            <li> The blades are different than previous models, because they scratch the sides of my chin if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is cheap but has a very weak power.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a tight budget &amp; can get a good deal on it, and if you don&#x27;t get frustrated by spending a lot of time shaving the same areas over and over, then this will work for you.  </li>
            <li> I had Norelco shavers before, but this one is the most disappointing ever.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a close shave in under 3 minutes that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy fast-growing beard type with sensitive skin, retired, and don&#x27;t shave every day.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it still won&#x27;t hold the charge for long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Norelco shavers and this one might be my last; The cons outweigh the pros.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can rinse the heads and other parts without worrying about damaging the mechanism is a big time saver!  </li>
            <li> Then you knock off the water and leave it to dry.</li>
            <li> But with this one, I can go over the same area of my face over &amp; over and it still keeps missing those same 3 or 4 hairs.  </li>
            <li> The only other time I have cut myself with an electric shaver is when the blades were very old and dull.  </li>
            <li> Its battery is too small and requires frequent charging.  </li>
            <li> This razor has talked down to me, pointed fingers at me, and slapped me around, but now I&#x27;ve had enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used and electric razor for over 40 years, always lather and blade, and I think this electric gives nearly as close a shave with a lot less mess and bother.</li>
            <li> I had my previous Norelco for 25 years and it finally gave out.</li>
            <li> but I think the total shave time is certainly less than the 25 minutes indicated.</li>
            <li> It claims 25 minutes of cordless shaving, but my personal experience has been closer to about half that.  </li>
            <li> on the current dead razor I found it took a long time to recharge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motor is very quiet compared to my previous Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> less than ten minutes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This is my second or third one of these over the past 10-12 years or so.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is, unlike my previous rechargeable shaver, it cannot be used as a corded shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gives an adequate if mediocre shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver over the Christmas holiday, it took a long time to get it due to out of stock, hut</li>
            <li> during their 60 day trial period and go ahead and get the expensive new heads for my old one.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels a little irritated, especially around the neck, when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> * Low noise, a lot less than other electric shaver</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> A tech support agent told me that it does blink, but only for a few seconds, then continues to glow.</li>
            <li> Requires multiple passovers and often pricks a few hairs in the process.  </li>
            <li> I get caught in the middle of a shave every few days.</li>
            <li> This razor is so quiet, it sounds like it didn&#x27;t charge up and the battery is almost dead.</li>
            <li> So far, a waste of 25 bucks, but at least it was only 25 bucks.</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint is the rather limited charge it holds.</li>
            <li> My only issue with the product is that the battery life fails to live up to its promises.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was a 7110 until I shaved 1/2 face with it and the other 1/2 w/7310.</li>
            <li> It was 29.99 minus 6 dollars therefore 24 bucks shipped!  </li>
            <li> This may be due to the \\&quot;rinse clean\\&quot; feature.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that it takes a while to shave as well</li>
            <li> I have had two other Norelcos that my dad and my brother took from me.  </li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> My other Norelco didn&#x27;t seem to be shaving well.  </li>
            <li> This model stays charged for about 2.5 weeks when shaving every other day and about 10 days if you use it every day.    </li>
            <li> It basically cost what replacement blades for my other shaver cost.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this razor, in part due to the rave reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The shape isn&#x27;t as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature.</li>
            <li> There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> The cost difference is not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that I don&#x27;t like the battery</li>
            <li> If you want to look acceptable you need to go over the same spot at least 10 times.</li>
            <li> quality has gone down over the years since philips bought them out.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for 35 years and this is hands down the poorest electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but it works and for the price of a replacement blade who can complain or even give less than 5 stars?  </li>
            <li> there is no travel bag like previous norelco models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less that 12 hours.</li>
            <li> 7110 is well priced(I paid less than 35$).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter, quieter and shaves closer than any previous cordless shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Also it was prices less than all the others.</li>
            <li> I get 3 less than 2 minute shaves on a 24 hour recharge.  </li>
            <li> I just bought mine this morning, plugged it in to charge for eight hours, then got impatient to try it after less than an hour.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this a little while ago and have been using it for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face couldn&#x27;t handle blades anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> So if the battery is dead, you&#x27;ll have to wait for it to fully charge.</li>
            <li> Cord is stiff, and not a spring.  </li>
            <li> With the 7110x, you can go over a giant hair over and over, and it&#x27;ll miss it every time and then randomly catch it on the 5th pass.  </li>
            <li> My one small concern is that small hairs that collect in the shaver tend to fall out and sprinkle around (into the drawer where the unit is stored and during usage).</li>
            <li> there are holes through the unit for the flow of water - this also allows small hairs to fall out.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a knowledgable rep said, \\&quot;Sorry</li>
            <li> I usually get 3-4 shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but it takes forever to shave with this model.  </li>
            <li> It worked terrifically, powered by the cord, on my three-days&#x27; growth of heavy beard!    </li>
            <li> Having had Norelcos in the past, I&#x27;m not anticipating any problems.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a smaller cutting area than my previous Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t travel much, so the razor usually just stays plugged in in the bathroom, but I am still disappointed that Philips Norelco makes such an exaggerated claim on its product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are very few products that I have rated lower.</li>
            <li> Battery life is not very good as well.  </li>
            <li> But this model is hardly useable with its AC charger.    </li>
            <li> Without my hearing aids, I could hardly tell it was</li>
            <li> Its hard to get a uniform shave with this.</li>
            <li> For the price, it would be hard to beat.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> i complained  to amazon</li>
            <li> Negative (dealbreaker for me)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Norelco units and had the least to say about the 7110.</li>
            <li> duh.  </li>
            <li> I had a Norelco electric shaver that lasted at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s slow.</li>
            <li> * Slow.</li>
            <li> Also, and this is probably the worst change with respect to the older model, when the shaver is plugged in, it still runs off battery, meaning that if the battery is dead you can&#x27;t shave for an hour even if it&#x27;s plugged in!</li>
            <li> I can hardly hear it!  </li>
            <li> The motor is very weak and turns the blades slowly.</li>
            <li> did, and the cutting heads do not clog up with clippings after just a few shaves as the 6613X would.   </li>
            <li> This was also the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> to be poor.</li>
            <li> Then, the skin irritation is, uh, really irritating.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless.</li>
            <li> I find that I can get a week of additional use before the battery is exhausted.  </li>
            <li> I keep a throw-away blade razor in my shaving kit to cover an exhausted battery.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find the ergonomics to be too bad.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my new Philips Norelco 7110x.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to one of the speed XL models and this one is slightly slower, but not so bad.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor.  </li>
            <li> This thing has a very weak battery.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> (their website was useless)  </li>
            <li> , the manual is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I guess I hit the wrong button on the computer.</li>
            <li> I do realize that this is not an expensive model, but it still should run for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Useless feature.     </li>
            <li> Sadly my beard keeps growing</li>
            <li> No complaints about shaving - doesn&#x27;t take too long; it&#x27;s washable also, but horrible on two places - my neck and my lower lip area.</li>
            <li> Go find some other schlubb to wash out your nasty blades.</li>
            <li> This shaver stinks.  </li>
            <li> When I used the 7310 on 1/2, I went over the 7110 area and could hear, not feel, the blades cutting closer.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I ended up cutting my neck also.  </li>
            <li> Hi Amazon:  I am very unhappy with Philips Norelco shaver, model 7110X</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is also the worst.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I have owned.  </li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s battery is terrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Norelco I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst one I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The power of this shaver is terrible.  </li>
            <li> He used to get the razor bumps on his face from shaving with the cream and the nasty razor.  </li>
            <li> It is without a doubt the WORST razor ever.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It seems to be under powered. Have to go back over face several times, does not give a clean shave the first time.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought it to replace a Remington shaver which I had for 18 months and was leaving red marks on my neck (it needed new blades which were almost same price as a new shaver).  &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I got a \\&quot;Philips Norelco 7110X\\&quot; and it worked great and quite for first 3 weeks then started to be not so comfortable and today after only one month it shaves as bad as my older shaver was doing after one year!! This is my 3rd experience with Philips, and excuse my language but \\&quot;IT SUCKS\\&quot; period.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in july/august for around $40 in WalMart, and at first it was OK (by far not as close as a Gillete M3 Power or Fusion), but right now it irritates my skin really bad!  Shaving the neck is a hassle, and you must pass it over it many times.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was just what my hubby was looking for, its great,works wonderful.The service was wonderful too got it in plenty of time infact it arrived before the shipping date stated that it would.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my older Norelco \\&quot;Quadra\\&quot; 6829XL that needs new heads. Since the price was so good I figured why not get a new shaver for not much more than what a new head costs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Strong Points &lt;br /&gt;*  Better and closer shave than the older Norelco. &lt;br /&gt;*  Quieter than the older Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER &lt;br /&gt;The older Norelco fully charges in an hour and will shave for 2 or 3 weeks or more.  A long enough shaving time that I could take it to the mountains away from a charging source for a week or 2 and it worked fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the old one is easy to disassemble and solder in an inexpensive replacement 2 cell battery pack if/when the NiCd battery needs replacing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one TAKES an EIGHT (yes 8!) hour charge and it&#x27;s best not to overcharge it so I use a light timer on it.  An inconvenience at best! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I am lucky if it shaves for a week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Customer service says it&#x27;s designed for 25 minutes of shaving after an EIGHT hour charge!!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should have done more researching before buying it!  I may return it for my money back from Norelco...during their 60 day trial period and go ahead and get the expensive new heads for my old one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***BE WARNED and AWARE of this before you buy!  **** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s for me a definite INCOVENIENCE and a **BIG \\&quot;CON\\&quot;**</li>
            <li> I love that it can just be rinsed under the faucet. Then you knock off the water and leave it to dry. I come home from work andf re-connect it to the power and ready for the next day. It is very quiet too. Better than other more expensive Norelco shavers I bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Works great on the face.  It cuts very close.  It doesn&#x27;t work too well under the chin.  It just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Philips sure cheapend up a good product. I had my previous Norelco for 25 years and it finally gave out. This \\&quot;new\\&quot; model weighs half as much,and is so cheaply made I do not expect it to last 5 years. Does not give as good a shave as my old one did after 25 years.</li>
            <li> This shaver stinks.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s before, and had a good experience with them.  But with this one, I can go over the same area of my face over &amp; over and it still keeps missing those same 3 or 4 hairs.  It takes forever to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> The razor works OK, but the recharging light never blinks like the instructions say they will.  Consquently, I never know when it is fully charged.  I left it charging for 3 days and never knew if it was charged or not.  Forget about getting advice from Norelco.  Phone calls, web sites, or Email will not help in answering a question.</li>
            <li> well the product i received was  the norelco 7110  but i did not ghet the  extra blades or pouch that was suppose to go with it i complained  to amazon but they have done nothing about it but they did change the misleading ad    in fact that pretty much was admitting there error</li>
            <li> The charge on this shaver holds long enough.  However, the shave isn&#x27;t close.  Cleaning is very simple though</li>
            <li> New item, fast shipper, but returned item due to it does not give as close a shave as it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Norelco shavers and this one might be my last; The cons outweigh the pros. Given the price, I expect a better performer. I&#x27;m searching for a new razor instead of buying replacement blades.    Pros:   1. Lightweight (see con #1)  2. Rinsable blades    Cons  1. Wall wort makes it cumbersome to travel with, and you&#x27;ll have to because...  2. Battery life seems much shorter than advertised, which is a problem because...  3. The shave isn&#x27;t very close so you&#x27;ll spend more time shaving.    Your morning routine deserves better.</li>
            <li> After 10 years, my trusty old Norelco died.  Thinking all electric razors were the same, I replaced it with the cheapest model in the store- I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.  Positives: holds a charge, eventually gives you a close shave, and easy to clean.  Negative (dealbreaker for me): it consistently takes at least 3 to 5 passes (if not more) to get most of the hairs, and even then, there are usually some stragglers.  My old razor spoiled me- it generally took only one pass.  With the 7110x, you can go over a giant hair over and over, and it&#x27;ll miss it every time and then randomly catch it on the 5th pass.  If you&#x27;re on a tight budget &amp; can get a good deal on it, and if you don&#x27;t get frustrated by spending a lot of time shaving the same areas over and over, then this will work for you.  Personally, I now realize that all razors are not created equal, and I&#x27;ll soon be replacing this with a more expensive model that doesn&#x27;t take 10 minutes per shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 7310 because I haven&#x27;t changed blades in my 7110 in almost 10 or more years I&#x27;ve had it. 7110 was $30 when new and the 7310 for $25(w/rebate) on 8/27/11. I didn&#x27;t know it was a 7110 until I shaved 1/2 face with it and the other 1/2 w/7310. The 7110 still shaves well but I was starting to press harder on my face and going over the same area 2-3+ times. When I used the 7310 on 1/2, I went over the 7110 area and could hear, not feel, the blades cutting closer. 7310 has 60 titanium blades vs the 7110/45 ss blades. If I had noticed the model numbers before purchase I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. How far off can a razor be in two model #&#x27;s? Glad I didn&#x27;t. Buy the 7310 or better. 5 stars for the 7310, but then again, I don&#x27;t have a Macho Randy Savage (RIP) beard either.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great.  An excellent deal especially considering the price.  As close as a blade.  Much better than my Braun or Remmington electric shavers.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a while. everything looks good except the using time is a little bit short after a full charge.</li>
            <li> Doen\\&quot;t do the best job. If I need a close save, need to finish with a razor</li>
            <li> This is the third Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  The first two gave an excellent, close, even shave and the charge lasted several weeks.  On my last vacation I forgot the charging cord and it turned on in my suitcase so I ended up having to buy a new one, and this was the only one I could find.  On the positive side the unit is light, holds a charge for a reasonably long time and is easy to clean.  Unfortunately it does a poor job as a razor.  It leaves a lot of long stray whiskers (especially under my nose) that I have to go back over from multiple directions to remove and this causes it to take much longer to shave and ends up irritating my skin.  I&#x27;m finally getting rid of this piece of junk today and I&#x27;m going to buy a different electric razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves great but the green indicator light which is supposed to flash when fully charged never flashes. I just have to leave it charging for 12-24 hours and it does seem fully charged by then. But it does shave great.</li>
            <li> After a thorough search, Amazon offered this Norelco shaver at a better price than anyone else (including Walmart), and with free shipping - so thanks to Amazon.  The shaver performs well. It gives me a very acceptable shave, and the recharge life is no problem - around 10 days between charges when used daily.  My one small concern is that small hairs that collect in the shaver tend to fall out and sprinkle around (into the drawer where the unit is stored and during usage). I think that this is because this is a rinse-able model, so there are holes through the unit for the flow of water - this also allows small hairs to fall out.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Quite a deal... works fine... the new razor and blades bought for just about the cost of the blades alone...</li>
            <li> At first we thought it had to be garbage because it was so light weight. When we turned it on, you could barely hear the motor. It sounded like it would never cut very good. Once my husband used it, we couldn&#x27;t believe how close of a shave. It really holds a charge great too. Considering the cost, great little shaver. Doesn&#x27;t replace those $150. ones, but comes close when you factor into it the cost.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shaver for the price. It is quiet and shaves very close with no pulling of whiskers. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good cordless razor.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver.  It is very, very quiet.  I can hardly hear it!  The shave is smooth/close.  I also like the easy way to clean it once a week by running hot water over the blades!  Neat!  Very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> I had an Norelco for the last ten years. It cost about $100 and was a lot better than this one, better build, better design (especially the flip up trimmer), felt great in the hand, came with a nice case. This does the job and for a fraction of the price. I would would say I&#x27;m about a third as happy as I was with the other one, so maybe I should have bought a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> The 7110X is quiet, comfortable to hold and use, and gives me a close shave with very little irritation. I get about a weeks worth of shaves per overnight charge. Well worth considering!</li>
            <li> It was 29.99 minus 6 dollars therefore 24 bucks shipped!  What can I say?  It is a norelco, not as good as my old one that I paid about 100 for but it works and for the price of a replacement blade who can complain or even give less than 5 stars?  Had it for about 4 months now and it is still going strong and gives a decent shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay the 40 bucks that they are asking for now but would purchase another one for the same discounted price of 24 bucks in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco.  After receiving, the charging-complete light did not indicate that charging was done.  So I called Norelco tech support.  (their website was useless)  Finally, a knowledgable rep said, \\&quot;Sorry, the manual is wrong.  Your model does not have the &#x27;charging complete&#x27; feature.\\&quot;  So the user must time charging, and remove the charger after 8 hours.  Annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it shaves great.</li>
            <li> A good product and good price. Easy do handle e shave well</li>
            <li> This razor gives a close shave in under 3 minutes that lasts all day long. It charges up fast and I love the portability.</li>
            <li> it appears that if you do not shave every day, shaving becomes more of a chore. it requires me to go over the same area over and over in order to remove some the longer hairs. This wasnt a promblem with the previous shaver that i had, even though i have given the proper amount of time to readjust to a new shaver.           ed</li>
            <li> Picked up the 7110X at a bargain price. Since I was in the market for an electric for a reasonable price, I figured a Norelco would be a decent choice. And that&#x27;s all it is. Decent. Not great, not terrible. It&#x27;s a great deal for a cordless rechargeable, however the power is much to be desired.  It almost feels as if it&#x27;s running low all the time. It does an okay job of shaving with no nicks or grabs, but it seems to take a longer time than I had expected. It takes several passes to do the job. Not 2 or 3, but as many as 5 or 6 to get the job done. But it eventually gets the job done. The flip-out trimmer works fine. The ability to rinse it out in water is a plus, quick and convenient. I would recommend this bargain shaver for someone who may need an inexpensive rechargeable travel shaver as opposed to a full time home shaver.</li>
            <li> RAZOR CANNOT BE POWERED BY CORD.  Battery must be charged in order for razor to operate.  Cord is stiff, and not a spring.  Batteries never fully charged with the AC charger included.  I love Norelco Tripleheaders, and have had a dozen of them over 25 years.  But this model is hardly useable with its AC charger.    However, it is excellent when used with the 12 volt charger, available separately.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He says that it does an excellent job on the face but does not work well on his neck. But the trimming attachment is very nice to have and it holds the charge for about a week.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  Under $40, works great.  Beats out all others including Braun, Remington.... go get it!</li>
            <li> This razor does a much better job than the previous Norelco ( Reflex Plus 6613X ) did, and the cutting heads do not clog up with clippings after just a few shaves as the 6613X would.   Also it is easy to clean, cost less, and has a low battery indicator light which allows you to get an indication of how much time you have left to shave before having to recharge.  I would definitely recommend it. Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver aprox 3 years ago and since then I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily/weekly basis.  It performs well, although the heads it brings from the factory (HQ8) aren&#x27;t the top performers on the market.  At the end, the shaver&#x27;s core are the heads, so doing some research I found out that the HQ9 could be used with this shaver... and what a difference!!    If you want to upgrade your 7110x shaver... instead of buying a new one, just buy \\&quot;HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I switched from Remington to Norelco electric razors over thirty years ago and they just work better, as big a difference in efficiency as comparing the ancient push lawn mower, to today&#x27;s rotary gasoline and electric lawn mowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like this Philips Norelco rechargeable model since, using an available accessory, Norelco model # (e4)020417, a 12 Volt adapter cigarette lighter type extension chord-plug, my 140 Watt solar panels on the roof charge two 6 Volt deep cycle golf cart batteries, wired in series to output 12 volts, then a 12 Volt clamp-on extension chord carries the correct charging voltage through the LED lighted accessory chord to charge the razor for free using sunlight photovoltaics.  The same batteries also power my living room hi-fi, using a 12 Volt DC to 120 Volt AC (house current) inverter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point, the yearly savings are about $40 total in electric bill costs during the, say, five year life of the razor.  The same battery bank also charges about 20 rechargeable D, AA, and AAA rechargeable common batteries using a similar DC power chord with a high quality 12 Volt DC fast charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to everyone I know, I pay about a tenth for batteries everyone else does, with much more convenience.  Unbeatable razor purchase, especially if solar energy is charging it.</li>
            <li> This shaver has performed well for me, so far.  I was able to shave five days, before recharging.  The charger is built into the cord, making the shaver itself lighter.  However the cord is not compatible with my older Morelco shaver.  It provides a very good shave for me.</li>
            <li> Pros:  &lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use.  &lt;br /&gt;- Good function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: none &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have used it for nearly two months. Until now, it works well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my *old* Norelco.  The 7110 is so quiet you sometimes can&#x27;t even hear it, gentle on the skin (even right away, which some reviews have said was not the case), and easy to clean.  The fact that you can rinse the heads and other parts without worrying about damaging the mechanism is a big time saver!  All in all, for the money (a fraction of what I paid for the last Norelco I had), this is a great buy.  There are more expensive Philips Norelco shavers out there, but unless they&#x27;re going to brew you some coffee while still giving you the same great shave, I can&#x27;t see spending the money... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;UNLESS 20-25 minutes of battery time isn&#x27;t enough for you.  The charger cord is unobtrusive, and easy to bring with, so it never bothers me that I only get 3-4 uses before it needs to be charged.  The battery time is the only reason whatsoever this thing doesn&#x27;t get 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver (have been using gillette sensor excel for number of years) and I love it.  This is giving me a very close shave on my cheeks but not so close under the chin/neck area.  Still, I am very happy with the overall shave and definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver over the Christmas holiday, it took a long time to get it due to out of stock, hut once I got it, it is a great shaver, it shave realy close like a razor. and very quiet and smooth. price was also very good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thuy</li>
            <li> bought cheaply when on sale for $25. i have always been a fan of norelco razors because they work great and are fast to use. quality has gone down over the years since philips bought them out. the plastic on this one is cheap when put side by side with my older norelco made in holland. &lt;br /&gt;I used to have an lcd display for power which this one doesnt have, just a green and red light for power. there is no travel bag like previous norelco models. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;cleaning is very easy though with just a quick wash in hot water. but i have concerns of constant water exposure to the blades which probably causes rust over time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;also cutting power doesnt seem as strong as older models and requires you to go back and fourth a few more times.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well once you get used to the switch from razors. The only minor complaint is the rather limited charge it holds. I usually get 3-4 shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> Hi Amazon:  I am very unhappy with Philips Norelco shaver, model 7110X, that I received on 3/23/07.  After charging the battery, before first use, for the required 8 hours, and an 8 hour recharging every second/third day since then, I cannot get a shave for up to the indicated 25 minutes of shave time.  The \\&quot;low\\&quot; battery indicator ALWAYS comes on the second or third time I shave.  I am going to keep trying but I think the total shave time is certainly less than the 25 minutes indicated.</li>
            <li> It is well made but when fully charged it only lasts two shaves and then needs to be charged again.</li>
            <li> I gave this shaver to my son.  He was using my husband&#x27;s shaver, which is an older model Norelco.  I thought he should have his own Norelco because they had to run to two different bathrooms to get it.  My husband has always owned Norelco shavers.  He still has his first one from the 60&#x27;s.  My own Dad also owned only Norelco shavers.  They always give great shaves and the Norelco tradition continues through my own family.</li>
            <li> The Norelco electric shaver that I purchased was exactly as promised **brand new in the box**.  I&#x27;m very happy with the service and prompt shipping.  They are an asset to amazon and I will buy from them again if the need arises.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with the shaver. He was looking for a replacement for the one he had, and this one was the closest match, and ended up being better quality and a great price.</li>
            <li> transaction was smootha and easy, product met my expecations, delivery was on time, actually was delivered before expected time.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for many years.  With the ability to clean this device under a fawcet, Norelco has moved to a new level of customer convenience.  An excellent product</li>
            <li> Excellent product. After buying  several shavers from Walmart  which although popular brand  named products they functioned poorly my husband is delighted with the Norelco. Although I ordered one three arrived. It didn&#x27;t seem easy to return so we kept the other two to give as gifts. I guess I hit the wrong button on the computer.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7110X shaver is a good product, a good value, and gives a good shave. Its transformer will work with most voltages, a useful feature for overseas travel. However, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like. This may be due to the \\&quot;rinse clean\\&quot; feature. The razor I was \\&quot;used to\\&quot; was bought in Australia two years ago and seems similar to the Philips Norelco 7145XL Rechargeable Cordless Razor with the transformer internal to the razor.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver, and it does a very good job, but I wish the charge would last more than 25 minutes.  I do realize that this is not an expensive model, but it still should run for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Runs so quietly it&#x27;s a pleasure to use, very nice product. Trimmer works great, too.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband.  He has had a Norelco for many years and has really enjoyed having one.  So we purchased a new one for his birthday and I know he will be using this also for years.  He is very pleased with the shave it gives, the convenience of its use - and the price was great!!!!</li>
            <li> For the money this product is excellent.  This is only the third Norelco I have had in over forty years of shaving with electric razors.  This one is superior the previous two, even when they were new.  This was also the least expensive.  The razor heads are identical to the more expensive razors.  The cost difference is not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is very good and works nice, and the price awesome, a good product for an incredible price!!!</li>
            <li> After about 3 years this razor is still giving consistently good and close shaves and the battery is still just as good as the day I got it. I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face couldn&#x27;t handle blades anymore. I thought I&#x27;d have to sacrifice a close shave in order to get a healthier face but this hasn&#x27;t been the case with this shaver. The shave is almost as close as a blade and I have absolutely no irritation. I upgraded to one of the speed XL models and this one is slightly slower, but not so bad.     There are only 2 downsides: It takes 8 hours to charge and you can&#x27;t use it corded. This is not that big of a deal though since you&#x27;ll still have plenty of time to finish when the low battery indicator goes off.    At this point I couldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver if you have already used a rotary and know you like them and for a very simple reason: it is obsolete and buying replacement heads is almost as much as a new razor. However, if you are looking for a traveling razor or want to give rotaries a shot then this might be the right choice. A few years ago I would have highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 4 years since I bought this razor and it still works great. I bother to shave about three times a week, so I can&#x27;t attest to daily usage, but for a simple model electric razor it is sufficient. It is a handy feature to be able to flush out the razor under the tap and just let it dry during the day. If this one broke I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He says it gives him as close a shave as a razor. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great razor for a cheap price.  much quieter than my older norelco.    THIS IS A POS RAZOR. AFTER ONE YEAR THE BATTER STARTED CRAPING OUT. NOW AFTER 16 MONTHS CAN&#x27;T EVEN GET ONE SHAVE OUT OF IT.      THIS SITE WILL NOT LET YOU CHANGE  YOUR RATING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a few months, and it gives a great, close shave.  My only issue with the product is that the battery life fails to live up to its promises.  It claims 25 minutes of cordless shaving, but my personal experience has been closer to about half that.  I don&#x27;t travel much, so the razor usually just stays plugged in in the bathroom, but I am still disappointed that Philips Norelco makes such an exaggerated claim on its product.  Despite this, I am quite pleased with the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> We have had to replace the blades several times. Maybe it is good that the razor is still running, but the blades are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco fan for years, and this must be my fifth shaver from them.  This is also the worst.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but it takes forever to shave with this model.  It seems to have a smaller cutting area than my previous Norelcos.  Perhaps the more expensive models do better, but for now, I&#x27;m just living with a longer shave time to get the same results.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and removes all of my beard growth Daily.    I am very satisfied with the product.     I am also pleased with it&#x27;s quietness and the fact that a full recharge only requires 8 hours. My old Norelco required a 24 hour recharge, but it was a very old model for which I bought replacement battereies three times in its lifetime.</li>
            <li> Did not try to wash it yet, but otherwise it works great.  Good deal for $40.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I have owned.  I bought two of them on sale&lt;br /&gt;from CVS @ $29.99.  Both died.  One problem involves cleaning. If you have&lt;br /&gt;steady fingers fine.  My hands shake a bit.  I can get some of the hairs out by using hot water. But each time I have tried to lift the plastic blade holder, either one of the parts has broken or there is great difficulty in getting the three blades properly reset and then getting the&lt;br /&gt;holder to click.  This has happened twice.  Moreover I have found the&lt;br /&gt;motor to be poor. A shaver repair specialist evaluated four different&lt;br /&gt;Norelco units and had the least to say about the 7110. The others received&lt;br /&gt;some praise. Matching the 7110 to the 9160 is like matching a Civic or&lt;br /&gt;Corolla to a Yugo or Pinto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the current dead razor I found it took a long time to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;Finally now the motor stopped working. I am hoping for a refund from&lt;br /&gt;CVS, even though eight months old. Norelco won&#x27;t issue a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are very few products that I have rated lower. I rate many things.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this shaver as a replacement for an old Hitachi. What a disappointment. The shaver&#x27;s battery is terrible. I barely get 3 or 4 shaves out of it. Also, I don&#x27;t use this shaver every day, so it could be the idle time drains the battery too. Also, you can&#x27;t just plug it in, and start using the shaver. Power can only come from the battery, so you can&#x27;t bypass it (a real bummer when the shaver is low on juice). Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find the ergonomics to be too bad. The other problem is that it takes a while to shave as well, it&#x27;s slow. I got fed up, and got a Panasonic instead (and it was only forty bucks). MUCH MUCH better. I charged it once, and it&#x27;s still going strong. Save your money and get a better product.</li>
            <li> The shaves are close.  The motor is very quiet compared to my previous Norelco&#x27;s.  I chose to purchase a new razor rather than buy the replacement heads.  I am enjoying this Norelco edition!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy fast-growing beard type with sensitive skin, retired, and don&#x27;t shave every day. Disposable blades are fine when I shave every day, but not after two or three days&#x27; growth. Then, the skin irritation is, uh, really irritating.    When my last electric (Braun) bit the dust several years ago, I went to disposables for their closer shave.    Now that I no longer shave every day, I decided to try a new electric.    For $29.95 at Wal-Mart, this Norelco 7110 can&#x27;t be beat!    I don&#x27;t understand the comments that it won&#x27;t work when on a cord and plugged in. I just bought mine this morning, plugged it in to charge for eight hours, then got impatient to try it after less than an hour.    I hadn&#x27;t read any of these reviews about how it won&#x27;t work on a cord. (Nor does the manual mention that.)    It worked terrifically, powered by the cord, on my three-days&#x27; growth of heavy beard!    Gave me absolutely as close a shave as a blade razor, and in the same short time!    Plus no irritation! Baby-soft skin and I&#x27;m not kidding!    Can&#x27;t comment yet on anything else about this shaver. I&#x27;ve had it less that 12 hours. But I already love it.    Having had Norelcos in the past, I&#x27;m not anticipating any problems.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased. No problems my son just wanted one.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco shaver. The first was purchased for about the same price about 12 years ago and worked well for its lifetime (it still works, but not well). The new Norelco 7110 is a big step down from that old model. It takes me a long time to shave (which means I mostly go around looking unshaven), requiring many passes over the same area, and the battery charge does not last more than one shave. By the time I&#x27;ve cleaned my face, the red \\&quot;low\\&quot; battery indicator is blinking. Also, and this is probably the worst change with respect to the older model, when the shaver is plugged in, it still runs off battery, meaning that if the battery is dead you can&#x27;t shave for an hour even if it&#x27;s plugged in! So a year after buying it, I&#x27;m in the market for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is cheap but has a very weak power. I recharged it several times already, hoping that the battery is just not properly charged but still got the same performance. I don&#x27;t even want to send it back as the cost of shipping is probably gonna cost me more than the actual price of this shaver.</li>
            <li> Upgraded to this razor (actually, the 7140XL, but they&#x27;re nearly identical razors) after my old Remington died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  It cut a bit close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was just me getting used to the \\&quot;Lift &amp; cut.\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This would be an excellent razor if it wasn&#x27;t for two features (or lack thereof) that make it a pain to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  The internal battery is NiCd.  This type of battery has \\&quot;memory\\&quot; to it, which means for optimal performance, the battery should be fully drained before you recharge it.  Otherwise, the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless. &lt;br /&gt;2.  There isn&#x27;t a low battery indicator. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By itself, either of these features wouldn&#x27;t pose a problem.  Combined, you&#x27;re left wondering when you&#x27;ll have to charge the shaver, or when you&#x27;re off on that business trip, if you&#x27;ll need to bring the charger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the long run, this razor is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.  Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH or some technology that&#x27;s not 15 years old. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a week, and I still can&#x27;t get over how quiet it is.  My old Norelco was so noisy I used a different shaver (an old Braun) around my ears.  This one is essentially silent.  The blades don&#x27;t seem to spin as fast as the old model, which probably contributes to its quietness, but that&#x27;s ok with me; it&#x27;s probably a little gentler on the skin as a result.  It is also very light (suspiciously so - what did they leave out?).  The shave is very close and I like the spring-loaded blades which contour very nicely around the jaw and chin.  I was concerned that the charging light never blinks to indicate a full charge (like the manual states it would) but I notice in another post that the manual is wrong, so that makes me feel better.  All in all, I would say so far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a electronic shaver. 7110 is well priced(I paid less than 35$).  &lt;br /&gt;Still cannot get a clean shave like a Gilette, But I like the fact that we can clean it under the tap with hot water.... Trimmer works good ....Like the grip... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I still prefer a clean Razor shave..</li>
            <li> This might work wor people who shave daily. Does not work for people planning to shave like once a week or longer!</li>
            <li> For just a little more than it would cost for new replacment blades for my old Norelco, I purchased the Norelco 7110X.  This is my 4th Norelco in 40 years and by far the best.  It&#x27;s lighter, quieter and shaves closer than any previous cordless shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  Also it was prices less than all the others.</li>
            <li> Just to make it short: My Father, Brother and I we all have Philips shavers (it has been that way for yearssss!!!). The reason: it has everything you can ask for: Cordless /w good battery live, washable, cool and precise shaving and the best part it has a reasonable price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is the worst Norelco I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I have had two other Norelcos that my dad and my brother took from me.  They were great shavers.  The only thing I like about this one is that you can rinse it under the faucet.  This thing has a very weak battery.  One must go over his face more than twice to get a smooth shave.  I paid $25 for it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver yesterday and today I got the best shave of my life with no skin irritation (I have sensitive skin.)  At this price, I am not put off any of the complaints regarding charging time, frequency, etc.  They sound just like my last one.  Light weight and excellent feel.  And quiet.  Without my hearing aids, I could hardly tell it was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pay any attention to the \\&quot;low\\&quot; charge light.  I find that I can get a week of additional use before the battery is exhausted.  Doing a complete discharge keeps the battery from developing a memory leak.  I keep a throw-away blade razor in my shaving kit to cover an exhausted battery.</li>
            <li> Good shaver but I found out that I prefer a blade.  Only negative is that I don&#x27;t like the battery, you have to charge it for 8 hours at a time and can&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time.  Other then that it does a very nice job.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a very good electric shaver. I&#x27;ve had this for over 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. Don&#x27;t need to charge it more than once a week. The hair-trimmer works well too.     Bottom line: If you want a good basic shaver for less, this is it!</li>
            <li> This Norelco is far superior to the older model I replaced.  It&#x27;s lighter, gives a smoother shave, holds a good charge, and I can wash the blades out under running water (couldn&#x27;t with the old one).  I was pleasantly surprised.  It exceeded my expectations, but still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.  I&#x27;ve had it a year and the blades need replacement.  I notice blades are $30 on Amazon, or you can buy a whole new razor for $29 shipped.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> I chose this shaver because it had mostly good reviews, but I think only people with peach fuzz whiskers are going to get a good shave from this.  On the first shave after fully charging, it took 8 minutes to get a \\&quot;complete\\&quot; shave and I ended up cutting my neck also.  The only other time I have cut myself with an electric shaver is when the blades were very old and dull.  This should not happen with a brand new shaver.  I took it back the next day and got a Remington R-800 instead.  Unfortunately, the Remington is not as good as my old Norelco 7616X, but it&#x27;s a darn site better than this Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers my entire adult life (nearly 30 years). This is the worst one I have purchased. I have used this one for about 6 months. The blades are different than previous models, because they scratch the sides of my chin if I&#x27;m not careful. They also take a couple passes to give a good shave.     The package and manual state that the charge light blinks when the cycle is complete, and that takes 8 hours. A tech support agent told me that it does blink, but only for a few seconds, then continues to glow. Useless feature.     The full charge only lasts a few (3, maybe 4) days. The previous model I had performed much better and charged in about an hour and the charge lasted for a week.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok barely passable I was looking for cheap and got what I paid for. Have owned other Norelco razors and have always been satisfied. would probably spend a little more money and get the next model it&#x27;s not a bad product i just got what I payed for</li>
            <li> Excellent electric shaver. It has most of the same features as Norelco&#x27;s more expensive models, including allowing the user to clean its blade assembly with running water. I don&#x27;t know why their top of the line models cost so much more, for seemingly so little difference between them and the lower priced 7110X.</li>
            <li> This has a nice function and very nice price. I got 6 of them as a gift and they like it.</li>
            <li> I am a regular Norelco 3-blade shaver.  They vary in price a lot, but I have found the basic model works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, it is equal and/or cheaper to just buy a new razor every few years than go through the less than always successful effort to buy and replace the unit&#x27;s blades with new ones.</li>
            <li> This shaves better on wet skin than dry skin. It also holds alot more battery charge.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used one that worked a little better, but this is a great shaver, escpecially for the price, i love it, easy to use, easy to clean, charges quickly and holds a charge for long period of time</li>
            <li> A good shave, but the batteries go dead quickly. My old Norelco lasts more than a week between charges, this lasts two or three days.</li>
            <li> I needed a quick shaver.It is adequate.Shaves reasonably well but after 3 shaves the charge light starts to flash.Eventually I will buy a better model of the same shaver</li>
            <li> For the money it was a great deal!  However, compared to my higher end Braun it feels cheaply made with light plastics - has a very cheap feel to it.  Other than feeling like junk, its decent for the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using various shaving systems and decided to try this philips norelco system.  I have tried remington in the past (gave a good shave but a little too close as my skin was always irritated after the shave), I have a braun syncro (love the system, upgraded it a few years after the first syncro since I loved it so much.  The only problem with the braun is that the hair particles get all over your bathroom as you shave.  There is no collection system). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This made me want to try another system that could be washed with running water and would collect the hair clippings.  The philips norelco 7110X does this and its great for the bathroom but its shave is not on par with the Braun Syncro.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Couple of things to consider...the Braun was almost 4 times more expensive.  It gave a better shave but also needed more attention with cleaning the shaver, the bathroom, etc.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps someone out there make their decision &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Indiawala</li>
            <li> The power of this shaver is terrible.  Requires multiple passovers and often pricks a few hairs in the process.  Battery life is not very good as well.  Avoid shaver.     The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the price is close to what you would expect for replacement heads.  Which is exactly what I ended up doing after one week.  I took out the heads and placed it in my 4 year old  shaver and its been great!</li>
            <li> My other Norelco didn&#x27;t seem to be shaving well.  I finally figured out that I needed to replace the blades...duh.  So, I was looking online and the cost of this product was only $20 more than replacement blades.  So why buy a new one?  Well...my other Norelco is also rechargeable and rechargeable batteries loose their life after a while, so it&#x27;s nice having one with a fresh battery.      This product does a good job considering the price.</li>
            <li> The reason i bought Norelco is they always have a top notch product... I gave to my nephew and he loves it... 3 head shaver, good grip and I got a free night at a b&amp;b out of it..</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my new Philips Norelco 7110x.  Its battery is too small and requires frequent charging.  According to Philips customer service, the battery can hold a maximum charge of 25 minutes.  If it takes 5 minutes to shave....a person would need to recharge every 5 days.  This is way too frequent and a hassle.  My older Philips shaver required recharging every 3-4 weeks!  NOT every 5 days.  I&#x27;m very very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Just not as good as the similar Remington it replaced. The only thing I like better with the Norelco is that it&#x27;s quieter than the Remington.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband for Christmas, and he loves it. Says he has experienced no hair pulling or other irritation, likely b/c he lets it grow out a little between shaves, 3-4 days. It does work best when the hair is a bit more than rough stubble...better to use a regular razor if you need a close shave when it is still short, like 1-2 days after a close shave. He did find the 8 hr fist charge annoying, and I keep reminding him that this type of battery works best when it is allowed to drain to near empty before recharging or it reduces battery life. Other than remembering that, it is a great product and he has used it several times, happy each time!</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  Gets the job done, battery lasts for at least a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  Definitely no flaws and no reason to spend hundreds of dollars when this razor gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for 35 years and this is hands down the poorest electric shaver I have ever used. The motor is very weak and turns the blades slowly. The build quality, shave and feel of this shaver is very much like one of those little travel shavers that runs on AA batteries. In fact I have one of those that gives a much better shave than this Norelco. This Norelco also will leave you with a face full of nicks and cuts. Avoid this shaver.</li>
            <li> I had Norelco shavers before, but this one is the most disappointing ever. It takes forever to get something resembling a close shave and if, then at the cost of razor burn. If you want to look acceptable you need to go over the same spot at least 10 times.</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my husband.  He used to get the razor bumps on his face from shaving with the cream and the nasty razor.  He does not get it with this though.  I bought the female shaver for myself and I enjoyed it.  It gives a nice shave!</li>
            <li> IT WAS EASY TO PICK OUT WHAT I WANTED, FIND THE RIGHT PRICE, ORDER EASILY AND PROCESS EFFORTLESSLY. PROUCT ARIVED VERY QUICKY AND WORKS VERY WELL. I WILL BE BACK.</li>
            <li> Good product as I expect. Nice price, In future, I will buy good product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco electric shaver that lasted at least 15 years. Finally gave out from use. This one my not last near that long, I&#x27;m not that thrilled. I still get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a year ago to relace my old Norelco.  The old one lasted about 5 years and worked perfectly until the battery quit.  This is an excellent razor, does a good job, and is quiet.</li>
            <li> This new model works much better than the previous Norelco Lift-n-cut. No longer do I have to scrub my face. The charge lasts a long time and no cord to get in the way anymore, and so quiet you can&#x27;t hear it running, and good grips so it never slips out of your grasp.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 weeks now,and it has performed well beyond my expectations for this price razor. The initial charge lasted over 7 days of shaving for me (my beard if fairly light) and it seems to do a very good job of shaving. I haven&#x27;t used and electric razor for over 40 years, always lather and blade, and I think this electric gives nearly as close a shave with a lot less mess and bother. I rate it EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this exact shaver at Black Friday 06, but they had sold out (surprise). I&#x27;m glad I waited to get this from Amazon with free prime shipping. The shave is good and it is super quiet. I also like how light-weight it is.</li>
            <li> If you like plugging in your shaver constantly, this is the device for you. I purchased this a little while ago and have been using it for about 2 months. It looks nice, but really only lasts about 10-15 min of shaving before you get the red flashing \\&quot;charge me\\&quot; indicator. Even when it is fully charged, it doesn&#x27;t seem that powerful. I find myself going over an area over and over again and then just getting a regular razor to get the job done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:  &lt;br /&gt;Easy to turn on and off, simply press a button. &lt;br /&gt;Looks good and when it works, it does a decent job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Lasts only 10-15 min max before you have to plug it in overnight to charge. &lt;br /&gt;Does do as good of job as I thought it would actually shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: &lt;br /&gt;Save you money and buy a better shaver. If if you can&#x27;t afford something nicer, a bag of disposable razors will do a better job.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the money, quite a close shave, easy to use and clean...  Be careful around the mouth as it sometimes catches the skin a little...  Well worth the money though!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor two months ago to replace a 20 year old Norelco Rota-Tract. It&#x27;s quieter, shaves closer &amp; it&#x27;s lighter than the old one. The light does not tell you when it&#x27;s fully charged as the owners manual says it should. I just leave it charging over night when the low charge light flashes &amp; it&#x27;s fine. It seems to hold a charge for a long time. I wish it had a nice case like my old one. Overall I like it. If it lasts like the old one I had it will be a great razor!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a little over a year now, and am still very happy with it.  This model is no less powerful than my two previous Norelco razors (both of which lasted about 12 years each).  It is however the quietest Norelco I have owned, and perhaps because it doesn&#x27;t buzz like an angry nest of hornets some people think it isn&#x27;t as powerful as their older Norelcos, but it is.    This model cuts nice and close, so if you haven&#x27;t used a Norelco before, don&#x27;t go grinding this into your face with force and then complain that it skinned you alive.  As the instructions state, a Norelco is meant to be glided across your face in smooth circular motions without using pressing force.    This model stays charged for about 2.5 weeks when shaving every other day and about 10 days if you use it every day.    If you are looking for a nice Norelco shaver and don&#x27;t want to waste money on gimmics don&#x27;t actually provide a better shave, then this 7110x is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same product previously and this was an exact duplicate.  The cost was very good and the product arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> Not bad but doesn&#x27;t get a good close shave.  I have always had problems getting a good close shave using electric shavers.  This one is no different.  Other then that is seems to work fine.  Mine is still kicking strong, use it about once every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am kind of happy with this shaver, but if you need a quick shave, go look somewhere else (most likely you&#x27;ll need to spend some more money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to wash with water (a killer feature at this price-point)&lt;br /&gt;* Low noise, a lot less than other electric shaver I used before.&lt;br /&gt;* Cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Slow. I can&#x27;t get a decent shave in less than ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;* Battery with memory effect: you need to wait for the battery to die before recharging. I get caught in the middle of a shave every few days.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third one of these over the past 10-12 years or so.  I use one every day and it performs well, holds a charge for a couple of weeks, so overall I am very satisfied.  It doesn&#x27;t shave QUITE as close as a blade, but who cares?  As a trade off for never cutting myself, it&#x27;s worth it.    The only reason I bought a new one was that the old one needed a new blade set which was about $30.  I was able to get a whole new razor for $38, so I bought it.  Gave the old one away... it was still running pretty well.</li>
            <li> This shaver fits comfortably in your hand. Very nice to use. Very close shaves and quiet running. I&#x27;m very impressed with this unit and would not hesitate to recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> This razor is so quiet, it sounds like it didn&#x27;t charge up and the battery is almost dead. Yet, it gives a nice, close shave. It&#x27;s a lot of razor for the price.[[ASIN:B000FEGUIM Philips Norelco 7110X Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for quite a few years.  Bought it on a fantastic sale- was even a bit leary because of the price I paid back then.    Excellent shave.  Charge lasts me 9 to 10 days.  Red LED flash during shave when it&#x27;s time to plug in -but you can finish the shave.  (In fact, I&#x27;ve gotten add&#x27;l shaves from it on those occasions where I&#x27;d forgotten to plug it in.)    Only drawback is, unlike my previous rechargeable shaver, it cannot be used as a corded shaver.  So if the battery is dead, you&#x27;ll have to wait for it to fully charge. -Probably that afternoon.  But it&#x27;s never been a problem because, as mentioned, you can get a shave or two after the first signal.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older Norelco 965RX which can no longer hold charge. For the price, it is certainly look and feel a lot cheaper than my 10+ years 965RX. It shave about the same as the 965RX but lacks the battery life indicator, longer charge time, larger AC cord and no travel case. The saving grace for this model is that it has a low battery indicator unlike the newer Norelco 73xx or even the 7130/7140. The head is also all plastic with no adjustment (except for the steel blades and combs) unlike the all metal of the old. The head is definitely flexing more than the old but I am not sure if it really cut any closer than the old \\&quot;Lift and Cut\\&quot; blades. This shaver have both slots and foil on the shaver combs to get closer shave and I think it helps on short stubbles. It does have a nice feature that my old Norelco could not do: washable head. The trimmer is similar to the old which I think is much better than the version on the expensive Arcitec which is not sliding out at all to be useful.</li>
            <li> I have had this POS for over a year. It is without a doubt the WORST razor ever. It sucks. It takes forever to shave, has a weak motor and never ever gives me a clean shave. Why, you ask, have I put up with it for a year? For the same reason some people stay in abusive relationships. This razor has talked down to me, pointed fingers at me, and slapped me around, but now I&#x27;ve had enough. I&#x27;m leaving you, 7110. Go find some other schlubb to wash out your nasty blades.</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone else that says it takes several passes over the same area to get all the hairs.  If there is any length to them at all, it can also pull on them.  Ouch!  My skin always feels a little irritated, especially around the neck, when I&#x27;m done.  I&#x27;ve gotten to wear I really don&#x27;t want to shave, so I only do it like once a week and therefore become quite scruffy looking.  I&#x27;m realizing that&#x27;s not going to work in my professional setting, so I&#x27;m definitely looking at upgrading very soon.</li>
            <li> Works fine... but you get maybe 2 or 3 shaves (days) and it needs recharging, again.</li>
            <li> First off, you shouldn&#x27;t be shaving anything but your face with this razor.  Norelco&#x27;s older models seem to be heavier and have more powerful motors; this thing is more like those old electric lawnmowers that couldn&#x27;t cut grass more than 1/2\\&quot; high.  It gives a middling shave on face and neck, but it certainly can&#x27;t handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean.  It also won&#x27;t do armpits or backs or legs very well.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go with an older model that is heavier and seems to have a more powerful motor.  You&#x27;ll need it to clearcut your axillary forest.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Amazon about a week ago for a blowout price.  It already looks like Amazon is not selling this item anymore as it is currently only listed as available from various Marketplace sellers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the three ten-spots I paid, I&#x27;m satisfied.  It basically cost what replacement blades for my other shaver cost.  I will say that this shaver doesn&#x27;t appear to have the same quality of build as my last Norelco.  It is lighter, doesn&#x27;t feel as good in the hand, and has a cheap plastic feel.  The motor sounds like it&#x27;s less powerful than my older model (which listed for a similar full retail price when new); even with a full charge it doesn&#x27;t sound like the blades and spinning around very fast.  That being said, the thing isn&#x27;t particularly quiet either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gives an adequate if mediocre shave.  Requires lots of passes over the same area of skin in order to get everything.  All in all not a terrible buy, but not a great find either.</li>
            <li> it is an excellent product for the price I paid. I strongly recommend the Philips Norelco 7110X!!!</li>
            <li> Its hard to get a uniform shave with this. Also even after 3 months, my skin still burns whenever I shave. I switched back to my razor</li>
            <li> The 7110X is quiet, comfortable and gives me a close shave. Much better than my old National electric shavers. I rate it Great! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this razor, in part due to the rave reviews on Amazon.  I must have gotten a rotten apple because I only get maybe, at the most, 5 minutes of shave time before the red light comes on.  I charge the battery for much longer than the stated 8 hours and it still won&#x27;t hold the charge for long.  Just tried Norelco&#x27;s online \\&quot;live\\&quot; customer support to find out how to return for service/replacement and the agents are 1) not very knowledgeable, and 2) unable to stay connected with me for more than a couple minutes.  So far, a waste of 25 bucks, but at least it was only 25 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years and I like them. After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It gives a great shave! They&#x27;ve changed the heads a bit and added some holes. Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s quiet. I can actually have a conversation with my wife while shaving. This wasn&#x27;t possible with my older shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is significanly lighter than my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cleanup is really easy. You just flush the head with hot water once a week. Once a month or so you&#x27;re supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean but my guess is that once a quarter would be plenty. Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It takes 8 hours to charge. Yikes! Eight hours. My old shaver never took over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s hard to tell how much charge you have left. My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front. This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor. When it runs low on juice you&#x27;ll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving. This isn&#x27;t nearly as handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The shape isn&#x27;t as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature. There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it&#x27;s wet. It doesn&#x27;t feel very good in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There is no case to store it in. This is a drawback if you use it to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The head is supposed to be replaced once a year. Huh??? This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers. These heads aren&#x27;t cheap, folks. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I&#x27;d probably buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver. It does the job very well and it was quite inexpensive. I would certainly recommend this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.ecommend this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, and the motor is pretty quiet. I haven&#x27;t felt the difference with the Lift-n-Cut feature that it advertises so much, I don&#x27;t feel any significant difference when compared to other electric shavers. But the instruction says that 8-hour of charge can only yield 25 minutes of operating time, that&#x27;s a bit short to me.  Maybe because it&#x27;s the lower priced model, and the more expensive ones will have longer battery time?  On the other hand, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean the shaving head, just one press n the head pops out, just rinse it with water and you are pretty much done, or you can clean the inside with the supplied brush.  Overall, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I think this razor is great and am totally amazed at the fact that you can rinse it clean under a water faucet..I just wish it didn&#x27;t take 8 hours to charge..</li>
            <li> I  bought it as gift for my uncle, so I actually don&#x27;t have a chance to use it yet. it looks really fashion, I like it.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t hold a charge and I returned it for exchange. But, while I had it, it ran quitely and shaved closely. I sent it back just yesterday and don&#x27;t know when the replacement will arrive.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and can be washed under running water. Sadly my beard keeps growing so I need to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Just bought this to replace a 15+ year old Braun, and it is definitely a great value for the money...it definitely has a different feel than my old Braun (much lighter for sure), but I have to say the difference in the shave is minimal, if any...I typically blade shave during the week, and use an electric on the weekends for convenience, but this may become my standard if the performance stays the same as it has so far...</li>
            <li> I have had the razor a couple of weeks and like it so far.  It cuts closer that the electrics I have had before (albeit not as close as a blade).  I was also surprised at how quiet it is.  For the price I paid for it, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift.  I have had no response from the receiver of this gift.  I hope he likes it.</li>
            <li> I get 3 less than 2 minute shaves on a 24 hour recharge.  Might as well leave it plugged in...  Shaves great</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Norelco shaver I had for over 5 years. Instead of buying new blades, I decided the &#x27;new&#x27; shave system might be worth the difference. I went from a good shaver that lasts 4-5 months per charge to a good shaver that lasts a week to 10 days per charge. It did shave any better than the old one I had.    I don&#x27;t know yet if this is indicative of all new Norelco shavers or just this model, but I would have returned it if I could have. I would not recommend this model.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, I like the fact that you can clean it by using running water. For the price, it would be hard to beat.[[ASIN:B000FEGUIM Philips Norelco 7110X Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over a year. No complaints about shaving - doesn&#x27;t take too long; it&#x27;s washable also, but horrible on two places - my neck and my lower lip area. This is the only shaver that managed to give me razor bumps on my neck and CUT my chin. When I shave in between my chin and my lower lip, it just goes \\&quot;snap\\&quot; and cuts my skin.   It takes a bit longer to get a decent clean shave out of it than other shavers, but overall it&#x27;s worth $40 paid for it.   However, if choosing again, I&#x27;d get something like HQ8xxx (three circles on each blade) since I actually put in HQ9 blades into HQ7110 and it seemed to shave a lot faster.   Bottom line: don&#x27;t buy it, add another $50 and get HQ8140 or RQ1050, it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is definitely worth what I paid for it . but it does seem a little lacking in power , but shaves decently</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to use this product. It works okay on my cheeks, chin, and upper lip, but when I brought it to my neck WATCHOUT! Slice and Dice.    Maybe it&#x27;s just me but OUCH!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. For the price of $29 I got an excellent product that saves me time in the morning. I use to shave using Gilette razor everyday for many years and that was a pain, but not anymore. I am going to buy another one for my dad.</li>
            <li> Why shave with a blade?  If you do, get this for the inbetween days.  You must use a pre-shave lotion and keep this charged fully.</li>
            <li> We got this for our son-in-law as a Christmas gift and he said it was his favorite gift and just loves it.</li>
            <li> The product was not only shipped faster than expected, but it was also in great condition and they followed up to ensure I got my order!</li>
