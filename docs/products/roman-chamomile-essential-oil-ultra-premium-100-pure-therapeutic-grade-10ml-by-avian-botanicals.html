            <li> The smell of this oil is strong if you smell it from the bottle. You are suppose to mix this oil with another oil like argon oil. This chamomile oil helps relax me on a stress full day. I mix some chamomile oil with argon oil and apply that on my wist to calm me down. When this oil is on my wist I can&#x27;t smell it anymore maybe because I have became use to it. You can also put this oil in a diffuser to spread the smell through out your room. I received this chamomile oil for free to test and review in order to give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma! Love the bottle and dropper it makes it easy to get the exact amount of drops for your recipe.</li>
            <li> This Roman Chamomile Essential oil is amazing. This oil is perfect if you are feeling restless or anxious. Just put a few drops in the diffuser and turn on. Within minutes you can feel the stress leaving your body.&lt;br /&gt; It has so many benefits and is said to have all these properties:&lt;br /&gt;Calming&lt;br /&gt;Relaxing&lt;br /&gt;Anti-infectious&lt;br /&gt;Anti-inflammatory&lt;br /&gt;Anti-parasitic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing oil and the quality of this brand is amazing.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!  I was able to purchase for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> We are fairly new to using Essential Oils in our home; however, we love finding new oils and new uses!  I have several friends who have been trained in the area of essential oils and tell me what to look for in an oil, which helps tremendously to weed out the good from the bad.  You don&#x27;t have to buy oils via direct sales if you don&#x27;t want either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile oil has been on my list of wants.  I know I needed 100% pure, steam distilled, and Roman or English Garden variety.  Aviano brand fits all those needs.  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been diffusing chamomile alone or mixed with lavender in our room at night.  Roman Chamomile is known to help with irritation and impatience as well as depression and PMS issues.  So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also supposed to be great for allergies and throat issues.  We&#x27;ve all been suffering from really bad allergy symptoms and they definitely seem to have eased some since diffusing this.  We also plan to try it the next time we have eczema or rashy skin!</li>
            <li> I am just now getting in to essential oils and am loving this! I am using this one mostly to try and help relax me after long, stressful days and it seems to be helping. I really like this company and the customer service they have offered me. I definitely plan to continue buying their products and trying them out!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it to unwind from stressful days in the salon. Super excited about receiving it.</li>
            <li> I got the Roman Chamomile Essential Oil because I heard it was good for insomnia and since my fiance and I both suffer from insomnia I thought I would give this a try! I put a couple drops in my oil diffuser when we were ready to start the awful process of trying to fall asleep. I set my oil diffuser for the hour setting to see if we would fall asleep in an hours time with this essential oil. We did like the smell of this essential oil and noticed that it made us feel really relaxed and in less than an hour we were both actually asleep! We both couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have sleeping pills to help with my insomnia but every time I take them I wake up with a massive headache and it&#x27;s just not worth it and now that I have found this essential oil I don&#x27;t need to even think about taking them because this essential oil has helped a ton! We absolutely love it and would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> We like to combine with lavender essential oil in a diffuser for&lt;br /&gt;to relax and calm after a busy day.  We purchased this&lt;br /&gt;chamomile essential oil in a promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;So happy with the purchase, as this is a premium quality,&lt;br /&gt;and pure (no carrier oils added)</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! I put it in my oil diffuser and it made my whole house smell like a fresh garden. The scent is very relaxing and fresh, but not too overpowering. The scent has a really good throw so I would recommend placing your diffuser in the middle of your house so the scent reaches all areas.  I love the dropper on this bottle too so I can really control how many drops I put in my diffuser. I definitely recommend this oil for de-stressing and relaxing. This would be great to diffuse in my workplace too for creating a calm atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review but all experiences are me own.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Love it. it has a real calming effect!</li>
            <li> Love this at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Chamomile should be in everyone&#x27;s home! This Aviano Botanicals oil is great quality and very calming. I love that it&#x27;s 100% pure and not blended with other oils.</li>
            <li> Purely amazing!!! This sweet potent fragrance is top quality at a good price! Thank you Aviano Botanicals!</li>
            <li> I have been using rosehip oil for 5 days now and i am very satisfied with the result, i mainly use it for my hair and it made it stronger, shiny and less hairfall, i also use it for my skin, it moisturize my skin through out the day, im loving it and it works right away with my skin and hair. I got this discounted item for product testing.</li>
            <li> This has a really strong smell, but it&#x27;s worth it after leaving your skin soft and replenished</li>
            <li> This is a great oil to diffuse at night time.  I turn on my diffuser around 8 at night and add a few drops of this oil.  I find it relaxing and calming after long stressful days at work and chasing kids around in the evenings.  Having chamomile in the air has proved to be helpful in getting us all to relax and be ready for bed at a decent hour.  My diffuser shuts itself off so I have found, by continuing to diffuse chamomile at night, I sleep much sounder and for much longer.  This Aviano brand is excellent because it&#x27;s 100% pure, which is rare to find.  When an oil is this pure and undiluted, you will use less of it, therefore it will last longer.  Saving you time and money.  I was able to purchase mine at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinions and review.  I am very happy with my purchase and would continue to be a customer.  If you are looking for an excellent grade chamomile oil to use, this one is great.</li>
            <li> This Chamomile Essential Oil is strong and a little goes a long way (so don&#x27;t be fooled by the small size of the bottle). It&#x27;s not my favorite smell, but it is calming and still pleasing. I&#x27;ve mixed it with other oils (jajoba, rose hip, etc) and I use it on my face as a serum. It&#x27;s been great in reducing my acne-caused redness. Below are some tips, some pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;TIPS WHEN COMBINING ESSENTIAL OILS-&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;When using this chamomile essential oil to make combination scents for perfume, soap, massage oils, etc, you always want to have a variety of what are called &amp;#34;essential oil notes&amp;#34;. These are scents that have different characteristics. They are broken up into Middle, Top and Bottom notes. Chamomile is a middle note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do different blends, but a good guideline is to start off with 30% Top Notes, 50% Middle Notes, and 20% Base Notes.&lt;br /&gt; ► MIDDLE NOTE: This Chamomile essential oil is what&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;Middle Note&amp;#34;. Other &amp;#34;middle notes&amp;#34; are Geranium, Black pepper, rose, rosemary, pine, etc.&lt;br /&gt; ► TOP NOTES: This includes scents such as: Lemongrass, Peppermint, Orange, Bergamont, Basil, Lavender (middle to top), etc.&lt;br /&gt; ► BASE NOTES: This includes: Ginger, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Frankincense, Myrrh, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS of this Chamomile:&lt;br /&gt; ► Calming&lt;br /&gt; ► Been helping me with my acne&lt;br /&gt; ► Has taken down the acne-related redness in my face significantly. I believe this is due to it&#x27;s anti-inflammatory nature.&lt;br /&gt; ► Great to mix with carrier oils for a calming massage oil&lt;br /&gt; ► Can be used with a carrier oil (such as jajoba, sweet almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, etc) to make perfumes. I suggest adding other essential oils as well (see above for a short guide)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; ► Like I&#x27;ve said, I don&#x27;t care for the smell on it&#x27;s own. But when combined with other essential oils, it works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free for the purpose of reviewing.

            <li> My fiancee uses this for aromatherapy and loves it. She puts it on some kind of leaves and hangs them in the shower. The steam from the shower makes the oils emit a pleasant calming scent, making for a more relaxing shower. I received a discount to provide my honest and unbiased opinion on this and in my opinion this is a high grade, high quality essential oil. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>

            <li> Roman Chamomile is a powerful smelling Essential oil. I could smell it before I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this oil in my bath along with some lavender to help de stress from the hectic day I had had.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you I felt very relaxed soaking in the hot bath. The Chamomile was not as overpowering as I thought it was going to be after unboxing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited to try this essential oil in my diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to try this product out in my home and then report back on how it worked for me. I&#x27;m glad I was given the opportunity to try this essential oil. I will be trying to make some handmade soaps with it next. So many benefits using Chamomile.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.  Smells so nice in my diffuser mixed with other oils for a wonderful floral aroma.  Even my husband liked the smell....</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and I am glad to add it to my collection of essential oils . The only draw back is that its such a great oil and such a small bottle. This stuff is amazing to use in my vaporizer . Like I say a small amount goes a long way with this. When used in a vaporizer it infects the entire room with such a wonderful and its great to use if your sick from the flu in the vaporizer. I mostly have been using this in small drops to put on my face when I get out of the shower to unstress myself.  Its the best for stress and gives you a whole new outlook on life when your down on the dumps. Amazing stuff. .. I received this for free to test and try out, to give feedback on the quality. This review is my honest opinion .</li>
