            <li> Very flimsy and snap in half easily.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality of the headbands I received, but they were the wrong size. The description clearly states they were 1/2&amp;#34; (inch). The headbands I received are clearly marked 5mm (1/2cm). That&#x27;s a big difference. I assume I could have returned them but they worked okay for my purpose so I kept them.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to work with these. plastice is very hard.</li>
            <li> Ecactly what is was supposed to be and I got them in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> Sturdy, great for making &amp;#34;ears&amp;#34; for kids costumes and THE BEST price that I could find</li>

            <li> These were pretty awesome! I made them into fairy crowns for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. All the girls including adults will be wearing one :)</li>
            <li> I like the sturdiness of them but I wish they were 1/2 all the way around and not just at the middle</li>
            <li> Used them for adults and kids. Very sturdy and priced well. They aren&#x27;t too tight at the ears for adults and aren&#x27;t too big for girls.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, 1/2&amp;#34; plastic headbands. Cheapies but exactly what I was looking for. They have to be covered still, but they we&#x27;re offered at a price that allows for that!</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. Packaged neatly. They aren&#x27;t flimsy which I was afraid of. Perfect for making headbands.</li>
            <li> Made favors for 2 little girls birthday parties with these headbands.  They worked great except they were pretty cheap quality.  No teeth on the headband or a cushion at the end, basically just a curved piece of white plastic.  They were thick enough that they didn&#x27;t break, even on adult size heads</li>
            <li> Perfect for craft project.  A bit flimsy but unless you wear it daily they hold up well.</li>
