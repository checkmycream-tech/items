            <li>It has always been my favorite</li>
            <li>and after I guess I will look for another favorite.</li>
            <li>-- so buying it on Amazon was the next best option.</li>
            <li>maybe I buy more soon</li>
            <li>I love this men&#x27;s bath soap.</li>
            <li>This has always been one of my favorite body washes.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it anywhere but online.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has great pricing and subscription offers.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found some still available.</li>
            <li>This product has been very hard to find, but I have liked for many years, so it is wonderful to be able to get it through the Subscribe &amp; Save program on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Searching for it on line I found it available on Amazom</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the product it does</li>
            <li>Nice smell very bubleling great price big bottle</li>
            <li>No longer available in retail stores in the Northeast US, so have to buy online.</li>
            <li>Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>This was a unique product so why discontinue?  </li>
            <li>Just clean.</li>
            <li>I ordered Softsoap Body Wash, Ocean Fresh because the manufacturer no longer makes it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as you would find at a retailer, and they do a nice job of shrink-wrapping each bottle to avoid spills.</li>
            <li>Nice soap free,but you can&#x27;t smell the ocean scent that well,and it doesn&#x27;t last the smell.doesnt leave residue though.</li>
            <li>You  will feel clean, fresh, and the aroma is very masculine.</li>
            <li>love the scent not so much for the price, but local stores do not carry anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different products (Irish Spring, Dove, Mennen) but the Softsoap seemed to offer best combination of stuff for a dwelling that is very dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and does not dry me out.</li>
            <li>I intend to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>So I switched to Nivea, Old Spice and, Axe.</li>

            <li> I ordered Softsoap Body Wash, Ocean Fresh because the manufacturer no longer makes it. It has always been my favorite and I have been literally using it for decades. Searching for it on line I found it available on Amazom so I ordered 4 bottles. This should last me for a while and after I guess I will look for another favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some trouble finding this stuff in stores -- was it discontinued? -- so buying it on Amazon was the next best option. It&#x27;s the same as you would find at a retailer, and they do a nice job of shrink-wrapping each bottle to avoid spills.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product it does it&#x27;s job and rinses off nicely plus it has a good scent. Most times I am unable to find it here locally. I intend to purchase this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and does not dry me out.</li>
            <li> Nice smell very bubleling great price big bottle I recommended  I use every day for a month  I lovet maybe I buy more soon</li>
            <li> I love this men&#x27;s bath soap. Have been using only this for the last eight years! Great scent makes one feel clean and refreshed!  Wifey and family are appreciative:) No longer available in retail stores in the Northeast US, so have to buy online. Amazon has great pricing and subscription offers.</li>
            <li> It was what was expected.</li>
            <li> This product has been very hard to find, but I have liked for many years, so it is wonderful to be able to get it through the Subscribe &amp; Save program on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap.  Lather, rinse, reapeat (optional).  Then you&#x27;ll smell like the ocean - briny and fishy.  Not really.  Just clean.</li>
            <li> Great Softsoap product for Men ! I was unable to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I always liked this product and was disappointed when they stopped making it.  Glad to have found some still available.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different products (Irish Spring, Dove, Mennen) but the Softsoap seemed to offer best combination of stuff for a dwelling that is very dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash product that I use.  The scent is not overbearing and it works great in a wash towel.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorite body washes.  For some reason whenever I like something Colgate Palmolive discontinues it.  This was a unique product so why discontinue?  What they offer now is not for me.  So I switched to Nivea, Old Spice and, Axe.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS A NICE FRAGRANCE TO IT,BUT IT DRIES OUT MY SKIN SO MUCH ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER TIME. OVERALL NOT A BAD BUY FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> excellent product and quality.  Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Nice soap free,but you can&#x27;t smell the ocean scent that well,and it doesn&#x27;t last the smell.doesnt leave residue though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it anywhere but online.  It was shipped and received two days earlier than promised.</li>
