            <li>This lotion smell amazing, is a great moisturizer and fab non bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the bronzers (which is good for my fair skin</li>
            <li>However i&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>I have gotten wise (about time).  </li>
            <li>Decided to try out some of Designer Skin&#x27;s tanning lotions, cuz I kept hearing good things about them.   </li>
            <li>Masquerade gives me a beautiful healthy glow, not orange.  </li>
            <li>I ordered from Sealed Lotion Products twice now and have been very pleased with their quality and speed of order</li>
            <li>It smells good and goes on nice</li>
            <li>The Aphrodisiac lotion has a very good smell to it, almost like Cool Water cologne.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product, but I still love my bronzers!</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>this is now one of my favorite tanning lotions!</li>
            <li>I saw amazing reviews about the lotion and decided to give it a try, but it just wasn&#x27;t the lotion for me.</li>
            <li>this product is well worth your money (even if you&#x27;re extremely light skinned like me!) :D</li>
            <li>It MUST have some kind of bronzer, or self tanner in it.</li>
            <li>Good price for the product though. :)</li>
            <li>I liked this lotion</li>
            <li>Was a great product, smells like a clean shower and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product other than the fact that it works great is its smell.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, very clean, and was moisturizing to the skin.</li>
            <li>I liked it at first- nice moisturizer, great light, fruity smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light and fresh, I don&#x27;t notice any difference in odor after getting out of the beds, my husband opened this and honestly thought it was just brightly packaged body lotion.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>its also very smooth when putting it on.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell, and the results were quick and noticeable.</li>
            <li>Although, I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the lotion.</li>
            <li>Not that smelly just got out of a tanning bed smell that most give you.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews of many products I decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>The scent is really nice and light and covers that \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li>Even after tanning, the light scent is still really nice.  </li>
            <li>I truly love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn\\&quot;t have a bronzer</li>
            <li>My tanning salon sold this for triple the price, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>One of the better tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li>I have paid more for a product that did not work as well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super thrilled with this lotion, it smelled good, but it didn&#x27;t help me much with gaining any color, and I tan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of all the tropical scents, I prefer a more sophisticated feminine and clean one and this is it.</li>
            <li>I bought a sample of this lotion from my local salon and it smells very good.</li>
            <li>It also came with a free sample of Designer Skin&#x27;s Angel body lotion which is also one of my favorite lotions.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves the skin soft and bronze.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy and satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and it was strong.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for an indoor lotion with a light clean scent and this is it!</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, and has a pleasant scent, but other than that...</li>
            <li>this lotion is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This came in the mail in about two days and smell fantastic.  </li>
            <li>But it pretty much does cancel out that burnt kind of tanning smell afterwards!</li>
            <li>There is no weird tanning or lotion smell after tanning which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>thanks to this lotion I&#x27;m becoming one of them!</li>
            <li>it also does a great job without letting you burn when staying in tanning bed to long.</li>
            <li>After using my bottle of Designer Skin Phoenician (which worked amazingly) I decided that I would try a new lotion, so I ordered Aphrodisiac.</li>
            <li>Loved the seller, I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good</li>
            <li>and they list that as fresh and clean cotton blossom</li>
            <li>therefore it does not even get you any darker than you are now UNLESS you are already super tan.</li>
            <li>The shipping was amazingly fast!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this lotion, its clean and yet sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, especially since it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>This is great if you tan early and plan on going out later because you wont have</li>
            <li>I always envied the girls who have a nice, deep tan, and</li>
            <li>Super amazed at how fast i received my product!</li>
            <li>Although it got delivered very quickly, when I opened the bottle I could already smell that it was old.</li>
            <li>but I expected it to have more bronzers!</li>
            <li>I would definitely order from this seller again :)</li>
            <li>This is the first tanning lotion iv ever used</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but it took using the WHOLE bottle to see a differnce!</li>
            <li>and i came out much darker after one use</li>
            <li>If any of your buyers have been into a Hollister clothing store, the scent really reminds me of that.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t a problem except that I go and exercise after I tan</li>
            <li>and when I sweat it gets really oily and beads up.  </li>
            <li>though not exceedingly fast, which I did not expect anyway.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have much to say about this lotion.</li>
            <li>I am just very dissatisfied with the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been in the beds 5 times, not even for the maximum time limits, and have already gotten fantastic color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>and this is the only lotion that made me more orange and not very dark at all even though it doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion for the scent alone.</li>
            <li>It applies nicely and a little bit goes a long way, so be conservative when first applying so</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t noticed that is has done very well as far as boosting my tan.</li>
            <li>Well, this stuff only made me a bronze, golden color.</li>
            <li>Very crisp and clean... don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else!</li>
            <li>I bought this after thinking maybe I should try something new and that wasn&#x27;t a bronzer.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I got a bit red my first trip to the tanning salon this summer, but I didn&#x27;t peel at all (which has never happened).</li>
            <li>No more orange for me :)  </li>
            <li>and it my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>As far as color goes I think its done its job as a lotion</li>
            <li>Some reviews are saying the scent is \\&quot;boyish\\&quot;; but I completely disagree.</li>
            <li>But I shower directly afterwards</li>
            <li>I think this lotion smells like men&#x27;s cologne - it is definitely not something I would buy a whole bottle of.</li>
            <li>Not sure why so many people claim its a bronzer; it is not labeled as such, even on the Designer Skin website.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to four tanning sessions and am already seeing a true, dark color!</li>
            <li>, I use only the amount I would normally use for body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommened this unless you are already very very dark and are just looking for a mild lotion to keep your color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it a few more tries</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend to friends and will purchase again once my current bottle gets low!  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t seem to get past having a dark orangey kind of tan.  </li>
            <li>But I frequently hear male tanners complain that A)</li>
            <li>I ordered this product a few months back as my first indoor tanning lotion.</li>

            <li> It is a little oily though, not enough to stain your clothes, but enough that you can feel it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great to get a nice even base tan.</li>
            <li> It is a very slick lotion, a little bit goes a long way and it keeps the skin very soft.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months back as my first indoor tanning lotion. Loved the smell, and the results were quick and noticeable. I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Ordered product and thought it would take 5-7 business days to receive...but I received it on my door step in 3 days!!  Thank you..works great and smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> The shipping was amazingly fast!! I ordered it on a Wednesday and I received it by Friday! Super amazed at how fast i received my product! Although, I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the lotion. The lotion didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. After using my bottle of Designer Skin Phoenician (which worked amazingly) I decided that I would try a new lotion, so I ordered Aphrodisiac. I saw amazing reviews about the lotion and decided to give it a try, but it just wasn&#x27;t the lotion for me. It did not make my darker at all, and I use level 3 tanning. Loved the seller, I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested a few tanning lotions but I just ordered this and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t have the bronzers (which is good for my fair skin, I heard they make you look orange). It smells nice, very clean, and was moisturizing to the skin. I got a bit red my first trip to the tanning salon this summer, but I didn&#x27;t peel at all (which has never happened). I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good it also does a great job without letting you burn when staying in tanning bed to long.</li>
            <li> I bought this after thinking maybe I should try something new and that wasn&#x27;t a bronzer.  The lotion smells great!  Not that smelly just got out of a tanning bed smell that most give you.  It applies nicely and a little bit goes a long way, so be conservative when first applying so you don&#x27;t waste.  It also leaves your skin very soft and moisturized.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would use this exclusively.  I&#x27;m going to give it a few more tries but I may go to alternating this with a bronzer now and then to get the coloring I want.  I&#x27;d recommend this product, but I still love my bronzers!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!!! This lotion smell amazing, is a great moisturizer and fab non bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to get a nice even base tan.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this product! I have used it twice..once in the tanning bed for 5 minutes and once for 8 minutes..and I have definite results. The best thing about this product other than the fact that it works great is its smell. Very crisp and clean... don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, especially since it smells so nice. The worst is the stinky sun products and this one is not one. :)</li>
            <li> I liked it at first- nice moisturizer, great light, fruity smell. However i&#x27;m fair skinned and this is the only lotion that made me more orange and not very dark at all even though it doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it. It may work for darker complected people but I hated the way it made me look.</li>
            <li> this lotion is fantastic. it works much better than the real expensive tanning lotions ive tried. IT smells great and i came out much darker after one use and it my skin was so soft. i strongly suggest using this before buying something real expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an indoor lotion with a light clean scent and this is it! It&#x27;s been a few hours since I tanned and when I smell my skin it&#x27;s like I just got out of the shower! I would highly recommend this lotion for the scent alone. I&#x27;m not a fan of all the tropical scents, I prefer a more sophisticated feminine and clean one and this is it. I do like to use bronzers I wish they offered this lotion with them. I used Paint it Black for a while and they list that as fresh and clean cotton blossom but I SMELLED after and it was strong. Aphrodisiac is hardly noticeable (so i can go on my lunch and tan and come back and no one knows) and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to shower as soon as I get home. This is great if you tan early and plan on going out later because you wont have this heavy scent fallow you like with other lotions. As far as color goes I think its done its job as a lotion and I will definitely continue to order this. THE ONLY reason I don&#x27;t give it all 5 stars is because there aren&#x27;t bronzers but I still look dark after one use! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 4 years and I&#x27;ve only ever used cheapy tanning lotion from Wal Mart or Sally&#x27;s. I&#x27;m naturally VERY pale, translucent even. With all the other lotions I would always get an orangey glow and I couldn&#x27;t seem to get past having a dark orangey kind of tan.  It takes me a while to build up my base tan, but with this lotion after only 3 sessions (not even the full time) my skin was already darker! I always envied the girls who have a nice, deep tan, and thanks to this lotion I&#x27;m becoming one of them! No more orange for me :)  The smell is alright..not as wonderful as I would have thought from reading the reviews. But it pretty much does cancel out that burnt kind of tanning smell afterwards!</li>
            <li> I am SUPER pale; tanning for me is nearly impossible. When I did and used other tanning lotions I tended to get the orange \\&quot;oompah loompah\\&quot; look. This lotion is absolutely perfect! I&#x27;ve been to four tanning sessions and am already seeing a true, dark color! Some reviews are saying the scent is \\&quot;boyish\\&quot;; but I completely disagree. If any of your buyers have been into a Hollister clothing store, the scent really reminds me of that. I am looking forward to buying again..this product is well worth your money (even if you&#x27;re extremely light skinned like me!) :D</li>
            <li> Was a great product, smells like a clean shower and goes on very smooth. There is no weird tanning or lotion smell after tanning which is very important to me. It is my second fave one ever!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the sample packets from my salon, because she said they have No bronzers in them. I was tired from using all the other hyped up lotions that were full of bronzers and self tanners. Well, this stuff only made me a bronze, golden color. The oposite of brown. (ie: me laying in the sun with NO lotion for 2 hrs.) Not good. It MUST have some kind of bronzer, or self tanner in it. Thank God I only got the packets.    I should have known..It&#x27;s from Designer Skin...Instant bronze and orange here we goo!</li>
            <li> It smells good and goes on nice but I don&#x27;t see that it helped me tan as dark as another brand I have used. It also doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin quite as well either.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does not have any bronzers in it therefore it does not even get you any darker than you are now UNLESS you are already super tan. I do not recommened this unless you are already very very dark and are just looking for a mild lotion to keep your color.</li>
            <li> I just got back into indoor tanning and I had never used an accelorater before.  After reading reviews of many products I decided on this one.  The scent is really nice and light and covers that \\&quot;tanning bed\\&quot; smell.  Even after tanning, the light scent is still really nice.  I don&#x27;t slather the product on, I use only the amount I would normally use for body lotion.  It is a little oily though, not enough to stain your clothes, but enough that you can feel it on your skin.  This really isn&#x27;t a problem except that I go and exercise after I tan and when I sweat it gets really oily and beads up.  But I shower directly afterwards so I don&#x27;t consider this a problem as it is my choice not to shower between tanning and exercising.  Without the exercise added in, it would not cause a problem for me.  I did search for an item that did not include bronzer as I have had issues in the past with an orange tint from self tanning bronzers.  So I am happy with this product that did not include that.  I feel the product is helping me to tan quicker, though not exceedingly fast, which I did not expect anyway.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know the darkness of the tan it will help in reaching.  Overall, I am happy and satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail in about two days and smell fantastic.  It also came with a free sample of Designer Skin&#x27;s Angel body lotion which is also one of my favorite lotions.  As a person who tans a lot this is now one of my favorite tanning lotions!</li>
            <li> Came in the mail within 2 days. Totally happy w/ the product! I would definitely order from this seller again :)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have much to say about this lotion. It goes on nicely, and has a pleasant scent, but other than that...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone whos looking to enhance their existing tan. It smells great and leaves the skin soft and bronze.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tanning lotion for about 6 months.  I was stupid and purchased from the salon for double the price here.  I have gotten wise (about time).  Anyway, I tried a different lotion and I am not seeing the same results.  Masquerade gives me a beautiful healthy glow, not orange.  It leaves my skin feeling silky and smelling great.  I truly love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion!! Arrived a few days ahead of delivery date.It smells great &amp; it&#x27;s not too heavy or thick. I love that it doesn\\&quot;t have a bronzer so my hands don&#x27;t turn colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion for indoor use, but I found that I like it just as a lotion too.  It has a very subtle apple smell, and leaves my skin feeling super soft.  My tanning salon sold this for triple the price, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Although it got delivered very quickly, when I opened the bottle I could already smell that it was old. It didn&#x27;t smell like anything that I would want to put on my body. I am just very dissatisfied with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the smell of this lotion since so many reviewers raved about it. It&#x27;s not as silky as other ds lotions I have used either.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and it is very smooth and moisturizing.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed that is has done very well as far as boosting my tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice tanner and don&#x27;t like bronzers, because I&#x27;ve had issues with orange-ness and streaks when using other sunless tanners. I&#x27;ve only been in the beds 5 times, not even for the maximum time limits, and have already gotten fantastic color. This lotion feels moisturizing, not greasy, and keeps my skin hydrated for hours after tanning. The smell is very light and fresh, I don&#x27;t notice any difference in odor after getting out of the beds, my husband opened this and honestly thought it was just brightly packaged body lotion. Would absolutely recommend to friends and will purchase again once my current bottle gets low!  **edited to add**  I absolutely recommend this lotion. I have been able to achieve &amp; maintain a perfect tan.  Not sure why so many people claim its a bronzer; it is not labeled as such, even on the Designer Skin website.  I usually look orange with any bronzers (which is why I bought this particular lotion) and my results were tan, not bronze.</li>
            <li> Decided to try out some of Designer Skin&#x27;s tanning lotions, cuz I kept hearing good things about them.   I ordered this and a bottle of the blue Saving Face lotion and I am very happy with both products.  The Aphrodisiac lotion has a very good smell to it, almost like Cool Water cologne.  It is a very slick lotion, a little bit goes a long way and it keeps the skin very soft.  I ordered from Sealed Lotion Products twice now and have been very pleased with their quality and speed of order</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!  This is the first tanning lotion iv ever used and I really like it, I can tell a big difference tanning with it and i get darker than going without lotion.  The tanning shop charged like 65 or 70 bucks and I got this for 24 dollars!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I think this lotion smells like men&#x27;s cologne - it is definitely not something I would buy a whole bottle of. But I frequently hear male tanners complain that A) All tanning lotions smelly girly, and B) They don&#x27;t like to use lotions with self-tanners. Therefore, this would definitely be my #1 lotion recommendation if it were a guy asking.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone. One of the better tanning lotions.  I have paid more for a product that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion, its clean and yet sweet at the same time. Its does an excellent job of moisturizing after tanning.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super thrilled with this lotion, it smelled good, but it didn&#x27;t help me much with gaining any color, and I tan really well so that says a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample of this lotion from my local salon and it smells very good. When your done tanning it doesnt leave you smelling burnt. its also very smooth when putting it on. I like to push my tan to the max and if your looking for the same, this lotion isnt for you either. Good price for the product though. :)</li>
            <li> I liked this lotion but I expected it to have more bronzers! I got tan but it took using the WHOLE bottle to see a differnce!</li>
            <li> Thia lotion is amazing, works great!! The smell is good too!! I have gotten dark while using it too. It has not turned me orange like some of the other posts said it would.</li>
