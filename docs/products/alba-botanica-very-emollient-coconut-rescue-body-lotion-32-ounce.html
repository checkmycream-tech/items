    <ol>
            <li>Best of all it makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li>the best alba flavor.</li>
            <li>It is a great lotion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I read good things about it in a health magazine and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>It will be good in the summer when the heat and humidity are up</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels good and coconut is so good for you.  </li>
            <li>Great I love it</li>
            <li>When i received this package the lotion top had unscrewed and lotion was kind of everywhere, but the lotion is very nice.</li>
            <li>This is my go to lotion the smell is great and not too strong.</li>
            <li>its rich and if you like pina coloda smell great</li>
            <li>It is very emollient and it is very good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Seems like you keep needed to put more on.</li>
            <li>So, if you are interesting in buying because you want the power of Alba with the scent of coconut</li>
            <li>However, because the scent is light and fades fast, this is great if you want a lotion that will not clash with your signature scent.</li>
            <li>Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my body in tandem with real coconut oil right out of the shower for a really great hydrating combo.  </li>
            <li>the smell is lovely like coconuts and super moisterizing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is light</li>
            <li>It was far superior.</li>
            <li>This is a good value, as it has natural ingredients, and a silky smooth feel that hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>It still is the best in my mind, but I was being lazy and found this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand</li>
            <li>I bought the Original</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs in your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>However, it does not moisturize my skin like I need it to right now.</li>
            <li>I have used two other Alba very emollient body lotions and loved them.</li>
            <li>Love the scent is the only positive for me.</li>
            <li>The genuine coconut scent is light and pleasant - definitely not cloyingly sweet or chemically fake.  </li>
            <li>the very emollient lotion will work when it&#x27;s hotter though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using pure coconut oil with vitamin E that I literally whip myself to make a natural lotion for years.</li>
            <li>The scent is a very light coconut, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The scent isnt too strong or overpowering, its pretty thick and has to be thoroughly rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike other coconut products that are sweet scented, this one is not.</li>
            <li>using it, especially in the summer when the pure coconut oil can be too oily for my skin.</li>
            <li>I miss the old formula for dry/irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>but like that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t harm the environment.</li>
            <li>I love Alba products, but this cocoa butter version is so thick it is had to absorb</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s thick, but much more absorb-able.</li>
            <li>This is a very thick lotion--so if you have really dry skin or live in a dry climate, this would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>and my skin gets very oily, but for the cooler months my skin feels tight moments after putting it on.</li>

            <li> I had to rub and rub to get this stuff to soak in and even after about 30 seconds I was left with dried streaks of lotion all over my leg.  Gross.  And to add to the mess it was sticky to the touch after &amp;#34;drying.&amp;#34; And then it started flaking off. This stuff is AWFUL. I miss the old formula for dry/irritated skin.  It was far superior.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and it goes on smooth.  Use a little - it goes a long way.  My skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I love Alba products, but this cocoa butter version is so thick it is had to absorb</li>
            <li> its rich and if you like pina coloda smell great</li>
            <li> When i received this package the lotion top had unscrewed and lotion was kind of everywhere, but the lotion is very nice. The scent isnt too strong or overpowering, its pretty thick and has to be thoroughly rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pure coconut oil with vitamin E that I literally whip myself to make a natural lotion for years. It still is the best in my mind, but I was being lazy and found this stuff. Wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand but like that it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t harm the environment. Best of all it makes my skin feel great! I&#x27;ll definitely&lt;br /&gt;continue using it, especially in the summer when the pure coconut oil can be too oily for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion before when I bought it from a brick n&#x27; mortar store, however, for some reason this bottle I bought off Amazon caused my skin to break out in red rash itchiness!  I don&#x27;t know if it was a product formula change or a bad batch but I will NOT be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Use everyday after shower when wet then dry off.  It is a great lotion.</li>
            <li> Very thick. Ugh. Just like another review.....took forever to absorb.  Love the scent is the only positive for me.</li>
            <li> the best alba flavor. the smell is lovely like coconuts and super moisterizing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other brand of lotion on my body...it&#x27;s a great product. This is a good value, as it has natural ingredients, and a silky smooth feel that hydrates my skin. The genuine coconut scent is light and pleasant - definitely not cloyingly sweet or chemically fake.  I use this on my body in tandem with real coconut oil right out of the shower for a really great hydrating combo.  I also find it&#x27;s less expensive to buy through Amazon, than in the stores (if you can even find it). This one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and definitely softens skin, especially heels and bottoms of toes.</li>
            <li> Takes a little while to set, but it&#x27;s a natural product, so I&#x27;d rather use this than something else.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick lotion--so if you have really dry skin or live in a dry climate, this would be a good choice.  The scent is a very light coconut, not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  My issue is that it takes a little while to soak into my skin.  I bought the Original and it&#x27;s thick, but much more absorb-able. I&#x27;ll use the Coconut Rescue during the winter.</li>
            <li> This is my go to lotion the smell is great and not too strong. It goes on smoothly and absorbs in your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Great I love it and I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Seems like you keep needed to put more on.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good and coconut is so good for you.  I read good things about it in a health magazine and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It comes out like a lotion. but when you rub it on you skin it get very thick and white and it does take a little effort to make that white disappear. I like the sent and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. However, it does not moisturize my skin like I need it to right now. It will be good in the summer when the heat and humidity are up and my skin gets very oily, but for the cooler months my skin feels tight moments after putting it on. For those months, I will use alba After Sun lotion.  I do this the very emollient lotion will work when it&#x27;s hotter though.</li>
            <li> I have used two other Alba very emollient body lotions and loved them. This one is no exception. It is very emollient and it is very good for your skin. Unlike other coconut products that are sweet scented, this one is not. It&#x27;s scent is light and I am given to believe it is product related and not meant to perfume the person using the lotion. So, if you are interesting in buying because you want the power of Alba with the scent of coconut then this is NOT the product for you. However, because the scent is light and fades fast, this is great if you want a lotion that will not clash with your signature scent.</li>
