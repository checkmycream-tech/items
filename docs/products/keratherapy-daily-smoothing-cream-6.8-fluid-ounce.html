            <li> Love love this product. I have thick hair that has gotten curly as I&#x27;ve gotten older. I use to straighten my hair and then it would start to frizz and curl as soon as I went outside. I live in GA so we have lots of humidity. But now that I use this product my hair will stay straight till I was it! I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find this product sooner. A little goes a long way. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Cream goes well with Keratin treated hair.... works well and smooths hair.  My hairdresser uses it for her Keratin treated customers.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Great for use on hair just before blow drying. Reduces frizz and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  I have long hair with curls that this has helped with the &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34;!!!!  I will order more before I run out.</li>
            <li> Very good very smoothing hair.  My hair dresser told me about this product and it really works.  Will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! And it smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product ! I have Natural hair and this makes it easy to blow dry and flat iron without causing damage .</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample in my Ipsy glam bag and it worked wonders so i ordered the larger size from Amazon. It made my hair so soft and i could really tell a difference in my split ends almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I call this miracle  cream!!!  I have frizzy, course hair and this product has been a life-saver!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after receiving a travel size in my ipsy subscription bag. It has changed how easy it is to dry my hair. My hair is short but it gets sometimes frizzy from highlighting and humidity... not anymore. A little bit goes a long way. I am going to get the same brand shampoo/conditioner. Love it!</li>
            <li> Better then many smoothing creams.. Light weight, good smell, ships fast!ðŸ’†</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and smooth. Only use a very small amount though. It can leave an oily appearance if too much is used.</li>
            <li> This is the best smoothing cream out there for my type hair.  I use it after shampooing with the Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner and I get lots of compliments on just how healthy my hair is.  Recommend this especially for us gals with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on my hair.  I loved how it looked. I purchased it from them, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s a life saver. I&#x27;ve used many products out there, and nothing can compare to this product. Now I can wash my hair and let it air dry and no frizzy hair. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different smoothing products for years and this one was very disappointing. It seemed to just disappear throughout the day leaving my hair frizzy. It had a strong sweet smell that I also didn&#x27;t care for. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have kinda long, thick, wavy hair.  I put a nickel sized amount in my hair after towel drying.  Makes my hair so much easier to dry,straighten and manage.  It also softens my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and I am used to straightening it.  However I had seen many tutorials and blogs saying they used this product and it changed their hair for the better so I thought I better investigate this. I&#x27;m not sure if I am using too much product or not enough but I really don&#x27;t think that this product is worth it.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of items from the drugstore that seem to work MUCH better than this so I honestly do not believe it is worth the cost.</li>
