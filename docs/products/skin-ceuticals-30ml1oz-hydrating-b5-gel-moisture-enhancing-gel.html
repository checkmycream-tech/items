            <li>/&gt;Nothing works as well as this for soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it</li>
            <li>Really makes a big difference and makes my skin so much better.</li>

            <li> Expensive but totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> I recently hiked for two weeks above 11,000 feet in extremely dry conditions.</li>

            <li> Used on face and appears to work and no toxic ingredients.  Use only a drop at a time</li>

            <li> This is a must have for a dry skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product as described. Good moisturizer under makeup.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Good product.</li>
            <li> this is a great product to add some extra moisture to your skin!  If you get dry as the day goes on just add this when you moisturize and it will keep you looking great all day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and it won&#x27;t block the pore. I use it every day and night. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Does not seem to moisturize - may even further dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Needs detailed instructions. Totally ineffective and very expensive</li>
            <li> Love Skin Ceutical brand, recommended by my dermatologist/surgeon.  Hydrates beautifully and I also use it after first applying CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li> very good product, improved my skin</li>
            <li> have been using for years, but  paying higher prices for both items.  thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years.  Using a couple drops each day before adding my moisturizer.  I have very dry skin and don&#x27;t want to do a day without it.</li>
            <li> Love this product - leaves my face really soft.  Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks. Skin looks really soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sunburn too!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that this stuff did anything for my skin except hydrate it a bit.  I did see a major difference in my skin when I used Skincueticals C &amp; E Ferulic though.  I would highly recommend that product for smoother, glowing, zit-free skin.  My skin looks so much better when I use that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the review I published for Skincueticals C &amp; E Ferulic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works as well as this for soft, smooth skin. A friend of mine who is an esthetician gave me a facial and told me this was the best to keep your skin looking really good. She was right.  Even getting regular photofacials does not compare to what this product does. I noticed after a week of using it that my skin was much like it was when I was a kid. It just had a different feel to it. It was so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I stopped using it and my skin starting looking pretty bad.  It started to get really dry and zits started popping up and the lines were becoming more obvious. I decided to start using it again and just within a few days, it looks so different. Zits gone, face is very smooth, cheeks are rosy and glowing even. I think it is good to use it a for few months and then give your skin a break from it for a month or so then go back to it so you skin doesn&#x27;t get too used to it.  This is how I use it. It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but totally worth it. It lasts forever. I have had this one bottle for over a year now. You don&#x27;t have to use it everyday either. Every couple of days is fine to keep your skin glowing. Using it everyday is just a waste of the product in my opinion.  You could even space it out every 3 days or so and if you have an event coming up where you want your face to look really good, use it 3 days in a row before the event.  It works wonders.</li>
            <li> Love this product... use on top of skinceuticals C E with ferulic during the day. At night, use it on top of retin a.</li>
            <li> Love this also ..it is a little sticky but feels very good in dry weather and climates ...I am happy I found it</li>
            <li> love this product.  Really makes a big difference and makes my skin so much better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it</li>
            <li> I have been using this B5 Gel for quite some time and would not be without it in my daily skin routine.  It glides on easily and gives my skin the extra moisture needed with older skin.  A few drops goes a long way.  My skin feels so much smoother after using this product and I think it helps keep my foundation from seeping into the fine lines.</li>
            <li> The Skin Ceuticals Hydrating is very good product. This product let my skin  hydrated without let oily. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The magic bullet in my skin regimine.  Best product to give moisture under my moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> A subtle protection for skin moisture. I recently hiked for two weeks above 11,000 feet in extremely dry conditions. The B 5 did a remarkable job protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I love it. I Haven&#x27;t found another product that hydrates my skin the way this product does. I do use it in conjunction with Skin Ceutical C E Furelic but this product performs very well on it&#x27;s own. It is a little pricey, but just a few drops go a long way. A 30ml bottle can last 3 months. It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I put it on after I take a shower and it makes my skin feel so hydrated and revitalized. Without the greasy feeling of moisturizing lotion. Expensive but totally worth it!!</li>
