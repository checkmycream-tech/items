    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>While this might be not sufficient for heavier oilier skin, it was perfect for mine.</li>
            <li>The very best way to crush shine during the day.</li>
            <li>these blotting papers are the best ones i have tried, and are a great pice.</li>
            <li>price is good</li>
            <li>Paper is never as good as a blotting film.</li>
            <li>Good for makeup finishing.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time, good packaging, etc.  </li>
            <li>and I was hoping that this product was as good as the Mandom, but it wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>I love how there are 200 sheets in each, which makes this a great buy.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my mom because she wanted some blotting paper, and she is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>It is nice having this control oil papers, but i dont like that it takes off all the makeup along with ur oil.</li>
            <li>It is amazing :)</li>
            <li>The packaging is gorgeous, and that is what originally attracted me to these papers, however, it is a tad bit flimsy.</li>
            <li>beautiful packaging - large sheets which (for me) are more absorbent than others I have used - would buy these again</li>
            <li>There are many so one can share</li>
            <li>Mostly ones sold at Sephora or departmet stores.  </li>
            <li>And, mostly, soaks-up all the oil &amp; persperation on my face leaving a hint of matte powder, but just a touch.  </li>
            <li>I had better luck with the blotting sheets I picked up at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>GRIP!)&lt;br /&gt;-Cheaper and more quantity per $1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just ordered more.</li>
            <li>This one is only as good as paper towels whereas Mandom Gatby was as good as washing your skin with soap and water.</li>
            <li>so-so,even feels like a cheap industrial paper,but most of all it&lt;br /&gt;-DOESN&#x27;T ABSORB OIL at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sheets did not do a good job of absorbing oil.</li>
            <li>Delivery is quick, product very nice and price reasonable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-convinient and easy to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;normally one sheet of clean&amp;clear paper is fine for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap, so</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin prone to redness.</li>
            <li>Worth the price for TWO HUNDRED sheets!</li>
            <li>order was filled quickly and correctly.</li>
            <li>The pack is quite big, which is good, because, for me, I have to use about 3-4 to get the absorbtion I want.</li>
            <li>These sheets do absorb oil, do not remove make-up, and the packaging is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Overall, given the low cost of these papers, I feel they are a very good value.</li>
            <li>However, the best paper type of blotter I&#x27;ve tried so far is Boscia&#x27;s Green Tea Blotting Linens.</li>
            <li>I did not have to wait for ages while the oil is absorbed like with the thicker plastic ones.</li>
            <li>Elegant, attractive format for a secret beauty tool that goes with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell as the oil absorbed is not visible on these, unless you hold it up to the light.  </li>
            <li>Larger format sheets than other brands make them more effective and still very compact and effective.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really liked about it is the large size of the paper.</li>
            <li>The packaging is attractive, although rather flimsy for something that is being pulled out and pushed back into one&#x27;s purse a couple of times each day for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Beautiful design on the outside looks frankly more classy in a briefcase or evening bag than the Noxzemas and other drug-store brands.</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>I took a chance with this brand, and it actually turned out better that the others.  </li>
            <li>The case looks pretty</li>
            <li>But after reading all positive reviews here,I have decided to give a chance to this brand because of the price and quantity.</li>
            <li>this product just isn&#x27;t very good, sorry.</li>
            <li>A little more pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>my only complaint is that they tear easily when you are removing them after pressing them to your skin, but other than that they are perfect for keeping in your locker at school or in your pusre on the go!</li>
            <li>Got very</li>
            <li>I bought these for my teenaged daughter who has very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Cheap feeling,the texture is that of a paper toilet seat cover.</li>
            <li>I used to buy her a name-brand product at store that cost much more and the individual sheets were smaller.</li>
            <li>I do feel the price is too high, hence 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>You need 2 of these [larger] sheets to accomplish what one sheet of the clean n clear.</li>
            <li>seems like a good deal but its really not lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 25% less effective, so it takes me 4 sheets, but since you get 200 of them, it&#x27;ll last.  </li>
            <li>Still, I appreciate the fact that the sellers showed the packaging very clearly on the product page so this was no surprise.</li>
            <li>My skin is only mildly oily and only in the t-zone.</li>
            <li>It was the clear winner when I compared it to Palladio &amp; some from Salley&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so you use less sheets to clean your face.</li>
            <li>I like that they are made of natural hemp fibers.</li>
            <li>On the downside, they don&#x27;t absorb as much oil as the blue sheets.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend these oil blotting papers.</li>
            <li>That being said, I do like that these papers are made of natural hemp and are of a larger size.</li>
            <li>and i really have to press down.</li>
            <li>For those with very oily skin who need a little extra in terms of oil absorption and like the benefit of the oil-absorbing powder, these papers may not be enough.</li>

            <li> These papers are very thin and do not have any rice powder added. For those with very oily skin who need a little extra in terms of oil absorption and like the benefit of the oil-absorbing powder, these papers may not be enough. That being said, I do like that these papers are made of natural hemp and are of a larger size. My skin is only mildly oily and only in the t-zone. Even so, I tend to need two sheets at a time. The packaging is attractive, although rather flimsy for something that is being pulled out and pushed back into one&#x27;s purse a couple of times each day for several weeks. I expect the package to be rather worn-looking long before I have finished using all the papers. Still, I appreciate the fact that the sellers showed the packaging very clearly on the product page so this was no surprise. Overall, given the low cost of these papers, I feel they are a very good value.</li>
            <li> I really like these! There are many so one can share and I am always asked were I got these.</li>
            <li> These are very thin sheets of rice paper which soak up very fast. While this might be not sufficient for heavier oilier skin, it was perfect for mine. I did not have to wait for ages while the oil is absorbed like with the thicker plastic ones. Less contact, less irritation. Good for sensitive skin prone to redness.</li>
            <li> I was blowing through packages of name brand, then store brand blotting sheets at the rate of a package a week.  It takes me about 3 sheets of name/store brand sheets to freshen up.  This package has lasted me over a month.  It&#x27;s about 25% less effective, so it takes me 4 sheets, but since you get 200 of them, it&#x27;ll last.  I definitely intend to purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of bloting paper over the years.  Mostly ones sold at Sephora or departmet stores.  I took a chance with this brand, and it actually turned out better that the others.  Keeps my make-up in place (I don&#x27;t wear a ton, though). And, mostly, soaks-up all the oil &amp; persperation on my face leaving a hint of matte powder, but just a touch.  The pack is quite big, which is good, because, for me, I have to use about 3-4 to get the absorbtion I want.</li>
            <li> The very best way to crush shine during the day. They don&#x27;t remove makeup, but make your face matte in a couple seconds. I carry them in my purse at all times. And there are 200 of the things, so the packet lasts forever! I wouldn&#x27;t be caught without them!!!</li>
            <li> It looks just the same as the picture, and the papers inside are just normal ordinary oil absorbing papers, just like what I expected.</li>
            <li> price is good but i&#x27;d rather buy clean&amp;clear blotting paper bc when I use this one I need to use 3-4 sheets then I feel satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;normally one sheet of clean&amp;clear paper is fine for me.</li>
            <li> I have used a different brand for my combination skin.But after reading all positive reviews here,I have decided to give a chance to this brand because of the price and quantity.But...\\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;-the order was filled quickly and correctly.Got very fast!Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;-the paper is portable&lt;br /&gt;-nice format and size&lt;br /&gt;-convinient and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;have a smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;-paper is so-so,even feels like a cheap industrial paper,but most of all it&lt;br /&gt;-DOESN&#x27;T ABSORB OIL at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again and will go back to an another branb.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teenaged daughter who has very oily skin. I used to buy her a name-brand product at store that cost much more and the individual sheets were smaller.</li>
            <li> This lasts forever!!! I am still using it today and it has been over 6 months. It is amazing :)</li>
            <li> This blotting paper is just like any other blotting paper. Paper is never as good as a blotting film. I also didn&#x27;t like the flimsy container. It&#x27;s not even a paper box. The only thing I really liked about it is the large size of the paper. However, the best paper type of blotter I&#x27;ve tried so far is Boscia&#x27;s Green Tea Blotting Linens. A little more pricey, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Sheets did not do a good job of absorbing oil. I had better luck with the blotting sheets I picked up at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Good for makeup finishing.  Arrived on time, good packaging, etc.  will buy again if I ever get thru all of these!!</li>
            <li> i bought this product because my makeup has a tendency to make my skin look shiny and oily. these blotting papers are the best ones i have tried, and are a great pice. my only complaint is that they tear easily when you are removing them after pressing them to your skin, but other than that they are perfect for keeping in your locker at school or in your pusre on the go!</li>
            <li> It is nice having this control oil papers, but i dont like that it takes off all the makeup along with ur oil.</li>
            <li> The title says it.  These things absorb less oil per square inch than the brand names, BUT they still get four stars for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Being Natural&lt;br /&gt;-Larger in size (EASIER TO HOLD/GRIP!)&lt;br /&gt;-Cheaper and more quantity per $1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also double as rolling papers...for dEm GrEenZ BaBy YEAAH!</li>
            <li> beautiful packaging - large sheets which (for me) are more absorbent than others I have used - would buy these again</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say, these sheets are twice the size of the average oil blotting papers. I like that they are made of natural hemp fibers. They soak up oil like the typical papers; I find they do no better or no poorer. I love how there are 200 sheets in each, which makes this a great buy. The packaging is gorgeous, and that is what originally attracted me to these papers, however, it is a tad bit flimsy. Overall, I would highly recommend these oil blotting papers.</li>
            <li> Elegant, attractive format for a secret beauty tool that goes with me everywhere. Larger format sheets than other brands make them more effective and still very compact and effective. Beautiful design on the outside looks frankly more classy in a briefcase or evening bag than the Noxzemas and other drug-store brands. All sustainable materials too!</li>
            <li> This is must-have for controlling the shine on my nose. It was the clear winner when I compared it to Palladio &amp; some from Salley&#x27;s. I do feel the price is too high, hence 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is quality and quantity! These are like double the size of the smaller portable ones. The plus is it&#x27;s bigger so you use less sheets to clean your face. The smaller ones I counted that I used 10-12 minimum. These cover a lot of space so maybe about 6-7 is only needed. That&#x27;s just me and I&#x27;m oozing oil on my face every 2-3 hours! Just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of blotting papers for a few years now. Usually I use the Clean n Clear, but these were less expensive. you get what you pay for. You need 2 of these [larger] sheets to accomplish what one sheet of the clean n clear. Cheap feeling,the texture is that of a paper toilet seat cover. this product just isn&#x27;t very good, sorry. I usually cut the sheet into 2 pieces to make them last longer, I wish I had examined these carefully before cutting, or I would return them.My bad.</li>
            <li> These papers are very rough and dont soak any oil off of your face. I will not be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> Delivery is quick, product very nice and price reasonable.  Have ordered several times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> These sheets do absorb oil, do not remove make-up, and the packaging is very pretty.  They are about twice the size of the other blue sheets.  They also leave behind no powder residue.  On the downside, they don&#x27;t absorb as much oil as the blue sheets.  I can&#x27;t really tell as the oil absorbed is not visible on these, unless you hold it up to the light.  I will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> I used Mandom Gatsby before and I was hoping that this product was as good as the Mandom, but it wasn&#x27;t the case. This one is only as good as paper towels whereas Mandom Gatby was as good as washing your skin with soap and water. The case looks pretty and it&#x27;s cheap, so I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one star.</li>
            <li> these kinda suck, i have to use a milliom just to get my face less oily. and i really have to press down. seems like a good deal but its really not lol.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom because she wanted some blotting paper, and she is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Got this for my aunt who has oily skin. Tried it on my face and it worked on mine ( I have combination skin). Worth the price for TWO HUNDRED sheets!</li>
