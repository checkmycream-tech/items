            <li>My skin looks great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great.</li>
            <li>was great.  </li>
            <li>This was great for the put-it-on then get-it-off application.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is some very nice TCA, I&#x27;ve purchased 35% TCA before from Ebay</li>
            <li>, this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>As I said, it is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I looked at many brands and formulations, and decided this one sounded like it was the best of my options.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A good vitamin supplement with A,C, and Zinc promotes healing.</li>
            <li>absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT WAS MY OWN FAULT</li>
            <li>If you purchase TCA do your research include burn/wound care for good advice, TCA creates a chemical burn to remove top layers of skin.</li>
            <li>Glycolic and Salicylic acids weren&#x27;t effective anymore, and since the treatments are geared for damage removal/reduction, I decided to bump it up to TCA.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a good product with decent to good results, but this acid exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t feel like spending more I decided to try an at home peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was confident in applying it myself as I had paid close attention to how the peel was put on my face before at the dermatologists office.</li>
            <li>Make sure the cotton ball is not dripping peel liquid.</li>
            <li>I made sure to pay close attention to the time...decided to go over the problem areas with 4 layers.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s much more healthier looking, glowing</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I think with 1-2 more applications my skin will look perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you know what you&#x27;re doing then you will come out with better skin.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to do a skin test and please follow instructions.ls.</li>

            <li>Just make sure to do a skin test and please follow instructions.</li>
            <li>Alcohols are in many skin products and drying to skin, these products will also burn when applied to treated skin surface, avoid alcohol.</li>
            <li>what you are doing do not put to many layer started out</li>
            <li>Best to do it regularly if you have scarring.  </li>
            <li>am not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>Best money we ever spent.</li>
            <li>It is a very effective product, and I recommend it for intermediate to professional users.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>If you have never used TCA be sure to start out with a lower concentration to become familiar with how your skin will react.</li>
            <li>Once frosting washing with baking soda won&#x27;t stop the process easily.  </li>
            <li>but like I said its really strong and the peeling happened within 1-2weeks for me</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I went with 35%, absolutely no regrets.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I went with 35%, absolutely no regrets.</li>
            <li>I am also happy to know proper after care.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products work great to restore healthy skin if used carefully.</li>
            <li>this stuff is much better and much higher quality.</li>
            <li>and the results were nothing special.</li>
            <li>0ne or two good enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really strong and did exactly what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>washed my face with Cetaphil mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>WOW is this one strong!  </li>
            <li>First let me say that this stuff works!</li>
            <li>It looks funy but is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The price was right too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>evidence of the effectiveness of the acid peel was visible right away.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the fine lines after all was said and done.  </li>
            <li>bought a 24% TCA peel off of MUAC&#x27;s website first.</li>
            <li>Then I put the peel on a cotton ball and applied it to my face; first on my forehead, side of my cheeks, my nose, then my chin.</li>
            <li>These product took them off the first time.</li>
            <li>I was only able to leave that first swipe on for the length of time it took to finish my face.</li>
            <li>It was time to move someone up to a higher level of peel.</li>
            <li>One important note to anyone trying this for the first time on NON african american skin, Don&#x27;t put more then</li>
            <li>acid is not for first timers, or for people who have no proper knowledge of the application and neutralization of strong cosmetic acids.</li>
            <li>Be gentle with treated skin, when bathing avoid directly showering treated skin, use cool dampened gauze for a soothing effect.</li>
            <li>My goal was basically to get my skin to frost on certain parts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who likes results as quick as possible, but if you have a little more patience than me then using lower percent peels are fine.</li>
            <li>my dermatologist said that if I wanted a stronger peel that I would have to pay a whole lot of $$$.</li>
            <li>and I REALLY needed to help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Dermalure!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this product really helped in eliminating my discoloration.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dermalure!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>be careful and make sure</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would do that fast, it was my mistake.  </li>
            <li>The skin healed really well, and quickly as a result of proper, gentle aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I noticed a burn feeling like 15 seconds into applying it and the burn was like a 4 (for me) on a scale of 1-10, not bad, very tolerable actually.  </li>
            <li>But my entire face frosted bright white INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li>:) If you have dark skin do not be swayed by people saying you CAN&#x27;T try it.</li>
            <li>:) If you have dark skin do not be swayed by people saying you CAN&#x27;T try it.</li>
            <li>Be careful, it is strong even if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend having one done by a dr before doing yourself</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend leaving this one to the professionals.</li>
            <li>The treated skin peeled off uniformly, painlessly, and left behind that perfect, pink fresh skin that medium peels are supposed to uncover.</li>
            <li>but I will wait until around the middle/end of december cause I still have a little more to do.</li>

            <li>My skin isNOT sensitive to this percentage and this product really helped in eliminating my discoloration.</li>
            <li>My advice would be to not worry about if frosting is normal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal skin tone</li>
            <li>Its completely gone, it looks fresh &amp; I feel like I can go out bare faced without makeup.</li>
            <li>I have no burns, hypopigmentation, no scarring, no negative reactions.</li>

            <li>I have no burns, hypopigmentation, no scarring, no negative reactions.</li>
            <li>To be honest: I didn&#x27;t have a specific time limit for when I would rinse the peel off, but knew I would rinse it off at 3 minutes or less.</li>
            <li>Also I noticed that I was finally frosting for the first time after applying the 4 layers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different acids over the years, ranging from the very weak to the fairly strong.</li>
            <li>I Have some chicken skin that greatly improved in tone and texture after three 5minute sessions.</li>
            <li>I applied alcohol on a cotton ball and rubbed it on my face til it was clear of oil and</li>
            <li>wow it  take them away</li>
            <li>It smoothes acne scars while making skin soft and supple (after it peels off).</li>
            <li>* that other people do the same instead of just jumping up this high too quickly.</li>
            <li>So the area will turn white first, like a frost bite, then really red, and then peel off.</li>
            <li>This is a strong product, just like the other reviewers said, so be careful.  </li>
            <li>As the results turned out my skin was tough as hell because I wasn&#x27;t seeing a noticeable difference, very light flakes falling off</li>
            <li>It took 4 layers, each sitting for 3 minutes of my previous peel to get a light frosting in my most troubled areas.</li>
            <li>Acids are inherently uncomfortable, therefore I strive to find one that works really well, very quickly, so the discomfort can be minimized.</li>
            <li>It got to work right away, and I got the proper level of action within a short few minutes.</li>

            <li> 1coat the first time, you can give yourself a very serious burn!</li>
            <li> it does take some of my dark spots off</li>
            <li> Skin being peeled is little thicker than TCA 12% of other brand, and it takes longer to peel.  </li>
            <li> It looks less visible.</li>
            <li> I was freaking out a little thinking what if I just effed up my skin because the areas where it frosted turned a brownish/purpleish color before turning into a dark crusty brown which lasted for 3 days before it started peeling off.</li>

            <li> And I will say that my tattoo is lighter in color and a little &amp;#34;foggy.&amp;#34; My husband made me promise never to do this again.</li>

            <li> The stinging wasn&#x27;t too bad; quite tolerable and it frosted within a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days the skin started browning and crinkling and fully peeled within 6 days.  </li>
            <li> It has been extremely painful (and because of the placement on my ankle it was painful to walk or stand)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was great! It&#x27;s really strong and did exactly what I bought it for. I wanted to peel some parts of my skin and it worked wonders but like I said its really strong and the peeling happened within 1-2weeks for me but I have really tough skin. I would definitely recommend this product. Read the instructions and stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li> i like this product  But never did receive my instructions for my skin machine that I put the order in at the same time</li>
            <li> This is a strong product, just like the other reviewers said, so be careful.  I have used it once and you really have to be mindful of keeping the product on the trouble spot.  I was a bit careless and I burned myself a bit.  It wasn&#x27;t too bad and I did see improvement in a raised scar after using this.</li>
            <li> This comes with directions so you won&#x27;t be left in the dark.  I&#x27;m not saying to follow what I do, I&#x27;m just telling you my experiences and common sense/advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m around Chanel Iman&#x27;s skin tone and decided to buy this peel for hyper-pigmentation. I&#x27;ve only previously tried 2 peels in my life before this. Again DON&#x27;T do what I do unless your skin is tough like a crocodile lol. I had a Vitalize peel done in a dermatologist&#x27;s office back in July which I didn&#x27;t feel any burn AT ALL (0 pain on a scale of 1-10) and the results were nothing special. Lasted like a week. I paid $120 and my dermatologist said that if I wanted a stronger peel that I would have to pay a whole lot of $$$. Because I didn&#x27;t feel like spending more I decided to try an at home peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 24% TCA peel off of MUAC&#x27;s website first. I was confident in applying it myself as I had paid close attention to how the peel was put on my face before at the dermatologists office. I did this in the beginning of September. As the results turned out my skin was tough as hell because I wasn&#x27;t seeing a noticeable difference, very light flakes falling off and I never got frosting after applying four layers - the burning sensation on a scale of 1-10 was a 2. It was extremely superficial in my case. I kinda figured out I needed a medium strength peel. I&#x27;m the type of person who likes results as quick as possible, but if you have a little more patience than me then using lower percent peels are fine. I just did not feel like waiting forever especially since this is a time consuming process and I REALLY needed to help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went online and read everyone&#x27;s review before buying this. The price was right too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read online about people saying African Americans should not use a peel this high of a percentage because it can cause hypo-pigmentation, burns, &amp; basically screw up your skin much worse than it was pre peel.. However, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, has different toughness levels and issues. What I did was test out a lower percentage **BEFORE** trying this, and, I **RECOMMEND** that other people do the same instead of just jumping up this high too quickly. Be safe instead of sorry, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE PREP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use Retin A. Since I have hyper-pigmentation on my cheeks and both sides of the chin I had been using hydroquinone for months...as part of a fade cream.  I also didn&#x27;t shave or use any scrubs on my face about 7 days prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PEEL PROCEDURE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I did was follow the directions. I had all of this on hand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- gloves&lt;br /&gt;- aquaphor&lt;br /&gt;- cotton balls&lt;br /&gt;- alcohol&lt;br /&gt;- cetaphil cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with Cetaphil mild cleanser. Used a towel to pat my face dry. I applied alcohol on a cotton ball and rubbed it on my face til it was clear of oil and any extra dirt the cleanser may have missed.  I put the gloves on. Then I put the peel on a cotton ball and applied it to my face; first on my forehead, side of my cheeks, my nose, then my chin. Make sure the cotton ball is not dripping peel liquid. I made sure to pay close attention to the time...decided to go over the problem areas with 4 layers. I noticed a burn feeling like 15 seconds into applying it and the burn was like a 4 (for me) on a scale of 1-10, not bad, very tolerable actually.  I never needed a fan or neutralizer. Also I noticed that I was finally frosting for the first time after applying the 4 layers. The non problem areas were only swiped with 2 layers, they did not frost. To be honest: I didn&#x27;t have a specific time limit for when I would rinse the peel off, but knew I would rinse it off at 3 minutes or less. My goal was basically to get my skin to frost on certain parts and if it did I would rinse off immediately with cold water, which is what happened and what I did. I did not feel immediate tightness but my skin was slightly red, something that didn&#x27;t happen with my previous peels. I put aquaphor on and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the peel on a monday night and started to peel from my chin on a wednesday night. As the days went on my face got tighter and tighter til it peeled. Overall the process lasted me about 9-10 days. When all was said and done my hyper-pigmentation was reduced drastically. Like I&#x27;ll say 80%. I will admit on day 2 I was freaking out a little thinking what if I just effed up my skin because the areas where it frosted turned a brownish/purpleish color before turning into a dark crusty brown which lasted for 3 days before it started peeling off. I was scared because I thought maybe I burned my skin but I didn&#x27;t. My advice would be to not worry about if frosting is normal. It IS normal, just be careful not to let your skin frost for too long. As soon as you see your skin turn white, rinse it with water. Also, always do a patch test before applying. That&#x27;s what I did under my chin first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the brown skin peeled off my skin wasn&#x27;t pink, but it was just way lighter in color. It turned my skin back almost to it&#x27;s normal skin tone (soooooo happy!!!). Now it&#x27;s much more healthier looking, glowing and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results. I will be doing this peel again but I will wait until around the middle/end of december cause I still have a little more to do. I think with 1-2 more applications my skin will look perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this only if you know your skin is tough and if you have tried other lower percentage peels before moving up to this. EVEN THEN~ PLEASE FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO A T. If you know what you&#x27;re doing then you will come out with better skin. African Americans use with caution~ this peel does lighten your skin. Thanks Dermalure!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 1/23/14 -- So I did my second chemical peel in December, and I&#x27;m now just finishing up on my third chemical peel. My skin just completed another 9 day process. I am so happy that I went with 35%, absolutely no regrets. My skin is NOT sensitive to this percentage and this product really helped in eliminating my discoloration. Its completely gone, it looks fresh &amp; I feel like I can go out bare faced without makeup. :) If you have dark skin do not be swayed by people saying you CAN&#x27;T try it. I have no burns, hypopigmentation, no scarring, no negative reactions. My skin looks great. Just make sure to do a skin test and please follow instructions.ls.

            <li> was great.  be careful and make sure you know what youre doing.  I highly recommend having one done by a dr before doing yourself so you know what to expect</li>
            <li> This is some very nice TCA, I&#x27;ve purchased 35% TCA before from Ebay and It was alright but not amazing... this stuff is much better and much higher quality.</li>
            <li> This is not for beginners. One important note to anyone trying this for the first time on NON african american skin, Don&#x27;t put more then 1coat the first time, you can give yourself a very serious burn! I Have some chicken skin that greatly improved in tone and texture after three 5minute sessions. I have pretty tough african american skin.</li>
            <li> it does take some of my dark spots off but It just wasn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m not saying its bad but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> i bought this to fade a tattoo but now i have an endless wound/scar.am still in pain because of this acetic acid don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> My wife has had some spots on her face that we have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get rid of them. everything from laser to peels, you name it. These product took them off the first time. absolutely amazing. Best money we ever spent. Anybody reading this you know how woman are about their looks. Take my word you cannot go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> First let me say that this stuff works! I bought it to help me fade a tattoo I have on my ankle. I read the instructions about put one layer, wait for it to do the peeling thing, etc... I thought if one layer would work, then I should do it several times over. I received this two days after I ordered it on a Friday night. I did it Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday night, and again on Sunday morning. It hurt SO BAD after Sunday I knew I had screwed up royally. By Tuesday the skin started coming off terrible. Think of an open wound where all of your underskin is exposed. I was living off of 800mg of Motrin (IB), invested in some NON-STICK wound coverage, some tape to keep it all in place, some aloe, A&amp;D Ointment, and finally Neosporine. It has been extremely painful (and because of the placement on my ankle it was painful to walk or stand) I just cried and cried it hurt so bad.&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS MY OWN FAULT THOUGH! I read the instructions and decided to ignore them. It is in the final stage of healing now, still painful but nothing like it was. And I will say that my tattoo is lighter in color and a little &amp;#34;foggy.&amp;#34; My husband made me promise never to do this again. I will do it again though because I want the tattoo gone. But I will do it in single layers as the instructions say after I am completely healed and pain-free from this stupid mistake. I will probably have some scarring from this. Be careful, it is strong even if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use under my eyes only.  The stinging wasn&#x27;t too bad; quite tolerable and it frosted within a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days the skin started browning and crinkling and fully peeled within 6 days.  I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the fine lines after all was said and done.  I might try it again in a month or two to see if an additional application will be of any benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I have now done a second application, it has peeled and I can see a definite improvement in the undereye area.  I would now change my rating to a 4 or 5 star.</li>
            <li> If you purchase TCA do your research include burn/wound care for good advice, TCA creates a chemical burn to remove top layers of skin. If you have never used TCA be sure to start out with a lower concentration to become familiar with how your skin will react. Use pain medication prior to peel and then after as needed. Be gentle with treated skin, when bathing avoid directly showering treated skin, use cool dampened gauze for a soothing effect. Routinely apply a triple antibiotic ointment, skin serum, aloe, moisturizer, to skin to prevent dryness. Alcohols are in many skin products and drying to skin, these products will also burn when applied to treated skin surface, avoid alcohol. A good vitamin supplement with A,C, and Zinc promotes healing. These products work great to restore healthy skin if used carefully.</li>
            <li> very good product, meets expectations. Also EXCELLENT customer service by Dermalure</li>
            <li> I see a big difference in my skin I will buy again this help the marks on my skin wow it  take them away just know  what you are doing do not put to many layer started out 0ne or two good enough</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am a licensed esthetician who has been trained and certified specifically in TCA peels and have received them myself.  WOW is this one strong!  I received a 35% peel a few months ago and it felt nothing like this.  It took 4 layers, each sitting for 3 minutes of my previous peel to get a light frosting in my most troubled areas. It&#x27;s possible that the previous solution used on me was slightly neutralized from being opened before it was used on me.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this is an amazing product! But my entire face frosted bright white INSTANTLY! I was only able to leave that first swipe on for the length of time it took to finish my face. .20 seconds maybe!  I am extremely grateful that I not only knew to be thoroughly prepared to neutralize this before applying it but also, that I tried it on myself before using it on a client.  I am also happy to know proper after care.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really not trying to discourage anyone from trying this. . As I said, it is amazing!  But please, be prepared and take care of your skin during the healing process if you&#x27;re considering doing this yourself.  I would highly recommend leaving this one to the professionals.</li>
            <li> this was not a TCA type of peel and I put five layers on. it&#x27;s just a regular peel the appeal the surface layers. Thus I don&#x27;t feel this was labeled correctly.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It smoothes acne scars while making skin soft and supple (after it peels off). Dont be afraid of the peeling layers - it&#x27;s the way it is supposed to work. And also never try to take them off yourself. It looks funy but is well worth it. So the area will turn white first, like a frost bite, then really red, and then peel off. Best to do it regularly if you have scarring.  I neutralize this peel just with plain water with baking soda (cup of water  - tea spoon of baking soda). And follow by Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different acids over the years, ranging from the very weak to the fairly strong. It was time to move someone up to a higher level of peel. Glycolic and Salicylic acids weren&#x27;t effective anymore, and since the treatments are geared for damage removal/reduction, I decided to bump it up to TCA. I looked at many brands and formulations, and decided this one sounded like it was the best of my options.&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed at all! I was expecting a good product with decent to good results, but this acid exceeded my expectations. It got to work right away, and I got the proper level of action within a short few minutes. Acids are inherently uncomfortable, therefore I strive to find one that works really well, very quickly, so the discomfort can be minimized. This was great for the put-it-on then get-it-off application.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product is strong and thin, so it took a VERY small amount for one application. When you&#x27;re looking to maximize your value, this one is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;The evidence of the effectiveness of the acid peel was visible right away. The treated skin peeled off uniformly, painlessly, and left behind that perfect, pink fresh skin that medium peels are supposed to uncover. The skin healed really well, and quickly as a result of proper, gentle aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;This acid is not for first timers, or for people who have no proper knowledge of the application and neutralization of strong cosmetic acids. It is a level three acid, so do not use it if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Also, the skin must be tough, and used to peels before use. It is a very effective product, and I recommend it for intermediate to professional users.&lt;br /&gt;With caution and proper application, this acid will do the job in no time flat.</li>
            <li> I chose 35% after using TCA 12% of other maker that hardly frost my skin even after 30 min. I simply thought it is 3 times stronger than 12%.  I now realized that it was not about the number.  This one frosts  my skin within a couple of min.  I didn&#x27;t think it would do that fast, it was my mistake.  Once frosting washing with baking soda won&#x27;t stop the process easily.  It caused chemical burn and left a mark... but It was my fault not being cautious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diluting this with water in 1:1, I found it goes deeper.  Skin being peeled is little thicker than TCA 12% of other brand, and it takes longer to peel.  I also used this peel to remove a dime mark scar on the back of my hand.  I don&#x27;t remember what caused the scar, but my guess is burn from cooking oil.  TCA 12% didn&#x27;t do anything, but this peel deduced the pigmentation. 70%?? It looks less visible.</li>
