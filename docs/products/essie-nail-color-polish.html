            <li>It goes on fantastically &amp; is as bright as the bottle.</li>
            <li>I loved the way that this looked in the bottle</li>
            <li>the color is nice though</li>
            <li>I used about 3 coats and it is so nice</li>
            <li>You need a top coat for sure!</li>
            <li>Looks great and lots of fun for summer.</li>
            <li>I felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in Summer.</li>
            <li>The polish went on very smooth</li>
            <li>I love the purple color.  </li>
            <li>However, one day I fell in love with a color my friend was wearing.</li>
            <li>I am a faithful fan of Essie now, with DJ Play that Song as my most favorite polish color.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>Love Essie products and love this color.</li>
            <li>It is more red-toned than yellow-toned.</li>
            <li>Two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish.</li>
            <li>So top coat is a must for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Saturday Disco Fever is a bright pure orange color.</li>
            <li>They lasted more than a week on me which is rare :-).</li>
            <li>but it looks fantastic</li>
            <li>Great coverage and lasting color</li>
            <li>It looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors.</li>
            <li>Pretty color, needs too many coats, chips easily.</li>
            <li>I love the color, but again I am a purple girl, and Essie did not fail to deliver here either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the long lasting wear which is what bumped it up from a 3 to a 4.</li>
            <li>This color was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>There is more pink in the polish than I thought from viewing online, but I love the shade.</li>
            <li>Good brand of polish, OPI is my other fav, this is the first time I tried Essie.  </li>
            <li>This dark Orange looks good on nails</li>
            <li>the finish is very matte</li>
            <li>Very neon.</li>
            <li>I tried to take pics after applying but my camera wouldn&#x27;t capture the real color.</li>
            <li>This is not a very blazing neon, so I am able to wear it to work.</li>
            <li>DJ Play that Song is a vibrant purple/ magenta hue.</li>
            <li>I may look a little better on fairer skinned people though.</li>
            <li>It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  </li>
            <li>The color is really pretty to naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Polish is naturally chip resistant.  </li>
            <li>(tip----learned from my manicurist that the Essie sold in drug stores with white lettering on the bottle is NOT the real Essie-</li>
            <li>so you definitely need a clear coat (i use sally hansen quick dry).</li>
            <li>It is a slight neon purple color, however not to bold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not in your face purple, but almost a little more pink and soft looking.  </li>
            <li>They dry quickly but dry matty-ish.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive at first because I personally don&#x27;t like Yellow/Orange shades.</li>

            <li> so you definitely need a clear coat (i use sally hansen quick dry).</li>
            <li> It is a slight neon purple color, however not to bold.</li>

            <li> I was a little apprehensive at first because I personally don&#x27;t like Yellow/Orange shades.</li>
            <li> However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I&#x27;m still on the fence about is the flat sheen.  </li>
            <li> Nothing that a little attention to detail and a clear coat can&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li> so I will be wearing this all year long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really matte and not shiny.  </li>
            <li> this one is long lasting, but I find that I need to shake it often (almost between each nail) or it gets clumpy, and then it dries with a dull finish.  </li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine!</li>
            <li> Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats.</li>
            <li> It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes</li>
            <li> I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.</li>
            <li> I applied a base coat (OPI Base Coat), 2 coats of polish and a top coat (OPI Top Coat).</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the Essie brand you&#x27;re completely missing out!</li>
            <li> Usually, my nail polish chips in 1 day...</li>
            <li> I was never really into the expensive nail polishes like Essie.</li>
            <li> i hated it</li>
            <li> It looks terrible, hate it!!!</li>

            <li> I love the purple color.  It&#x27;s not in your face purple, but almost a little more pink and soft looking.  The one thing that I&#x27;m still on the fence about is the flat sheen.  It&#x27;s not really matte and not shiny.  I haven&#x27;t decided how I feel about that.</li>
            <li> Just put this color on my hands and feet Luv it !!! I would recommend this color to all my friends</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!</li>
            <li> the finish is very matte so you definitely need a clear coat (i use sally hansen quick dry). the color is nice though</li>
            <li> Excellent color! It literally goes well with any season! I bought it for the summer but it looks fantastic so I will be wearing this all year long. If you haven&#x27;t tried the Essie brand you&#x27;re completely missing out!</li>
            <li> I love the color, but again I am a purple girl, and Essie did not fail to deliver here either. Love!!!</li>
            <li> Got a lot of compliments.  Polish is naturally chip resistant.  Good brand of polish, OPI is my other fav, this is the first time I tried Essie.  Now I am open to Essie as well as OPI.  (tip----learned from my manicurist that the Essie sold in drug stores with white lettering on the bottle is NOT the real Essie- beware.)</li>
            <li> Usually, my nail polish chips in 1 day... this one is long lasting, but I find that I need to shake it often (almost between each nail) or it gets clumpy, and then it dries with a dull finish.  Nothing that a little attention to detail and a clear coat can&#x27;t fix.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the long lasting wear which is what bumped it up from a 3 to a 4.</li>
            <li> I was never really into the expensive nail polishes like Essie. However, one day I fell in love with a color my friend was wearing. It was DJ Play that Song. So I asked her if I could borrow it. The polish went on very smooth {I always were a bottom coat}. I only had to put 2 coats on to achieve the desired color. I loved it!! I am a faithful fan of Essie now, with DJ Play that Song as my most favorite polish color. It is a slight neon purple color, however not to bold. I have it on my toes now and receive tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love this color. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores. It was sold out. You need a top coat for sure!</li>
            <li> Pretty color, needs too many coats, chips easily.</li>
            <li> Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.</li>
            <li> great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated, very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This color was a lot of fun. Very neon. I used about 3 coats and it is so nice&lt;br /&gt;.I got a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and lasting color</li>
            <li> I loved the way that this looked in the bottle but once i placed it on my nail i hated it, it made me look like i had barney hands. I may look a little better on fairer skinned people though.</li>
            <li> DJ Play that Song is a vibrant purple/ magenta hue. It goes on fantastically &amp; is as bright as the bottle. There is more pink in the polish than I thought from viewing online, but I love the shade.</li>
            <li> Love Essie products and love this color. Looks great and lots of fun for summer. Very bright. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> DJ Play That Song is a semi-neon purple color with red undertones. I say semi because it&#x27;s not a blazing neon. It can be worn to work. It looks just like it is pictured in the bottle - pinkish purple. I tried to take pics after applying but my camera wouldn&#x27;t capture the real color. I tried in sun/shade/indoors/lights.. but didn&#x27;t work. The color is really pretty to naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday Disco Fever is a bright pure orange color. This is not a very blazing neon, so I am able to wear it to work. It looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors. I felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in Summer. I was a little apprehensive at first because I personally don&#x27;t like Yellow/Orange shades. But this color worked for me. It is more red-toned than yellow-toned. This dark Orange looks good on nails too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula on both the polishes is great. Two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish. They dry quickly but dry matty-ish. So top coat is a must for me. I applied a base coat (OPI Base Coat), 2 coats of polish and a top coat (OPI Top Coat). They lasted more than a week on me which is rare :-).</li>
