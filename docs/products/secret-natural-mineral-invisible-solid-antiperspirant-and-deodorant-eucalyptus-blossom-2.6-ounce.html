    <ol>
            <li>, it&#x27;s one of the best out there.</li>
            <li>but I never thought I&#x27;d find the perfect one.</li>
            <li>Great smell, works well.</li>
            <li>So of course I am happy with this order.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Love this, does the job and smells great!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant, I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Just in case I can&#x27;t find my favorite I signed up for this on my Subscribe N Save</li>
            <li>It seems to be good for sensitive skin -- it doesn&#x27;t sting or cause redness.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and lasts longer than other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice to have it last a bit longer, but it&#x27;s a trade-off for me with wearability.  </li>
            <li>AND I can find it right here in a store</li>
            <li>Very pricey on Amazon, but when something works, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The cons: it It does create white chunks if you put a lot on, but fewer than most.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care if they call it &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or not, or if it really is &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent that isn&#x27;t irritating (not too flowery or synthetic).</li>
            <li>My family was cursed with especially strong and hard to control body odor, and this is the only product that works.</li>
            <li>Went on nicely, no white marks, and really worked - it would kick in after working out near the end of the day and it used natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY deodorant I can use on my sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation!</li>
            <li>Wish they made this as a clear deodorant only!</li>
            <li>I Love Secret....</li>
            <li>I need something that works, and this works, even when no other deodorant did, even all the various &amp;#34;Clinical Strengths&amp;#34;.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not only does it smell lovely (but not too strong or annoying), it WORKS too!</li>
            <li> Finally, a simple deodorant that works...spent so much money on organic and natural crap and finally found something that really works.</li>
            <li> I tried many different antiperspirants and they all clogged up my sweat glands/pores and made my underarms swell up with painful lumps.  </li>

            <li> I like the product, although it is getting harder to find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like any other product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had problems with sweating and odor the way I do with other antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few antiperspirants I can use.  </li>
            <li> Discovered this a few months ago, and this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I Always use it and it is now so difficult to find at local stores....</li>
            <li> I alway buy a few at a time when I do find it!</li>
            <li> Hate paying this much</li>
            <li> I purchased two on here at an overinflated price but know that I am going to have to try out some new ones to see if I can find something else that works.  :(</li>
            <li> One of the deoderants with few bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I just learned today that this product has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed Proctor and Gamble has discontinued it</li>

            <li> Great smell, works well.</li>
            <li> I Love Secret....enough said!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and now I can&#x27;t find it in any local store.  Hate paying this much but I don&#x27;t like any other product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this deo and sad that its no longer sold in stores. I love the fragrance. So of course I am happy with this order.</li>
            <li> Great product it&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t find it at stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Discovered this a few months ago, and this stuff works! Doesn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;cover up,&amp;#34; but helps prevent odor and minimizes perspiration that contributes to odor. Very pleased. Suddenly, I couldn&#x27;t find it in our local grocery or drug stores, so I looked on Amazon and thankfully found some. Very pricey on Amazon, but when something works, it was worth it. Still, wondering why it&#x27;s no longer sold in my local retailers???</li>
            <li> Recieved on time and intact. I&#x27;m just disappointed Proctor and Gamble has discontinued it, it&#x27;s one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and absolutely love it.  I tried many different antiperspirants and they all clogged up my sweat glands/pores and made my underarms swell up with painful lumps.  I tried this one and have never had a problem.  Unfortunately I just learned today that this product has been discontinued.  I purchased two on here at an overinflated price but know that I am going to have to try out some new ones to see if I can find something else that works.  :(</li>
            <li> I need something that works, and this works, even when no other deodorant did, even all the various &amp;#34;Clinical Strengths&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t care if they call it &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or not, or if it really is &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or not. My family was cursed with especially strong and hard to control body odor, and this is the only product that works.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant! Not only does it smell lovely (but not too strong or annoying), it WORKS too! I haven&#x27;t had problems with sweating and odor the way I do with other antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> One of the deoderants with few bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, I wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued! Pros: It has a great scent that isn&#x27;t irritating (not too flowery or synthetic). I sweat a lot and while the fragrance diminishes, it prevents odor. It seems to be good for sensitive skin -- it doesn&#x27;t sting or cause redness.  The cons: it It does create white chunks if you put a lot on, but fewer than most. It contains antiperspirant. I switch back and forth between this and a men&#x27;s deodorant without antiperspirant. Wish they made this as a clear deodorant only!</li>
            <li> Buying again! The smell is great and lasts longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I Always use it and it is now so difficult to find at local stores.... Great product</li>
            <li> Love this, does the job and smells great!</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d review an antiperspirant but I never thought I&#x27;d find the perfect one. This was it. Went on nicely, no white marks, and really worked - it would kick in after working out near the end of the day and it used natural ingredients. Unfortunately the P&amp;G decided for whatever reason that it was no longer worth selling and it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deodorant I can use on my sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few antiperspirants I can use.  It has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation.  By the end of the day, it starts to wear off.  It&#x27;d be nice to have it last a bit longer, but it&#x27;s a trade-off for me with wearability.  I like the product, although it is getting harder to find it in stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> ACTULLY I BOUGHT IT &amp;#34;BECAUSE&amp;#34;  MY WIFE LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say I found a deodorant that I like as well as my Nivea AND I can find it right here in a store but this stuff is great. Just in case I can&#x27;t find my favorite I signed up for this on my Subscribe N Save</li>
            <li> Finally, a simple deodorant that works...spent so much money on organic and natural crap and finally found something that really works. I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed throughout the day because my armpits are reeking havoc on my nostrils and everyone&#x27;s around me.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t always carry this on Amazon, and I can&#x27;t find it in stores.  It&#x27;s the only deodorant I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause me skin irritation and works!!!  I alway buy a few at a time when I do find it!</li>
