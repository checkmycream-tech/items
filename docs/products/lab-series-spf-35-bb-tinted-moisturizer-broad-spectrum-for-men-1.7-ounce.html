    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>- It does what it says it will do, and it does that excellently.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the great product!</li>
            <li>The tint is the best part of it.</li>
            <li>Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s darker in my case), but it evens out incredibly well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t attractive at all.</li>
            <li>Great cream if you have redness.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>At SPF35, it&#x27;s great for outdoor wear as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin, and this stuff goes on great.</li>
            <li>Matches my skin tone, gives me a glow and makes my skin even more flawless.</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t say it won&#x27;t do anything good for you either.</li>
            <li>This product seems best for people with light colored</li>
            <li>it look good.</li>
            <li>This is a good BB cream that includes some sunscreen.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re like me and love looking your best and see your body as your artistic canvas you need this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and I  would suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It will help you look amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on really nice.</li>
            <li>but this one is the best by far!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, better use it after the aftershave and do not add anything else in between or after</li>
            <li>you better google and find non-comedogenic BB cream.</li>
            <li>But for those with great even skin already, I can&#x27;t see much justification for the price -</li>
            <li>This is the begging of many more brands for men to come.</li>
            <li>I think of Lab as a pinoneer for a push for better mens skin care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to control it, but it never fully went away.</li>
            <li>Since using this, my skin started looking so ridiculously healthy</li>
            <li>Just after about a months use, my skin looks almost flawless, even prior to applying.</li>
            <li>This BB cream seems mostly like a concealer.</li>
            <li>I apply this on top of my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Really love how it evens out the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Woman&#x27;s cover up makeup has many shades to match varying complexions.</li>
            <li>A very good product that actually does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li>That said, the coverage (for things like age spots and moles, etc.) is really minimal, so if you think it&#x27;s going to make you look flawless, it won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It is REALLY smooth and doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a product that does triple duty--moisturizing, sun block, and light cosmetic ability.  </li>
            <li>Still a reasonably useful product :-)</li>
            <li>Way too light.  </li>
            <li>it can give a nice touch and even hide some imperfections (mainly to give an even tone to the face).</li>
            <li>Bought this product at a significant discount compared to what it was going for in singapore.</li>
            <li>Even my wife noticed a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>The BB cream is great for evening out color inconsistencies in your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lab Series products for more than 10 years and absolutely swear by them.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, a little pricey, but</li>
            <li>It could stick to the facial hairs making it look like you have applied some kind of powder without a brush.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and time.</li>
            <li>Definitly worth the $ that youl spend buying this</li>
            <li>Worth it and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>so far have enjoyed the product for the spf aspect....</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>But at the same time you don&#x27;t have to be super cautious of touching your face to anything.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what a men&#x27;s BB cream should aim for.</li>
            <li>Although it works pretty well as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But since I want to play it safe and use a product I know was made for a man I pay the extra price.</li>
            <li>I kind of expected this to happen, but I urge you to wash your hands after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After noticing the streak from rubbing my hands across the cloth</li>
            <li>The good news is you&#x27;re only going to use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to blend ok with my pale and light colored complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thin so it goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I tried it but didn&#x27;t realize that it was tinted, what I got was a light tint, and on my skin it made me look very pale, in the right light I looked like those guys in the Vampire series.  </li>
            <li>The benefit is noticeable but not so much that it ever looks like you have man-makeup on.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer if they had specials for returning buyers, such as buy 1 get 1 free.</li>
            <li>product applies well and leaves your skin feeling refreshed while looking very even-toned without appearing oily.  </li>
            <li>Just apply a light face moisturizer or after shave lotion and then apply a tiny bit of this while face is still moist.</li>
            <li>(just bought a second tube for when I am actually out, to be honest).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve covered all your other bases in looking good (low body fat, muscular tone, acne, hair, clothes, ALPHA PERSONALITY!)</li>
            <li>I notice that it sort of come off when you massage it on the face on top of other products.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smoothly although you have to be careful to work it in so that you don&#x27; t have visible areas that look like you applied makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavier and greasier than your typical lotion, but that&#x27;s what you expect if you want more coverage.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not makeup, but the tint does smooth out rough areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tint will wipe off easily, but blotting sweat/oil off seems to remove less tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One tube should last you two months roughly - even if you use it most days like me.</li>
            <li>I use it more for special occasion wear and not as an everyday moisturizer due to the price.</li>
            <li>First, let&#x27;s deal with the obvious.</li>
            <li>But I dress first, and use this last.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on clear, nor does it turn clear.</li>
            <li>Did not cause any rash or breakout on my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After allowing the product to soak into my skin for about a half-hour, I lightly rubbed a white cloth across my forehead; sure enough it left only a very slight tan streak.  </li>
            <li>It also goes on pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I sought this product per its reputation amongst other users, and the need for it in the summer when I am in the sun so much more than other parts of the year.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And in the conservative rural area I live in, folks would call me out and label me a tranny</li>
            <li>First off, IT IS pretty much makeup, but it is very subtle.</li>
            <li>Using it daily it could last 2 months, but the cost is still high.</li>
            <li>Plus, I consistently battled dark spots and scars.</li>
            <li>The tube is pretty small compared to a normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>it blends into to skin quickly and very little it needed.</li>
            <li>I was out in the sun all day on a Saturday recently and fried my shoulders/chest/back to the point the skin eventually peeled - there wasn&#x27;t even redness on the bridge of my nose with this applied earlier that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily sensitive skin prone to breakouts if I am not careful.</li>
            <li>But even though I [only] applied an amount about the size of a dime to my skin, I noticed that when I wiped my hands on a white cloth shortly after there was a clear tan streak.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great for people like me with uneven skin tones due to dark spots from acne (or similar) who want to even their skin out without looking at-all fake.</li>
            <li> My only caveat is that is can feel a bit dry.</li>
            <li> It did smooth out my skin but the color was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Since it goes on so dry</li>
            <li> , I decided to allow the product to dry on my face to conduct a test to see if it would rub off onto (for example) clothing throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Come on guys, our skin is a mess of different colors.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I think I have had less acne since I&#x27;ve started using this, but it could be due to not using a daily moisturizer before using this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles to happen with this lotion but expected a skin smoothing and evening result.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> It must be the ingredients combined with the UVA/UVB protection, but my dark spots have all faded, and I&#x27;m not getting pimples or blackheads.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this product would work for those with medium to dark complexions.</li>
            <li> and I noticed less crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> It blends in and makes flaws less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product contains oxybenzone and a few other chemicals that I feel are not good for daily use.</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t give a flat fake powdery look though - even up</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product made my face slightly shiny after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap by any means</li>
            <li> I feel like I could experiment with a few and eventually find a cheaper alternative that works just as well.</li>
            <li> No one realized and said I was using a tint, but I did not apply the product heavily.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t spread easily, a little too thick.</li>
            <li> you apply small amount and do not sweat</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any female BB creams because I was afraid they would look like makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed in with the product which is unusual for Lab Series.</li>
            <li> bad news is this stuff is a little pricy.</li>
            <li> But the tinted part - that&#x27;s makeup plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tinted doesn&#x27;t make it bad, or girly</li>
            <li> The product is expensive, but has lasted a while.</li>
            <li> I did this again after about 6-7 hours or so and the streak was extremely faint,</li>
            <li> The tinted part is so inconvenient.</li>
            <li> product is very expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> I had bad acne through my teens, until about a month ago (I&#x27;m 28).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> First, let&#x27;s deal with the obvious. It&#x27;s makeup for men, right? Maybe, maybe not. It doesn&#x27;t go on clear, nor does it turn clear. It&#x27;s tinted. So it&#x27;s makeup. But it doesn&#x27;t change the color of your face. It only mellows it out. Still sounds like makeup to me. If this was just sunscreen or moisturizer then I wouldn&#x27;t think makeup. But the tinted part - that&#x27;s makeup plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tinted doesn&#x27;t make it bad, or girly, it&#x27;s just to control the appearance of the skin. Come on guys, our skin is a mess of different colors. It really isn&#x27;t attractive at all. So lets do something about it. Let&#x27;s mellow out the reds and the faded spots. And we can do that with sunscreen and moisturizer to protect our faces too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is this stuff is a little pricy. The good news is you&#x27;re only going to use a tiny bit. This tube will last for months. A tiny spec will work on each cheek. Another spec for your nose. Two specs for your forehead. Once you rub and blend it all in, you probably won&#x27;t notice the difference. But it&#x27;s there, yes, it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it coming off on my clothes. But I dress first, and use this last. I like this stuff, no matter if it&#x27;s makeup or not.</li>
            <li> I notice that it sort of come off when you massage it on the face on top of other products. It could stick to the facial hairs making it look like you have applied some kind of powder without a brush. I have also tried a sample of SPF 15 protective lotion, from the same company, and it does not show the problem mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;So, better use it after the aftershave and do not add anything else in between or after it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply small amount and do not sweat it can give a nice touch and even hide some imperfections (mainly to give an even tone to the face). Using it daily it could last 2 months, but the cost is still high.</li>
            <li> Color comes off on hands and clothes.</li>
            <li> I sought this product per its reputation amongst other users, and the need for it in the summer when I am in the sun so much more than other parts of the year.Plus, it works!</li>
            <li> Great cream if you have redness.  Works great</li>
            <li> Do not rub your face, as it&#x27;s tinted and will wipe off - my fear afterwards was that I was blotchy so I washed my face to remove it.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE OILY OR COMBINATION SKIN!&lt;br /&gt;This product is not &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34; meaning it will clog your pores because it contain silicons. you better google and find non-comedogenic BB cream.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and I  would suggest it to anyone. Doesn&#x27;t look like I have anything on. Worth the money and time.</li>
            <li> Bought this product at a significant discount compared to what it was going for in singapore. Highly recommend it as a daily moisturizer. I use it everyday and I noticed less crow&#x27;s feet. SPF protection is an added benefit!</li>
            <li> The BB cream is great for evening out color inconsistencies in your skin. It&#x27;s a bit heavier and greasier than your typical lotion, but that&#x27;s what you expect if you want more coverage.  At SPF35, it&#x27;s great for outdoor wear as well. I use it more for special occasion wear and not as an everyday moisturizer due to the price. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles to happen with this lotion but expected a skin smoothing and evening result.  The benefit is noticeable but not so much that it ever looks like you have man-makeup on.  That&#x27;s exactly what a men&#x27;s BB cream should aim for.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t spread easily, a little too thick.</li>
            <li> A very good product that actually does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. Definitly worth the $ that youl spend buying this</li>
            <li> First off, IT IS pretty much makeup, but it is very subtle. Only you will see a difference, but you will definitely see a difference. In the three months or so I have been wearing this I have never been asked if I was wearing makeup. And in the conservative rural area I live in, folks would call me out and label me a tranny if they could tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, it should work with about any Caucasian skin tone. Before it&#x27;s rubbed in it may look darker or lighter than your skin (it&#x27;s darker in my case), but it evens out incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does it do? It makes your skin look healthier, evened out, and minimizes the appearance of pores. Definitely doesn&#x27;t give a flat fake powdery look though - even up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is legit. I was out in the sun all day on a Saturday recently and fried my shoulders/chest/back to the point the skin eventually peeled - there wasn&#x27;t even redness on the bridge of my nose with this applied earlier that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily sensitive skin prone to breakouts if I am not careful. This does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts, thankfully. In all honesty, I think I have had less acne since I&#x27;ve started using this, but it could be due to not using a daily moisturizer before using this. And on that note, I do use this 6 to 7 days a week. No problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tube should last you two months roughly - even if you use it most days like me. It has been about three months for me and it&#x27;s just now getting low (just bought a second tube for when I am actually out, to be honest). That said, at $35 a tube it&#x27;s not cheap by any means and that&#x27;s its biggest downfall for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another con is it will rub off of your face if you wipe your face with a shirt, towel, napkin, pillows or whatever similar. But at the same time you don&#x27;t have to be super cautious of touching your face to anything. You can still put white shirts on over your head and scratch the occasional face itch with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts - It does what it says it will do, and it does that excellently. It&#x27;s great for people like me with uneven skin tones due to dark spots from acne (or similar) who want to even their skin out without looking at-all fake. But for those with great even skin already, I can&#x27;t see much justification for the price - But I won&#x27;t say it won&#x27;t do anything good for you either.</li>
            <li> I like that it blends into to skin quickly and very little it needed. This is the begging of many more brands for men to come. I think of Lab as a pinoneer for a push for better mens skin care. Although it works pretty well as a stand alone product. I would prefer if they had specials for returning buyers, such as buy 1 get 1 free. I would recommend</li>
            <li> Matches my skin tone, gives me a glow and makes my skin even more flawless. I highly recomend it. ;)</li>
            <li> Changed my life, no joke. I had bad acne through my teens, until about a month ago (I&#x27;m 28). I&#x27;ve been able to control it, but it never fully went away. Plus, I consistently battled dark spots and scars. Since using this, my skin started looking so ridiculously healthy I stopped messing with it, and simplified my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin, and this stuff goes on great. It&#x27;s not makeup, but the tint does smooth out rough areas. It must be the ingredients combined with the UVA/UVB protection, but my dark spots have all faded, and I&#x27;m not getting pimples or blackheads. Just after about a months use, my skin looks almost flawless, even prior to applying. Thank you for the great product!</li>
            <li> The tinted part is so inconvenient.</li>
            <li> This BB cream seems mostly like a concealer. I don&#x27;t feel like it hydrates my face at all. It also goes on pretty dry. It does however even my skin tone without looking like makeup. Only takes a tiny amount to get results. Since it goes on so dry I apply this on top of my moisturizer. Really love how it evens out the skin on my face. I have olive skin and this blends in perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the price is a bit steep. I haven&#x27;t tried any female BB creams because I was afraid they would look like makeup on my face. I feel like I could experiment with a few and eventually find a cheaper alternative that works just as well. But since I want to play it safe and use a product I know was made for a man I pay the extra price. The tube is pretty small compared to a normal moisturizer so you are definitely paying for the tint. I would just expect this to be a concealer made for men. This won&#x27;t replace your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me and love looking your best and see your body as your artistic canvas you need this product. The tint is the best part of it. I&#x27;ve only tried this and the Mary Kay tinted moisturizer but this one is the best by far! It is REALLY smooth and doesn&#x27;t look like makeup. It&#x27;s nice and thin so it goes on easily. It will last a while. It will help you look amazing. The difference is noticeable. If you&#x27;ve covered all your other bases in looking good (low body fat, muscular tone, acne, hair, clothes, ALPHA PERSONALITY!) then this is a must.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts or skin irritation while using this product. The tint will reduce redness a shade or so. This product seemed to blend ok with my pale and light colored complexion. No one realized and said I was using a tint, but I did not apply the product heavily. The sunblock seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very expensive for what it does. This product contains oxybenzone and a few other chemicals that I feel are not good for daily use. I have oily skin and this product made my face slightly shiny after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this product would work for those with medium to dark complexions. Woman&#x27;s cover up makeup has many shades to match varying complexions. This product seems best for people with light colored complexions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tint will wipe off easily, but blotting sweat/oil off seems to remove less tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and would buy it again. The product is expensive, but has lasted a while. No one has noticed that I have the product on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lab Series products for more than 10 years and absolutely swear by them.  I decided to give this product a try at the recommendation of a Lab Series rep at my local retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product applies well and leaves your skin feeling refreshed while looking very even-toned without appearing oily.  But even though I [only] applied an amount about the size of a dime to my skin, I noticed that when I wiped my hands on a white cloth shortly after there was a clear tan streak.  I kind of expected this to happen, but I urge you to wash your hands after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After noticing the streak from rubbing my hands across the cloth, I decided to allow the product to dry on my face to conduct a test to see if it would rub off onto (for example) clothing throughout the day.  After allowing the product to soak into my skin for about a half-hour, I lightly rubbed a white cloth across my forehead; sure enough it left only a very slight tan streak.  I did this again after about 6-7 hours or so and the streak was extremely faint, almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;streaking&#x27; aside, I do like the way this product makes your skin look.  Even my wife noticed a significant difference.  But I dont think I&#x27;ll use this product as part of my daily ritual.  I&#x27;m going to stick with my LS Daily Moisture Defense, which has always worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Its man makeup! Just apply a light face moisturizer or after shave lotion and then apply a tiny bit of this while face is still moist. It blends in and makes flaws less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Goes on really nice. Doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing anything. It smoothes out skin and evens it out.&lt;br /&gt;Makes it look good. Worth it and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The last review makes you think this stuff shouldn&#x27;t rub off-- like a self tanner. It&#x27;s not a self tanned at all. It&#x27;s a moisturizer. Like any lotion it would wipe off. It&#x27;s not a tan look though--it&#x27;s lighter than that. The biggest thing it does is even the skin tone without greasy look.</li>
            <li> This is a good BB cream that includes some sunscreen. It goes on pretty smoothly although you have to be careful to work it in so that you don&#x27; t have visible areas that look like you applied makeup. This cream visibly evens tone and reduces shine. My only caveat is that is can feel a bit dry. Did not cause any rash or breakout on my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so far have enjoyed the product for the spf aspect....</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff. I use with glycol Murad, they use this for the SPF and the tint cover my blotchy skin and imperfections. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a product that does triple duty--moisturizing, sun block, and light cosmetic ability.  That said, the coverage (for things like age spots and moles, etc.) is really minimal, so if you think it&#x27;s going to make you look flawless, it won&#x27;t.  Also, the price for this daily use product is quite steep, without any place to buy them at a discount, or anything like one.  Still a reasonably useful product :-)</li>
            <li> I tried it but didn&#x27;t realize that it was tinted, what I got was a light tint, and on my skin it made me look very pale, in the right light I looked like those guys in the Vampire series.  It did smooth out my skin but the color was wrong.  Only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores which is key.  Great stuff, a little pricey, but it does the job well.  (watch out for your collars though, it will wipe off if you rub against it after application.)</li>
            <li> Way too light.  Not manly at all. Very Disappointed in with the product which is unusual for Lab Series. Wish I could get a credit.</li>
