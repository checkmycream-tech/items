            <li>I have fine hair and this stuff really pumps up the volume.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I searched and found it in the larger size</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft looking but allows me to have more control with it.</li>
            <li>not bad, i am happy that is is a small size that will travel without issue.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and because of this most products weigh my hair down, this one did not.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me just the right amount of volume at the roots to create fullness without dulling the shine or smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that lays flat unless I put in a lot of effort.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast, too!</li>
            <li>I saw this product first on a hair tutorial I found on Pinterest.</li>
            <li>It helps my fine textured hair have more body and volume, without leaving it sticky or stiff looking.  </li>
            <li>Con: My thin fine hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get a lot of boost from this foam, but it&#x27;s good at keeping the static down when using the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is extra fine, and this product works well to give me some texture &amp; lift.  </li>
            <li>and any more volume than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product on recommendation from beauty blog, &#x27;the small things&#x27; and yes, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>After shampooing and dry toweling the hair, lift roots and spray in sections, comb through and then start blow drying (with or without brush is fine).  </li>
            <li>For the price it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth buying it.  </li>
            <li>I have loved the way Aquage foam fluffs my thin hair for years.</li>
            <li>I saw this on the small things blog and have fell in love.</li>
            <li>I love the foaming action and how you can just comb it through your roots, unlike sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>After the blogger raving about the product more, I finally broke down and ordered some.</li>
            <li>I heard such great things about this product and I was so excited to try it, but I was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li>Container is designed specifically to place product directly on the root.</li>
            <li>Small container was perfect for my needs but expensive.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it takes about 25% longer to dry my hair with the product in it, but it is worth it in the end.</li>

            <li> I think it works well to add a little texture, but a little goes a long way on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying the large container unless you need a small one for a similar reason.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;flat on the head\\</li>
            <li> I have thin, flat, straight hair &amp; this does wonders.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the large bottle at my stylists but needed a small travel bottle for a weekend flight I was taking.</li>
            <li> It truly does lift my straight, thin hair.</li>
            <li> divide hair into sections, spray product on the root of each section, flip head over and use fingers to drag product through rest of hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this foam sets itself apart from other mousses that you can buy in a grocery store.</li>
            <li> Dry upside down for a few minutes, then flip hair up and continue to dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use every other day and now can go a day or so between washings since my hair will hold the style and it also absorbs the oil!</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, which a lot of times can look flat.  </li>
            <li> : There is no sticky heavy feel to my hair which I do like.  </li>
            <li> Works but still makes hair feel heavy and tacky</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different after using this.  </li>
            <li> I usually tease the hair after bumble and bumble beach spray</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t add body and just leaves a gross film, making my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this product did not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to work well for volume and body with my thin hair though.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this def ooomphd it up for the wedding I was attending.  </li>
            <li> but hate that flat, lifeless look.</li>
            <li> My hair just felt like I dried it with mousse and did not have the lift :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very fine hair that lays flat unless I put in a lot of effort. This product has been great and makes my hair much fuller. The only downside is it takes about 25% longer to dry my hair with the product in it, but it is worth it in the end. It holds the volume all day as well!</li>
            <li> The be st mouse on the market.  Flexible yet strong. Good for volume at the roots.</li>
            <li> I saw a review of this product on a blog I read. I was curious to see if it really gave your hair a \\&quot;lift\\&quot;. After the blogger raving about the product more, I finally broke down and ordered some. I have to say, I love it!! It truly does lift my straight, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Think travel size.  Works phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the review of a youtube beauty blogger. I think it works well to add a little texture, but a little goes a long way on fine hair. Buy the trial size and try it out. Glad I did . Probably won&#x27;t buy the full size, but I&#x27;ll use this one up.</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size of this product to try it out. I loved it so much I searched and found it in the larger size and it has been the best product for my hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this foam sets itself apart from other mousses that you can buy in a grocery store. It works well, but it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I heard such great things about this product and I was so excited to try it, but I was greatly disappointed. This doesn&#x27;t add body and just leaves a gross film, making my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product in a blog I follow and the lady raves about it constantly so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it several times a week for 3 weeks now and I love it! It does exactly what she said it would - gives incredible volume to my very flat hair! I love the foaming action and how you can just comb it through your roots, unlike sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s worth every penny and smells great too!</li>
            <li> I saw this on the small things blog and have fell in love. I used to use big sexy and did not get the results I get from this! I use every other day and now can go a day or so between washings since my hair will hold the style and it also absorbs the oil!</li>
            <li> Love the uplifting foam! Not as sticky as most mouse products and gives my hair lots of body and lift. I usually buy the large bottle at my stylists but needed a small travel bottle for a weekend flight I was taking. Small container was perfect for my needs but expensive. I would suggest buying the large container unless you need a small one for a similar reason.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after it was recommended by a friend.  i tried it and it didn&#x27;t and any more volume than other products I have tried.  For the price it definitely wasn&#x27;t worth buying it.  The plus side though is it made my hair smell great and left it shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This product was recommended by the Simple Things Blog and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy but gives body to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this stuff really pumps up the volume.</li>
            <li> My hair is extra fine, and this product works well to give me some texture &amp; lift.  I travel a lot, so was glad to have found a travel sized product.  Shipment was fast, too!</li>
            <li> Con: My thin fine hair doesn&#x27;t seem to get a lot of boost from this foam, but it&#x27;s good at keeping the static down when using the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: There is no sticky heavy feel to my hair which I do like.  All in all, this helps in styling &amp; Aquage Finishing Spray gives the boost and hold I need, so I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Genuine article.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing on blowdrying my huge, fine, 3b hair straight! I like to blow-dry my curls out but hate that flat, lifeless look. This product gives me just the right amount of volume at the roots to create fullness without dulling the shine or smoothness of my hair. Perfect with no residue!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different after using this.  I was so excited to try it after all the reviews. Nothing seems to work well for volume and body with my thin hair though.</li>
            <li> I have loved the way Aquage foam fluffs my thin hair for years. The 2.5 oz size fits into the airport 3-1-1 bag for storage in my carry-on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Container is designed specifically to place product directly on the root. divide hair into sections, spray product on the root of each section, flip head over and use fingers to drag product through rest of hair. Dry upside down for a few minutes, then flip hair up and continue to dry with a round brush. You can actually feel the body your hair now has! I have very fine hair and it works!</li>
            <li> I saw this item on a video where a lady was describing it as wonderful.  I have really thick hair, which a lot of times can look flat.  The Aquage Foam helps it a good bit.  I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;flat on the head\\&quot; look anymore!</li>
            <li> Used this in Hawaii. I have thin hair and this def ooomphd it up for the wedding I was attending.  After shampooing and dry toweling the hair, lift roots and spray in sections, comb through and then start blow drying (with or without brush is fine).  I usually tease the hair after bumble and bumble beach spray</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for volume.  I&#x27;ve ordered it 3 times now and will continue to do so until I can find it locally.</li>
            <li> This foam gives your hair a wonderful lightweight feeling and it makes your hair look fuller.  Smells wonderful and comes at a great price!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizing product I have used and I&#x27;ve had people comment on the amount of volume in my hair when I use it. Look on Aquage&#x27;s website for helpful hints on using it.</li>
            <li> The 2.5 oz container of the aquage uplifting foam is perfect for travel.  It helps my fine textured hair have more body and volume, without leaving it sticky or stiff looking.  It leaves my hair soft looking but allows me to have more control with it. I would definitely recommend it to others.  I received this product very quickly through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great size for travel.</li>
            <li> I saw this product first on a hair tutorial I found on Pinterest. I am absolutely in love with this product. I have very fine hair and because of this most products weigh my hair down, this one did not.  I am definitely going to be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> Works but still makes hair feel heavy and tacky</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this product did not work as well as I expected. For me, it made my hair look oily and I could not tell that it gave my roots any amount of lift. I have tried another brand of root lifter from a salon, and I will go back to using it.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product and it did not live up to them. My hair just felt like I dried it with mousse and did not have the lift :(</li>
            <li> not bad, i am happy that is is a small size that will travel without issue. and it does not make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I have thin, flat, straight hair &amp; this does wonders. I have tried EVERYTHING &amp; this finally does the trick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on recommendation from beauty blog, &#x27;the small things&#x27; and yes, it is amazing.  I will be getting the larger size next time.  Came quickly, and in perfect condition from seller.</li>
            <li> Love how super light it is and smells great!</li>
