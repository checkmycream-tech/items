            <li> These lotions have really helped my dry skin!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and also got the larger set.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of use, my face was dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> I did not carefully examine to determine the fluid ounces of each product before ordering, but sheesh - these things are microscopically small!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye-creams and they are greasy and goes into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Arbonne is a terrific product, but this is a sample that a consultant gets for $14 for a pack of 10, this is not good business.  </li>
            <li> 9 bucks wasted</li>
            <li> Seller you should be ashamed :/</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how small the trial tubes were.</li>
            <li> I wish Arbonne wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> Thats absurd!!</li>

            <li> Very tiny samples....what company would charge for these.  I was shocked and I bought 3 to give to my sisters to try...they could not believe I paid for those...who knows if they are a good product...not enough to try for any time enough to see.</li>
            <li> yall are getting ripped off!  I give these away for FREE to clients who want to try.  Seller you should be ashamed :/</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Arbonne!!!</li>
            <li> So misleading!  Granted I did not carefully examine to determine the fluid ounces of each product before ordering, but sheesh - these things are microscopically small!  I thought these would be great for traveling, but you can&#x27;t get more than one - MAYBE two uses out of these.  I have used the RE9 products before and they are great, but this travel set is useless in my book.</li>
            <li> Dont buy it from amazon! Thats absurd!! The consultants give it for free! And ysah its a bit expansive but works so great that is worth to pay!</li>
