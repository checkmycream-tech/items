            <li>Great product to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li>Good color and longevity but most of all, SAFE TO USE.</li>
            <li>I used this product about three weeks ago, and it is by far the best henna product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best natural hair colors on the market.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, if gets on skin, on the floor, or sink, it is easily removed with water/soap, but stays well on hair.  </li>
            <li>, it looked ok and did the job.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to use product to make my hair healthy looking...</li>
            <li>I use pantene ProV conditioner with it, it makes hair even better looking.  </li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I also shampooed after the color and before conditioning my hair to make sure I got all the residual color out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>and it worked better than most things.  </li>
            <li>and I love it, but mixing it is cumbersome, so</li>
            <li>I have used Surya Henna products for about 6 months now and have found that it has quite literally transformed my hair to a much more lusterous, healthy feeling texture.</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;m glad I purchased two bottles.  </li>
            <li>I receive many compliments with the Mahogany color.</li>
            <li>I love having a way to color my hair without toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I only use this brand of henna dye, it is the BEST one I have tried.</li>
            <li>I would also suggest researching the ingredients a bit more to determine whether or not you are getting the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product you think you have purchased.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have anything better to do on the weekend, I&#x27;d change my hair color.</li>
            <li>tried a couple more times after that, always having antibiotics on hand to start a couple of days before.</li>
            <li>i love the color</li>
            <li>For me, the best decision at this time is to continue use a product that is gentle, effective, and fits my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>It lasts as long as any semi-permanent color - and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make me swell up like a Klingon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts as long as any semi-permanent color - and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make me swell up like a Klingon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great, natural color,</li>
            <li>Love this product , it leave ls my hair looking  healthy and super shyny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really haven&#x27;t experienced fear until you&#x27;ve seen your forehead go from a mild unicorn affliction into full-blown, shut-eyed, bumpy-faced Klingon mode overnight.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>This product is easily applied and covers so well that no one would even notice you had gray hair before the coloring.</li>
            <li>It went on easily and any color on my skin was easily removed with a washcloth and soap.  </li>
            <li>An easy and inexpensive alternative to pricey salon treatments.</li>
            <li>I thought application was fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>Nothing this easy to use could be.</li>
            <li>Nothing this easy to use could be.</li>
            <li>turns all my hair purple , no mater what color you use , if you want purple hair it is fine .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good, healthy, natural and much better than the toxic counterparts(regular dyes) from the big brands.</li>
            <li>Great shine and conditioning even without extra conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different hair coloring products and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a great and necessary alternative to PPD containing hair dyes.</li>
            <li>I used a SLS free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair 2-3 times a week with a SLS free shampoo and conditioner and lukewarm water.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried the chocolate which was ok</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used Surya Cream and am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>By the way, it covers my grey very nicely.</li>
            <li>Mild symptoms the first time or two, with more pronounced effect after that.</li>
            <li>Mild symptoms the first time or two, with more pronounced effect after that.</li>
            <li>make sure you really wash it out well or it will transfer to your pillow and wash your hair before applying the color (just rinse and condition).</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair super shiny...</li>
            <li>Since using this product for the first time over 4 months ago, my hair has grown tremendously!</li>
            <li>The color was absolutely perfect--a glossy chocolate brown, but with a few highlights coming through, so it looks really awesome!  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing and it covered my very grey roots easily.  </li>
            <li>and I love the soft brown color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month and needs to be touched up, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with color and processing time, but so far, I love it.</li>
            <li>My original intention was to be able to use one in the future.   </li>
            <li>However, the chocolate brown is an exact match for my natural color, it&#x27;s quick and easy, and it covers the gray.</li>
            <li>However, the chocolate brown is an exact match for my natural color, it&#x27;s quick and easy, and it covers the gray.</li>
            <li>I would truly say experiment with true Henna; this product doesn&#x27;t give the real effect of Henna.   </li>
            <li>I holed up at home for a couple of days, bugging the nurses at the clinic about how long it would take the antibiotics to take effect, until I could put neither my loving (and concerned) boyfriend nor my demanding job off another day.</li>
            <li>A great mix is Dark Brown with Golden Blonde....makes a natural brunette color.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle to my hair.</li>
            <li>I used my own shower cap as the one in the box was not much help.  </li>
            <li>The first application of this product lasted 4 1/2 weeks before I needed to recolor.  </li>
            <li>That I can really appreciate!</li>
            <li>Love this product, and got tons of compliments, even from total strangers, on my hair immediately after dying it.</li>
            <li>He advised me to be patient and it would most likely fade away...</li>
            <li>For me, that seems to be be related more to preparation than anything else (use a clarifying wash, etc).</li>
            <li>To say it wasn&#x27;t pretty is the understatement of a lifetime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hairdresser tried every exotic coloring he could get his hands on...and they all followed the same pattern.</li>
            <li>hairdresser tried every exotic coloring he could get his hands on...and they all followed the same pattern.</li>
            <li>but i think it is more like a regular dye than henna !!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, as it&#x27;s a liquid, and you can save what you don&#x27;t use for another application or two as long as you store it in a cool place out of sunlight.  </li>
            <li>I also tried dark brown of the same brand, but I liked the chocolate color better.  </li>
            <li>For you, the right decision may be a different one.n at this time is to continue use a product that is gentle, effective, and fits my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it is more or less effective at coloring or covering grey (and I am an EXCELLENT test subject for grey!) than henna powders.</li>
            <li>It will also make an absolute mess of your towels, so after you use it be sure to avoid drying your hair with white towels, otherwise your towels will end up being a lovely henna-dye hue!</li>
            <li>My hair is more than 60 percent grey.  </li>
            <li>Many people who color their hair have no idea about the harsh chemicals in the products - Surya Henna products are all natural and safe.</li>
            <li>and I just wanted a nice black...</li>
            <li>Amazon.com price is lower than health store price, however, because of shipping charges, it does not make it beneficial unless ordering relatively large quantity of product.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>That seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>I was really worried about that.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it is sold in Whole Foods as well.  </li>
            <li>I have used real henna before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to go with the real deal and won&#x27;t reorder this version.</li>
            <li>This was shipped out in a very timely manner...</li>
            <li>This product included cheap plastic gloves that tore as soon as I put my fingers in; an oversized, no-form plastic cap when a regular shower cap would have sufficed; and the color on the gray washed out during the rinse.</li>
            <li>conditioner help to seal in the color, as I was told it would, although they do not give as much shine as I get with RenPure Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner from Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try a more natural hair color and decided on this brand.  </li>
            <li>What I do love about it is that it gives my gray highlights ( I have a natural red undertone)</li>
            <li>Then, about 15 years ago I used a popular drugstore brand (no names, they&#x27;re no different than any other) to go a gorgeous sunset red and about 6 hours after application, I had open, running sores on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have naturally brown mousy hair, and I chose Mahogany, and it left my hair a lovely dark red-brown with lovely reddish highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for using an all natural product on my hair which produces more natural results than most dyes and protects my hair from UV damage.</li>
            <li>Easy, works, and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>This product says it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients, but once you really read the fine print, it has the following:    </li>
            <li>I have since found dark brown to be more suited for me in the summer months.</li>
            <li>I left it alone for the rest of the weekend, just rinsing with cool water and leaving it be until the ickiness went away.</li>
            <li>A tightness of the scalp, a persistent itchiness, and finally, a feeling of heat with some mild swelling.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to have something cover my grey</li>
            <li>I realized that this is not all natural, but it is gentler than other products and I love the ease of application.</li>
            <li>the best was chocolate and the worse is sweedish blond because it didn&#x27;t color anything not the gray nor the dark hair.</li>
            <li>Even now, without color the guy who cuts my hair is pretty much the only one who notices besides</li>
            <li>Even now, without color the guy who cuts my hair is pretty much the only one who notices besides</li>
            <li>It was a great relief to see that it didn&#x27;t damage or dry my hair in the least bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I started using the Surya haircare products, I got far less color running into the shower after shampooing, and more body.</li>
            <li>For you, the right decision may be a different one.</li>
            <li>Live this henna cream.</li>
            <li>I figured, oh well, I&#x27;ll live through it.</li>
            <li>This henna cream is easy to use and the color really last a long time.</li>
            <li>I use the Chocolate color and was afraid of it dying my gray hair too reddish, but it turned out beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Now that my hair has more grey, it seems harder to color.</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients (and it can be more or less, depending on the color you&#x27;re using) show up as moderate hazards.</li>
            <li>Color washed right out of the towels I use to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>it had the least amount of chemical in it and was most natural made my head break out...</li>
            <li>hair also feels softer and looks naturally colored compared to the chemical hair dye.</li>
            <li>If applied well, it covers gray completely and stays for about two months.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly isn&#x27;t a natural product.</li>
            <li>So far, I have gotten rave compliments and the cream covered all of my grays.  </li>
            <li>I am natural and I decided to cut my hair shorter.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and experienced a frightening rate of hair loss, until I switched from commercial hair dyes to Surya Henna.  </li>
            <li>It covers grays completely and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair at all.</li>
            <li>Shiny and natural.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll have to color your hair frequently.</li>
            <li>Any oil near hairline will prevent color from adhering&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Compliments galore, soft, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>With my extremely sensitive skin, I have had no reactions whatsoever to the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far.</li>
            <li>Red, black, various shades of brown and blonde, with the occasional fuschia or burgundy thrown in for good measure.</li>
            <li>Other henna products are not as easy to use and do not cover grey well.  </li>
            <li>The other regular brands that I used to buy in supermarkets were very toxic and made my scalp itch and burn, so this product is a very healthier option.</li>
            <li>I live in California where the sun is constantly shining.</li>
            <li>It is also does not dry my hair out and leaves it soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li>it is henna, so it is messy, and it will dye your scalp if you don&#x27;t wipe off the drips quickly.</li>
            <li>also love that it is not permanent, that it washes out slowly over a few months back to your natural color without having to strip your hair with harsh chemicals, unlike so many of the drugstore brands that are permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>and I well be doing the long tidies for REAL natural henna dye ...as soon as this dye fade from my scalp.</li>
            <li>Henna cream is much easier to use than the powder form, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li>At first it seemed I would tolerate it okay with the help of antibiotics, but continued use worsened the symptoms until I was afraid to keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it seemed I would tolerate it okay with the help of antibiotics, but continued use worsened the symptoms until I was afraid to keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is made from natural products and does not damage the hair, quite the opposite.  </li>
            <li>But, I thought it was 100% natural and left it on longer than 45 min.  </li>
            <li>I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair and I am looking for healthier and gentler coloring alternatives.</li>
            <li>The applicator bottle and cream inside were much like any other over the counter hair color.  </li>
            <li>So I started using the henna powder mixing it with hot red tea or black tea to get the color I want.</li>
            <li>I will say that the color fades rather quickly as compared to the traditional gloss I usually purchase from the drug store.  </li>
            <li>Unlike traditional hennas where you are putting an herbal paste in your hair, there was little mess with this, except a drip or two, and the excess rinsed out easily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have used Surya Henna products for about 6 months now and have found that it has quite literally transformed my hair to a much more lusterous, healthy feeling texture.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;m glad I purchased two bottles.  </li>
            <li> I receive many compliments with the Mahogany color.</li>
            <li> I love having a way to color my hair without toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I only use this brand of henna dye, it is the BEST one I have tried.</li>
            <li> I would also suggest researching the ingredients a bit more to determine whether or not you are getting the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product you think you have purchased.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have anything better to do on the weekend, I&#x27;d change my hair color.</li>
            <li> tried a couple more times after that, always having antibiotics on hand to start a couple of days before.</li>
            <li> i love the color</li>
            <li> For me, the best decision at this time is to continue use a product that is gentle, effective, and fits my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as any semi-permanent color - and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make me swell up like a Klingon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as any semi-permanent color - and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make me swell up like a Klingon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great, natural color,</li>
            <li> Love this product , it leave ls my hair looking  healthy and super shyny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really haven&#x27;t experienced fear until you&#x27;ve seen your forehead go from a mild unicorn affliction into full-blown, shut-eyed, bumpy-faced Klingon mode overnight.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This product is easily applied and covers so well that no one would even notice you had gray hair before the coloring.</li>
            <li> It went on easily and any color on my skin was easily removed with a washcloth and soap.  </li>
            <li> An easy and inexpensive alternative to pricey salon treatments.</li>
            <li> I thought application was fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> Nothing this easy to use could be.</li>
            <li> Nothing this easy to use could be.</li>
            <li> turns all my hair purple , no mater what color you use , if you want purple hair it is fine .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, healthy, natural and much better than the toxic counterparts(regular dyes) from the big brands.</li>
            <li> Great shine and conditioning even without extra conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different hair coloring products and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is a great and necessary alternative to PPD containing hair dyes.</li>
            <li> I used a SLS free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair 2-3 times a week with a SLS free shampoo and conditioner and lukewarm water.  </li>
            <li> At first I tried the chocolate which was ok</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used Surya Cream and am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> By the way, it covers my grey very nicely.</li>
            <li> Mild symptoms the first time or two, with more pronounced effect after that.</li>
            <li> Mild symptoms the first time or two, with more pronounced effect after that.</li>
            <li> make sure you really wash it out well or it will transfer to your pillow and wash your hair before applying the color (just rinse and condition).</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair super shiny...</li>
            <li> Since using this product for the first time over 4 months ago, my hair has grown tremendously!</li>
            <li> The color was absolutely perfect--a glossy chocolate brown, but with a few highlights coming through, so it looks really awesome!  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing and it covered my very grey roots easily.  </li>
            <li> and I love the soft brown color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month and needs to be touched up, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with color and processing time, but so far, I love it.</li>
            <li> My original intention was to be able to use one in the future.   </li>
            <li> However, the chocolate brown is an exact match for my natural color, it&#x27;s quick and easy, and it covers the gray.</li>
            <li> However, the chocolate brown is an exact match for my natural color, it&#x27;s quick and easy, and it covers the gray.</li>
            <li> I would truly say experiment with true Henna; this product doesn&#x27;t give the real effect of Henna.   </li>
            <li> I holed up at home for a couple of days, bugging the nurses at the clinic about how long it would take the antibiotics to take effect, until I could put neither my loving (and concerned) boyfriend nor my demanding job off another day.</li>
            <li> A great mix is Dark Brown with Golden Blonde....makes a natural brunette color.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle to my hair.</li>
            <li> I used my own shower cap as the one in the box was not much help.  </li>
            <li> The first application of this product lasted 4 1/2 weeks before I needed to recolor.  </li>
            <li> That I can really appreciate!</li>
            <li> Love this product, and got tons of compliments, even from total strangers, on my hair immediately after dying it.</li>
            <li> He advised me to be patient and it would most likely fade away...</li>
            <li> For me, that seems to be be related more to preparation than anything else (use a clarifying wash, etc).</li>
            <li> To say it wasn&#x27;t pretty is the understatement of a lifetime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hairdresser tried every exotic coloring he could get his hands on...and they all followed the same pattern.</li>
            <li> hairdresser tried every exotic coloring he could get his hands on...and they all followed the same pattern.</li>
            <li> but i think it is more like a regular dye than henna !!</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, as it&#x27;s a liquid, and you can save what you don&#x27;t use for another application or two as long as you store it in a cool place out of sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I also tried dark brown of the same brand, but I liked the chocolate color better.  </li>
            <li> For you, the right decision may be a different one.n at this time is to continue use a product that is gentle, effective, and fits my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it is more or less effective at coloring or covering grey (and I am an EXCELLENT test subject for grey!) than henna powders.</li>
            <li> It will also make an absolute mess of your towels, so after you use it be sure to avoid drying your hair with white towels, otherwise your towels will end up being a lovely henna-dye hue!</li>
            <li> My hair is more than 60 percent grey.  </li>
            <li> Many people who color their hair have no idea about the harsh chemicals in the products - Surya Henna products are all natural and safe.</li>
            <li> and I just wanted a nice black...</li>
            <li> Amazon.com price is lower than health store price, however, because of shipping charges, it does not make it beneficial unless ordering relatively large quantity of product.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> That seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> I was really worried about that.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it is sold in Whole Foods as well.  </li>
            <li> I have used real henna before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to go with the real deal and won&#x27;t reorder this version.</li>
            <li> This was shipped out in a very timely manner...</li>
            <li> This product included cheap plastic gloves that tore as soon as I put my fingers in; an oversized, no-form plastic cap when a regular shower cap would have sufficed; and the color on the gray washed out during the rinse.</li>
            <li> conditioner help to seal in the color, as I was told it would, although they do not give as much shine as I get with RenPure Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner from Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try a more natural hair color and decided on this brand.  </li>
            <li> What I do love about it is that it gives my gray highlights ( I have a natural red undertone)</li>
            <li> Then, about 15 years ago I used a popular drugstore brand (no names, they&#x27;re no different than any other) to go a gorgeous sunset red and about 6 hours after application, I had open, running sores on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have naturally brown mousy hair, and I chose Mahogany, and it left my hair a lovely dark red-brown with lovely reddish highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for using an all natural product on my hair which produces more natural results than most dyes and protects my hair from UV damage.</li>
            <li> Easy, works, and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> This product says it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients, but once you really read the fine print, it has the following:    </li>
            <li> I have since found dark brown to be more suited for me in the summer months.</li>
            <li> I left it alone for the rest of the weekend, just rinsing with cool water and leaving it be until the ickiness went away.</li>
            <li> A tightness of the scalp, a persistent itchiness, and finally, a feeling of heat with some mild swelling.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to have something cover my grey</li>
            <li> I realized that this is not all natural, but it is gentler than other products and I love the ease of application.</li>
            <li> the best was chocolate and the worse is sweedish blond because it didn&#x27;t color anything not the gray nor the dark hair.</li>
            <li> Even now, without color the guy who cuts my hair is pretty much the only one who notices besides</li>
            <li> Even now, without color the guy who cuts my hair is pretty much the only one who notices besides</li>
            <li> It was a great relief to see that it didn&#x27;t damage or dry my hair in the least bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I started using the Surya haircare products, I got far less color running into the shower after shampooing, and more body.</li>
            <li> For you, the right decision may be a different one.</li>
            <li> Live this henna cream.</li>
            <li> I figured, oh well, I&#x27;ll live through it.</li>
            <li> This henna cream is easy to use and the color really last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use the Chocolate color and was afraid of it dying my gray hair too reddish, but it turned out beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Now that my hair has more grey, it seems harder to color.</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients (and it can be more or less, depending on the color you&#x27;re using) show up as moderate hazards.</li>
            <li> Color washed right out of the towels I use to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> it had the least amount of chemical in it and was most natural made my head break out...</li>
            <li> hair also feels softer and looks naturally colored compared to the chemical hair dye.</li>
            <li> If applied well, it covers gray completely and stays for about two months.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly isn&#x27;t a natural product.</li>
            <li> So far, I have gotten rave compliments and the cream covered all of my grays.  </li>
            <li> I am natural and I decided to cut my hair shorter.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and experienced a frightening rate of hair loss, until I switched from commercial hair dyes to Surya Henna.  </li>
            <li> It covers grays completely and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair at all.</li>
            <li> Shiny and natural.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll have to color your hair frequently.</li>
            <li> Any oil near hairline will prevent color from adhering&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Compliments galore, soft, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> With my extremely sensitive skin, I have had no reactions whatsoever to the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far.</li>
            <li> Red, black, various shades of brown and blonde, with the occasional fuschia or burgundy thrown in for good measure.</li>
            <li> Other henna products are not as easy to use and do not cover grey well.  </li>
            <li> The other regular brands that I used to buy in supermarkets were very toxic and made my scalp itch and burn, so this product is a very healthier option.</li>
            <li> I live in California where the sun is constantly shining.</li>
            <li> It is also does not dry my hair out and leaves it soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li> it is henna, so it is messy, and it will dye your scalp if you don&#x27;t wipe off the drips quickly.</li>
            <li> also love that it is not permanent, that it washes out slowly over a few months back to your natural color without having to strip your hair with harsh chemicals, unlike so many of the drugstore brands that are permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> and I well be doing the long tidies for REAL natural henna dye ...as soon as this dye fade from my scalp.</li>
            <li> Henna cream is much easier to use than the powder form, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li> At first it seemed I would tolerate it okay with the help of antibiotics, but continued use worsened the symptoms until I was afraid to keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it seemed I would tolerate it okay with the help of antibiotics, but continued use worsened the symptoms until I was afraid to keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is made from natural products and does not damage the hair, quite the opposite.  </li>
            <li> But, I thought it was 100% natural and left it on longer than 45 min.  </li>
            <li> I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair and I am looking for healthier and gentler coloring alternatives.</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle and cream inside were much like any other over the counter hair color.  </li>
            <li> So I started using the henna powder mixing it with hot red tea or black tea to get the color I want.</li>
            <li> I will say that the color fades rather quickly as compared to the traditional gloss I usually purchase from the drug store.  </li>
            <li> Unlike traditional hennas where you are putting an herbal paste in your hair, there was little mess with this, except a drip or two, and the excess rinsed out easily.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I visited our local Sally beauty supply and bought a hair coloring brush and coloring caps, plus professional gloves.  </li>
            <li> However, it is SO much easier to apply, rinse out, and generally use that it is hard to go back to the powders and the several hours of unpleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Henna on my hair because I have very thin, brittle hair and most dyes damage my hair, causing breaks.     </li>
            <li> but it left me with grey hair that was now chocolate</li>
            <li> I applied to dry hair, but think the next time I will try with damp hair.</li>
            <li> I will update my review after I see how long the color lasts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Several people, particularly a few years ago, mentioned the toxicity and lack of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not entirely natural.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not entirely natural.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I need to rinse my hair with water and vinegar the first time I apply the Henna and at the time I have to rinse the color from my scalp in order to fix the color because every time I wash my hair it loses a lot of color down the drain...</li>
            <li> I left the color on for 60 minutes due to gray coverage and rinsed thoroughly in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Only draw back is, my shower water is always a little tinted as the dye washes out, week after week.</li>
            <li> my whole nape area was blueish black!!!</li>
            <li> I have dry, relaxed color treated hair, and for some reason I have lots of greys on my hair line and on my temples.  </li>
            <li> She prefers this because it doesn&#x27;t dry her hair</li>
            <li> I actually mixed the chocolate with the dark brown that I already had</li>
            <li> This has happened twice and the third time, I had it on less than 45 min</li>
            <li> I always have a slight staining on my towels even over a month later.  </li>
            <li> I stopped by the emergency clinic on the way home from work and was told I had probably developed an infection secondary to my allergic reaction to the color.</li>
            <li> I even got my hair wet at the pool and did not have any issues.  </li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s not much).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recommended it to quite a few people who don&#x27;t want to use chemicals in their hair, and I forgot the color was in my hair one day as I got caught up cleaning the house and realized that 3-4 hrs later the cream was still in my hair.</li>
            <li> Grace, in Surya customer service, told me: &amp;#34;Wash your hair, remove all oils from scalp and skin, towel dry hair minimally, work product through with fingers, don&#x27;t comb it through (removes color from roots and makes ends too dark).</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair and use about half a bottle for each coloring.  </li>
            <li> But, no messier than any other hair color.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other permanent colors that stain.</li>
            <li> If you search on any of these synthetic dyes, they are pretty scary.     </li>
            <li> I did one other step besides what was recommended by the company -</li>
            <li> I began to have sharp shooting pains all over my body- almost like someone pricking me with a pin.  </li>
            <li> I too started out by putting the Henna Cream on dry hair, with messy results.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to conventional chemical dyes..</li>
            <li> For those reviews that say it is not 100% henna, perhaps they are correct, but I will tell you that natural henna is not only messy, smelly and inconvenient, but it made my hair turn green on several occasions.</li>
            <li> Mine is Dark brown \\&quot; chocolate \\&quot; with premature gray hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the delivery isn&#x27;t always timely after you order.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, it is the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly below collar length.  </li>
            <li> Disperse Black    </li>
            <li> I used the black dye Surya Henna.</li>
            <li> I was loosing my hair and now am experiencing a slight regrowth.  </li>
            <li> I would equate this product with Jazzing in Black Cherry.  </li>
            <li> You can use this product as often as needed without worrying about negative long term effects on your health.  </li>
            <li> I tried calling the company, but they are down in Brazil and my portugese is pretty lousy!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dark black...</li>
            <li> Then I tried the dark brown and tada!</li>
            <li> It seems that the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; claims of this product are a little iffy.  </li>
            <li> Just a little pointy bit in-between my eyes, like I was sprouting a unicorn horn.</li>
            <li> The process is messy.  </li>
            <li> and I still scrub my nape everyday with a clarifying shampoo and it has just started to fade some.</li>
            <li> and ... it dried my scalp out...</li>
            <li> my scalp flakes everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few compliments with this product</li>
            <li> Clearly that isn&#x27;t a guarantee for anyone else, but - the one reaction I had to a henna product was caused by the completely natural essential fir needle oil that I added in to try to cover up the absolutely dreadful smell of one of the powder products.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair with a few grays sprinkled in and I used the Chocolate color.  </li>
            <li> woke up at 3 in the morning with my eyes swelled shut and my face resembling nothing less than a Klingon!</li>
            <li> Henna does cover the gray hair well and does not leave a hard to remove residue as with other products.</li>
            <li> Pull the cap down over hairline, clip it, and wait at least 60 minutes</li>
            <li> Semi-permanent is hard to get used to because of the wash out, but it beats having gray hair for 9 months.</li>
            <li> I had to leave it at least 7 hours on my head..</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair since my late teens and I am now in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t care for was how thick the product was.  </li>
            <li> I found that the consistency was rather thick</li>
            <li> In the mean time I have been wearing wigs and another thing...</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than the chemical Schwartzkopf dyes from expensive salons which always faded to nothing in less than a month.</li>
            <li> even some really expensive stuff that I purchased once that touted</li>
            <li> and I hate to destroy my hair with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I saw a review of this product on youtube when I was desperate to find a hair color that would cover up my awful grey hair.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would bleed out into the pool, but no issues.</li>
            <li> the color has already faded and it looks like dirty muddy brown and my grays are a tinsel tangerine  orange and..</li>
            <li> I now have to recolor my hair, but I won&#x27;t use this crap again.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this product , it leave ls my hair looking  healthy and super shyny.</li>
            <li> Great product to use while pregnant. Semi-permanent is hard to get used to because of the wash out, but it beats having gray hair for 9 months. Color washed right out of the towels I use to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I saw a review of this product on youtube when I was desperate to find a hair color that would cover up my awful grey hair.  I have dry, relaxed color treated hair, and for some reason I have lots of greys on my hair line and on my temples.  At first I tried the chocolate which was ok but it left me with grey hair that was now chocolate, it looked ok and did the job.  Then I tried the dark brown and tada! it covered everything nicely.  I dont use heat on the color so I dont know if it could have come out more brown, but I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to conventional chemical dyes..even some really expensive stuff that I purchased once that touted it had the least amount of chemical in it and was most natural made my head break out...but Surya Henna does not. For those reviews that say it is not 100% henna, perhaps they are correct, but I will tell you that natural henna is not only messy, smelly and inconvenient, but it made my hair turn green on several occasions. Surya Liquid Henna is the closest thing to perfect...even though it has to stay on my head for 60 minutes minimum to cover the gray...it works. It also makes my hair super shiny...people stop me on the street all the time and ask what I have in my hair. I no longer have to use product to make my hair healthy looking...just Surya Liquid Henna. Should get 10 stars!</li>
            <li> my mom uses this product to color her hair. She prefers this because it doesn&#x27;t dry her hair afterward.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair also feels softer and looks naturally colored compared to the chemical hair dye. She is very satisfied in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  My hair is more than 60 percent grey.  My hair is slightly below collar length.  I used 1 1/2 bottles of chocolate surya.  The process is messy.  But, no messier than any other hair color.  If anything gets on the sink, you, ect. It washes off easily with soap and water. Unlike other permanent colors that stain. I applied to dry hair, but think the next time I will try with damp hair. After reading other reviews, I visited our local Sally beauty supply and bought a hair coloring brush and coloring caps, plus professional gloves.  The color is amazing and it covered my very grey roots easily.  Great shine and conditioning even without extra conditioner.  Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> This henna cream is easy to use and the color really last a long time. It is also does not dry my hair out and leaves it soft and shiney.  My hair is collar length and I can get two uses from one box. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Since using this product for the first time over 4 months ago, my hair has grown tremendously! My hair is also shiny and very healthy. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different hair coloring products and this is by far the best.  It is made from natural products and does not damage the hair, quite the opposite.  This product is easily applied and covers so well that no one would even notice you had gray hair before the coloring. If applied well, it covers gray completely and stays for about two months.  I have medium long hair and use about half a bottle for each coloring.  Ever since I bought this product, I stopped going to hair salon.  I also tried dark brown of the same brand, but I liked the chocolate color better.  Other henna products are not as easy to use and do not cover grey well.  Since I started using this product, I get a lot of compliments on how shiny my hair is.  I use pantene ProV conditioner with it, it makes hair even better looking.  Amazingly, if gets on skin, on the floor, or sink, it is easily removed with water/soap, but stays well on hair.  I purchased this product for all my relatives who have gray hair and this is the only color all of them are using now.  Amazon.com price is lower than health store price, however, because of shipping charges, it does not make it beneficial unless ordering relatively large quantity of product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this henna cream for the last three years. It is very gentle to my hair. Mine is Dark brown \\&quot; chocolate \\&quot; with premature gray hair. I don&#x27;t like to see gray hair and I hate to destroy my hair with chemicals. So I started using the henna powder mixing it with hot red tea or black tea to get the color I want. I had to leave it at least 7 hours on my head.. this is when I started looking for a henna that stays only 1 hour and I found this beautiful henna cream it doesn&#x27;t itch it doesn&#x27;t burn stays 45 min on hair and then wash. I tried the chocolate, red , mahogany and sweedish blond. the best was chocolate and the worse is sweedish blond because it didn&#x27;t color anything not the gray nor the dark hair. but the chocolate was the best for my hair.. I love it :)</li>
            <li> Great, natural color, texture smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, healthy, natural and much better than the toxic counterparts(regular dyes) from the big brands.The other regular brands that I used to buy in supermarkets were very toxic and made my scalp itch and burn, so this product is a very healthier option. The only problem is that I need to rinse my hair with water and vinegar the first time I apply the Henna and at the time I have to rinse the color from my scalp in order to fix the color because every time I wash my hair it loses a lot of color down the drain...but like I said I am very happy with Surya Henna.</li>
            <li> This product says it&#x27;s made from all natural ingredients, but once you really read the fine print, it has the following:    May contain the following:  HC Blue 2  HC Yellow 5  HC Red 3  HC Yellow 2  HC Yellow 4  HC Red 1  Disperse Violet 1  HC Violet 14 D  Disperse Black    So basically you are putting a bunch of synthetic dyes on your head. If you search on any of these synthetic dyes, they are pretty scary.     The product does a nice job of coloring your hair....but it certainly isn&#x27;t a natural product. I tried calling the company, but they are down in Brazil and my portugese is pretty lousy!</li>
            <li> This is a great and necessary alternative to PPD containing hair dyes. You can use this product as often as needed without worrying about negative long term effects on your health.  Thank goodness for this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this henna cream after doing a lot of research.  I have colored my hair since my late teens and I am now in my 40&#x27;s.  I have about 25% gray hair and had to stop coloring on the recommendation of my dermatologist.  I have scalp psoriasis and the chemicals in my hair color were causing severe issues with my scalp.  I finally decided to try a more natural hair color and decided on this brand.  I figured it could not hurt to try it out.  I was amazed.  The applicator bottle and cream inside were much like any other over the counter hair color.  It went on easily and any color on my skin was easily removed with a washcloth and soap.  I used my own shower cap as the one in the box was not much help.  I left the color on for 60 minutes due to gray coverage and rinsed thoroughly in the shower.  I did one other step besides what was recommended by the company - I also shampooed after the color and before conditioning my hair to make sure I got all the residual color out of my hair.  I used a SLS free shampoo and conditioner.  So far, I have gotten rave compliments and the cream covered all of my grays.  I use the Chocolate color and was afraid of it dying my gray hair too reddish, but it turned out beautiful.  I will update my review after I see how long the color lasts.  Update 6/8/15 - The first application of this product lasted 4 1/2 weeks before I needed to recolor.  I may have gotten another week out of it, but had my hair washed at the salon for a haircut.  It stripped all this hair color out.  I wash my hair 2-3 times a week with a SLS free shampoo and conditioner and lukewarm water.  That seems to work really well.  I have used this color again and no noticeable issues with my scalp psoriasis.  I even got my hair wet at the pool and did not have any issues.  I was really worried about that.  I got splashed by my daugther repeatedly for 1 hour and no change to my hair color.  I was afraid it would bleed out into the pool, but no issues.</li>
            <li> I used this product about three weeks ago, and it is by far the best henna product I have ever used.  It goes on easy, as it&#x27;s a liquid, and you can save what you don&#x27;t use for another application or two as long as you store it in a cool place out of sunlight.  Unlike traditional hennas where you are putting an herbal paste in your hair, there was little mess with this, except a drip or two, and the excess rinsed out easily.  It didn&#x27;t leave a stain on my pillowcase like some products, either.  The color was absolutely perfect--a glossy chocolate brown, but with a few highlights coming through, so it looks really awesome!  I LOVE IT.  This is going to be my henna of choice from now on!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the label as well as I should.  I was so excited to have something cover my grey and it worked better than most things.  But, I thought it was 100% natural and left it on longer than 45 min.  I began to have sharp shooting pains all over my body- almost like someone pricking me with a pin.  This has happened twice and the third time, I had it on less than 45 min and after that, I threw the product in the trash.  I can&#x27;t believe it is sold in Whole Foods as well.  It needs to have a warning.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> This covers all the grays! An easy and inexpensive alternative to pricey salon treatments. I leave it on longer than suggested (90 min) for darker brown color). Now I use the chocolate color.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best natural hair colors on the market. I am paying exorbitant shipping fees just to have it shipped to Germany!</li>
            <li> I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair and I am looking for healthier and gentler coloring alternatives. I have used real henna before and I love it, but mixing it is cumbersome, so I thought that I would try this premixed henna. I realized that this is not all natural, but it is gentler than other products and I love the ease of application. I actually mixed the chocolate with the dark brown that I already had and I love the soft brown color. By the way, it covers my grey very nicely. It&#x27;s been about a month and needs to be touched up, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Good color and longevity but most of all, SAFE TO USE. Many people who color their hair have no idea about the harsh chemicals in the products - Surya Henna products are all natural and safe. That I can really appreciate!</li>
            <li> Love this product, and got tons of compliments, even from total strangers, on my hair immediately after dying it. I have naturally brown mousy hair, and I chose Mahogany, and it left my hair a lovely dark red-brown with lovely reddish highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it is not permanent, that it washes out slowly over a few months back to your natural color without having to strip your hair with harsh chemicals, unlike so many of the drugstore brands that are permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback--it is henna, so it is messy, and it will dye your scalp if you don&#x27;t wipe off the drips quickly. It will also make an absolute mess of your towels, so after you use it be sure to avoid drying your hair with white towels, otherwise your towels will end up being a lovely henna-dye hue!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Live this henna cream.</li>
            <li> the colour is awesome and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This dye stained my scalp. I am natural and I decided to cut my hair shorter. After the Barber cut my hair real low at the nape ... he asked me what was the stains on the my nape area. I got a mirror and looked. I could not believe my eyes... my whole nape area was blueish black!!! I used the black dye Surya Henna. I went home and I scrubbed  and scrubbed my nape and the stains did not move one bit. I use apple cider, olive oil... clarifying shampoos, dawn dish detergent and was about to use hydrogen peroxide  until my husband stopped the 4 day madness. He advised me to be patient and it would most likely fade away... thank God he is my voice of reason... lol However its been 2 weeks and I still scrub my nape everyday with a clarifying shampoo and it has just started to fade some. In the mean time I have been wearing wigs and another thing... the color has already faded and it looks like dirty muddy brown and my grays are a tinsel tangerine  orange and.. and ... it dried my scalp out... my scalp flakes everyday. Ummmm NEVER AGAIN!!!  My hair is naturally very dark black... with 10-15 % gray... and I just wanted a nice black... I have never done henna before so I went with this and thought it would be fool proof... well I can report I was the fool...lol Since this mishap... I have been carefully studying all natural henna and indigo... and I well be doing the long tidies for REAL natural henna dye ...as soon as this dye fade from my scalp. I say dont cut corners and try this... your hair and scalp well mostly likely thank you later.... Just my 2 cent ..lol</li>
            <li> I have used Surya Henna products for about 6 months now and have found that it has quite literally transformed my hair to a much more lusterous, healthy feeling texture. I was loosing my hair and now am experiencing a slight regrowth.  I hope the change in my scalp reverses the hair loss I previously experienced.  I am 61 years old and experienced a frightening rate of hair loss, until I switched from commercial hair dyes to Surya Henna.  My only complaint is the delivery isn&#x27;t always timely after you order.  However, I am hoping that will be remedied soon.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used Surya Cream and am so pleased with the results. I use Henna on my hair because I have very thin, brittle hair and most dyes damage my hair, causing breaks.     I live in California where the sun is constantly shining. Using Henna on my hair protects it from UV damage. The added benefit of Henna is, instead of a solid coat of color on your hair, it takes my (ever increasing) grays and tints them. I look like I have highlights! My gray hair now looks like cooper strands blended with chestnut hair.    Since using Henna, I receive compliments and inquiries into \\&quot;where I get my hair done.\\&quot; Surya cream is so easy to use and gives great results. Only draw back is, my shower water is always a little tinted as the dye washes out, week after week. But I have NOT noticed the dye coming off on my pillows or clothes, just the hair towel (and it&#x27;s not much). But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for using an all natural product on my hair which produces more natural results than most dyes and protects my hair from UV damage.</li>
            <li> Henna cream is much easier to use than the powder form, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  Loved the color, though!</li>
            <li> I never review anything until I realized how helpful they are.  I purchased this product based on reviews and hmmm....i guess some were happier than I.    Tried this product last night and here&#x27;s my thoughts.    Deposited color nicely and covered the gray well!  The only downside is the red stained scalp.  I would equate this product with Jazzing in Black Cherry.  Basically save the money and shipping and purchase the Jazzing for $4.00 it provides the same depth of color and it&#x27;s a rinse as well.    What I didn&#x27;t care for was how thick the product was.  Honestly I&#x27;m glad I purchased two bottles.  My original intention was to be able to use one in the future.   However, I ended up needed both!  My hair is currently in a short flip, so longer hair would need 4 bottles and beyond!!    I would truly say experiment with true Henna; this product doesn&#x27;t give the real effect of Henna.   I&#x27;ve decided to go with the real deal and won&#x27;t reorder this version.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments with the Mahogany color. Now that my hair has more grey, it seems harder to color. Does it matter if you keep this product in your hair longer to get a deeper color all over?</li>
            <li> This was shipped out in a very timely manner...I like this product a lot im going to keep using it....color was just what it said..</li>
            <li> This product included cheap plastic gloves that tore as soon as I put my fingers in; an oversized, no-form plastic cap when a regular shower cap would have sufficed; and the color on the gray washed out during the rinse. I now have to recolor my hair, but I won&#x27;t use this crap again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this surya henna for years now.  Best non chemical dye there is out there!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful semi-permanent color. It covers grays completely and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair at all. Shiny and natural.</li>
            <li> the only thing I will use to color my hair!!</li>
            <li> Of course this is not a permanent color so you&#x27;ll have to color your hair frequently. What I do love about it is that it gives my gray highlights ( I have a natural red undertone) are a brilliant golden brown. I&#x27;ve had quite a few compliments with this product and I&#x27;ve recommended it to quite a few people who don&#x27;t want to use chemicals in their hair, and I forgot the color was in my hair one day as I got caught up cleaning the house and realized that 3-4 hrs later the cream was still in my hair. It was a great relief to see that it didn&#x27;t damage or dry my hair in the least bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you really wash it out well or it will transfer to your pillow and wash your hair before applying the color (just rinse and condition).</li>
            <li> I too started out by putting the Henna Cream on dry hair, with messy results. Grace, in Surya customer service, told me: &amp;#34;Wash your hair, remove all oils from scalp and skin, towel dry hair minimally, work product through with fingers, don&#x27;t comb it through (removes color from roots and makes ends too dark). Pull the cap down over hairline, clip it, and wait at least 60 minutes (I go 1/1/2 hours). Any oil near hairline will prevent color from adhering&amp;#34;. A great mix is Dark Brown with Golden Blonde....makes a natural brunette color. I&#x27;m still experimenting with color and processing time, but so far, I love it. It lasts longer than the chemical Schwartzkopf dyes from expensive salons which always faded to nothing in less than a month. Compliments galore, soft, shiny hair. Gray becomes highlights. Surya&#x27;s Color Fixation shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner help to seal in the color, as I was told it would, although they do not give as much shine as I get with RenPure Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner from Rite Aid. When I started using the Surya haircare products, I got far less color running into the shower after shampooing, and more body. Henna Cream is a wonderful product, just keep experimenting with application and colors  until you get it right. I&#x27;m trying Chocolate next.</li>
            <li> Henna does cover the gray hair well and does not leave a hard to remove residue as with other products. It is temporary coverage. I sweat a lot and so have to reapply when I wash my hair. I still like the product as it reduces the coverage attempts I have to make in between washes. (My gray hair is  concentrated in the front of my head.)</li>
            <li> I love having a way to color my hair without toxic chemicals. I have since found dark brown to be more suited for me in the summer months. Thank you for a beauty product that I can feel good about!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna to dye my hair for about the last 18 months, and I&#x27;ve used the Surya Brasil product several times. Hands down, it is the easiest to apply. I don&#x27;t find that it is more or less effective at coloring or covering grey (and I am an EXCELLENT test subject for grey!) than henna powders. For me, that seems to be be related more to preparation than anything else (use a clarifying wash, etc). However, it is SO much easier to apply, rinse out, and generally use that it is hard to go back to the powders and the several hours of unpleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several people, particularly a few years ago, mentioned the toxicity and lack of natural ingredients. Some of the ingredients specifically called out no longer show on the ingredient list at all; it looks like the company heard and listened. I also checked out the current ingredients on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Database; the majority of the ingredients are listed as low or no hazard. Some of the ingredients (and it can be more or less, depending on the color you&#x27;re using) show up as moderate hazards. However, everything that I looked up was a hazard for sensitivity and allergens, rather than for toxicity or cancer risks. Nothing showed cumulative effects over time, either. All the hazards were also based on the amount used and the amount of exposure. With my extremely sensitive skin, I have had no reactions whatsoever to the product. Clearly that isn&#x27;t a guarantee for anyone else, but - the one reaction I had to a henna product was caused by the completely natural essential fir needle oil that I added in to try to cover up the absolutely dreadful smell of one of the powder products. Turns out I&#x27;m allergic, and days of burning red ears convinced me never to go that route again. For the record, fir needle oil is listed as 0 hazard on the Skin Deep Database. Everyone needs to make good decisions for their health and sustainability - but that means making informed, balanced decisions. For me, the best decision at this time is to continue use a product that is gentle, effective, and fits my busy lifestyle. For you, the right decision may be a different one.n at this time is to continue use a product that is gentle, effective, and fits my busy lifestyle.

            <li> my mom got her henna cream  cheaper here i believe and it has worked the same!</li>
            <li> This is the best henna dye I have ever used. Easy, works, and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out. I only use this brand of henna dye, it is the BEST one I have tried.</li>
            <li> It seems that the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; claims of this product are a little iffy.  Since I have not researched this myself, I will stick to reviewing the quality of the product.  I have medium brown hair with a few grays sprinkled in and I used the Chocolate color.  I thought application was fairly easy.  I ditched the skinny applicator and just dumped the product into my gloved hands, rubbed them together and applied the product.  I found that the consistency was rather thick so it did not drip out of my palms.  The color turned out very nice and shiny and the gray coverage was very good.  I will say that the color fades rather quickly as compared to the traditional gloss I usually purchase from the drug store.  I always have a slight staining on my towels even over a month later.  I would recommend this product but warn that re-application may be needed every month for best results.  I would also suggest researching the ingredients a bit more to determine whether or not you are getting the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product you think you have purchased.</li>
            <li> I used to color my hair with any drugstore color - and I&#x27;d color on a whim. If I didn&#x27;t have anything better to do on the weekend, I&#x27;d change my hair color. Red, black, various shades of brown and blonde, with the occasional fuschia or burgundy thrown in for good measure. Then, about 15 years ago I used a popular drugstore brand (no names, they&#x27;re no different than any other) to go a gorgeous sunset red and about 6 hours after application, I had open, running sores on my scalp. I figured, oh well, I&#x27;ll live through it. I left it alone for the rest of the weekend, just rinsing with cool water and leaving it be until the ickiness went away. Then, three days later, my forehead started to swell a bit. Just a little pointy bit in-between my eyes, like I was sprouting a unicorn horn. I stopped by the emergency clinic on the way home from work and was told I had probably developed an infection secondary to my allergic reaction to the color. They gave me a script for antibiotics and sent me home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up at 3 in the morning with my eyes swelled shut and my face resembling nothing less than a Klingon! I holed up at home for a couple of days, bugging the nurses at the clinic about how long it would take the antibiotics to take effect, until I could put neither my loving (and concerned) boyfriend nor my demanding job off another day. At that point, I called the clinic and insisted on immediate relief. They gave me a course of Prednisone to take the swelling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really haven&#x27;t experienced fear until you&#x27;ve seen your forehead go from a mild unicorn affliction into full-blown, shut-eyed, bumpy-faced Klingon mode overnight. To say it wasn&#x27;t pretty is the understatement of a lifetime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a couple more times after that, always having antibiotics on hand to start a couple of days before. The symptoms persisted, although lessened by my precaution. A tightness of the scalp, a persistent itchiness, and finally, a feeling of heat with some mild swelling. At first it seemed I would tolerate it okay with the help of antibiotics, but continued use worsened the symptoms until I was afraid to keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser tried every exotic coloring he could get his hands on...and they all followed the same pattern. Mild symptoms the first time or two, with more pronounced effect after that. I resigned myself to a colorless life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray to cover up. Even now, without color the guy who cuts my hair is pretty much the only one who notices besides me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I missed the pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this product about 10 years ago. I know it&#x27;s not entirely natural. Nothing this easy to use could be. However, the chocolate brown is an exact match for my natural color, it&#x27;s quick and easy, and it covers the gray. It lasts as long as any semi-permanent color - and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make me swell up like a Klingon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far. Fingers crossed. Truth is, at this point in life, if it stops working, I&#x27;ll just make peace with the gray. Until then, I&#x27;m a Surya Henna fan.ld swelling.

            <li> i love the color but i think it is more like a regular dye than henna !!&lt;br /&gt;thanks i like it as a dye</li>
