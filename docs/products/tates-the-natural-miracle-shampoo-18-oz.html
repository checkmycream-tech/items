            <li>GREAT products.</li>
            <li>, my hair feels so great after using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to those chemical-filled shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Would be great for children.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s please stop writing things like \\&quot;This is a great alternative to those chemical-filled shampoos\\</li>
            <li>The product is great and purchasing on Amazon, I&#x27;m buying from a store, not the Tate company.</li>
            <li>In checking around, I learned the attacks are from disgruntled employees of Tate&#x27;s, not the stores selling this great shampoo.</li>
            <li>SMELLS GREAT TO....</li>
            <li>Would not use anything but Tate&#x27;s Shampoo, and their conditioner is great also.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself is very nice to use at home</li>
            <li>However, to stay frugal it is best used more for washing your hair than your dishes.</li>
            <li>:-P</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t find as many uses for it as the matching conditioner, but it&#x27;s still a wonderful product</li>
            <li>The almond scent is pleasant, too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good sized bottle</li>
            <li>It has so many incredible uses as well.</li>
            <li>it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>is it really as good as it says it is?</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair squeaky clean (literally) and lathers wonderfully.</li>
            <li>So I decided to order the shampoo and conditioner after reading so many great reviews.    </li>
            <li>Please read labels and do your own research, stay informed and make good decisions about what you use on your body.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo, but it isn&#x27;t just my shampoo!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said - this shampoo messed up my healthy hair like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!</li>
            <li>With so many products made in China, let&#x27;s support America made products!</li>
            <li>I will be adding mine to the others soon, however, I feel that something with greater ramification must be done!</li>
            <li>Despite the issue with the ingredients list, this shampoo and conditioner are amazing.</li>
            <li>After one shampoo I am absolutely thrilled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works great, smells great and Is so natural.</li>
            <li>It is very strong with the scent of almond extract.</li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve found on the market so far!</li>
            <li>I can think of many, many charges he will be up against!</li>
            <li>A very good gentle body wash, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who likes a mild pleasant almond scent.  </li>
            <li>it smells great and leaves my hair feeling so clean and full of body.  </li>
            <li>but my hair looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>but now it looks even better and all I had to do is wash and condition it.</li>
            <li>I even love the almond scent.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I hope the company continues to manufacture it for many years.     </li>
            <li>I would love to hear from others who have switched to Tates.</li>
            <li>Many products these days are advertised as \\&quot;All Natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;Certified Organic\\</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it at Amazon</li>
            <li>Be sure to also try their conditioner, which has many applications besides use on hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll fall in love with it</li>
            <li>The way in which Tate uses its ingredients may be perfectly innocent.</li>
            <li>Ok, so what form of raspberries?</li>
            <li>Check out this link if you want more info.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is not the Tate&#x27;s I know and love.</li>
            <li>Many complaints about the company, but I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is WAY better.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients of this brand of shampoo and the way it works with my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years:)</li>
            <li>I have used as a shampoo and skin wash (face and upper body) and it cleans perfectly well.</li>
            <li>was able to help me.</li>
            <li>have used Tate&#x27;s shampoo for years want to make sure that I get the product that I ordered, as well as others.</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Go to the BBB website for more information.</li>
            <li>Many complaints have been made to the BBB.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products ever.</li>
            <li>I spoke with the company &amp;#34;Tate&#x27;s&amp;#34; and ordered two more bottles from them</li>
            <li>Love love the Tate&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great for gentle face wash too</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shine and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li>Apples, mango, rose, orange, aloe, eucalyptus and about thirty other wonderful sounding things in the wipes alone.</li>
            <li>I rest easy knowing all of the ingredients are plant-based and easy to recognize! :)</li>
            <li>Aside from the high price, this product is \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; great.</li>
            <li>Clean, safe, good ingredients, smells simple and great price.  </li>
            <li>This is the single best product on the market today.</li>
            <li>And unlike similar products, its very good at each thing.</li>
            <li>I also got the shampoo/face wash/body wash, which smells lightly of almonds and also washes windows and more.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect results this good.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very clean...very good as a body wash too.</li>
            <li>The conditioner among other things, is an excellent lotion for face and body, a lip balm, a cuticle cream, baby lotion, make up remover, etc.</li>
            <li>The smell is overwhelming almond (original Tate&#x27;s does not have this,</li>
            <li>(I really like the scent myself, it is kind of refreshing and cheerful.)</li>
            <li>but my hair is still baby fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>Product is fine and works for the uses intended.  </li>
            <li>This product has a deep and pleasant almond scent, a refreshing alternative to perfume-laden shampoos.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, too; similar to almond oil.</li>
            <li>The scent of the shampoo is light - yes, sort of like bubble gum.</li>
            <li>But please, let&#x27;s move beyond the naivety of believing the label they have so craftily provided us.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this, it smelled pretty nice (like almonds) and worked fine.</li>
            <li>well worth it in my book!</li>
            <li>When asked about the rich lather, they insisted it was just the combination of the remaining ingredients on the label.</li>
            <li>much clean anything with it.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean</li>
            <li>It is lovely, safe, natural and everyone needs to try it.</li>
            <li>which subsides to reveal the true chemical smell of the underlying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just love this for my whole family and have given it as a gift for new-born babies.</li>
            <li>I saw this pic and really wanted the pump top.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also great as a lotion and make-up remover, among other things.  </li>
            <li>Tate&#x27;s quickly replaced defective pumps on my bottles, too, at no charge, after I emailed them about the problem.    </li>
            <li>My hair feels sleek and silky right down to the ends again, full of body, shiny, and I didn&#x27;t even have to blow-dry it for it to fall beautifully.</li>
            <li>While traveling, I ran across this shampoo in a health products store, and decided to take a chance on it despite its high price (more than listed here.)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone that does not want to use so many chemicals on hair.</li>
            <li>A green, safe, healthy line of products that works better than the rest.</li>
            <li>I had a much longer detailed review, however Amazon chose not to publish it.  </li>
            <li>Tate&#x27;s isn&#x27;t cheap by any means, but many products do double, triple zipple duty.</li>
            <li>, it is defintely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Very wholesome &amp; natural, but also effective.</li>
            <li>I am in search of natural self care products and ALMOST fell in love with the ingredients list until I read that it contains cocamide dea.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I love Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle Conditioner.</li>
            <li>The lather fades quickly, however, so scrub fast!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use very many shampoos, they&#x27;re all too harsh, but this is more gentle than baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also use the conditioner which doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all, but leaves it incredibly silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Tate&#x27;s for all of your special products.  </li>
            <li>It is light, and pretty much disappears into you skin/lips/rough feet, where it really works wonders.</li>
            <li>While \\&quot;lots and lots of love\\&quot; is a cute ingredient, I would also like to know exactly what the other ingredients are, so there is a level of trust you have to give the company to enjoy this</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I got the toothpaste, which I like a lot Most commercial toothpaste burns my mouth, but tate&#x27;s cleans without pain.</li>
            <li>This bottle also has cocomide dea noted as an ingredient which was not listed online as an ingredient and which was not listed on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I will source it again from my first supplier.</li>
            <li>[...]    Please be aware that the FDA does not pre-approve cosmetic labeling.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer points out, the legality of the ingredient label claims is questionable at best.</li>
            <li>(it did me at first).</li>
            <li>She emailed me a return label, refunded the purchase price and told me she would make the warehouse and shipping dept. aware of the problem.</li>
            <li>The real ingredients are chemicals!</li>
            <li>Sure enough!</li>
            <li>However, this was the first time purchasing on Amazon and not on their website.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Tate&#x27;s product that you will buy from the supplier or from the retailer or company itself!</li>
            <li>No multiple products, what more could one ask for.</li>
            <li>I got the nail polish remover, which unlike other supposedly scent free, acetone free removers actually doesn&#x27;t smell, and works much more quickly than like anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, beats the hell out of the huge bottle of OPI remover I recently bought.</li>
            <li>but it was more natural and less overwhelming)</li>
            <li>It is such a light and gentle hair wash and my hair feels so cleansed and fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li>So, if you don&#x27;t like sweet smelling products, steer clear.</li>
            <li>I have not found a shampoo that I can stand to use for very long, and I have ordered many recommended \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>It smells better, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all tangly or dry it out.  </li>
            <li>Do they expect me to believe they tossed in these natural ingredients, (all very susceptible to bacteria and natural decay) and this miracle product came out odorless, free of mold and rot, wonderfully smooth and white?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fantastic results with this product, but I got quite the runaround trying to get my order straight and fell prey to their tactic of double shipping my order then asking me to pay for it.</li>
            <li>This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I was beyond desperate when I came across this wonderful shampoo.</li>
            <li>I guess it is a tad on the pricey side, but if one were to use it for all of it&#x27;s uses, they wouldn&#x27;t be spending as much money.</li>
            <li>They know precisely where they can or cannot use such words.</li>
            <li>i was on a fat free regimen for several weeks, and it&#x27;s the only oil free shampoo i could find.  </li>
            <li>But...what&#x27;s really going on here?</li>
            <li>really dislike the powdery smell</li>
            <li>Very disapointing.</li>
            <li>It is to much of a pain to return.</li>
            <li>I cut it with Rosewater and it becomes very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery service is always a plus.</li>
            <li>His real name is Steve something.</li>
            <li>, I know that this is NOT the real product that is sold from the company itself or legit</li>
            <li>However, I received the same kind of bottle my local health food store sells....</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product thinking it was all natural and only contained the products listed on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>None of the ingredients are even natural!!!</li>
            <li>DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!!</li>
            <li>It should say no extra fragrance added, because other wise it&#x27;s very misleading.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and delicate, and it is now soft and clean feeling after each use.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner can also be used for many other things, I have yet to try that, though!</li>
            <li>When California Baby changed the ingredients in their super sensitive baby shampoo line, there were many of us who were not able to use it.  </li>
            <li>and I had to go back in the shower quick as I could to remove it , it burned and itched .</li>
            <li>Particularly when discussing cocamide dea in their shampoo.</li>
            <li>The two main reasons I believe in this product is my skin sensitivity and the convenience of its multipurpose use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really leaves me feeling heathy, refreshed, and natural.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see the real ingredients in the bottle I have: nothing of what says here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find tate&#x27;s, and decided to take the plunge and order a few things.</li>
            <li>The other issue is that I&#x27;ve also gotten the runaround when I&#x27;ve tried to get an accurate ingredients list from them.</li>
            <li>Because it lathers so much, you won&#x27;t need to use much of it, which is a definite bonus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and is made in the USA!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells like an old lady!</li>
            <li>In addition, the names are completely fictitious!</li>
            <li>It was yellow looking unlike my first bottle of shampoo which was clear.</li>
            <li>He buys cheap gallons of shampoo and conditioner from Sally&#x27;s for less that $4.50/gallon.</li>
            <li>Appreciate this all natural product and a little goes a long way making it cost effective.  </li>
            <li>great for psorisis suffers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked so clear.</li>
            <li>Again, 101 uses, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Now there is a revised ingredients list that differs from the old, &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredients list:</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin stay away.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smelled like cheap baby shampoo with a heavy powdery scent.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle claims to be a family business out of a home in Ohio?</li>
            <li>It was listed on the label of one order, but crossed off the label of another order, and their explanation was that the shampoo no longer contains that ingredient, but they are using up old labels.</li>
            <li>It is not as natural as they claim.</li>
            <li>And, besides its all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I will be 70 yrs old May</li>
            <li>I love the scent and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>My local health food store carries the shampoo in a large bottle with a regular cap.  </li>
            <li>I do not have to alternate shampoos anymore as Tate&#x27;s consistently leaves my hair clean, soft, and free of bad ingredients.</li>
            <li>I moved recently and could not find in my new neighborhood but found on amazon thankfully.</li>
            <li>I am very upset about the order I received, which was not the the same Tate&#x27;s shampoo bottle shown above.</li>
            <li>bought this while looking for a cruelty-free product that left my hair clean and without much heavy buildup.</li>
            <li>It left my fine, thin hair very manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, they won&#x27;t come out white or clear, they will not be odorless, and they will not produce a lather.</li>
            <li>the past years, I have spent more money on this company&#x27;s products than I care to admit.</li>
            <li>You may be surprised that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t produce a big lather, nor is the conditioner/moisturizer creamy.</li>
            <li>I just recently have been trying to buy all natural products, especially for my body, and I am absolutely complete in this purchase.</li>
            <li>I also noticed how my scalp has felt so dry and itchy, especially since it is winter, and the past couple of days it has been fine.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tate&#x27;s for at least 5 years, originally purchasing it at my local health food store.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little thin, but I love using a truly natural product.</li>

            <li> The product is great and purchasing on Amazon, I&#x27;m buying from a store, not the Tate company.</li>
            <li> In checking around, I learned the attacks are from disgruntled employees of Tate&#x27;s, not the stores selling this great shampoo.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT TO....</li>
            <li> Would not use anything but Tate&#x27;s Shampoo, and their conditioner is great also.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself is very nice to use at home</li>
            <li> However, to stay frugal it is best used more for washing your hair than your dishes.</li>
            <li> :-P</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find as many uses for it as the matching conditioner, but it&#x27;s still a wonderful product</li>
            <li> The almond scent is pleasant, too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a good sized bottle</li>
            <li> It has so many incredible uses as well.</li>
            <li> it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> is it really as good as it says it is?</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair squeaky clean (literally) and lathers wonderfully.</li>
            <li> So I decided to order the shampoo and conditioner after reading so many great reviews.    </li>
            <li> Please read labels and do your own research, stay informed and make good decisions about what you use on your body.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo, but it isn&#x27;t just my shampoo!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said - this shampoo messed up my healthy hair like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!</li>
            <li> With so many products made in China, let&#x27;s support America made products!</li>
            <li> I will be adding mine to the others soon, however, I feel that something with greater ramification must be done!</li>
            <li> Despite the issue with the ingredients list, this shampoo and conditioner are amazing.</li>
            <li> After one shampoo I am absolutely thrilled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great, smells great and Is so natural.</li>
            <li> It is very strong with the scent of almond extract.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found on the market so far!</li>
            <li> I can think of many, many charges he will be up against!</li>
            <li> A very good gentle body wash, too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who likes a mild pleasant almond scent.  </li>
            <li> it smells great and leaves my hair feeling so clean and full of body.  </li>
            <li> but my hair looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> but now it looks even better and all I had to do is wash and condition it.</li>
            <li> I even love the almond scent.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I hope the company continues to manufacture it for many years.     </li>
            <li> I would love to hear from others who have switched to Tates.</li>
            <li> Many products these days are advertised as \\&quot;All Natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;Certified Organic\\</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it at Amazon</li>
            <li> Be sure to also try their conditioner, which has many applications besides use on hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll fall in love with it</li>
            <li> The way in which Tate uses its ingredients may be perfectly innocent.</li>
            <li> Ok, so what form of raspberries?</li>
            <li> Check out this link if you want more info.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This is not the Tate&#x27;s I know and love.</li>
            <li> Many complaints about the company, but I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is WAY better.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients of this brand of shampoo and the way it works with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years:)</li>
            <li> I have used as a shampoo and skin wash (face and upper body) and it cleans perfectly well.</li>
            <li> was able to help me.</li>
            <li> have used Tate&#x27;s shampoo for years want to make sure that I get the product that I ordered, as well as others.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Go to the BBB website for more information.</li>
            <li> Many complaints have been made to the BBB.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products ever.</li>
            <li> I spoke with the company &amp;#34;Tate&#x27;s&amp;#34; and ordered two more bottles from them</li>
            <li> Love love the Tate&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great for gentle face wash too</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> Apples, mango, rose, orange, aloe, eucalyptus and about thirty other wonderful sounding things in the wipes alone.</li>
            <li> I rest easy knowing all of the ingredients are plant-based and easy to recognize! :)</li>
            <li> Aside from the high price, this product is \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; great.</li>
            <li> Clean, safe, good ingredients, smells simple and great price.  </li>
            <li> This is the single best product on the market today.</li>
            <li> And unlike similar products, its very good at each thing.</li>
            <li> I also got the shampoo/face wash/body wash, which smells lightly of almonds and also washes windows and more.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect results this good.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very clean...very good as a body wash too.</li>
            <li> The conditioner among other things, is an excellent lotion for face and body, a lip balm, a cuticle cream, baby lotion, make up remover, etc.</li>
            <li> The smell is overwhelming almond (original Tate&#x27;s does not have this,</li>
            <li> (I really like the scent myself, it is kind of refreshing and cheerful.)</li>
            <li> but my hair is still baby fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> Product is fine and works for the uses intended.  </li>
            <li> This product has a deep and pleasant almond scent, a refreshing alternative to perfume-laden shampoos.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, too; similar to almond oil.</li>
            <li> The scent of the shampoo is light - yes, sort of like bubble gum.</li>
            <li> But please, let&#x27;s move beyond the naivety of believing the label they have so craftily provided us.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this, it smelled pretty nice (like almonds) and worked fine.</li>
            <li> well worth it in my book!</li>
            <li> When asked about the rich lather, they insisted it was just the combination of the remaining ingredients on the label.</li>
            <li> much clean anything with it.</li>
            <li> I feel so clean</li>
            <li> It is lovely, safe, natural and everyone needs to try it.</li>
            <li> which subsides to reveal the true chemical smell of the underlying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just love this for my whole family and have given it as a gift for new-born babies.</li>
            <li> I saw this pic and really wanted the pump top.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also great as a lotion and make-up remover, among other things.  </li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s quickly replaced defective pumps on my bottles, too, at no charge, after I emailed them about the problem.    </li>
            <li> My hair feels sleek and silky right down to the ends again, full of body, shiny, and I didn&#x27;t even have to blow-dry it for it to fall beautifully.</li>
            <li> While traveling, I ran across this shampoo in a health products store, and decided to take a chance on it despite its high price (more than listed here.)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone that does not want to use so many chemicals on hair.</li>
            <li> A green, safe, healthy line of products that works better than the rest.</li>
            <li> I had a much longer detailed review, however Amazon chose not to publish it.  </li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s isn&#x27;t cheap by any means, but many products do double, triple zipple duty.</li>
            <li> , it is defintely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Very wholesome &amp; natural, but also effective.</li>
            <li> I am in search of natural self care products and ALMOST fell in love with the ingredients list until I read that it contains cocamide dea.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I love Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle Conditioner.</li>
            <li> The lather fades quickly, however, so scrub fast!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use very many shampoos, they&#x27;re all too harsh, but this is more gentle than baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I also use the conditioner which doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all, but leaves it incredibly silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Tate&#x27;s for all of your special products.  </li>
            <li> It is light, and pretty much disappears into you skin/lips/rough feet, where it really works wonders.</li>
            <li> While \\&quot;lots and lots of love\\&quot; is a cute ingredient, I would also like to know exactly what the other ingredients are, so there is a level of trust you have to give the company to enjoy this</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I got the toothpaste, which I like a lot Most commercial toothpaste burns my mouth, but tate&#x27;s cleans without pain.</li>
            <li> This bottle also has cocomide dea noted as an ingredient which was not listed online as an ingredient and which was not listed on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I will source it again from my first supplier.</li>
            <li> [...]    Please be aware that the FDA does not pre-approve cosmetic labeling.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer points out, the legality of the ingredient label claims is questionable at best.</li>
            <li> (it did me at first).</li>
            <li> She emailed me a return label, refunded the purchase price and told me she would make the warehouse and shipping dept. aware of the problem.</li>
            <li> The real ingredients are chemicals!</li>
            <li> Sure enough!</li>
            <li> However, this was the first time purchasing on Amazon and not on their website.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Tate&#x27;s product that you will buy from the supplier or from the retailer or company itself!</li>
            <li> No multiple products, what more could one ask for.</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish remover, which unlike other supposedly scent free, acetone free removers actually doesn&#x27;t smell, and works much more quickly than like anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, beats the hell out of the huge bottle of OPI remover I recently bought.</li>
            <li> but it was more natural and less overwhelming)</li>
            <li> It is such a light and gentle hair wash and my hair feels so cleansed and fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t like sweet smelling products, steer clear.</li>
            <li> I have not found a shampoo that I can stand to use for very long, and I have ordered many recommended \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> It smells better, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all tangly or dry it out.  </li>
            <li> Do they expect me to believe they tossed in these natural ingredients, (all very susceptible to bacteria and natural decay) and this miracle product came out odorless, free of mold and rot, wonderfully smooth and white?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fantastic results with this product, but I got quite the runaround trying to get my order straight and fell prey to their tactic of double shipping my order then asking me to pay for it.</li>
            <li> This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I was beyond desperate when I came across this wonderful shampoo.</li>
            <li> I guess it is a tad on the pricey side, but if one were to use it for all of it&#x27;s uses, they wouldn&#x27;t be spending as much money.</li>
            <li> They know precisely where they can or cannot use such words.</li>
            <li> i was on a fat free regimen for several weeks, and it&#x27;s the only oil free shampoo i could find.  </li>
            <li> But...what&#x27;s really going on here?</li>
            <li> really dislike the powdery smell</li>
            <li> Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> It is to much of a pain to return.</li>
            <li> I cut it with Rosewater and it becomes very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery service is always a plus.</li>
            <li> His real name is Steve something.</li>
            <li> , I know that this is NOT the real product that is sold from the company itself or legit</li>
            <li> However, I received the same kind of bottle my local health food store sells....</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product thinking it was all natural and only contained the products listed on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> None of the ingredients are even natural!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!!</li>
            <li> It should say no extra fragrance added, because other wise it&#x27;s very misleading.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and delicate, and it is now soft and clean feeling after each use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner can also be used for many other things, I have yet to try that, though!</li>
            <li> When California Baby changed the ingredients in their super sensitive baby shampoo line, there were many of us who were not able to use it.  </li>
            <li> and I had to go back in the shower quick as I could to remove it , it burned and itched .</li>
            <li> Particularly when discussing cocamide dea in their shampoo.</li>
            <li> The two main reasons I believe in this product is my skin sensitivity and the convenience of its multipurpose use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really leaves me feeling heathy, refreshed, and natural.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see the real ingredients in the bottle I have: nothing of what says here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find tate&#x27;s, and decided to take the plunge and order a few things.</li>
            <li> The other issue is that I&#x27;ve also gotten the runaround when I&#x27;ve tried to get an accurate ingredients list from them.</li>
            <li> Because it lathers so much, you won&#x27;t need to use much of it, which is a definite bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and is made in the USA!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like an old lady!</li>
            <li> In addition, the names are completely fictitious!</li>
            <li> It was yellow looking unlike my first bottle of shampoo which was clear.</li>
            <li> He buys cheap gallons of shampoo and conditioner from Sally&#x27;s for less that $4.50/gallon.</li>
            <li> Appreciate this all natural product and a little goes a long way making it cost effective.  </li>
            <li> great for psorisis suffers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked so clear.</li>
            <li> Again, 101 uses, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Now there is a revised ingredients list that differs from the old, &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredients list:</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin stay away.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smelled like cheap baby shampoo with a heavy powdery scent.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle claims to be a family business out of a home in Ohio?</li>
            <li> It was listed on the label of one order, but crossed off the label of another order, and their explanation was that the shampoo no longer contains that ingredient, but they are using up old labels.</li>
            <li> It is not as natural as they claim.</li>
            <li> And, besides its all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I will be 70 yrs old May</li>
            <li> I love the scent and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My local health food store carries the shampoo in a large bottle with a regular cap.  </li>
            <li> I do not have to alternate shampoos anymore as Tate&#x27;s consistently leaves my hair clean, soft, and free of bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> I moved recently and could not find in my new neighborhood but found on amazon thankfully.</li>
            <li> I am very upset about the order I received, which was not the the same Tate&#x27;s shampoo bottle shown above.</li>
            <li> bought this while looking for a cruelty-free product that left my hair clean and without much heavy buildup.</li>
            <li> It left my fine, thin hair very manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, they won&#x27;t come out white or clear, they will not be odorless, and they will not produce a lather.</li>
            <li> the past years, I have spent more money on this company&#x27;s products than I care to admit.</li>
            <li> You may be surprised that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t produce a big lather, nor is the conditioner/moisturizer creamy.</li>
            <li> I just recently have been trying to buy all natural products, especially for my body, and I am absolutely complete in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I also noticed how my scalp has felt so dry and itchy, especially since it is winter, and the past couple of days it has been fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tate&#x27;s for at least 5 years, originally purchasing it at my local health food store.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thin, but I love using a truly natural product.</li>
            <li> but we worked the price down to a small fraction of the original</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the natural and organic shampoos available, and have had negative reactions to everyone of them, usually from just one or two of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I have a lot of grey and white streaks these days and color my hair blonde.</li>
            <li> all natural is to list item by item\\&quot; and \\&quot;Every product that sounded good at first turned out to have nasty chemicals hidden in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> I was born with thick, coarse, straight red hair</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a new shampoo that didn&#x27;t contain any of the harsh surfactants and sulfates like sodium lauryl sulfate</li>
            <li> and you only need a single squirt to wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extreme scalp sensitivities, and Tates is the ONLY shampoo that doesn&#x27;t create product build up on the scalp, make my hair fall out in handfuls, or cause a red, itchy allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret the extra money spent at all.</li>
            <li> As long as I have hair on my head</li>
            <li> Every product that sounded good at first turned out to have nasty chemicals hidden in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> So while I dropped a wad on these products, I feel like I&#x27;ve found a natural and yes miraculous line, and i believe I will just bite the bullet and accept the stiff prices if I can..</li>
            <li> &quot; and \\&quot;what sold me on them was the ingredients list\\&quot; and \\&quot;The only other thing</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients reads like any other chemical laden shampoo, and the result is the same as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year and from the second I smelled this shampoo I knew it was not right.</li>
            <li> I took her advice, trying several other kinds, but it wasn&#x27;t until I used Tate&#x27;s that the rash went away!</li>
            <li> I just want to give a head&#x27;s up concerning Tate&#x27;s labeling for the more incensed reviewers who cannot understand why anyone would give the product a bad rating.    </li>
            <li> And during those years I have spent a fortune on salon brands.</li>
            <li> The texture is thinner than Tate&#x27;s should be and you can barely get it to lather before it slides down your arms causing you to waste alot of it.</li>
            <li> I will certainly not buy this product from this seller anymore.</li>
            <li> This is just BS plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s ingredient list, while very unusual, does not have anything scary in it.</li>
            <li> Then to make matters worse, the shampoo did not have the Natural Miracle Shampoo signature scent of almonds.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin needing very little lotion after a shower.</li>
            <li> : You only need a very small amount to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I felt a slight burning in the genital area.</li>
            <li> Because they are not certified organic, and to label the actual product as such would be glaringly illegal.</li>
            <li> That little fact disturbs me a bit.</li>
            <li> I am left with the impression of a company playing a bit of a marketing game.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s not be quite this green.</li>
            <li> I like this product and a few others in the Tate line.  </li>
            <li> I usually get this time of year, but</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this shampoo as a trial from another seller and it worked well, no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I will continue to use this as a shampoo or body wash.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention the the description and ended up with expensive shampoo that I don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> This version had an unpleasant smell, was not as thick and did not lather very well.</li>
            <li> The second time, when I bought it here from Amazon, it smelled 100% different - and terrible, like a poor version of commercial baby-product scent.</li>
            <li> Is our common sense so in abeyance?    </li>
            <li> Normally it is extremely thick...</li>
            <li> There are comments on there from PAST EMPLOYEES!</li>
            <li> Seriously who would use a shampoo as toothpaste, shampoo and laundry soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other shampoos, which have all kinds of artificial additives, always caused an eventual itchy reaction.</li>
            <li> I just spent hours researching this and it turns out everything is FAKE!</li>
            <li> Every shampoo and conditioner I tried either didn&#x27;t help the fuzzies or weighed my hair down and made it feel oily or dirty.    </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and threw the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> But that is unimportant compared to the fact that my online research using google, google maps (with street view), and BBB, indicates that this business is a fraud.</li>
            <li> ..Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrified about what chemicals I have been putting on my body for the past 3 years!!!</li>
            <li> and I was getting the horrible red bumps on my arms and legs</li>
            <li> Tate&#x27;s ingredient list...does not have anything scary in it.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> I wrote to Bigfly sports and they take no responsibility but blamed Amazon for the lousy packing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s a lie.</li>
            <li> I found the product &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; and was disappointed by this.</li>
            <li> Something is very, VERY wrong here!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> The product is terrible...</li>

            <li> Really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This gets 5 stars!  I love the scent and a little goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t buy anyother shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an all-natural shampoo for years. Every product that sounded good at first turned out to have nasty chemicals hidden in the ingredients list. Tate&#x27;s ingredient list, while very unusual, does not have anything scary in it. So I decided to order the shampoo and conditioner after reading so many great reviews.    Well, I don&#x27;t know how they do it but my hair looks and feels better than it has in years. And during those years I have spent a fortune on salon brands. I was born with thick, coarse, straight red hair but I have a lot of grey and white streaks these days and color my hair blonde. My hair is shoulder length and was getting \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot;, especially towards the ends. Every shampoo and conditioner I tried either didn&#x27;t help the fuzzies or weighed my hair down and made it feel oily or dirty.    After one shampoo I am absolutely thrilled. My hair feels sleek and silky right down to the ends again, full of body, shiny, and I didn&#x27;t even have to blow-dry it for it to fall beautifully. I really didn&#x27;t expect results this good. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my hair but now it looks even better and all I had to do is wash and condition it. I&#x27;m hooked. I even love the almond scent. This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I finally got it that what goes on our skin and hair and teeth and fingernails goes into us, and some of those chemicals are carcinogenic or neurotoxins, etc. I was so glad to find tate&#x27;s, and decided to take the plunge and order a few things. Tate&#x27;s isn&#x27;t cheap by any means, but many products do double, triple zipple duty. The conditioner among other things, is an excellent lotion for face and body, a lip balm, a cuticle cream, baby lotion, make up remover, etc. etc. And unlike similar products, its very good at each thing. I also got the shampoo/face wash/body wash, which smells lightly of almonds and also washes windows and more. I got the toothpaste, which I like a lot Most commercial toothpaste burns my mouth, but tate&#x27;s cleans without pain. I got the nail polish remover, which unlike other supposedly scent free, acetone free removers actually doesn&#x27;t smell, and works much more quickly than like anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, beats the hell out of the huge bottle of OPI remover I recently bought. And the biggest surprise of all are the wipes. Again, 101 uses, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft. It&#x27;s definitely winter here and I was getting the horrible red bumps on my arms and legs I usually get this time of year, but with only two applications, I can see the difference. They are absolutely wonderful, which makes their exorbitant price almost bearable. So while I dropped a wad on these products, I feel like I&#x27;ve found a natural and yes miraculous line, and i believe I will just bite the bullet and accept the stiff prices if I can.. And of course I have to go back for the lip balm. Apples, mango, rose, orange, aloe, eucalyptus and about thirty other wonderful sounding things in the wipes alone. What&#x27;s not to love.    PS You may be surprised that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t produce a big lather, nor is the conditioner/moisturizer creamy. It is light, and pretty much disappears into you skin/lips/rough feet, where it really works wonders. A green, safe, healthy line of products that works better than the rest. Miraculous.</li>
            <li> Aside from the high price, this product is \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; great. It leaves your hair squeaky clean (literally) and lathers wonderfully. The lather fades quickly, however, so scrub fast!  The scent is reminiscent of fruit and bubble gum, rather than a musky scent. So, if you don&#x27;t like sweet smelling products, steer clear. (I really like the scent myself, it is kind of refreshing and cheerful.) Because it lathers so much, you won&#x27;t need to use much of it, which is a definite bonus. The multi-prpose aspect is great; you can prerty much clean anything with it. However, to stay frugal it is best used more for washing your hair than your dishes. :-P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this while looking for a cruelty-free product that left my hair clean and without much heavy buildup. Its ingredients list is rather mysterious, since it only mentiones various plants, and not the specific ingredients used. While \\&quot;lots and lots of love\\&quot; is a cute ingredient, I would also like to know exactly what the other ingredients are, so there is a level of trust you have to give the company to enjoy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work well, however. If the issues mentioned don&#x27;t concern you, it is defintely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> My facialist suggested that I change shampoos because the one I was using was giving me a rash all along my hair line. I took her advice, trying several other kinds, but it wasn&#x27;t until I used Tate&#x27;s that the rash went away! The almond scent is pleasant, too. Tip: You only need a very small amount to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a new shampoo that didn&#x27;t contain any of the harsh surfactants and sulfates like sodium lauryl sulfate and when I found Tate&#x27;s here I was a bit put off by the price. However, based on the reviews I decided to go for it and make the purchase. I don&#x27;t regret the extra money spent at all. This shampoo gets my hair cleaner than any I&#x27;ve ever used before. It&#x27;s the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked so clear. The smell is great, too; similar to almond oil. As long as I have hair on my head I&#x27;ll be using this product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with all natural ingredients.  Skin feels very clean...very good as a body wash too.</li>
            <li> I have extreme scalp sensitivities, and Tates is the ONLY shampoo that doesn&#x27;t create product build up on the scalp, make my hair fall out in handfuls, or cause a red, itchy allergic reaction. I have tried all of the natural and organic shampoos available, and have had negative reactions to everyone of them, usually from just one or two of the ingredients. I was beyond desperate when I came across this wonderful shampoo. My hair is very fine and delicate, and it is now soft and clean feeling after each use. It&#x27;s growing thicker, too. I hope the company continues to manufacture it for many years.     When California Baby changed the ingredients in their super sensitive baby shampoo line, there were many of us who were not able to use it.  I would love to hear from others who have switched to Tates. It truly is a Miracle.</li>
            <li> Despite the issue with the ingredients list, this shampoo and conditioner are amazing. They have made my hair thicker and healthier. I use the shampoo as a face wash, body wash &amp; bubble bath. I use the conditioner on my skin as a moisturizer, make up remover, lip balm, insect bite/anti-rash balm! The scent of the shampoo is light - yes, sort of like bubble gum. It&#x27;s nice. The conditioner seems to be unscented. Very wholesome &amp; natural, but also effective. I am hooked. GREAT products.</li>
            <li> This is not the same shampoo that I have been getting.  It is very strong with the scent of almond extract. I had been getting shampoo that smelled like tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I am in search of natural self care products and ALMOST fell in love with the ingredients list until I read that it contains cocamide dea. I checked it out on cosmeticsdatabase.com and it comes up as a skin irritant, causes immunotoxicity, and has been linked to cancer. If you don&#x27;t recognize the ingredients please look it up on the cosmetics database website prior to purchasing a mystery concoction so you know what you are getting yourself into. Many products these days are advertised as \\&quot;All Natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;Certified Organic\\&quot; but they sneak these ingredients in there anyways at YOUR expense. Don&#x27;t let those words trick you. Please read labels and do your own research, stay informed and make good decisions about what you use on your body.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this shampoo as a trial from another seller and it worked well, no irritation.  From the time I received my shampoo from Amazon I realised it was different. It was yellow looking unlike my first bottle of shampoo which was clear. Also when I used it as a shower gel I felt a slight burning in the genital area. This bottle also has cocomide dea noted as an ingredient which was not listed online as an ingredient and which was not listed on my first bottle. The supplier of this shampoo was also different from that Amazon listed as the supplier. I am not sure I will continue to use this as a shampoo or body wash. I will source it again from my first supplier.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a couple of months ago.  I have to say, I have not been disapointed.  I use it for hair, body, and face wash.  I feel so clean, my hair feels so great after using it.  I also use the conditioner which doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair at all, but leaves it incredibly silky and soft.  The conditioner is also great as a lotion and make-up remover, among other things.  This is a great alternative to those chemical-filled shampoos.  Definitely worth the money.  The shampoo and conditioner can also be used for many other things, I have yet to try that, though!</li>
            <li> I have been trying for YEARS to get rid my hairline acne and switching to this shampoo was the trick! It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it in my book! I like the conditioner as well ... it&#x27;s a little thin, but I love using a truly natural product.</li>
            <li> While traveling, I ran across this shampoo in a health products store, and decided to take a chance on it despite its high price (more than listed here.) I have not found a shampoo that I can stand to use for very long, and I have ordered many recommended \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products. All of them contained chemicals in the ingredients list except Tate&#x27;s.     Tate&#x27;s quickly replaced defective pumps on my bottles, too, at no charge, after I emailed them about the problem.    I highly recommend this product. And I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it at Amazon so I&#x27;ll have a convenient source from now on. I think I&#x27;ll use it as a face and body wash from now on, too.     Be sure to also try their conditioner, which has many applications besides use on hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 but my hair is still baby fine and tangles easily.  I can&#x27;t use very many shampoos, they&#x27;re all too harsh, but this is more gentle than baby shampoo.  It smells better, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all tangly or dry it out.  It&#x27;s priceier than some but it&#x27;s a good sized bottle and you only need a single squirt to wash your hair.  A very good gentle body wash, too.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who likes a mild pleasant almond scent.  My roommate hates almond scent, so she can&#x27;t stand it, but everyone else give it a try.  Would be great for children.  I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s great.  Try this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great, smells great and Is so natural. I have used it on myself and my kids. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo - it smells great and leaves my hair feeling so clean and full of body.  It&#x27;s all natural and is made in the USA!  (specifically in Ohio)</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years as there are no harmful chemicals in it and it does the job not only as shampoo but as body wash, hand wash, too.  P Pratt</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo, but it isn&#x27;t just my shampoo! -I use it as a facial cleanser and my body wash! It is such a light and gentle hair wash and my hair feels so cleansed and fresh after I use it. There is never any soapy residue or chemical feeling afterwards. It has so many incredible uses as well. I guess it is a tad on the pricey side, but if one were to use it for all of it&#x27;s uses, they wouldn&#x27;t be spending as much money. I no longer have to buy facial cleansers or body washes. I also use the Miracle Conditioner, not only on my hair, but on my face and body; So I no longer have to buy a body lotion or a face cream!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really leaves me feeling heathy, refreshed, and natural. I just recently have been trying to buy all natural products, especially for my body, and I am absolutely complete in this purchase. I also noticed how my scalp has felt so dry and itchy, especially since it is winter, and the past couple of days it has been fine. I recommend trying this product out and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll fall in love with it too!&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sarah, Narberth PA</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found on the market so far! As a midwife and crunchy mom I recommend this product all the time.</li>
            <li> This is not a review attacking the effectiveness of this product. If the product works for you, then wonderful. I just want to give a head&#x27;s up concerning Tate&#x27;s labeling for the more incensed reviewers who cannot understand why anyone would give the product a bad rating.    Hmmm. That wonderful list of ingredients? I would challenge you all to mix up those ingredients in your blender. Let me tell you, they won&#x27;t come out white or clear, they will not be odorless, and they will not produce a lather. Chemistry anyone? Is science in the U.S. in such dire straits? Is our common sense so in abeyance?    The way in which Tate uses its ingredients may be perfectly innocent. But how would we know from the way they have labeled things? Do they expect me to believe they tossed in these natural ingredients, (all very susceptible to bacteria and natural decay) and this miracle product came out odorless, free of mold and rot, wonderfully smooth and white? Coconuts? Is that a coconut based surfactant or coconut oil? How would anyone know? Raspberries. Ok, so what form of raspberries? Are they trying to say they used a botanical extract? Why not just say so? And how do they prevent mold in their products? Are you going to tell me that \\&quot;sea salt\\&quot; does the trick? How about \\&quot;Love\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hugs\\&quot;? I don&#x27;t believe the FDA has approved such ingredients for cosmetic use. Or are those trade secrets? :) Sarcasm aside, their manner of ingredient labeling is misleading and illegal. Check out this link if you want more info. [...]    Please be aware that the FDA does not pre-approve cosmetic labeling. Neither is the word \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; regulated in cosmetics. Anyone can make that claim. Organic is regulated, however. If you visit Tate&#x27;s website, you will see that they place the claim \\&quot;Organic All Natural\\&quot; in the body text of the website. Please notice the word \\&quot;organic\\&quot; is not on the actual product itself. Why? Because they are not certified organic, and to label the actual product as such would be glaringly illegal. They may use organic products in their formulation, but they have no certification, and they know it. That little fact disturbs me a bit. They know precisely where they can or cannot use such words. I am left with the impression of a company playing a bit of a marketing game. It seems they want to exploit the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; market. I prefer to support companies that are forthcoming in their labeling. I should not have to call a company for clarification.       If these objections pose no quandary for you, by all means, use the shampoo. But please, let&#x27;s move beyond the naivety of believing the label they have so craftily provided us. Let&#x27;s please stop writing things like \\&quot;This is a great alternative to those chemical-filled shampoos\\&quot; and \\&quot;what sold me on them was the ingredients list\\&quot; and \\&quot;The only other thing I can think to do to prove that these products are 100% all natural is to list item by item\\&quot; and \\&quot;Every product that sounded good at first turned out to have nasty chemicals hidden in the ingredients list. Tate&#x27;s ingredient list...does not have anything scary in it.\\&quot;    Let&#x27;s not be quite this green.</li>
            <li> If I could I would give this ZERO stars. As it stands the one star is for the creativity Tate&#x27;s marketing company used to come up with uses for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Laundry soap, shampoo, mouthwash, stain remover,pet shampoo, toothpaste....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list goes on and on. Seriously who would use a shampoo as toothpaste, shampoo and laundry soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said - this shampoo messed up my healthy hair like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!</li>
            <li> i was on a fat free regimen for several weeks, and it&#x27;s the only oil free shampoo i could find.  it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tate&#x27;s for at least 5 years, originally purchasing it at my local health food store. I moved recently and could not find in my new neighborhood but found on amazon thankfully. This shampoo is heavenly. Other shampoos, which have all kinds of artificial additives, always caused an eventual itchy reaction. I do not have to alternate shampoos anymore as Tate&#x27;s consistently leaves my hair clean, soft, and free of bad ingredients. I love it and I will never change shampoos. I use the conditioner too.</li>
            <li> This is not the Tate&#x27;s I know and love. The list of ingredients reads like any other chemical laden shampoo, and the result is the same as well. The smell is overwhelming almond (original Tate&#x27;s does not have this, the Almond Tate&#x27;s did but it was more natural and less overwhelming) which subsides to reveal the true chemical smell of the underlying shampoo. It&#x27;s quite gross. The texture is thinner than Tate&#x27;s should be and you can barely get it to lather before it slides down your arms causing you to waste alot of it. I will certainly not buy this product from this seller anymore.</li>
            <li> Appreciate this all natural product and a little goes a long way making it cost effective.  It left my fine, thin hair very manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> The product is a fraud. I have bought the product before. Now there is a revised ingredients list that differs from the old, &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredients list: Water, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryth Sulfate, Lauramide DEA, Lauryl Glucoside, Ammonium Xylene Sulfonate, Sodium Chloride, Almond Flavor, Vitamin E.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it said NO FRAGRANCE .  Just opening it I can smell the coconut.  I purchased this to use in bear country while camping and it needed to be NO FRAGRANCE.  The shampoo itself is very nice to use at home but not if you have fragrance allergies (like my husband does). It should say no extra fragrance added, because other wise it&#x27;s very misleading.  This DOES have a fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> The product is terrible... I was very disappointed in this product..Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Many complaints about the company, but I don&#x27;t get it. The product is great and purchasing on Amazon, I&#x27;m buying from a store, not the Tate company. In checking around, I learned the attacks are from disgruntled employees of Tate&#x27;s, not the stores selling this great shampoo. I like to support the merchants. With so many products made in China, let&#x27;s support America made products!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like an old lady! There was no way that I was going to use this stuff. I wish someone had warned me about the scent prior to purchasing it. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is WAY better.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin stay away.  I had a much longer detailed review, however Amazon chose not to publish it.  Hmmm....</li>
            <li> Product is fine and works for the uses intended.  Order it from the manufacturer and not through the vendors of  Amazon like BIGFLYSPORTS.  I ordered 6 of the 18 oz and the way Amazon packed it for shipping caused 3 of the bottles to spill.  I wrote to Bigfly sports and they take no responsibility but blamed Amazon for the lousy packing.  Amazon didn&#x27;t take my money so what do they care that 3 bottles spilled in shipping.  FYI...order from someone who cares how it gets to you!</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients of this brand of shampoo and the way it works with my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for years:)</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this, it smelled pretty nice (like almonds) and worked fine. The second time, when I bought it here from Amazon, it smelled 100% different - and terrible, like a poor version of commercial baby-product scent. The bottle was also totally different the second time. As another reviewer points out, the legality of the ingredient label claims is questionable at best. (How have they been getting away with this? Raspberries? Pine needles? No definitive information about the actual form of substances going into this product? Hello?) I guess the romantic tone of the label sells some people (it did me at first). But...what&#x27;s really going on here?</li>
            <li> really dislike the powdery smell and I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about.  is it really as good as it says it is?</li>
            <li> This product has a deep and pleasant almond scent, a refreshing alternative to perfume-laden shampoos. I have used as a shampoo and skin wash (face and upper body) and it cleans perfectly well. It does not irritate my skin at all, even after shaving, or on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find as many uses for it as the matching conditioner, but it&#x27;s still a wonderful product and I would definitely buy it again. I rest easy knowing all of the ingredients are plant-based and easy to recognize! :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair fuzzy and unmanageable . I did not like it . I tried the conditioner on my arms and I had to go back in the shower quick as I could to remove it , it burned and itched . Also it felt sticky on my skin .</li>
            <li> I am very upset about the order I received, which was not the the same Tate&#x27;s shampoo bottle shown above. Then to make matters worse, the shampoo did not have the Natural Miracle Shampoo signature scent of almonds. This stuff smelled like cheap baby shampoo with a heavy powdery scent.&lt;br /&gt;Next I went to Tate&#x27;s family website and contacted them by email and phone. I received a call back and was told that they only make their shampoo with the almond scent.&lt;br /&gt;I then called Amazon Customer Service and the rep was able to help me. She emailed me a return label, refunded the purchase price and told me she would make the warehouse and shipping dept. aware of the problem. And that I could call back in two weeks and check to see how it was resolved.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Tate&#x27;s shampoo for years want to make sure that I get the product that I ordered, as well as others.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo. It&#x27;s all I ever use anymore. I use a lot of their products, like the shampoo, conditioner, acne solution, and nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see the real ingredients in the bottle I have: nothing of what says here at Amazon. The real ingredients are chemicals! Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> I love Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle Conditioner. I bought this thinking I was buying the conditioner because the picture they used for the shampoo is a picture of the conditioner. I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention the the description and ended up with expensive shampoo that I don&#x27;t want. It is to much of a pain to return.</li>
            <li> This is the single best product on the market today. Clean, safe, good ingredients, smells simple and great price.  No build up. I just love this for my whole family and have given it as a gift for new-born babies.</li>
            <li> I like this product and a few others in the Tate line.  I cut it with Rosewater and it becomes very affordable.  Fast delivery service is always a plus.</li>
            <li> UPDATE! I just spent hours researching this and it turns out everything is FAKE! The \\&quot;owner\\&quot; of Tate&#x27;s is located in Massachusetts. His real name is Steve something. He buys cheap gallons of shampoo and conditioner from Sally&#x27;s for less that $4.50/gallon. Then he fills the Tate&#x27;s bottle in the basement of his home. Go to the BBB website for more information. Please make complaints. AND STOP USING THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL POST-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;Over the past years, I have spent more money on this company&#x27;s products than I care to admit. It wasn&#x27;t until I saw the recent reviews today that I even considered there might be a problem. I just googled their location and it came up as a place called Dura-Bilt Drapery &amp; Upholstery. Another reviewer said it is also the location for Kathy&#x27;s Family. Sure enough! Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle claims to be a family business out of a home in Ohio? A home surrounded by nature and all the ingredients used in making this product? NOT! Something is very, VERY wrong here! In addition, the names are completely fictitious! No records can be found. I also googled the phone number and it came up on 800notes. There are comments on there from PAST EMPLOYEES! They say the \\&quot;owner\\&quot; is broke, a crook, and a slimeball. None of the ingredients are even natural!!! There is also an owner name given, but I couldn&#x27;t find records. Many complaints have been made to the BBB. I will be adding mine to the others soon, however, I feel that something with greater ramification must be done! This is unexceptionable, immoral, and against the law! I&#x27;m terrified about what chemicals I have been putting on my body for the past 3 years!!! A lawsuit is hopefully in this guy&#x27;s future. I can think of many, many charges he will be up against! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! DO NOT GIVE ANY CREDIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANY!!! IT IS A FRAUD!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received is different from the photo. But that is unimportant compared to the fact that my online research using google, google maps (with street view), and BBB, indicates that this business is a fraud. Plus, as another reviewer pointed out, there is no way shampoo of this color and texture can be made from the list of ingredients listed on the bottle! I plan to contact Amazon customer service to request removal of this fraud business from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fantastic results with this product, but I got quite the runaround trying to get my order straight and fell prey to their tactic of double shipping my order then asking me to pay for it. I insisted they send me a return label but we worked the price down to a small fraction of the original so I just went with it. The other issue is that I&#x27;ve also gotten the runaround when I&#x27;ve tried to get an accurate ingredients list from them. Particularly when discussing cocamide dea in their shampoo. It was listed on the label of one order, but crossed off the label of another order, and their explanation was that the shampoo no longer contains that ingredient, but they are using up old labels. When asked about the rich lather, they insisted it was just the combination of the remaining ingredients on the label. This is just BS plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I do like the shampoo.  However, I wanted a pump-top bottle as shown in the picture.  My local health food store carries the shampoo in a large bottle with a regular cap.  I saw this pic and really wanted the pump top.  However, I received the same kind of bottle my local health food store sells.... just a regular cap.</li>
            <li> This bottle was not as described and not the same shampoo that was recommended. This version had an unpleasant smell, was not as thick and did not lather very well. I was very disappointed and threw the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> This product keeps your skin nice and soft. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin needing very little lotion after a shower. Then I recommand the next product the Tates Conditioner for that.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction to this product.  It is not as natural as they claim.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products ever. However, this was the first time purchasing on Amazon and not on their website. I found the product &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; and was disappointed by this. Normally it is extremely thick...concentrated...but not this time. I spoke with the company &amp;#34;Tate&#x27;s&amp;#34; and ordered two more bottles from them and it was 100% just as I&#x27;ve always known it. I would not purchase again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Tate&#x27;s product that you will buy from the supplier or from the retailer or company itself! I have been using this shampoo for over a year and from the second I smelled this shampoo I knew it was not right. Now that I&#x27;ve looked at these reviews and used it, I know that this is NOT the real product that is sold from the company itself or legit retailers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Tate&#x27;s, do not purchase it from this seller!</li>
            <li> This produt rocks! It is lovely, safe, natural and everyone needs to try it. Thanks Tate&#x27;s for all of your special products.  I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> great for psorisis suffers.  Hair is manageable and beautiful.  SMELLS GREAT TO....Works also when you forget the soap for your body.</li>
            <li> This company is lying to us! I enjoyed this product thinking it was all natural and only contained the products listed on the ingredient list. Unfortunately it&#x27;s a lie. Those ingredients aren&#x27;t in your shampoo and THERE ARE CHEMICALS in this shampoo. They just don&#x27;t list them.</li>
            <li> Love love the Tate&#x27;s shampoo. My hair is thicker and healthier than when I was p&lt;br /&gt;In my 20s ! Great for gentle face wash too</li>
            <li> The two main reasons I believe in this product is my skin sensitivity and the convenience of its multipurpose use. I have been using Tate&#x27;s Miracle Shampoo for over five years as both a hair shampoo and a body wash. Start on the head and work your way to toes. No multiple products, what more could one ask for. And, besides its all natural ingredients. I am sold.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone that does not want to use so many chemicals on hair. Tons of uses from shampoo to???</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  I have been using it now for 10 plus years.  I will be 70 yrs old May and when I go to the beautician they say I have the healthiest hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and keeps it healthy. Would not use anything but Tate&#x27;s Shampoo, and their conditioner is great also.</li>
            <li> Great price! Just love this stuff!!!</li>
