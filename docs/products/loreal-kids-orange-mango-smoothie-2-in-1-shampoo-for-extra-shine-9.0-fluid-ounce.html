            <li>Smells really nice and not harsh.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I find that it has so much conditioner in it</li>

            <li>My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the shampoo has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out.</li>
            <li>received the product quickly and no spills [[ASIN:B000VOENEE L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo for</li>
            <li>I called Amazon and they were kind enough to send me a free replacement for it.</li>
            <li>so I bought this to have a quick all-in-one because he doesn&#x27;t like having his hair washed.</li>
            <li>I am fourteen years old, and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line, and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>With my daughters hair I had to use quite a bit more shampoo then normal in order to get it to lather.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old liked the smell so much she borrows it for her showers too!</li>
            <li>My hair is very delicate,,,it is fine and</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo for my hair besides Suave Naturals, hands down!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo for my hair besides Suave Naturals, hands down!</li>
            <li>My kids love the smell of the shampoo and how it leaves their hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>And the mango scent is fresh and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>so it makes bath time fun</li>
            <li>and, I constantly get compliments about how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>The characters also add to the &#x27;fun&#x27; of hair washing.</li>
            <li>and I have absolutely no complaints; it smells good,</li>
            <li>My kids have fine Asian hair and comes out super shiny and smooth every time.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST shampoo I have used and it leaves her very thick hair incredibly soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>just spring right up.  </li>
            <li>Price was right and no complaints....buy it now or else</li>
            <li>new formula is also Paraben free.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, but you can&#x27;t smell it once the hair is dry.</li>
            <li>pre paraban free and now paraban free, and the product is the same either way).  </li>
            <li>Whenever I try to grab another shampoo, my kids throw an epic fit.</li>
            <li>The bottle looked pretty cute as well, and, I saw that it helped prevent split ends, dentangle hair, and add extra shine to hair, so, I thought \\&quot;Why</li>
            <li>;) )</li>
            <li>Hmmm...where will I stash???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li>However, after trying several &#x27;tear free&#x27; shampoos that weren&#x27;t really &#x27;tear free&#x27;</li>
            <li>A tad more pricier than what I used to pay back in Blighty where it&#x27;s pretty much on every supermarket/drugstore shelf.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son and daughter&#x27;s hair ends up clean and soft.</li>
            <li>When I applied this to my hair and scalp, it felt nice, smooth, thick, and creamy.</li>
            <li>but if your kid&#x27;s hair is really dry this will probably work better.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out her skin like many brands.  </li>
            <li>It was soft, super sleek, and had the highest level of shine that I had ever seen.</li>
            <li>Overall, an amazing, great-smelling, and affordable 2-in-1 shampoo that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>Overall, an amazing, great-smelling, and affordable 2-in-1 shampoo that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for my daughter who has straight stringy hair.</li>
            <li>And the kids really like the fragrance and the shape of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and leaves her hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t seem to condition at all.</li>
            <li>It also lathers really well too.</li>
            <li>I decided to find one that worked on hair and was gentle on the eyes.</li>
            <li>No matter how much goes in their eyes they just wipe their face and keep on playing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the only scent I can use,,,the others are too strong,,,,,,,,,i shampoo and enjoy.....</li>
            <li>Only this shampoo is deemed worthy of touching their silken locks all jammed up with all-day kid funk.</li>
            <li>It barely lathers, so it takes more shampoo to wash my child&#x27;s hair, and at a slightly higher price than other shampoos, I expected better.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the bottle is so freaking fantastic that it is also awesome when empty, as evidenced by the 5 or 6 empty fish shampoo containers that I&#x27;m constantly stepping on as I tried to wash their blessed, totally smelly heads.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 bottles on Amazon, and both were only about 75% full.</li>
            <li>Price is decent if you subscribe to it.</li>
            <li>I have the kind of hair that looks thick</li>
            <li>throws out  600 &#x27;new&#x27; products at a time,,,change their formulas,,,,and have gone</li>
            <li>I have used various products from Burt&#x27;s Bees to Johnson and Johnson trying to keep my daughter&#x27;s hair clean, soft and just generally not a bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li>So, if you are a young adult, or even an adult looking to use this shampoo, I&#x27;ll say go for it!</li>

            <li>after doing research i was so glad to see there were other options for my son&#x27;s hair that was so dry-</li>
            <li>(I am twelve years old.)</li>
            <li>I use this for my 2 year old.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>i wanted him to have baby soft hair again.</li>
            <li>his hair is still not baby soft</li>
            <li>I tried the Loreal kids shampoo for curly/wavy hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>Even complete strangers ask me \\&quot;What do you use on your hair?</li>
            <li>My kiddos sensitive skin is not bothered by this either.</li>
            <li>is soft after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope the formula stay the same,,,,,,i check from my old</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a bottle saver),,,,,L&#x27;Oreal has been moving far ahead of Revlon,,,,,,,,(Revlon</li>
            <li>This surprised me because not one review mentioned having this problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>old with lots of hair.  </li>
            <li>and someone mentioned that you have to stop using baby shampoo at some point and switch to kids or adult shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo really smells great unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last on the hair once it is dry.  </li>
            <li>But for normal to thin hair I think you would be able to forgo the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it on both of my kids, my daughter has long, very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have very thick course wavy/frizzy hair and it made my hair by far more manageable.</li>
            <li>We were having major knots.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>to work fine, but the container had less than expected product in it.</li>
            <li>When I blow-dried my hair on the cool setting as usual, I was so suprised with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>I just shampoo, rinse, and let it dry naturally, and her natural curls</li>
            <li>Much prefer this one to all the other &#x27;flavours&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I still deep use deep repair afterwards,,,,you can wash your body with it,,, (like a gentle soap,,,....)  also good for my doggie with very delicate thin skin (Shitz Zu)  ?</li>

            <li> Though it conditions  the hair really well and gives the hair a good shine, I don&#x27;t think it makes his hair feel smoother/softer.   </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is much easier to brush than when we used baby soap and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I can easily run a comb through her hair after her bath.</li>
            <li> LOVE the clean, fruity scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love that it is paraben free and teat free.  </li>
            <li> Even my hairstylist asks me what I use, because she says my hair is so sleek and strong.</li>
            <li> Even my hairstylist asks me what I use, because she says my hair is so sleek and strong.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and gentle on hairs!</li>
            <li> My 9-year-old has fine hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely so much less dry-and i am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo, for more than 5 years, It was my daughter&#x27;s first shampoo and now, my 2 years old son, uses it too, smells great, very mild, and</li>
            <li> products are paraben free</li>
            <li> It also seems to be 100% tear free.</li>
            <li> She has really fine hair that tangles super easy</li>
            <li> My son has very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> When I first used this in the shower, the first thing I noticed was the amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and not harsh.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I find that it has so much conditioner in it</li>
            <li> Lathers up well and rinses out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the shampoo has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out.</li>
            <li> received the product quickly and no spills [[ASIN:B000VOENEE L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo for</li>
            <li> I called Amazon and they were kind enough to send me a free replacement for it.</li>
            <li> so I bought this to have a quick all-in-one because he doesn&#x27;t like having his hair washed.</li>
            <li> I am fourteen years old, and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line, and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> With my daughters hair I had to use quite a bit more shampoo then normal in order to get it to lather.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old liked the smell so much she borrows it for her showers too!</li>
            <li> My hair is very delicate,,,it is fine and</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo for my hair besides Suave Naturals, hands down!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo for my hair besides Suave Naturals, hands down!</li>
            <li> My kids love the smell of the shampoo and how it leaves their hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> And the mango scent is fresh and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> so it makes bath time fun</li>
            <li> and, I constantly get compliments about how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li> The characters also add to the &#x27;fun&#x27; of hair washing.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no complaints; it smells good,</li>
            <li> My kids have fine Asian hair and comes out super shiny and smooth every time.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST shampoo I have used and it leaves her very thick hair incredibly soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> just spring right up.  </li>
            <li> Price was right and no complaints....buy it now or else</li>
            <li> new formula is also Paraben free.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, but you can&#x27;t smell it once the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> pre paraban free and now paraban free, and the product is the same either way).  </li>
            <li> Whenever I try to grab another shampoo, my kids throw an epic fit.</li>
            <li> The bottle looked pretty cute as well, and, I saw that it helped prevent split ends, dentangle hair, and add extra shine to hair, so, I thought \\&quot;Why</li>
            <li> ;) )</li>
            <li> Hmmm...where will I stash???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> However, after trying several &#x27;tear free&#x27; shampoos that weren&#x27;t really &#x27;tear free&#x27;</li>
            <li> A tad more pricier than what I used to pay back in Blighty where it&#x27;s pretty much on every supermarket/drugstore shelf.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son and daughter&#x27;s hair ends up clean and soft.</li>
            <li> When I applied this to my hair and scalp, it felt nice, smooth, thick, and creamy.</li>
            <li> but if your kid&#x27;s hair is really dry this will probably work better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out her skin like many brands.  </li>
            <li> It was soft, super sleek, and had the highest level of shine that I had ever seen.</li>
            <li> Overall, an amazing, great-smelling, and affordable 2-in-1 shampoo that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> Overall, an amazing, great-smelling, and affordable 2-in-1 shampoo that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my daughter who has straight stringy hair.</li>
            <li> And the kids really like the fragrance and the shape of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and leaves her hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t seem to condition at all.</li>
            <li> It also lathers really well too.</li>
            <li> I decided to find one that worked on hair and was gentle on the eyes.</li>
            <li> No matter how much goes in their eyes they just wipe their face and keep on playing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the only scent I can use,,,the others are too strong,,,,,,,,,i shampoo and enjoy.....</li>
            <li> Only this shampoo is deemed worthy of touching their silken locks all jammed up with all-day kid funk.</li>
            <li> It barely lathers, so it takes more shampoo to wash my child&#x27;s hair, and at a slightly higher price than other shampoos, I expected better.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the bottle is so freaking fantastic that it is also awesome when empty, as evidenced by the 5 or 6 empty fish shampoo containers that I&#x27;m constantly stepping on as I tried to wash their blessed, totally smelly heads.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles on Amazon, and both were only about 75% full.</li>
            <li> Price is decent if you subscribe to it.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair that looks thick</li>
            <li> throws out  600 &#x27;new&#x27; products at a time,,,change their formulas,,,,and have gone</li>
            <li> I have used various products from Burt&#x27;s Bees to Johnson and Johnson trying to keep my daughter&#x27;s hair clean, soft and just generally not a bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> So, if you are a young adult, or even an adult looking to use this shampoo, I&#x27;ll say go for it!</li>
            <li> So, if you are a young adult, or even an adult looking to use this shampoo, I&#x27;ll say go for it!</li>
            <li> after doing research i was so glad to see there were other options for my son&#x27;s hair that was so dry-</li>
            <li> (I am twelve years old.)</li>
            <li> I use this for my 2 year old.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> i wanted him to have baby soft hair again.</li>
            <li> his hair is still not baby soft</li>
            <li> I tried the Loreal kids shampoo for curly/wavy hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Even complete strangers ask me \\&quot;What do you use on your hair?</li>
            <li> My kiddos sensitive skin is not bothered by this either.</li>
            <li> is soft after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope the formula stay the same,,,,,,i check from my old</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a bottle saver),,,,,L&#x27;Oreal has been moving far ahead of Revlon,,,,,,,,(Revlon</li>
            <li> This surprised me because not one review mentioned having this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li> old with lots of hair.  </li>
            <li> and someone mentioned that you have to stop using baby shampoo at some point and switch to kids or adult shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo really smells great unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last on the hair once it is dry.  </li>
            <li> But for normal to thin hair I think you would be able to forgo the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it on both of my kids, my daughter has long, very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick course wavy/frizzy hair and it made my hair by far more manageable.</li>
            <li> We were having major knots.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> to work fine, but the container had less than expected product in it.</li>
            <li> When I blow-dried my hair on the cool setting as usual, I was so suprised with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I just shampoo, rinse, and let it dry naturally, and her natural curls</li>
            <li> Much prefer this one to all the other &#x27;flavours&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I still deep use deep repair afterwards,,,,you can wash your body with it,,, (like a gentle soap,,,....)  also good for my doggie with very delicate thin skin (Shitz Zu)  ?</li>
            <li> My daughter had a rash after using this product, and doesn&#x27;t have one when using generic ones, or any other shampoo so far.</li>
            <li> This leaves her hair very soft, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the curls.  </li>
            <li> She wanted her hair long</li>
            <li> Amazon delivered this in a timely manner but the cap of the bottle had cracked open due to which the shampoo had leaked in the plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> Only have to condition every other time when I use this one.</li>
            <li> this combines to a Naturally dry hair,,,(for some reason)  </li>
            <li> My already straight, thick, and shiny hair was shining like glass, and looked even sleeker!</li>
            <li> and I found that regular shampoo had a harsh effect on her hair.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was a little bit bigger, but other than that</li>
            <li> I cleans well and makes it a little easier to come my granddaughters long curley hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint and reason for giving it 4 stars was because I felt that it didn&#x27;t lather as well as other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> But, when I saw this in my local Walgreens one day, I decided to give it a shot, and at least try it.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 for my daughter&#x27;s hair I also use the conditioner from L&#x27;oreal Kids as it&#x27;s not enough as she has thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My son has thick, coarse, curly hair</li>
            <li> We used a different scent of the same brand for a while, but we came back to this one because it smells less artificial.</li>
            <li> I shampoo less</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> Even with thick long hair.</li>
            <li> i assumed that everyone just used that brand of shampoo for little kids</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again, but I am not impressed so far.</li>
            <li> what a waste that was!</li>
            <li> usually there are tons), and it is shiny and looks styled.  </li>
            <li> My childs hair is a bit hard to comb through after using tbis shampoo.</li>
            <li> But I think it stings my sons eyes because when I used it for him, he complained about it.</li>
            <li> She has thick curly hair and wanted a conditioner in her shampoo.</li>
            <li> This worked just as well; if not better, than my Suave Naturals shampoos/conditioners!</li>
            <li> I have tried literally every shampoo brand on the market, Tressemme, Matrix, Pantene, Garnier, Aussie, Aveda, Organix, and, I even went all out and blew right through my $60.00 of birthday money on stupid, useless Wen...</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical, because, after all, it was a kid&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is not full and is also very thin, leading a kid to spill a lot when they wash their hair.  </li>
            <li> but in reality is thin, just have lots of it, and curly.  </li>
            <li> We also use the Active Kids version of this that washes off that nasty Chlorine smell after swimming.</li>
            <li> As my daughters hair got longer, baby shampoo wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>

            <li> I like the smell. It makes my hair softer and smell better.  The container is cute.  (I am twelve years old.)</li>
            <li> received the product quickly and no spills [[ASIN:B000VOENEE L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo for Extra Shine, Orange-Mango Smoothie, 9-Fluid Ounce]] my grandchildren loves this</li>
            <li> My kids love the smell of the shampoo and how it leaves their hair so soft.  And it doesn&#x27;t sting when it accidentally get in their eyes.  I wish the bottle was a little bit bigger, but other than that, it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> As my daughters hair got longer, baby shampoo wasn&#x27;t cutting it. We were having major knots. Not fun. I decided to try this, and she picked the mango scent. I love it. I can easily run a comb through her hair after her bath. And the mango scent is fresh and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Not going to order this again.  It is not full and is also very thin, leading a kid to spill a lot when they wash their hair.  Not cool.</li>
            <li> I have recently received this shampoo and used it for my son a couple of times. Smells great,conditions hair. But I think it stings my sons eyes because when I used it for him, he complained about it. I could see that it stings, bcoz his eye had turned red.Having used Johnsons Baby No Tear Shampoo all these years makes the difference obvious. Though it conditions  the hair really well and gives the hair a good shine, I don&#x27;t think it makes his hair feel smoother/softer.   Amazon delivered this in a timely manner but the cap of the bottle had cracked open due to which the shampoo had leaked in the plastic packaging. I called Amazon and they were kind enough to send me a free replacement for it. Amazon Customer Service never disappoints.  Price is decent if you subscribe to it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 2 year old.  Conditions nicely and the smell is wonderful.  My 10 year old liked the smell so much she borrows it for her showers too!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my daughter who has straight stringy hair. It helped her hair look 100% better. In the meantime, I ran out of my shampoo so, I used hers......best hair day ever! I have very thick course wavy/frizzy hair and it made my hair by far more manageable. I&#x27;m not saying I threw out my straightening iron or anything but, it worked well. (Happy with the price too @ $3 a bottle)</li>
            <li> LOVE the clean, fruity scent of this shampoo. It lathers well and has become a household favorite. My husband likes it because of the nice but not overpowering mango scent.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  It smells very good and makes my kids hair smooth.  They actually ask me for the mango shampoo.</li>
            <li> Awesome 2 in 1 for kids. You wash with this thing: No tangles. Even with thick long hair. My kids have fine Asian hair and comes out super shiny and smooth every time. Can&#x27;t find it in Target, Walgreens, Walmart, but who cares? Amazon has it! A tad more pricier than what I used to pay back in Blighty where it&#x27;s pretty much on every supermarket/drugstore shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula is also Paraben free. I&#x27;m no health nut, but it might matter to some of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great. This one is Orange-Mango. Much prefer this one to all the other &#x27;flavours&#x27;. We also use the Active Kids version of this that washes off that nasty Chlorine smell after swimming. That one smells great too. Better than Eau-de-Piscine. Not keen on cuddling kiddies that smell of chemicals, or whatever else they tend to get into. This guarantees fragrant children... For  awhile anyway!</li>
            <li> Works well as a shampoo. Lathers up well and rinses out pretty easily. And the kids really like the fragrance and the shape of the bottle. Provides some entertainment in the bath tub.</li>
            <li> My 9-year-old has fine hair and I found that regular shampoo had a harsh effect on her hair. After reading several reviews of the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids hair care products, I decided to purchase the shampoo, conditioner, and swim shampoo. The shampoos are paraben-free and the results have been wonderful thus far. My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the shampoo has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out. I&#x27;m even using it myself. I just wish the range came in larger containers.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this shampoo.  It lathers well and leaves her hair very manageable.  She asked for more!  It will fit nicely in her stocking at Christmas.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and not harsh. Even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 for my daughter&#x27;s hair I also use the conditioner from L&#x27;oreal Kids as it&#x27;s not enough as she has thick hair.  But for normal to thin hair I think you would be able to forgo the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreals products are paraben free</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, but you can&#x27;t smell it once the hair is dry. I bought this for more of a conditioner to smooth out my daughter&#x27;s hair but it really didn&#x27;t seem to condition at all. The regular baby shampoo made her hair softer than this did. She has really fine hair that tangles super easy so I needed something that would help. This didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo that looks like a smiling fish. BOOM. MIC DROP. The fact that it resembles a smiling fish automatically makes it the best shampoo in or around the tub or shower area. Whenever I try to grab another shampoo, my kids throw an epic fit. Only this shampoo is deemed worthy of touching their silken locks all jammed up with all-day kid funk. Apparently the bottle is so freaking fantastic that it is also awesome when empty, as evidenced by the 5 or 6 empty fish shampoo containers that I&#x27;m constantly stepping on as I tried to wash their blessed, totally smelly heads. The fact that this magical shampoo bottle also contains shampoo that smells pretty good is a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old daughter. We love the smell of mango! it&#x27;s a good product overall. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good. Nice smell and gentle on hairs!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my elderly mother. She has thick curly hair and wanted a conditioner in her shampoo. This works wonderfully. It doesn&#x27;t hurt her eyes, keeps her hair from being frizzy and she loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, like that it is paraben free. Kids can open cap alone. Cannot find in stores, wish was not add on item.</li>
            <li> I love that it is paraben free and teat free.  And in smells really good too.</li>
            <li> my son&#x27;s hair was drying out by using johnson&#x27;s shampoo. i was at a loss what to do cuz i assumed that everyone just used that brand of shampoo for little kids -i wanted a company that would have \\&quot;no tears\\&quot;. after doing research i was so glad to see there were other options for my son&#x27;s hair that was so dry-i wanted him to have baby soft hair again. i love mango tango more than strawberry smoothie. strawberry smoothie is good too but if your kid&#x27;s hair is really dry this will probably work better. it&#x27;s amazing what a difference his hair is after using this shampoo. i am really happy with it- it also smells amazing and my son laughs whenever i say we are going to use \\&quot;mango tango\\&quot; so it makes bath time fun lol.  his hair is still not baby soft but it&#x27;s definitely so much less dry-and i am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Smells good - but that&#x27;s about the only good thing I have to say about it.  It barely lathers, so it takes more shampoo to wash my child&#x27;s hair, and at a slightly higher price than other shampoos, I expected better.  I ordered 2 bottles on Amazon, and both were only about 75% full.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for my toddler with very fine, curly hair.  I tried the Loreal kids shampoo for curly/wavy hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.  This leaves her hair very soft, and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the curls.  I no longer have to use a curl conditioner.  I just shampoo, rinse, and let it dry naturally, and her natural curls just spring right up.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite soap/shampoo for her daughter.  We keep some on hand all the time.  Smells great...works great!  Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out her skin like many brands.  Check it out.  Not all kids are the same so I hope it works for you, too!</li>
            <li> The shampoo really smells great unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last on the hair once it is dry.  I cleans well and makes it a little easier to come my granddaughters long curley hair although I also use a leave in.</li>
            <li> Got this for my great-granddaughter. She wanted her hair long and it was always so tangled when washed. Now my granddaughter even uses it on her own hair as well. She says it is wonderful and no tangles when wet</li>
            <li> My daughter had a rash after using this product, and doesn&#x27;t have one when using generic ones, or any other shampoo so far. Can&#x27;t really speak about how great it is for the hairs as we kind of focused on the rash.</li>
            <li> I love the scent--it&#x27;s so yummy!  Best of all, it does a great job on my girls&#x27; hair!  Definitely an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am fourteen years old, and I was trying to find the right kind of shampoo for my hair. I have tried literally every shampoo brand on the market, Tressemme, Matrix, Pantene, Garnier, Aussie, Aveda, Organix, and, I even went all out and blew right through my $60.00 of birthday money on stupid, useless Wen...ha! what a waste that was! My hair was very healthy when I switched to using only the Suave Naturals shampoo/conditioner line, and the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo as well. It was soft, super sleek, and had the highest level of shine that I had ever seen. But, when I saw this in my local Walgreens one day, I decided to give it a shot, and at least try it. I was a little bit skeptical, because, after all, it was a kid&#x27;s shampoo. The bottle looked pretty cute as well, and, I saw that it helped prevent split ends, dentangle hair, and add extra shine to hair, so, I thought \\&quot;Why not??\\&quot;. When I first used this in the shower, the first thing I noticed was the amazing scent. It smelled almost like my Suave Mango Mandarin Shampoo and Conditioner. When I applied this to my hair and scalp, it felt nice, smooth, thick, and creamy. It also lathers really well too. When I blow-dried my hair on the cool setting as usual, I was so suprised with the results of this product. This worked just as well; if not better, than my Suave Naturals shampoos/conditioners! My already straight, thick, and shiny hair was shining like glass, and looked even sleeker! I also found out that it made my hair more manageable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using this for about a month (along with my Suave shampoos/conditioners, of course! ;) ) and, I constantly get compliments about how nice my hair looks. Even my friends (who all use Wen) ask me constantly, \\&quot;What shampoo do you use on your hair? It looks so shiny!\\&quot;. I simply reply, \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Kids, and Suave\\&quot;, and they look at me, dumbfounded. Even complete strangers ask me \\&quot;What do you use on your hair? It looks so healthy!\\&quot;, and I reply with the same answer. Even my hairstylist asks me what I use, because she says my hair is so sleek and strong. She replied \\&quot;A Kid&#x27;s shampoo...and Suave....??\\&quot;, and I replied with a simple \\&quot;Yep\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, if you are a young adult, or even an adult looking to use this shampoo, I&#x27;ll say go for it! This is by far the best shampoo for my hair besides Suave Naturals, hands down! I would give this 10 stars if I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, an amazing, great-smelling, and affordable 2-in-1 shampoo that actually does what it says. I have a stockpile under my bathroom sink, and I just bought more today. Hmmm...where will I stash???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;)with the same answer.

            <li> We were a &#x27;whatever is on sale&#x27; family when it came to shampoo for the kiddos. However, after trying several &#x27;tear free&#x27; shampoos that weren&#x27;t really &#x27;tear free&#x27; I decided to find one that worked on hair and was gentle on the eyes. Loreal fits perfectly. My son and daughter&#x27;s hair ends up clean and soft. No matter how much goes in their eyes they just wipe their face and keep on playing. My kiddos sensitive skin is not bothered by this either. Additional bonus is the assortment of lovely scents these come in. The characters also add to the &#x27;fun&#x27; of hair washing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a great fresh citrus scent. I used it on both of my kids, my daughter has long, very curly hair. My son has very fine straight hair. It worked great for both. My only complaint and reason for giving it 4 stars was because I felt that it didn&#x27;t lather as well as other shampoos. With my daughters hair I had to use quite a bit more shampoo then normal in order to get it to lather.</li>
            <li> smells good - orange @ mango.&lt;br /&gt;hair is soft after using it.&lt;br /&gt;good price.&lt;br /&gt;overall a great product.&lt;br /&gt;i wish they had a similar conditioner</li>
            <li> This has been the perfect big-girl shampoo. My daughter&#x27;s hair is much easier to brush than when we used baby soap and it smells good too. It also seems to be 100% tear free.</li>
            <li> My kid picked out the flavor and is very pleased. Price was right and no complaints....buy it now or else</li>
            <li> My son has thick, coarse, curly hair so I bought this to have a quick all-in-one because he doesn&#x27;t like having his hair washed. It&#x27;s ok, but I find that it has so much conditioner in it that I can&#x27;t actually tell if it&#x27;s all rinsed out because it almost feels greasy. It smells great and may work for some people, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again..</li>
            <li> I have used various products from Burt&#x27;s Bees to Johnson and Johnson trying to keep my daughter&#x27;s hair clean, soft and just generally not a bird&#x27;s nest. This is THE BEST shampoo I have used and it leaves her very thick hair incredibly soft and easy to comb. I often use it in combination with a leave-in conditioner and I have absolutely no complaints; it smells good, a little goes a long way and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> My 2-year-old loves this shampoo.  It does not seem to burn his sensitive eyes and smells great.  We used a different scent of the same brand for a while, but we came back to this one because it smells less artificial.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo, for more than 5 years, It was my daughter&#x27;s first shampoo and now, my 2 years old son, uses it too, smells great, very mild, and my kids and I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very delicate,,,it is fine and blonde,,,also wavy,,,,,all this combines to a Naturally dry hair,,,(for some reason)  I shampoo less now,,,,,and I use this shampoo.  I still deep use deep repair afterwards,,,,you can wash your body with it,,, (like a gentle soap,,,....)  also good for my doggie with very delicate thin skin (Shitz Zu)  ?sp.  yes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the only scent I can use,,,the others are too strong,,,,,,,,,i shampoo and enjoy.....I hope the formula stay the same,,,,,,i check from my old bottle,,,(since i&#x27;m a bottle saver),,,,,L&#x27;Oreal has been moving far ahead of Revlon,,,,,,,,(Revlon throws out  600 &#x27;new&#x27; products at a time,,,change their formulas,,,,and have gone Downhil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work fine, but the container had less than expected product in it. I probably won&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again, but I am not impressed so far. This surprised me because not one review mentioned having this problem.</li>
            <li> My kids loved it. It smells great, i just wish they would make the conditioner seperate. My childs hair is a bit hard to comb through after using tbis shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this product for years (pre paraban free and now paraban free, and the product is the same either way).  I&#x27;m an adult and I love what it does for my hair.  I have the kind of hair that looks thick but in reality is thin, just have lots of it, and curly.  This hair is great for removing frizz and making it manageble.  Now, here is why I really love it.  I have a 21 mo. old with lots of hair.  I thought her hair was just unruly until I was reading online and someone mentioned that you have to stop using baby shampoo at some point and switch to kids or adult shampoo.  Turns out that is correct.  Literally after one shampoo I saw a difference.  NO knots whatsoever (and usually there are tons), and it is shiny and looks styled.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use after swimming. The kids love the smell, and it got the chlorine out and helps with the combing. Only have to condition every other time when I use this one. Much better than others we&#x27;ve tried. Ultra swim is also a very good one.</li>
