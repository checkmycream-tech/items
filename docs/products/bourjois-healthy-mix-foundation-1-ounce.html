            <li>i think it is a very good foundation, i love the medium coverage it has, and the demi matte finish is beautiful, and i think you can build it...</li>
            <li>I saw this on a top 10 best foundations list online.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation it goes on great and has great coverage.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this foundation from beauty gurus on YouTube</li>
            <li>I use a makeup brush to blend it in and It covers nicely and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>- I am usually a light beige in most makeups; but, I went with the Vanilla color which is one shade lighter and it was a perfect match.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>But boy does it work amazingly.</li>
            <li>A nice alternative when I don&#x27;t feel like using BB cream.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST foundation!  </li>
            <li>(Also, the vanilla is a color match to the Ivory to Fair #10 in the Neutrogena healthy skin enhancer - if that</li>
            <li>I liked the consistency and the wear.</li>
            <li>So that was really nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>I reached out to this seller to ask a quick question &amp; they are very kind &amp; prompt.</li>
            <li>Love this as much or more than my favorite luxury brand!</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fruity smell which is nice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lovely foundation</li>
            <li>The coverage could have been better, but it was still buildable.</li>
            <li>and i love the glow it gives to my skin.</li>
            <li>but next time i&amp;#34;ll purchase a shade darker for a perfect match.</li>
            <li>I really love this foundation..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the Healthy Mix Foundation.</li>
            <li>Hopefully  I&#x27;m able to use this vendor again as the shade (vanilla)</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most foundations, so I was a bit worried taking a chance on this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the smooth application</li>
            <li>Love the color Vanille for light skin.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Has really benefited my skin and makes a very smooth finish that looks and stays put!  </li>
            <li>but I mix it with a slightly darker foundation that I already have and its perfect.</li>
            <li>light coverage.</li>
            <li>but this applied fairly smoothly except on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous coverage.</li>
            <li>Overall, great foundation..</li>
            <li>However I ordered 1 shade too light</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly and lasts for the 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and has not made me break out at all.</li>
            <li>You would not want to buy this product if you want medium to significant coverage.</li>
            <li>in combination with my wet Real Techniques beauty sponge this foundation goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li>I get a medium to full coverage with this which I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It is good value for money as similar foundations sell for multiples of the price of this foundation.</li>
            <li>This shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been very interested in trying this foundation for awhile now.</li>
            <li>I have the powder from this company also and love all the products thus far!</li>
            <li>Leave it to me to fall in love with a foundation you can only get easily in Europe.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I chose the right color.</li>
            <li>This is okay tho since I don&#x27;t plan on wearing this product on my face anywhere near 16 hours.</li>
            <li>Two thin coats (drying in between) gives me a flawless face.</li>
            <li>But still worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and light like a tinted moisturizer but the coverage is decent.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by Lisa Eldridge, make-up artist, as a good, natural, light to medium-coverage (build-able) for skin tending toward dry.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to blend, leaves a nice finish and is neither dried out nor dewy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for everyday make up!</li>
            <li>Looks amazing on my skin but isn&#x27;t long wear if you have oily skin like me.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the foundation itself, it looks very natural on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different shade than the healthy mix serum.  </li>
            <li>I ordered some and it covers very well.</li>
            <li>I hope this continues to be available on Amazon because I definitely will purchase it again and again!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light, I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing anything but still has enough coverage!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>But, honestly, unless you have a very warm skin tone, this is crazy yellow.</li>
            <li>My skin is on the cool side of neutral, and this foundation was made for people with straight up yellow skin.</li>
            <li>Especially with a beauty blender or buffed in for a more sheer application.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>However this shade was too dark for me, so I gave it to my mom for her to enjoy.</li>
            <li>Loooove this foundation for my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Iam 41 years old.</li>
            <li>You only need a pea sized drop to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating for my dry skin...</li>

            <li> Very hydrating for my dry skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> My forehead must be extra dry.  </li>
            <li> The product came 2 weeks earlier than expected (the cali/oregon area), and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> but it is not meant for oily or combination skin, it does wear off through out the day, i mean it just dissappear, and it makes me look very oily...</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> I do not believe the 16 hour wear claim as after only 8 hours of wear time the foundation started to look a little patchy as it sat on my skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 star is it took a little over 3 weeks for delivery.</li>
            <li> I spent what seemed like forever trying to figure out what color to buy based on online color palates.  </li>
            <li> Good.a little bit dry.</li>
            <li> I think they are slightly darker than other make up colors</li>
            <li> I believe it came in a little under two.</li>
            <li> Not sure about that.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to this foundation.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The label seemed to peeling off in a weird way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I do like the color and finish, but it arrived with a broken seal and it smells awful.</li>

            <li> A nice alternative when I don&#x27;t feel like using BB cream.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating for my dry skin...in combination with my wet Real Techniques beauty sponge this foundation goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li> has a great fruity smell! light coverage. easy to apply. perfect for day to day occasions.</li>
            <li> Great blendable coverage and smells great.  No breakouts, doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing any foundation.  Such a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real thing. Not impressed. The label seemed to peeling off in a weird way.</li>
            <li> i think it is a very good foundation, i love the medium coverage it has, and the demi matte finish is beautiful, and i think you can build it... but it is not meant for oily or combination skin, it does wear off through out the day, i mean it just dissappear, and it makes me look very oily...</li>
            <li> I have been very interested in trying this foundation for awhile now. I am beyond happy that I have!! This foundation is so beautiful on the skin. Especially with a beauty blender or buffed in for a more sheer application. Great for dryer skin types. I love this product &amp; will never be without it again!! I reached out to this seller to ask a quick question &amp; they are very kind &amp; prompt.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation it goes on great and has great coverage. It color is lighter then I was expecting but I mix it with a slightly darker foundation that I already have and its perfect. I would definatley order again but I would get a shade or 2 darker. (I purchased #52)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different shade than the healthy mix serum.  It&#x27;s orange and I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I do like the color and finish, but it arrived with a broken seal and it smells awful. Literally like rotten fruit. I put it on over an hour ago and I can still smell that gross smell. I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to this foundation. I will keep using it over the next couple of weeks and see if the foundation makes up for the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This is awesome foundation. I saw this on a top 10 best foundations list online. It was resonably priced. I ordered some and it covers very well. I have the powder from this company also and love all the products thus far!</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin but this applied fairly smoothly except on my forehead.  My forehead must be extra dry.  I get a medium to full coverage with this which I wanted.  The color matched my skin perfect.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>

I think they are slightly darker than other make up colors - I am usually a light beige in most makeups; but, I went with the Vanilla color which is one shade lighter and it was a perfect match.

It has a light fruity smell which is nice.  I use a makeup brush to blend it in and It covers nicely and feels good on my skin.  I hope this continues to be available on Amazon because I definitely will purchase it again and again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight foundation with medium coverage that lets your skin breath than that&#x27;s the foundation for you</li>
            <li> I loved this foundation! it&#x27;s great for everyday make up! it&#x27;s so light, I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing anything but still has enough coverage!  PERFECT !!!</li>
            <li> Love this as much or more than my favorite luxury brand!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the foundation itself, it looks very natural on. However this shade was too dark for me, so I gave it to my mom for her to enjoy. I&#x27;m an nc15 in MAC if that gives you an idea. This shade would be best for 20-25 perhaps? If I can find it in a lighter shade I would purchase. Like I said I gave it away, I do not plan on returning b/c it&#x27;s a lovely foundation and I found someone who needed it.</li>
            <li> Good.a little bit dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the cool side of neutral, and this foundation was made for people with straight up yellow skin. I liked the consistency and the wear. The coverage could have been better, but it was still buildable. But, honestly, unless you have a very warm skin tone, this is crazy yellow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year. I like the fact that it can&#x27;t be seen &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is the perfect amount of dewiness and coverage.  It makes my skin look flawless and lasts all day.  I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this foundation from beauty gurus on YouTube and so i decided to try it out for myself. I&#x27;m pleased with the smooth application and i love the glow it gives to my skin. I do not believe the 16 hour wear claim as after only 8 hours of wear time the foundation started to look a little patchy as it sat on my skin. This is okay tho since I don&#x27;t plan on wearing this product on my face anywhere near 16 hours. Overall, great foundation.. but next time i&amp;#34;ll purchase a shade darker for a perfect match.</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation.. However I ordered 1 shade too light so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It goes on easy and lasts for hours. it doesn&#x27;t crack or get oily looking. Very good foundation. Iam 41 years old.</li>
            <li> This is a great Foundation that blends well into your skin.</li>
            <li> Best foundation ever.</li>
            <li> This shipped quickly. The packaging was in great condition. I&#x27;m in love with the Healthy Mix Foundation. It feels fresh and light like a tinted moisturizer but the coverage is decent. Hopefully  I&#x27;m able to use this vendor again as the shade (vanilla) I use is not always in stock at Asos. Leave it to me to fall in love with a foundation you can only get easily in Europe.</li>
            <li> Like the way this make up looks on.  goes on smoothly and lasts for the 8 hour work day. Radiant?  Not sure about that.  Love the color Vanille for light skin.  I gave it a four star because it does not have a lot of coverage.  You would not want to buy this product if you want medium to significant coverage.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Delivered very quickly. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most foundations, so I was a bit worried taking a chance on this one. But boy does it work amazingly. I LOVE it and have found nothing wrong with it. It goes on smooth, and has not made me break out at all. In addition, while the shipping says 2-3 weeks. I believe it came in a little under two. So that was really nice</li>
            <li> Looks amazing on my skin but isn&#x27;t long wear if you have oily skin like me.</li>
            <li> The product came 2 weeks earlier than expected (the cali/oregon area), and was well packaged. You only need a pea sized drop to cover your whole face. Coverage is sheer but buildable. Two thin coats (drying in between) gives me a flawless face. This foundation also smells very nice! I will be buying this again.(:</li>
            <li> This is one of the best foundation I have had</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Very nice. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is it took a little over 3 weeks for delivery. But still worth the wait.</li>
