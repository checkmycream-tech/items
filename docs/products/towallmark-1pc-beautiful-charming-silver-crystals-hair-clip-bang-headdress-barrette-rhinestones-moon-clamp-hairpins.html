            <li>So cute.</li>

            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s really cute</li>
            <li>I just wish it was better made, otherwise, I would love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered 5 more to give away</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>They love them.  </li>
            <li>It would work better if clipped over a rubber band or something.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty and the quality is also good.</li>
            <li>Also if that part does break it is easy to replace.</li>
            <li>On fine hair it will slide out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this will work for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I really need to order one or more to keep!</li>
            <li>does not look cheap.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Unique product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really beautiful, VERY SPARKLY, I only wear at night.</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair into an interesting shape as it slides into the moon, which is really unusual.</li>
            <li>but will look good with my white hair.  </li>
            <li>Quality is not bad.</li>
            <li>I think its really more decorative than functional and a few bobby pins would be a good idea to use with this clip</li>
            <li>Cute and a pretty hair clip  , looks exactly as described in the picture....</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty ans just look like the picture.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and have received a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Pretty but cheaply made.</li>
            <li>clips are a great way to add a little bling to your look without having to do an up do.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Surprisingly price gives the impression that cheap, a little bit of weight is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Its alittle heavy but still a great clip</li>
            <li>Worth for the price paid</li>
            <li>nice and simple.</li>
            <li>It is bigger than it looks in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t slip and holds my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>nice, but a long delivery time</li>
            <li>Ok can wear only rarely</li>
            <li>it is really pretty, and holds well in my hair.</li>
            <li>Looks very elegant on a little kid</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Its very cute but its so heavy that it does not stay in my hair that well.</li>
            <li>It is a fairly large piece as well.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair and this clip holds it all day long with no problem.</li>
            <li>(1) you cannot put too much hair into it, it will not snap shut.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this hair piece!</li>
            <li>I, as usual, march to my own drummer.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t expect perfection for such a low price, it could be better quality.</li>
            <li>It cant really hold too much hair its really just a clip in a moon shape, but I like it because I was looking for something different.</li>
            <li>she loves it and gave me a really big smile ...</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, a little weighty but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>so it did bend a bit but only after continuous use and it was easy to bend back into shape with having no wear damage on the clip part.</li>
            <li>Easy off and on while not being too heavy to wear all day.</li>
            <li>This is a tiny hair accessory, its really small but still looks nice.</li>
            <li>I love little blings in my hair when I wear it up in a french roll or pony tail...</li>
            <li>No missing gem.</li>
            <li>The clasp part is made out of soft metal</li>
            <li>Arrived early.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty so 3 stars but loose..</li>
            <li>Came on the first day it was expected for delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already broken at the first try right after opening the box!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this barrette wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold a small amount of hair.</li>

            <li> A little larger than I expected, but I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Shipping takes about 20 days long too.</li>
            <li> have long hair -to</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive, but we were in no hurry.</li>
            <li> Very Poor Quality, it&#x27;s so cheaply made that it will pull the hair off when you try to use it.</li>
            <li> Pretty but very delicate.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but a bit heavy for my thin hair</li>
            <li> Also versatile- wear it in the office for a little bling or out at night dancing to keep your bangs back, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> If it were only missing one, that might work, but missing 4 stones, makes it very obvious.</li>
            <li> Not too small, not too big.</li>
            <li> Just like the picture and very firm when I open and close it.</li>
            <li> and I like to use this clip to keep my hair out of my eyes but still wear it mostly down.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair tight without falling out.</li>
            <li> Arrived with half the stones missing..</li>
            <li> Its very study and the rhinestones shiny like crazy.</li>
            <li> Too heavy to stay in your hair</li>
            <li> Few thoughts..</li>
            <li> The problem is that it arrived with 4 stones missing.</li>
            <li> It is a metal barrette and I am not sure it will hold.</li>
            <li> Difficult to open the clip</li>
            <li> so this is a blast from my past as a lot of people feel this is old-fashioned...like my grandchildren.  </li>
            <li> It took forever to get here, but duh</li>
            <li> but my hair is thick</li>
            <li> You do need at least medium to thick hair to wear it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> I defiantly wont  wear it  every day, as I would be afraid that the stones would eventually fall out, but I will be wearing it often.</li>
            <li> OMG :(  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wear it :(</li>
    </ol>

            <li> OMG :(  It&#x27;s already broken at the first try right after opening the box! I don&#x27;t want to give even one star, but I can&#x27;t open the writing box. I ordered on April 7 and I received on April 27. Shipping takes about 20 days long too.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but my hair is thick so I have to use Bobby pins</li>

            <li> I have fine hair and this barrette wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold a small amount of hair.</li>
            <li> Difficult to open the clip</li>
            <li> This is really cute! It doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of hair, it&#x27;s meant to wear as an accent. It pulls the hair into an interesting shape as it slides into the moon, which is really unusual.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best looking hair clips I&#x27;ve found on Amazon. You do need at least medium to thick hair to wear it. I&#x27;m so happy with it that I will order more for friends!</li>
            <li> Came on the first day it was expected for delivery. Was in good shape upon arrival. I have pretty fine hair and this clip holds it all day long with no problem. Easy off and on while not being too heavy to wear all day. The clasp part is made out of soft metal so it did bend a bit but only after continuous use and it was easy to bend back into shape with having no wear damage on the clip part. Also if that part does break it is easy to replace. Very pretty and have received a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my wife and she is very happy with the product the only thing that i gave 4 star is becoz of the quality of the clip. otherwise its a nice piece</li>
            <li> Cute and a pretty hair clip  , looks exactly as described in the picture.... Suitable for wedding or parties !!!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly price gives the impression that cheap, a little bit of weight is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Very cute and I love it</li>
            <li> Very Poor Quality, it&#x27;s so cheaply made that it will pull the hair off when you try to use it.</li>
            <li> Clip keeps popping off. Does not hold hair properly.</li>
            <li> Pretty but cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Just like the picture and very firm when I open and close it. The only issue is that one of the rhinestones had fallen off when I opened the package but otherwise it&#x27;s really cute and I&#x27;m happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful piece of hair jewelry but the first day I wore it, one of the beads fell off.... It is a good size for coarser  hair types.  I just wish it was better made, otherwise, I would love it.</li>
            <li> This is really good looking.  I let my hairdresser have the one that I ordered.  I really need to order one or more to keep!</li>
            <li> This barette is pretty but does not hold very good.</li>
            <li> Even prettier in person!</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here, but duh it&#x27;s from China so I was expecting that. When it did arrive I was so happy!&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair -to my waist- and I like to use this clip to keep my hair out of my eyes but still wear it mostly down. Also versatile- wear it in the office for a little bling or out at night dancing to keep your bangs back, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this hair piece!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very cute!  Holds my hair tight without falling out. Arrived early.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> I like it. Not too small, not too big. I ordered 5 more to give away</li>
            <li> Its alittle heavy but still a great clip</li>
            <li> Arrived with half the stones missing.. now i have a craft project.</li>
            <li> This is a tiny hair accessory, its really small but still looks nice. It cant really hold too much hair its really just a clip in a moon shape, but I like it because I was looking for something different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful.  I love it. Unique product.</li>
            <li> Bought one for each daughter.  They love them.  All stones were in place and the slip is snug that it stays in the hair.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I expected, but I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;They clips are a great way to add a little bling to your look without having to do an up do.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> beautiful... My hair is thin so I could not get it to stay in my hair... gave it to my niece. she loves it and gave me a really big smile ... good quality and wonderful sparkle ..</li>
            <li> Very pretty and very small...but will look good with my white hair.  I love little blings in my hair when I wear it up in a french roll or pony tail...I am 71 so this is a blast from my past as a lot of people feel this is old-fashioned...like my grandchildren.  ha ha  I, as usual, march to my own drummer.  Love the shineys!</li>
            <li> Very nice. On time delivery</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip.  My daughter loves it and wears it daily!</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip! It&#x27;s so pretty, and it looks great in my hair. It is bigger than it looks in the picture, but it doesn&#x27;t slip and holds my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip. Identical to picture</li>
            <li> nice, but a long delivery time</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She loves sparkly hair clips. She is 6 and has tons of hair. It took a long time to arrive, but we were in no hurry. The problem is that it arrived with 4 stones missing. I checked the envelope and they were not inside, therefore, they fell out prior to shipping, not in transit. While I don&#x27;t expect perfection for such a low price, it could be better quality. If it were only missing one, that might work, but missing 4 stones, makes it very obvious.</li>
            <li> Looked great, but wouldn&#x27;t say put in my hair.  It would work better if clipped over a rubber band or something.</li>
            <li> Its very cute but its so heavy that it does not stay in my hair that well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Pretty and the quality is also good.</li>
            <li> Ok can wear only rarely</li>
