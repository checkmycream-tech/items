            <li>excellent product which I received the next day</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>I love Mint Asure.</li>
            <li>I used to like this product better when it was called Breath Asure.  </li>
            <li>or so I&#x27;ve been told! : )</li>
            <li>I have bought this product for many years.</li>
            <li>We have used Rainbow Light Mint Asure for over 10 years and nothing else works like it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Refreshing and gives you more self confidence .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>If you love garlic, you need Mint Assure.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s my truthful review.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;you will have to use more like ten(10) or twelve(12) but they work.</li>
            <li>Now I can eat more roasted garlic.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This supplement helps you smell better all over, both your breath and your body.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I have them with me --</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for myself, but those around me say there is no odor in the morning too.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>these are more for &amp;#34;the moment&amp;#34; mints.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>actually I have perfect breath with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and is the best product, you don&#x27;t need mints or constantly chewing gum to camouflage your breath, this is better,  </li>
            <li>This stuff works like a magic wand  :))</li>
            <li>ME &amp; MY HUSBAND LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>This Mint Asure helps because I love garlic and onions in my food.</li>
            <li>I guess it works for most people, but not for people like me.</li>
            <li>We love garlic, and almost no amount of rinsing, brushing, flossing and tongue scraping will get rid of the vapors escaping your stomach.  </li>
            <li>the freshness lasts more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the original &amp;#34;non mint&amp;#34; formula better</li>
            <li>Parsley, the essential ingredient, is very good for you anyway, so all the better.</li>
            <li>Well worth the inexpensive cost!!</li>
            <li>I am glad that I can now easily get them through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>A great product that naturally neutralizes garlic and onion odors.  </li>
            <li>i wish it were more widely available</li>
            <li>This is good stuff because it works remarkably well and appears to have absolutely no side effects.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to take</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to keep in a purse or pocket.</li>
            <li>and these were delivered promptly in good condition at a decent price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hilarious, but true.  </li>
            <li>I am a HUGE garlic/Onion eater and my husband is not, so I take a couple of these and he is no longer offended by my vampire fighting breath.</li>
            <li>The makers of breath assure know this, understood this, and then proceeded to make the most effective ALL NATURAL (And</li>
            <li>About the seller, the product arrived on time and well packed, I am happy with the service he provided, I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>I never felt comfortable about my breath after eating spicy foods until I found Mint Assure.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>one or two of these will clean the moth and breath very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is highly effective at absorbing offensive breath odors.</li>
            <li>I believe I would swallow as many as 3 or 4 and my breath still wasn&#x27;t fresh.  </li>
            <li>I loved it but so far no results yet</li>
            <li>These mints do not work like the original breath</li>
            <li>It takes about 30 minutes to work, but then he&#x27;s fresh as a daisy!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Read up on this, sounds like who ever caused the whoha over the original product.  </li>
            <li>Might be effective to others, but for me no effect what so ever &amp;#34;THUMBS DOWN&amp;#34; try different product instead :)</li>
            <li>and I have crystal clean breath.  </li>
            <li>I love these mint pills since you have guarantee fresh, clean breath smell right from your stomach and out.</li>
            <li>good internal deodorant</li>
            <li>Since I love to talk all the time, I am very concious about not wanting to offend anyone.  </li>
            <li>B001ET6Y56 Rainbow Light Mint Asure Fresh Breath, 160-Count Capsules (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does work under most circumstances.</li>
            <li>The process was fast and easy and I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It used to be you could pretty much count on most products</li>
            <li>I have an unfortunately strong reaction to garlic and this is the only product that counteracts it (I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
            <li>I am more confident about my breath when I am with other people and the special man in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a million for Breath assure.</li>
            <li>These little capsule are great breath freshener, no matter what U ate, onion, garlic, etc</li>
            <li>Used this for few years now, they work great</li>
            <li>The product is effective and works internally.</li>
            <li>and you get fresh breath that lasts.</li>
            <li>They arrived as expected and have already put them to good use.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Mint Fresh assure for years and stands by it.  </li>
            <li>I am always concerned about receiving something expired or near expiration, but today is December 2013 and package received expires March 2016 - more than fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is going to be offensive when you burp, take these and your burps will smell like fresh parsley - and not whatever you ate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell fresh.</li>
            <li>my mouth feels fresh for about 20 minutes...</li>
            <li>I have used Breath Assure for many years, pretty much since it first came on the market.</li>
            <li>OUR BREATHS ARE FRESH.</li>
            <li>These mints do  a good job as expected.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend these for anyone who just wants fresh breath...</li>
            <li>You might as well buy regular mints at the store, they work better.</li>
            <li>it really helps with fresh breath and digestion.</li>
            <li>This is the exact product you purchase in stores.  </li>
            <li>In the summer when working in hot weather I take 3 a day.</li>
            <li>Had I gotten the &amp;#34;bad packaging&amp;#34; in the first box of the 3-pack, I might have been able to get my money back.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I take 3 capsules every morning before I go to work - and 3 more later</li>
            <li>As the vodka commercial used to say: &amp;#34;It will leave you breathless.&amp;#34; Very true; try it yourself, please.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without them now, they really really work!!</li>
            <li>They are very tiny and easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>I only take half of what the direction recommends but still works great.</li>
            <li>This pure magic product is a very important part of your everyday life, especially if you are a drinker.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really get a sense that its working unless i take like 5 of them.</li>
            <li>I even had a flight attendant friend look for it in China and Japan.</li>
            <li>Now, everyone wants them.  </li>
            <li>follow up with two more during or after the meal if the onion or garlic is UNcooked.</li>
            <li>It really helps control odor from the inside out.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Every now and then a product comes along that works, really works</li>
            <li>Work but need a lot to really work</li>
            <li>perhaps they were too much</li>
            <li>This is a ABSOLUTE must have.</li>
            <li>If there are any sceptics out there, trust me this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and they really work.</li>
            <li>Really seems to &amp;#34;neutralize&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Price on Amazon (if I get free shipping) is cheaper than when it&#x27;s on sale in a local drugstore.</li>
            <li>Even after eating raw onions, which I love!</li>
            <li>The parsley oil settles my stomach better than Tums or other similiar products.</li>
            <li>I love to eat many foods that contain garlic - and often afterwards pay the price of the crazy full feeling for hours - a couple of these before and after eating (Italian...Chinese...</li>
            <li>this is a better solution to keep your breath under control when the food you eat contains  onions, garlic and other spices or after drinking coffee etc.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this product based on the positives reviews.  </li>
            <li>Use regularly, or when you have a special need, like when traveling on business.</li>
            <li>I really hoped they would help out when I am in public and needed that burst of fresh breath without gum or a mint.</li>
            <li>Different but luckily still effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you suffer from stomach problems I would highly recommend trying these to see if they work for you too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love these little capsules.</li>
            <li>Best product ever for anyone concerned about bad breath.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are perfect, so this is not for bad teeth halitosis.</li>
            <li>They are the best item for bad breath.</li>
            <li>With only 3 gels at day of Mint Asure leaves my mouth smelling fresh all day..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has no negative side effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing how something so small and simple could help so much.</li>
            <li>liked the product enough that I looked for it for a long time, and finally found that they changed their name to what it is now from Breath Assure.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Can eat raw onions and garlic without worry -- these magic capsules neutralize those offensive odors from the inside</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re fine, but, wonder why they changed their coating slightly.</li>
            <li>Rainbow Light has proven reliable and quick, offering a package size (160-count) for this product that is very hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li>I love this product but now it is very hard to find or the price has gone up so much</li>
            <li>I have lingering troubles with certain foods leaving a \\&quot;bad taste\\&quot; in my mouth from acid reflux, and these have always been a great help to me.</li>
            <li>After any digestively-stinky meal, just pop 2-3 of these babies and within an hour, your breath is clear of any evidence of the stink you ate.</li>
            <li>Product arrived complete and soon after order placement.</li>
            <li>My friends and I recently had a very garlicky/spicy dinner together.  </li>
            <li>this stuff makes my breath almost completely odorless.</li>
            <li>All natural,</li>
            <li>Mint Breath Soft caps.</li>
            <li>I tried them and I did not work as far as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t chew the caplets - parsley seed oil is pretty bitter.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re these tiny little capsules, filled with a herb flavored / scented oil.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years, and was super bummed when it disappeared out of stores a few years ago.</li>
            <li>This became very apparent when my wife said one day, &amp;#34;You smell like beer.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>These are small enough to carry discreetly in your pocket or purse, and are easy to swallow without water if you need to.  </li>
            <li>Three of these little tablets and your breath is kissably fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say that it doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the old Breath Asure.</li>
            <li>Its benefit is apparent when, well, you burp.  </li>
            <li>One or two small Mint Asure tablets seem to provide longer clean breath control than simply masking the breath odor with gum or mints.</li>
            <li>you take three of the little caplets within about 1/2 hour of eating strong food, there is little trace of the odor in the morning.</li>

            <li> Let&#x27;s be candid.  </li>
            <li> I tried them before and was pleased with the results so these were purchased because of the good price.  </li>
            <li> but I would rather be nice to talk to than have spongebob breath.</li>

            <li> Sincerely, Marla, Phoenix, AZ</li>
            <li> excellent product which I received the next day</li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> I love Mint Asure.</li>
            <li> I used to like this product better when it was called Breath Asure.  </li>
            <li> or so I&#x27;ve been told! : )</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for many years.</li>
            <li> We have used Rainbow Light Mint Asure for over 10 years and nothing else works like it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Refreshing and gives you more self confidence .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> If you love garlic, you need Mint Assure.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s my truthful review.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;you will have to use more like ten(10) or twelve(12) but they work.</li>
            <li> Now I can eat more roasted garlic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This supplement helps you smell better all over, both your breath and your body.  </li>
            <li> I always make sure I have them with me --</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for myself, but those around me say there is no odor in the morning too.</li>
            <li> Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> these are more for &amp;#34;the moment&amp;#34; mints.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> actually I have perfect breath with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and is the best product, you don&#x27;t need mints or constantly chewing gum to camouflage your breath, this is better,  </li>
            <li> This stuff works like a magic wand  :))</li>
            <li> ME &amp; MY HUSBAND LOVE THESE.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> This Mint Asure helps because I love garlic and onions in my food.</li>
            <li> I guess it works for most people, but not for people like me.</li>
            <li> We love garlic, and almost no amount of rinsing, brushing, flossing and tongue scraping will get rid of the vapors escaping your stomach.  </li>
            <li> the freshness lasts more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the original &amp;#34;non mint&amp;#34; formula better</li>
            <li> Parsley, the essential ingredient, is very good for you anyway, so all the better.</li>
            <li> Well worth the inexpensive cost!!</li>
            <li> I am glad that I can now easily get them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> A great product that naturally neutralizes garlic and onion odors.  </li>
            <li> i wish it were more widely available</li>
            <li> This is good stuff because it works remarkably well and appears to have absolutely no side effects.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to take</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to keep in a purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> and these were delivered promptly in good condition at a decent price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hilarious, but true.  </li>
            <li> I am a HUGE garlic/Onion eater and my husband is not, so I take a couple of these and he is no longer offended by my vampire fighting breath.</li>
            <li> The makers of breath assure know this, understood this, and then proceeded to make the most effective ALL NATURAL (And</li>
            <li> About the seller, the product arrived on time and well packed, I am happy with the service he provided, I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I never felt comfortable about my breath after eating spicy foods until I found Mint Assure.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> one or two of these will clean the moth and breath very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is highly effective at absorbing offensive breath odors.</li>
            <li> I believe I would swallow as many as 3 or 4 and my breath still wasn&#x27;t fresh.  </li>
            <li> I loved it but so far no results yet</li>
            <li> These mints do not work like the original breath</li>
            <li> It takes about 30 minutes to work, but then he&#x27;s fresh as a daisy!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Read up on this, sounds like who ever caused the whoha over the original product.  </li>
            <li> Might be effective to others, but for me no effect what so ever &amp;#34;THUMBS DOWN&amp;#34; try different product instead :)</li>
            <li> and I have crystal clean breath.  </li>
            <li> I love these mint pills since you have guarantee fresh, clean breath smell right from your stomach and out.</li>
            <li> good internal deodorant</li>
            <li> Since I love to talk all the time, I am very concious about not wanting to offend anyone.  </li>
            <li> B001ET6Y56 Rainbow Light Mint Asure Fresh Breath, 160-Count Capsules (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does work under most circumstances.</li>
            <li> The process was fast and easy and I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It used to be you could pretty much count on most products</li>
            <li> I have an unfortunately strong reaction to garlic and this is the only product that counteracts it (I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
            <li> I am more confident about my breath when I am with other people and the special man in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a million for Breath assure.</li>
            <li> These little capsule are great breath freshener, no matter what U ate, onion, garlic, etc</li>
            <li> Used this for few years now, they work great</li>
            <li> The product is effective and works internally.</li>
            <li> and you get fresh breath that lasts.</li>
            <li> They arrived as expected and have already put them to good use.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Mint Fresh assure for years and stands by it.  </li>
            <li> I am always concerned about receiving something expired or near expiration, but today is December 2013 and package received expires March 2016 - more than fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is going to be offensive when you burp, take these and your burps will smell like fresh parsley - and not whatever you ate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell fresh.</li>
            <li> my mouth feels fresh for about 20 minutes...</li>
            <li> I have used Breath Assure for many years, pretty much since it first came on the market.</li>
            <li> OUR BREATHS ARE FRESH.</li>
            <li> These mints do  a good job as expected.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend these for anyone who just wants fresh breath...</li>
            <li> You might as well buy regular mints at the store, they work better.</li>
            <li> it really helps with fresh breath and digestion.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product you purchase in stores.  </li>
            <li> In the summer when working in hot weather I take 3 a day.</li>
            <li> Had I gotten the &amp;#34;bad packaging&amp;#34; in the first box of the 3-pack, I might have been able to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I take 3 capsules every morning before I go to work - and 3 more later</li>
            <li> As the vodka commercial used to say: &amp;#34;It will leave you breathless.&amp;#34; Very true; try it yourself, please.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without them now, they really really work!!</li>
            <li> They are very tiny and easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> I only take half of what the direction recommends but still works great.</li>
            <li> This pure magic product is a very important part of your everyday life, especially if you are a drinker.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really get a sense that its working unless i take like 5 of them.</li>
            <li> I even had a flight attendant friend look for it in China and Japan.</li>
            <li> Now, everyone wants them.  </li>
            <li> follow up with two more during or after the meal if the onion or garlic is UNcooked.</li>
            <li> It really helps control odor from the inside out.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Every now and then a product comes along that works, really works</li>
            <li> Work but need a lot to really work</li>
            <li> perhaps they were too much</li>
            <li> This is a ABSOLUTE must have.</li>
            <li> If there are any sceptics out there, trust me this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and they really work.</li>
            <li> Really seems to &amp;#34;neutralize&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Price on Amazon (if I get free shipping) is cheaper than when it&#x27;s on sale in a local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Even after eating raw onions, which I love!</li>
            <li> The parsley oil settles my stomach better than Tums or other similiar products.</li>
            <li> I love to eat many foods that contain garlic - and often afterwards pay the price of the crazy full feeling for hours - a couple of these before and after eating (Italian...Chinese...</li>
            <li> this is a better solution to keep your breath under control when the food you eat contains  onions, garlic and other spices or after drinking coffee etc.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product based on the positives reviews.  </li>
            <li> Use regularly, or when you have a special need, like when traveling on business.</li>
            <li> I really hoped they would help out when I am in public and needed that burst of fresh breath without gum or a mint.</li>
            <li> Different but luckily still effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you suffer from stomach problems I would highly recommend trying these to see if they work for you too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love these little capsules.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for anyone concerned about bad breath.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are perfect, so this is not for bad teeth halitosis.</li>
            <li> They are the best item for bad breath.</li>
            <li> With only 3 gels at day of Mint Asure leaves my mouth smelling fresh all day..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has no negative side effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing how something so small and simple could help so much.</li>
            <li> liked the product enough that I looked for it for a long time, and finally found that they changed their name to what it is now from Breath Assure.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> Can eat raw onions and garlic without worry -- these magic capsules neutralize those offensive odors from the inside</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re fine, but, wonder why they changed their coating slightly.</li>
            <li> Rainbow Light has proven reliable and quick, offering a package size (160-count) for this product that is very hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I love this product but now it is very hard to find or the price has gone up so much</li>
            <li> I have lingering troubles with certain foods leaving a \\&quot;bad taste\\&quot; in my mouth from acid reflux, and these have always been a great help to me.</li>
            <li> After any digestively-stinky meal, just pop 2-3 of these babies and within an hour, your breath is clear of any evidence of the stink you ate.</li>
            <li> Product arrived complete and soon after order placement.</li>
            <li> My friends and I recently had a very garlicky/spicy dinner together.  </li>
            <li> this stuff makes my breath almost completely odorless.</li>
            <li> All natural,</li>
            <li> Mint Breath Soft caps.</li>
            <li> I tried them and I did not work as far as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t chew the caplets - parsley seed oil is pretty bitter.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re these tiny little capsules, filled with a herb flavored / scented oil.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years, and was super bummed when it disappeared out of stores a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This became very apparent when my wife said one day, &amp;#34;You smell like beer.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are small enough to carry discreetly in your pocket or purse, and are easy to swallow without water if you need to.  </li>
            <li> Three of these little tablets and your breath is kissably fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say that it doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the old Breath Asure.</li>
            <li> Its benefit is apparent when, well, you burp.  </li>
            <li> One or two small Mint Asure tablets seem to provide longer clean breath control than simply masking the breath odor with gum or mints.</li>
            <li> you take three of the little caplets within about 1/2 hour of eating strong food, there is little trace of the odor in the morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product without doing much research, and I&#x27;m still not really sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> At long last I&#x27;ve found this product again.</li>
            <li> My last package had 3 different sheets that the center tabs were melted in place or heat fused to the foil.  </li>
            <li> In the future, I may just pop ALL of them loose &amp; keep them in a prescription bottle or something.  </li>
            <li> HAS DID WHAT SO MANY OTHER BREATH FRESHNERS HAVE FAILED.</li>
            <li> When I returned a week later and opened&lt;br /&gt;one of the boxes, it was empty.</li>
            <li> it stays with me all night long!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wake up with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I had to scrape the foil off &amp; then pick &amp; pry the tablet loose.  </li>
            <li> I also need to take more capsules in order for my bad breath to go away.</li>
            <li> You just suck the minty coating off, which takes a few seconds, then swallow the tiny caplets.</li>
            <li> I used to be so cautious and careful about eating food with garlic and onions, I don&#x27;t have to anymore.</li>
            <li> The delivery of this item was as expected but it just doesnt work for me.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a big fan of even the plain ole breath assure in their ability to cut onion and garlic breath.</li>
            <li> pop a few and have no odor all day long...</li>
            <li> It is to lessen/eliminate breath odors from garlic, onions or other spicy foods.</li>
            <li> If you drink alcohol the night before and don&#x27;t take Mint Asure in the morning, you are at risk of being discovered as a possible alcoholic (or so someone says).</li>
            <li> Extremely convenient</li>
            <li> This is meant for odoriferous foods like garlic and onions, not bad breath from a dirty or infected mouth or stomach or sinus</li>
            <li> I do not know the potency has changed or some other factor has altered their effectiveness, but i am actively looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> I usually take 3 at one time and then another 3 a half hour later or as needed.</li>
            <li> I usually take three of these beforehand and take a few along with me when these social occasions arise.  </li>
            <li> no anything less than expected!</li>
            <li> I love the taste of garlic and onions, but I hate the lingering after effects.  </li>
            <li> I have very good dental habits but still suffer from bad breath which is a bummer because I never know if it&#x27;s bad unless someone (usually my wife) tells me.  </li>
            <li> Review broken down into 3 key parts...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and three little tabs does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I mean, its not bad for what it is - but what it is and what i paid was disappointing.</li>
            <li> These little guys are miracle workers.</li>
            <li> but the rest was just a waste.</li>
            <li> I eat onions and garlic almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have for years.</li>
            <li> A few of these pills neutralizes any odor.</li>
            <li> They work wonders -- take them after eating garlic, and even heavy garlic goes away.</li>
            <li> I even got a few friends hooked on them.</li>
            <li> Which is completely frustrating since I cant buy them local</li>
            <li> WE KEEP THEM IN OUR HOME YEAR ROUND.</li>
            <li> Something so few people still understand.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works - and it is pretty much impossible to find anyplace except online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of them just plain did not come out.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> After my meal I take two or three of these minty capsules, once the minty flavor melts down I swallow down the tiny capsule jell with water and in less then twenty minutes controls my bad breath.  </li>
            <li> The Capsules work from your stomach where your bad breath really comes from.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m not likely to repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> A small change -</li>
            <li> , I am double angry when I find some</li>
            <li> complain to Amazon or Amazon seller because it is way past the deadline.  </li>
            <li> THE STINCH IS NO MORE.</li>
            <li> It works as described and no more smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they had to go and change their name.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Some people have a sensitive nose that can detect your bad breath.</li>
            <li> So now I order at LEAST three boxes at a time</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 15 years.  </li>
            <li> When the old &amp;#34;Breath Asure&amp;#34; product was taken off the market I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> These do what they say- make my breath feel fresh when I eat garlic or anything that I am afraid will cause bad breath.</li>
            <li> I always had bad breath and this is the only thing that ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of spicy food and seasoning but had the bad breath that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> Then if I get a bad sheet again I cant complain instantly.</li>
            <li> within couple days of using it, bad breath dissapeared and hasn&#x27;t came back since.</li>
            <li> 15-20 minutes later, NO ONE is going to smell bad breath on you.</li>
            <li> They have a little mint flavor coating that helps some with bad breath, except for the heavy spiced foods.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty nasty after you get through the candy</li>
            <li> I have a stomach condition that causes me to digest foods VERY slowly.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy them because they work for me, but I am BEYOND ANGRY that I cant use every tablet I pay for because of sloppy packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li> you suffer from bad breath, get the orabrush, floss, and use an electric toothbrush and wahlah no more gum or use of products like these.</li>
            <li> Everyone was skeptical until they realized how well they work.  </li>
            <li> My daughters and I are absolutely addicted to mint assures!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was chagrined and</li>
            <li> One of the worst side effects from this is that food stays in my stomach for a very long time and if I&#x27;ve eaten something with garlic, onions, broccoli, etc...</li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than being with friends or a group of people and worrying about offending someone with bad breath.  </li>
            <li> They not only cure bad breath, but they also cure the nasty after taste of garlic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid of offending someone with bad breath.</li>
            <li> Almost all of bad breath comes from the stomach (unless one has diseased or rotting teeth and/or gums).  </li>
            <li> Having bad breath can kill you on a sales call, and you can&#x27;t walk in chewing gum.  </li>
            <li> so I NEVER have to worry about bad breath.</li>
            <li> a must have if bad breath is an issue for you....</li>
            <li> Eliminates bad breath triggered by foods.  </li>
            <li> shell.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it would help with the bad breath but you can still smell bad breath after taking the mint.</li>
            <li> I use 2 each moring and don&#x27;nt worry about bad breath the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist, and people ask me all the time about what to do about bad breath.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover up bad breath</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad breath</li>
            <li> even unnatural) product to neutralize bad breath.  </li>
            <li> My wife and daughter always tell me i have bad breathe, so I took this product per the directions</li>
            <li> and i still have bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I have bad allergies and also helps with my allergy-breath in this area as well.</li>
            <li> These babies absorb any bad breath</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Those four words saved me a lifetime of grief.</li>
            <li> My dad has the worst bad breath every that cannot be concealed by gum, mints or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It takes that bad taste out of your mouth too!</li>
            <li> i hated chewing gum but when i was on the road and eating i had to until i got this.  </li>
            <li> THE COMBINATION CREATE A AWFUL SMELL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Only product we&#x27;ve found that works on my dragon breath!</li>
            <li> good internal deodorant</li>
            <li> Excellent price and service.</li>
            <li> Forget mints or gums masking your breath and not taking care of \\&quot;the source\\&quot;...I love these mint pills since you have guarantee fresh, clean breath smell right from your stomach and out. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Rainbow Light has proven reliable and quick, offering a package size (160-count) for this product that is very hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> These save my life. My dad has the worst bad breath every that cannot be concealed by gum, mints or mouthwash. These neutralized him and make it so we can stand to be around him.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for anyone concerned about bad breath.  Replaced Breath Assure.  I always order this since I can&#x27;t find it on any store shelves in my area.</li>
            <li> I loved it but so far no results yet</li>
            <li> Product arrived complete and soon after order placement. The product is effective and works internally. A great product, parsley seed and sunflower oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now and have found it to be a life saver. I have a stomach condition that causes me to digest foods VERY slowly. One of the worst side effects from this is that food stays in my stomach for a very long time and if I&#x27;ve eaten something with garlic, onions, broccoli, etc... it stays with me all night long! Mint Asure helps make those displeasing tastes go away before my problems even begin. I have to take about 5 or 6 of these tiny pills after I eat spicy meals but it does the trick. If you suffer from stomach problems I would highly recommend trying these to see if they work for you too. I would also recommend these for anyone who just wants fresh breath...my husband uses them when we eat out and he says they work great for him as well.</li>
            <li> These mints do not work like the original breath Assure which actually work. A couple of time I did get a couple that seem to work but the rest was just a waste.</li>
            <li> Received this on time and it works great.  It is easy to take and you get fresh breath that lasts.</li>
            <li> In sales you always need to make good impressions.  Having bad breath can kill you on a sales call, and you can&#x27;t walk in chewing gum.  Take a couple of these 5-10 minutes before you meet with your prospect, and you wont have to worry about your breath.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Mint Asure for years! I eat onions and garlic almost everyday.  Since I love to talk all the time, I am very concious about not wanting to offend anyone.  I never have to worry about morning breath!!  I know Mint Asure Capsules works internally.  Thank you \\&quot;Rainbow Light and \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; for the great price and shipping convenience!!   Sincerely, Marla, Phoenix, AZ</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001ET6Y56 Rainbow Light Mint Asure Fresh Breath, 160-Count Capsules (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps my breath and stomach after onions and garlic.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Have been using it for years, and was super bummed when it disappeared out of stores a few years ago. So now I order at LEAST three boxes at a time so I don&#x27;t run out. Can eat raw onions and garlic without worry -- these magic capsules neutralize those offensive odors from the inside so I NEVER have to worry about bad breath. Even after eating raw onions, which I love! Am going to buy as &amp;#34;stocking stuffers&amp;#34; for Christmas this year!!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and three little tabs does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> Might be effective to others, but for me no effect what so ever &amp;#34;THUMBS DOWN&amp;#34; try different product instead :)</li>
            <li> These are small enough to carry discreetly in your pocket or purse, and are easy to swallow without water if you need to.  They have a little mint flavor coating that helps some with bad breath, except for the heavy spiced foods.&lt;br /&gt;I tried them out hoping they would work with and without eating spicy foods that would leave my breath toxic and they didn&#x27;t work too well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they aren&#x27;t made to work for everyone&#x27;s body. I really hoped they would help out when I am in public and needed that burst of fresh breath without gum or a mint.</li>
            <li> I cant&#x27; seem to find this product in stores like I used to.  If you are a garlic lover like I am, then you shouldn&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> You might as well buy regular mints at the store, they work better. They don&#x27;t have a lasting effect when used as intended.</li>
            <li> excellent product which I received the next day</li>
            <li> The day I found this product was the best day of my life.  I always had bad breath and this is the only thing that ever worked for me.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. I truly recommend it. This is my second order and definitely not the last.</li>
            <li> Excellent value! Great product</li>
            <li> Love these little capsules. I&#x27;m always afraid of offending someone with bad breath. This gives me the security every morning that my breath will be fine for the day!</li>
            <li> Happy to see this product is still around.</li>
            <li> I love these things. I have been using them for years. They work.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Using this product is the only way my husband can eat something that has garlic in it.  He loves Italian, but no one can be around him if he eats it.  Mint Asure allows him to eat some items that have some garlic in it.  I keep it on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> These are the bomb! If you are looking for something to eliminate garlic breath, 10 minutes after you eat it...this is the product for you. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> wonderful product...a must have if bad breath is an issue for you....pop a few and have no odor all day long...</li>
            <li> Helps to keep your breath neutralized without any odor through out the day. Great product</li>
            <li> i hated chewing gum but when i was on the road and eating i had to until i got this.  it seems to neutralize your breath - even after you eat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without them now, they really really work!!</li>
            <li> use often. they work folks!</li>
            <li> Used this for few years now, they work great</li>
            <li> Love this product..Have been buying it for years..but where did it go? It&#x27;s no longer in any store I used to buy it at...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this intermittently for onion/garlic breath, and noticed that when I do, I don&#x27;t have any body odor for about 36 hours. My teeth and gums are perfect, so this is not for bad teeth halitosis. It is to lessen/eliminate breath odors from garlic, onions or other spicy foods. Parsley, the essential ingredient, is very good for you anyway, so all the better. Use regularly, or when you have a special need, like when traveling on business.</li>
            <li> These work internally so anything you eat, like garlic or onions..poof all gone and you have nice breath. I usually take 3 at one time and then another 3 a half hour later or as needed.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re fine, but, wonder why they changed their coating slightly. The delivery was great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product without doing much research, and I&#x27;m still not really sure how I feel about it. They&#x27;re these tiny little capsules, filled with a herb flavored / scented oil. I guess the standard dosage / serving is 2-3 capsules - but I don&#x27;t really get a sense that its working unless i take like 5 of them. No wonder why they sell them in packs of 160 count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I guess they work - they do leave a minty aftertaste that seems to be coming from my throat. But it lasts for like 10 mins max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have googled breath assure prior to purchasing - had I, I likely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this. I mean, its not bad for what it is - but what it is and what i paid was disappointing. Needless to say, I&#x27;m not likely to repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love Mint Asure. The process was fast and easy and I will buy this product again. I use it everyday and have for years. It is something I keep in my purse, at work and at home.</li>
            <li> Amazing how something so small and simple could help so much. They work for me. I take two with my vitamins in the morning, and those around me say they work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. unfortunately it is hard to find in the stores. Thankfully Amazon carries it. and at a good price. The Capsules work from your stomach where your bad breath really comes from. it also has a mint coating for your mouth.</li>
            <li> At long last I&#x27;ve found this product again. I&#x27;ve been asking around for it in stores and searching the web. I even had a flight attendant friend look for it in China and Japan. No luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say that it doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the old Breath Asure. The smell and after taste is slightly different. I also need to take more capsules in order for my bad breath to go away. A small change - I assume the formula is different. Different but luckily still effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found it.</li>
            <li> After reading the Amazon reviews, I decided to give these mints a try.  I love the taste of garlic and onions, but I hate the lingering after effects.  These actually take the taste away.  My friends and I recently had a very garlicky/spicy dinner together.  Since we were going out after eating, we were concerned that our breath was going to kill some people.  I gave everyone 4 of these capsules.  Everyone was skeptical until they realized how well they work.  Now, everyone wants them.  They not only cure bad breath, but they also cure the nasty after taste of garlic.</li>
            <li> I used to like this product better when it was called Breath Asure.  Within and hour this product stops working or so I&#x27;ve been told! : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various types of breath freshners in this form, this one don&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for many years. it really helps with fresh breath and digestion. I love it and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> One of our secrets to marital bliss.  Eliminates bad breath triggered by foods.  Life is too short NOT to eat garlic and onions!</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
            <li> Have used these for over 15 years.  from back when they were called &#x27;breathasure&#x27; without the mint flavor.  use two of these before meals with these components and you will NOT be exhaling the aftereffects of such consumption.  follow up with two more during or after the meal if the onion or garlic is UNcooked.</li>
            <li> Have used Mint Asure for years.  It really helps control odor from the inside out.</li>
            <li> We have used Rainbow Light Mint Asure for over 10 years and nothing else works like it!  Well worth the inexpensive cost!!</li>
            <li> I love this product but now it is very hard to find or the price has gone up so much, you would think it is gold.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  A great product that naturally neutralizes garlic and onion odors.  I am a big fan of spicy food and seasoning but had the bad breath that comes with it.  A few of these pills neutralizes any odor.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, works even after garlic...</li>
            <li> Great Value. Really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Refreshing and gives you more self confidence .&lt;br /&gt;I can eat anything without worrying about my breath.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my breath almost completely odorless. It takes that bad taste out of your mouth too! I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mint Asure multi-packs. They arrived as expected and have already put them to good use. I use the mints every day for self satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I have lingering troubles with certain foods leaving a \\&quot;bad taste\\&quot; in my mouth from acid reflux, and these have always been a great help to me. If I&#x27;ve eaten something that I know will cause a problem for me, I take several of these, and my problem is gone. I am glad that I can now easily get them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Great breathe cleanser. If you love garlic, you need Mint Assure. Purchasing this through Amazon saved me time and money. A great convenience.</li>
            <li> Effective breath mint.</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchases</li>
            <li> They are very tiny and easy to swallow. They also great taste, I love them and want to chew but it says don&#x27;t chew. Gave some to a friend and he loved them.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Mint Fresh assure for years and stands by it.  It has parsley in it and helps freshen your breath.</li>
            <li> Mint assures are one of the best products on the market. You simply swallow 3-4 capsules and you will eliminate garlic and onion breath in about 30 minutes. They are also great if you have an upset stomach. The parsley oil settles my stomach better than Tums or other similiar products. My daughters and I are absolutely addicted to mint assures!</li>
            <li> this is the only substance besides crystal assure that has ever helped my garlic breath.  i wish it were more widely available</li>
            <li> Review broken down into 3 key parts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;Received on-time. Packaged nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller:&lt;br /&gt;As described by Seller.  This is the exact product you purchase in stores.  I am always concerned about receiving something expired or near expiration, but today is December 2013 and package received expires March 2016 - more than fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been an odd-ball, but I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one that mentions the following.  For me, the product does not &amp;#34;freshen breath&amp;#34;, aside from 5 initial seconds given from the mint coating on the gel capsules.  For me, it does not make my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; breath any more pleasant.  Its benefit is apparent when, well, you burp.  It&#x27;s hilarious, but true.  Let&#x27;s be candid.  When you eat something you know is going to be offensive when you burp, take these and your burps will smell like fresh parsley - and not whatever you ate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and that&#x27;s my truthful review.  Hope it helps.</li>
            <li> Love this product, keeps your breath smelling great.  If you have garlic or onion&lt;br /&gt;you will have to use more like ten(10) or twelve(12) but they work.</li>
            <li> With only 3 gels at day of Mint Asure leaves my mouth smelling fresh all day..Don&#x27;t forget to brush your teeth&#x27;s every day.</li>
            <li> This product actually works, we have been using it for years and will continue.</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty nasty after you get through the candy shell.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it would help with the bad breath but you can still smell bad breath after taking the mint.</li>
            <li> Mint-Asure is the marriage saver!!! My hubby has been using Mint-Asure after meals for almost 20 years. It is PERFECT. No matter how &amp;#34;flavorful&amp;#34; a meal has been, there is no hint of garlic or spices on his breath afterwards. It takes about 30 minutes to work, but then he&#x27;s fresh as a daisy!</li>
            <li> Fresh breath is always a good thing! Now I can eat more roasted garlic.</li>
            <li> This is what I use as deodorant. I take 2 a day and don&#x27;t have to wear deodorant. Smell fresh. In the summer when working in hot weather I take 3 a day.</li>
            <li> Good quality parsley oil capsules coated with mint flavoring (for taste before swallowing them) work well and these were delivered promptly in good condition at a decent price</li>
            <li> Mint assure is a great product if you want to feel secure about your breath, it works great anytime, even at night or in the morning, I take 3 before I go to bed and I don&#x27;t wake up with a dry mouth. I would recommend it to anyone who think that it is an internal problem as Mint Assure works from the inside. About the seller, the product arrived on time and well packed, I am happy with the service he provided, I will definitely buy from this seller again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Found it in a local store, and then they quit carrying and said they could not order it anymore.  I went online and found the product.  I would be lost without them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This supplement helps you smell better all over, both your breath and your body.  It doesn&#x27;t cancel out all odors if you eat a lot of garlic and curry like I do, but it helps.</li>
            <li> I have an unfortunately strong reaction to garlic and this is the only product that counteracts it (I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love to eat many foods that contain garlic - and often afterwards pay the price of the crazy full feeling for hours - a couple of these before and after eating (Italian...Chinese...Middle Eastern)and the challenge is greatly lessened or reduced.  Just parsley oil - like restaurants often put to garnish - is SPECIFIC for garlic (well, and onions, which are closely related) All natural, and it obviously helps the breath as well as the digestive tract</li>
            <li> Mint Breath Soft caps. They are the best item for bad breath. They are good tasteing. They can be swallowed hole are hold in mouth until they melt. I use 2 each moring and don&#x27;nt worry about bad breath the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Garlic/Onion lovers take notice. These little guys are miracle workers. After any digestively-stinky meal, just pop 2-3 of these babies and within an hour, your breath is clear of any evidence of the stink you ate. I am a HUGE garlic/Onion eater and my husband is not, so I take a couple of these and he is no longer offended by my vampire fighting breath.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like these. They work wonders -- take them after eating garlic, and even heavy garlic goes away. I always make sure I have them with me -- the car, my office, home, etc.</li>
            <li> This product was great!  THe product came on time. thank you for the wonderful service! I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Garlic lovers rejoice!</li>
            <li> This product really works. I&#x27;m a dental hygienist, and people ask me all the time about what to do about bad breath. This is meant for odoriferous foods like garlic and onions, not bad breath from a dirty or infected mouth or stomach or sinus infections.&lt;br /&gt;If you take three of the little caplets within about 1/2 hour of eating strong food, there is little trace of the odor in the morning. I use it mostly for myself, but those around me say there is no odor in the morning too. Just don&#x27;t chew the caplets - parsley seed oil is pretty bitter. You just suck the minty coating off, which takes a few seconds, then swallow the tiny caplets. I seldom need water to swallow them because they are so tiny and slippery.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;It has no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to keep in a purse or pocket.</li>
            <li> These do what they say- make my breath feel fresh when I eat garlic or anything that I am afraid will cause bad breath. Easy and convenient to use and taste good. Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> As promised. Quality product, well packaged.</li>
            <li> I used to be a big fan of even the plain ole breath assure in their ability to cut onion and garlic breath. I even got a few friends hooked on them. Now, I&#x27;ve no way to know what caused this, but they don&#x27;t seem to work like they used too when could get them at the local pharmacy and health food stores. I do not know the potency has changed or some other factor has altered their effectiveness, but i am actively looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> these are more for &amp;#34;the moment&amp;#34; mints.  i used them after every meal...my mouth feels fresh for about 20 minutes...then its back to chewing gum.  the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Breath Assure and now Mint Assure for years. I love the product. It really does work under most circumstances. Especially helpful on vacation.</li>
            <li> no anything less than expected!</li>
            <li> I think it is the parsley oil that makes it so spot on. It doesn&#x27;t cover up bad breath it eliminates it with a vengeance. I have been using it for years and am never disappointed. If you can&#x27;t buy it, buy parsley.</li>
            <li> Best product ever to get rid if garlic and onion breath.</li>
            <li> Mint Assure works great I never felt comfortable about my breath after eating spicy foods until I found Mint Assure.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am more confident about my breath when I am with other people and the special man in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a million for Breath assure.</li>
            <li> One or two small Mint Asure tablets seem to provide longer clean breath control than simply masking the breath odor with gum or mints.</li>
            <li> Every now and then a product comes along that works, really works and this is one of those. It used to be you could pretty much count on most products did what they advertised, but it&#x27;s not like that anymore. I liked the original &amp;#34;non mint&amp;#34; formula better but this is a great product. I have used Breath Assure for many years, pretty much since it first came on the market.</li>
            <li> I used to be so cautious and careful about eating food with garlic and onions, I don&#x27;t have to anymore. After my meal I take two or three of these minty capsules, once the minty flavor melts down I swallow down the tiny capsule jell with water and in less then twenty minutes controls my bad breath.  I don&#x27;t have bad breath actually I have perfect breath with it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years and is the best product, you don&#x27;t need mints or constantly chewing gum to camouflage your breath, this is better,  this is a better solution to keep your breath under control when the food you eat contains  onions, garlic and other spices or after drinking coffee etc. etc.. This stuff works like a magic wand  :))</li>
            <li> This pure magic product is a very important part of your everyday life, especially if you are a drinker. If you drink alcohol the night before and don&#x27;t take Mint Asure in the morning, you are at risk of being discovered as a possible alcoholic (or so someone says). Some people have a sensitive nose that can detect your bad breath. If this happens at work, you could lose your job. This became very apparent when my wife said one day, &amp;#34;You smell like beer.&amp;#34; Whoa! Those four words saved me a lifetime of grief. I had been taking Mint Asure every now and then, but with those words, I began taking two capsules every morning and no one was the wiser. Savor the coated mint in your mouth and then swallow with a glass of water. Repeat in about 4 to 6 hours. As the vodka commercial used to say: &amp;#34;It will leave you breathless.&amp;#34; Very true; try it yourself, please. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works - and it is pretty much impossible to find anyplace except online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the tablets are shrink wrapped in this foil coating - you have to pop them out through the foil packing.  My last package had 3 different sheets that the center tabs were melted in place or heat fused to the foil.  I had to scrape the foil off &amp; then pick &amp; pry the tablet loose.  Some of them just plain did not come out.  Which is completely frustrating since I cant buy them local, I am double angry when I find some I cannot use at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt find a website or anything for the actual manufacturer, so I have no place to formally complain to (except here)...I will continue to buy them because they work for me, but I am BEYOND ANGRY that I cant use every tablet I pay for because of sloppy packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant complain to Amazon or Amazon seller because it is way past the deadline.  Had I gotten the &amp;#34;bad packaging&amp;#34; in the first box of the 3-pack, I might have been able to get my money back.  In the future, I may just pop ALL of them loose &amp; keep them in a prescription bottle or something.  Then if I get a bad sheet again I cant complain instantly.</li>
            <li> ME &amp; MY HUSBAND LOVE THESE. WE KEEP THEM IN OUR HOME YEAR ROUND. WE HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THEM KNOWING OUR BREATHS ARE FRESH.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Take it after eating garlic and your spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend will thank you.....</li>
            <li> MINT ASURE HAS DID WHAT SO MANY OTHER BREATH FRESHNERS HAVE FAILED. I TAKE VARIOUS MEDICATIONS AND THE COMBINATION CREATE A AWFUL SMELL. WITH MINT ASURE THE STINCH IS NO MORE.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law told me about these years ago and I wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  They actually seem to help settle your stomach too.</li>
            <li> When I received my order (pack of 3) I hastily put away the boxes away&lt;br /&gt;and left on a business trip.  When I returned a week later and opened&lt;br /&gt;one of the boxes, it was empty. Needless to say, I was chagrined and&lt;br /&gt;felt cheated. Watch out for this company if you decide to order from them.</li>
            <li> These little capsule are great breath freshener, no matter what U ate, onion, garlic, etc... one or two of these will clean the moth and breath very quickly. Love them.</li>
            <li> These mints do  a good job as expected.  I tried them before and was pleased with the results so these were purchased because of the good price.  Will keep buying</li>
            <li> When the old &amp;#34;Breath Asure&amp;#34; product was taken off the market I was disappointed.  I&#x27;m assuming that this is made by the same manufacturer as they look the same and work equally as well.  Not easy to find in retail stores.  I have very good dental habits but still suffer from bad breath which is a bummer because I never know if it&#x27;s bad unless someone (usually my wife) tells me.  Nothing is worse than being with friends or a group of people and worrying about offending someone with bad breath.  I usually take three of these beforehand and take a few along with me when these social occasions arise.  They work!</li>
            <li> It works as described and no more smell. within couple days of using it, bad breath dissapeared and hasn&#x27;t came back since. I only take half of what the direction recommends but still works great.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that gets rid of my husbands onion  and garlic breath. We used to use it when it was Breath Assure. When we ran out we couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores even as Mint Assure.</li>
            <li> Used these years ago when they were called BreathAssure, but the store where I bought them quit carrying them.  Let me just say THESE WORK!  So glad I was able to find them again!  Very satisfied with product and delivery.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Work but need a lot to really work</li>
            <li> Almost all of bad breath comes from the stomach (unless one has diseased or rotting teeth and/or gums).  Something so few people still understand.  The makers of breath assure know this, understood this, and then proceeded to make the most effective ALL NATURAL (And even unnatural) product to neutralize bad breath.  Go ahead, eat chunks of garlic, doritos, or almost anything else.  Pop two or three capsules and swallow them.  15-20 minutes later, NO ONE is going to smell bad breath on you.</li>
            <li> The delivery of this item was as expected but it just doesnt work for me.  My wife and daughter always tell me i have bad breathe, so I took this product per the directions and i still have bad breath.  The only thing that works for me is Closys Breath Spray... I can wake up in the morning and shoot 3 sprays in my mouth and I have crystal clean breath.  My wife hates when I use it in public... but I would rather be nice to talk to than have spongebob breath.</li>
            <li> Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to many of my friends. This Mint Asure helps because I love garlic and onions in my food. I have bad allergies and also helps with my allergy-breath in this area as well.</li>
            <li> Read up on this, sounds like who ever caused the whoha over the original product.  I read how to get rid of the odors that cause the &amp;#34;garlic breath&amp;#34;, and  thats what i see in the product ingredients.  Not sure why they had to go and change their name.  Nor do I understand why someone went after them except perhaps they were too much competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product enough that I looked for it for a long time, and finally found that they changed their name to what it is now from Breath Assure.</li>
            <li> This is a ABSOLUTE must have. If there are any sceptics out there, trust me this stuff really works. I will always keep this with me from now on.</li>
            <li> Best breath freshener I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Garlic&amp;#34; is my middle name.  But no one will ever be the wiser with Mint Asure.  It is highly effective at absorbing offensive breath odors.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff because it works remarkably well and appears to have absolutely no side effects.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My order arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> This always comes on time and fulfills its use</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product based on the positives reviews.  I tried them and I did not work as far as I can remember.  I believe I would swallow as many as 3 or 4 and my breath still wasn&#x27;t fresh.  Big disappointment.  I guess it works for most people, but not for people like me.</li>
            <li> We love garlic, and almost no amount of rinsing, brushing, flossing and tongue scraping will get rid of the vapors escaping your stomach.  Three of these little tablets and your breath is kissably fresh.</li>
            <li> I swear by these and take them wherever I go. Extremely convenient and they really work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 15 years.  I take 3 capsules every morning before I go to work - and 3 more later if I go to a party or out to dinner.  Really seems to &amp;#34;neutralize&amp;#34; my breath.  Price on Amazon (if I get free shipping) is cheaper than when it&#x27;s on sale in a local drugstore.</li>
            <li> These babies absorb any bad breath</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about this product. You def need to take 4 or 5 at a time and not chew! plus swallow it with water. Your breath does seem a bit fresher after you swallow it but I don&#x27;t this the freshness lasts more than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you suffer from bad breath, get the orabrush, floss, and use an electric toothbrush and wahlah no more gum or use of products like these.</li>
            <li> I like to tell myself this works, but I obviously don&#x27;t think so 100% or I would remember to take it after I eat mexican or spicy foods.</li>
