            <li>I take 1/2 the recommended dosage for a pump up that equals about 2 cups of good coffee.</li>

            <li>Amazing product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>But this stuff is amazing, it taste like drinking a jolly rancher.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li>It gave me a nice buzz</li>
            <li>With it, my own motivation began to decline.</li>
            <li>Drink it, love it, it&#x27;s gorgeous on the tongue.</li>
            <li>Warm up for 30 min</li>
            <li>The tingles are nice  </li>
            <li>I liked the raspberry taste.</li>
            <li>a good diet plan is more important than anything</li>
            <li>Tastes great and really improves my workout!</li>
            <li>Watermelon is my favorite flavor.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>OK, I have been working out for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting if the trend continues.  </li>
            <li>I just want to get the most out of the time I have in the gym and</li>
            <li>I originally ordered the strawberry flavor and was sent the watermelon and to my surprise I love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite pre-workout product.  </li>
            <li>I can see why this is a top pre workout.</li>
            <li>a lil more an hour in</li>
            <li>I love this pre-workout.</li>
            <li>And the watermelon flavor is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>Watermelon taste is tolerable (honestly, if your using a product like this taste isn&#x27;t your primary concern).  </li>
            <li>never take it more than twice a week</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the instruction C4 provides and make sure you are loaded on protein and creatine before you hit it or else you are just burning money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NOT take it more than twice</li>
            <li>You have plenty more to learn before maximizing a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>take for more than 1-2 months in a row.</li>
            <li>take 2 scoops and try again in a direction geared more for motivation than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>take 2 scoops and try again in a direction geared more for motivation than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRE WORKOUT....5 STARS</li>
            <li>Same delicious product, exceedingly speedy delivery!</li>
            <li>It works exceedingly well, and with such an abundance of great flavors, it&#x27;s a treat to drink!</li>
            <li>The taste is pretty good</li>
            <li>It really does help get you amped up and wake you up for a good workout.</li>
            <li>Product came very quickly.</li>
            <li>but if it was easy you wouldn&#x27;t gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very powerful pre-workout supplement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going through different pre-workout stuff and this one is pretty good, taste like a jolly rancher... gives a nice kick...</li>
            <li>I went through a phase of taking Jack3d (the original) during every session.</li>
            <li>I thought I found something special when I started Jack3d.  </li>
            <li>wife thought it was too sweet</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s very finicky :)</li>
            <li>It really, truly helps you get the most of each and every workout.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, product matches description and ease of order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You will in the beginning but at the end this product will have a major impact on your nature metabolism system and you will eventually get fatter because you still haven&#x27;t been honest with yourself and you think that there&#x27;s a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the original formula for Jacked, but it will definitely get you ready for a workout.</li>
            <li>people in the gym were freaking out at my arm pump :).. C4 has become my new #1</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you are feeling a little draggy before a workout.</li>
            <li>energy was top of the line but the thing that surprised me was the pump</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and reliable, been using it now for about 1 year, it&#x27;s the only thing I can use after work to get the energy to go workout but doesn&#x27;t keep me up all night either.</li>
            <li>Great piumps and smooth long lasting energy.</li>
            <li>so I take 2 scoops, and that is about right for me.  </li>
            <li>This product contains substances banned by many professional sports organizations as well as the NCAA and a number of high school sports governing bodies.  </li>
            <li>first off..</li>
            <li>Today was the first time I felt that I truly moved it up a notch during the workout.  </li>
            <li>Very misleading !</li>
            <li>but when I take this i have noticeably more energy during my workout even though i only take one scoop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessary when you&#x27;ve had a day or more</li>
            <li>So much so, I did an extra 35 minutes and probably did 4x more work today than I would do in almost 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and worked out most of my adult life without ever using a preworkout powder or drink.</li>
            <li>and I was hyper sensitive to all the comments about the dizziness and such as I often get light headed while working out, (which the Dr told me was fine).  </li>
            <li>There have also been claims that it can cause a positive reading on drug tests.  </li>
            <li>I try to take no more than twice a week just because you will build a tolerance to it but overall good product!</li>
            <li>It gives me the jolt I need before intense workouts.  </li>
            <li>This just works really well.</li>
            <li>me, it was not so much a rush or boost as it was an increased amount of drive and stamina.  </li>
            <li>I use to be really sluggish in the morning but not anymore.</li>
            <li>2 scoops might really put me on the edge.</li>
            <li>It makes me very jittery and tingly feeling</li>
            <li>I am able to work out harder and longer.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than ordering from the cellucor website.</li>
            <li>Really gets you moving.</li>
            <li>Really worked on my friends but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic taste, gives me the drive to make the 3rd circuit.</li>
            <li>i use it on days when i am doing lighter training so i dont get burned out on other better pre workouts.</li>
            <li>so I only get about 50 minutes which is ok, but I never felt I was driven enough to get a quality 50 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Decent preworkout with citruline, caffeine and beta alanine.  </li>
            <li>Gets you in the mood to workout and give you a decent pump as well</li>
            <li>#34;hey man, you&#x27;ve got a little more to give...</li>
            <li>just a few more sets...c&#x27;mon.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve turned a few more folks onto this</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re gonna be wishing you could just drink it on the normal with dinner and</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to pre-workout and have been using it for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>If you are a high school, college, or professional athlete, stay away from this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I had a ton of questions when first starting and still have plenty now.</li>
            <li>I had a ton of questions when first starting and still have plenty now.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t really give me super amounts of energy but our workouts are early in the morning and it does wake me up enough to get a solid workout in.</li>
            <li>I thought the original C4 was ok..better than average</li>
            <li>Well , I was surprised again.  </li>
            <li>Instead, go about your work out the old fashioned way...</li>
            <li>eat a good balance diet, drink lots of fluids (water, Gatorade), get lots of rest, and simply know that if you are training correctly that you will have sore, tired muscles.</li>
            <li>As a woman it&#x27;s hard to get the right mix without getting the tingles and hot from the mix.</li>
            <li>I took my child out for breakfast for an end of school year treat and had a bigger breakfast than I normally would, but that was 3 hours ago.  </li>
            <li>I took 1 hr earlier as I normally would).</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve waited enough of time you better hit the weights hard and drink a lot of water...</li>
            <li>As for results, I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge difference over the last few months compared to before.</li>
            <li>and some people apparently died from it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this due to the fact that I&#x27;m usually getting up at 0530 to head to the gym, and often don&#x27;t get more than 7 hours of sleep per nite.  </li>
            <li>My next thought was if people boast so much about the flavor it can&#x27;t be as effective as the bad tasting drinks.</li>
            <li>have a very strict diet and workout plan and I workout twice a day average 3 to 4 hours per day, 6 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first few times I took this, I felt the skin tingling stuff lots of people talked about</li>
            <li>The first few times I took it, it made my skin tingle and itch.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just blindly purchase something because the guy bigger than you recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PW&#x27;s Generalized:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preworkout supplements are great ways to get a little extra boost at the gym.</li>
            <li>If you scale down usage as much as I do 2 month cycles is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have not experience any weird  side effects such as dizziness, light headed, high heart rate...etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using PW products for a few years, and I&#x27;m fairly large (230#)</li>

            <li> It really does help get you amped up and wake you up for a good workout.</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly.</li>
            <li> but if it was easy you wouldn&#x27;t gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very powerful pre-workout supplement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going through different pre-workout stuff and this one is pretty good, taste like a jolly rancher... gives a nice kick...</li>
            <li> I went through a phase of taking Jack3d (the original) during every session.</li>
            <li> I thought I found something special when I started Jack3d.  </li>
            <li> wife thought it was too sweet</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s very finicky :)</li>
            <li> It really, truly helps you get the most of each and every workout.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product matches description and ease of order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You will in the beginning but at the end this product will have a major impact on your nature metabolism system and you will eventually get fatter because you still haven&#x27;t been honest with yourself and you think that there&#x27;s a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original formula for Jacked, but it will definitely get you ready for a workout.</li>
            <li> people in the gym were freaking out at my arm pump :).. C4 has become my new #1</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you are feeling a little draggy before a workout.</li>
            <li> energy was top of the line but the thing that surprised me was the pump</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and reliable, been using it now for about 1 year, it&#x27;s the only thing I can use after work to get the energy to go workout but doesn&#x27;t keep me up all night either.</li>
            <li> Great piumps and smooth long lasting energy.</li>
            <li> so I take 2 scoops, and that is about right for me.  </li>
            <li> This product contains substances banned by many professional sports organizations as well as the NCAA and a number of high school sports governing bodies.  </li>
            <li> first off..</li>
            <li> Today was the first time I felt that I truly moved it up a notch during the workout.  </li>
            <li> Very misleading !</li>
            <li> but when I take this i have noticeably more energy during my workout even though i only take one scoop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessary when you&#x27;ve had a day or more</li>
            <li> So much so, I did an extra 35 minutes and probably did 4x more work today than I would do in almost 3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and worked out most of my adult life without ever using a preworkout powder or drink.</li>
            <li> and I was hyper sensitive to all the comments about the dizziness and such as I often get light headed while working out, (which the Dr told me was fine).  </li>
            <li> There have also been claims that it can cause a positive reading on drug tests.  </li>
            <li> I try to take no more than twice a week just because you will build a tolerance to it but overall good product!</li>
            <li> It gives me the jolt I need before intense workouts.  </li>
            <li> This just works really well.</li>
            <li> me, it was not so much a rush or boost as it was an increased amount of drive and stamina.  </li>
            <li> I use to be really sluggish in the morning but not anymore.</li>
            <li> 2 scoops might really put me on the edge.</li>
            <li> It makes me very jittery and tingly feeling</li>
            <li> I am able to work out harder and longer.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than ordering from the cellucor website.</li>
            <li> Really gets you moving.</li>
            <li> Really worked on my friends but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic taste, gives me the drive to make the 3rd circuit.</li>
            <li> i use it on days when i am doing lighter training so i dont get burned out on other better pre workouts.</li>
            <li> so I only get about 50 minutes which is ok, but I never felt I was driven enough to get a quality 50 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Decent preworkout with citruline, caffeine and beta alanine.  </li>
            <li> Gets you in the mood to workout and give you a decent pump as well</li>
            <li> #34;hey man, you&#x27;ve got a little more to give...</li>
            <li> just a few more sets...c&#x27;mon.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned a few more folks onto this</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re gonna be wishing you could just drink it on the normal with dinner and</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to pre-workout and have been using it for about 3 months.</li>
            <li> If you are a high school, college, or professional athlete, stay away from this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I had a ton of questions when first starting and still have plenty now.</li>
            <li> I had a ton of questions when first starting and still have plenty now.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t really give me super amounts of energy but our workouts are early in the morning and it does wake me up enough to get a solid workout in.</li>
            <li> I thought the original C4 was ok..better than average</li>
            <li> Well , I was surprised again.  </li>
            <li> Instead, go about your work out the old fashioned way...</li>
            <li> eat a good balance diet, drink lots of fluids (water, Gatorade), get lots of rest, and simply know that if you are training correctly that you will have sore, tired muscles.</li>
            <li> As a woman it&#x27;s hard to get the right mix without getting the tingles and hot from the mix.</li>
            <li> I took my child out for breakfast for an end of school year treat and had a bigger breakfast than I normally would, but that was 3 hours ago.  </li>
            <li> I took 1 hr earlier as I normally would).</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve waited enough of time you better hit the weights hard and drink a lot of water...</li>
            <li> As for results, I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge difference over the last few months compared to before.</li>
            <li> and some people apparently died from it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this due to the fact that I&#x27;m usually getting up at 0530 to head to the gym, and often don&#x27;t get more than 7 hours of sleep per nite.  </li>
            <li> My next thought was if people boast so much about the flavor it can&#x27;t be as effective as the bad tasting drinks.</li>
            <li> have a very strict diet and workout plan and I workout twice a day average 3 to 4 hours per day, 6 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first few times I took this, I felt the skin tingling stuff lots of people talked about</li>
            <li> The first few times I took it, it made my skin tingle and itch.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just blindly purchase something because the guy bigger than you recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PW&#x27;s Generalized:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preworkout supplements are great ways to get a little extra boost at the gym.</li>
            <li> If you scale down usage as much as I do 2 month cycles is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not experience any weird  side effects such as dizziness, light headed, high heart rate...etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using PW products for a few years, and I&#x27;m fairly large (230#)</li>
            <li> I thought I would try something new, but the Watermelon has too much fake sweet taste.</li>
            <li> began to scale down on PW&#x27;s in general, trying a few of the most recommended (C4, Assault, Jack3d micro) in small doses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to be motivated when you know that the workout you&#x27;ve always been doing is suddenly much, much harder and your recovery takes much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went through my phases and now have a very limited supplement list that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Pink Lemonade &amp; Strawberry Margarita are also yummy.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago I found that my energy level during workouts was starting to decline.</li>
            <li> I use it for those days when I don&#x27;t have the mental motivation to get to the gym.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful with your water intake, timing is everything.  </li>
            <li> so I purchased the C4 Extreme</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get jittery at all like other preworkouts</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itchy like other workouts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to water down the ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I started just taking half a scoop and the tingle and itch went away.</li>
            <li> If my weight routine is less than 30 minutes, I start getting the face flush.</li>
            <li> half of the recommended dosage to start.</li>
            <li> take if you&#x27;ve been lifting for a year or less -</li>
            <li> Have tried other preworkouts that make me nauseous or anxious.</li>
            <li> so I overly paced myself to the point a lot of time was wasted recovering between reps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try taking it 30 minutes before and 10 minutes before a few times to see if there is a difference between how it kicks in and compare that with what I ate that morning.  </li>
            <li> i drink at least half of gallon when I am at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s what I did in the past.</li>
            <li> I would wait at least 30 to 40 min before start drinking any water....</li>
            <li> and I mean FOCUSED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough</li>
            <li> It is a servicable, but not great pre-workout.</li>
            <li> Product description wrong ..</li>
            <li> I was using the blue raspberry for a while, it clumps something horrible no matter</li>
            <li> Got the wrong amount of item and the wrong flavor !</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- 5 servings of chicken breast or fish</li>
            <li> micro was like dating the ugly sister and touting the family name&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C4</li>
            <li> I just hate that you have to cycle off and on because it will lose effect over time.  </li>
            <li> Amps my workouts up like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> I have a horrible case of gym sweats</li>

            <li> Tastes great and really improves my workout!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It gives me the jolt I need before intense workouts.  Watermelon is my favorite flavor.  Pink Lemonade &amp; Strawberry Margarita are also yummy.  I just hate that you have to cycle off and on because it will lose effect over time.  Still favorite pre-workout supp!</li>
            <li> I received this from Cellucor to test out..I thought the original C4 was ok..better than average but I had ones I favored more..This newest generation of C4 is a totally different animal..first off..the taste..I&#x27;ve never had a watermelon flavor that I could stomach..this was delicious..wife thought it was too sweet but she&#x27;s very finicky :)..energy was top of the line but the thing that surprised me was the pump..thought my triceps were gonna pop..people in the gym were freaking out at my arm pump :).. C4 has become my new #1</li>
            <li> I think our order history speaks for itself. Have tried other preworkouts that make me nauseous or anxious. This just works really well. You get that tingling sensation but that&#x27;s just the Beta-Alanine working. For reference, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1, 105 lbs and I take about 1 scoop, my husband is 6&#x27;0 and 200 lbs and takes around 2 scoops. It&#x27;s effective and reliable, been using it now for about 1 year, it&#x27;s the only thing I can use after work to get the energy to go workout but doesn&#x27;t keep me up all night either.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ! Very happy with purchase great price!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Amps my workouts up like crazy!!! Best out there!</li>
            <li> It cam in the same size can as the 30 serving one and I got no response when I inquired as to how or why that&#x27;s possible.  Rip off!</li>
            <li> OK, I have been working out for about 5 years now. I do it during my lunch break so I only get about 50 minutes which is ok, but I never felt I was driven enough to get a quality 50 minutes.  I would try and push weights but would fatigue so I overly paced myself to the point a lot of time was wasted recovering between reps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost 40 lbs of fat the last 10 months and I am now trying to bulk up, so i went to GNC and they recommended this to help push me a bit during my workouts and then I got a good protein shake for after.  I have been on both for a bit and today, I can finally say I felt a difference.  The first few times I took this, I felt the skin tingling stuff lots of people talked about and I was hyper sensitive to all the comments about the dizziness and such as I often get light headed while working out, (which the Dr told me was fine).  But I never felt that &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; everyone talked about.  I had been taking it 30 min before I work out but today I took it as I was on the way to the gym.  Today was the first time I felt that I truly moved it up a notch during the workout.  So much so, I did an extra 35 minutes and probably did 4x more work today than I would do in almost 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it was not so much a rush or boost as it was an increased amount of drive and stamina.  I will also say that my morning routine was a bit different as well.  I took my child out for breakfast for an end of school year treat and had a bigger breakfast than I normally would, but that was 3 hours ago.  I had eggs sausage and hashbrowns (along with my morning protein shake I took 1 hr earlier as I normally would). But I have had bigger breakfasts before and it never affected my performance before..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long story short, I felt different to the point that I believe I could have stayed in the gym another hour if I did not have to get back to work.  It will be interesting if the trend continues.  I will try taking it 30 minutes before and 10 minutes before a few times to see if there is a difference between how it kicks in and compare that with what I ate that morning.  Everyone is different and almost every day is different.  I just want to get the most out of the time I have in the gym and at this point, I think this is helping.  It does cost a bit but being you get up to 60 servings plus, I will not take this on days I know I will not have time to justify taking it, it will last me over 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the strawberry flavor and was sent the watermelon and to my surprise I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I started out with Cellucor&#x27;s M5 formula. It gave me a nice buzz so I purchased the C4 Extreme and it has been great. I am relatively new to pre-workout and have been using it for about 3 months. With that in mind, I have just been using 1 scoop mixed with 4-5 ounces of water. As far as I can tell, it doesn&#x27;t really give me super amounts of energy but our workouts are early in the morning and it does wake me up enough to get a solid workout in. I use to be really sluggish in the morning but not anymore. 2 scoops might really put me on the edge.</li>
            <li> A great product! It makes me very jittery and tingly feeling but I think that&#x27;s what it is supposes to do. I am able to work out harder and longer. Product came very quickly. Much cheaper than ordering from the cellucor website.</li>
            <li> My favorite pre-workout product.  I feel great and the taste is great!!  Watermelon is my fave flavor.</li>
            <li> Product description wrong .. Very misleading ! Got the wrong amount of item and the wrong flavor !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going through different pre-workout stuff and this one is pretty good, taste like a jolly rancher... gives a nice kick... but i need about 2/3 scoops to keep me pushing for a 2 hour workout of constant activity... i like it, so try it out...</li>
            <li> Gets me energized to get stuff done. The first few times I took it, it made my skin tingle and itch. I started just taking half a scoop and the tingle and itch went away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to care about flavor and can drink just about anything.  And that&#x27;s what I did in the past. But this stuff is amazing, it taste like drinking a jolly rancher.  My next thought was if people boast so much about the flavor it can&#x27;t be as effective as the bad tasting drinks. Well , I was surprised again.  I thought I found something special when I started Jack3d.  But Jack3D does not give me enough energy.  I would say both provide similar pump.  But C4 gets me SO AMMMPPPPEEEDDD!</li>
            <li> I can see why this is a top pre workout. It helps get me going in the morning. I also like the amount of servings you get for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product. It will pump you up.</li>
            <li> I have never taken a pre workout before but when I take this i have noticeably more energy during my workout even though i only take one scoop.</li>
            <li> Tastes good.  You definitely feel a kick, but no heart racing or shaking!!  I take it when I have 10 mins left on an exercise bike, then go into my weights.  If my weight routine is less than 30 minutes, I start getting the face flush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and worked out most of my adult life without ever using a preworkout powder or drink. A few years ago I found that my energy level during workouts was starting to decline. With it, my own motivation began to decline. It&#x27;s hard to be motivated when you know that the workout you&#x27;ve always been doing is suddenly much, much harder and your recovery takes much longer. So, a friend of mine turned me on to C4. The effect it has is almost immediate. When taken about 15 minutes prior to your workout you will start to feel the tingle coursing through your veins ( and in my case, through your face, making you want to sneeze). Don&#x27;t let that worry you, though. Those are the aminos kicking into gear. Once your workout begins you will find yourself incredibly focused on each rep...and I mean FOCUSED. It&#x27;s amazing...you don&#x27;t even want to leave the gym. Every time I walk toward the exit my C4 side tells me, &amp;#34;hey man, you&#x27;ve got a little more to give...just a few more sets...c&#x27;mon.&amp;#34; Not even exagerating. I&#x27;ve turned a few more folks onto this and they are hooked on it. It really, truly helps you get the most of each and every workout.</li>
            <li> This stuff will wake you up and get you focused.  It&#x27;s not as good as the original formula for Jacked, but it will definitely get you ready for a workout.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It&#x27;s the Best!!! I couldn&#x27;t do my workouts without it!! I dont know how I was workingout before I knew about cellucor!! Totally recommend this product to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t do anything for me anymore. I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> the watermelon flavor is delish</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty good an definitely gives you a push for your workout. Only thing I noticed is that it starts to wear off after about  a lil more an hour in and that&#x27;s with me using two scoops. I use it for those days when I don&#x27;t have the mental motivation to get to the gym.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely makes a difference! C4 is easy to mix in with a glass of water and taste great! Within 15 - 25 minutes after drinking a glass of C4, you will fill your body start to tingle and your blood start to rush. It really does help get you amped up and wake you up for a good workout. As for results, I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge difference over the last few months compared to before. However, it does helped get me amped up and motivated to work out!</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. My son uses on a daily basis for workout. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really good product, I love the energy and focus it gives me to get a good workout in. Greatly helps my stamina so i can work out longer. I try to take no more than twice a week just because you will build a tolerance to it but overall good product!</li>
            <li> Best pre-workout and tastes great</li>
            <li> Just... Just every flavor, so good. You want a delicious preworkout that&#x27;s so damn good you&#x27;re gonna be wishing you could just drink it on the normal with dinner and what not? You already know whats up with this C4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAT WATERMELON THO?! Drink it, love it, it&#x27;s gorgeous on the tongue.</li>
            <li> I love this pre-workout. I don&#x27;t get jittery at all like other preworkouts and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itchy like other workouts. And the watermelon flavor is my favorite. Soooo good.</li>
            <li> Great value per ounce. Really gets you moving. Taste is great</li>
            <li> With 2 scoops you cant sleep lol</li>
            <li> Always a great product.</li>
            <li> Tastes good and gets the job done.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> Teenage son likes it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, and intact.</li>
            <li> Thee best pre-workout in the market. C4 is considered to be the best clean energy. Great piumps and smooth long lasting energy.</li>
            <li> Decent preworkout with citruline, caffeine and beta alanine.  Watermelon taste is tolerable (honestly, if your using a product like this taste isn&#x27;t your primary concern).  I&#x27;ve been using PW products for a few years, and I&#x27;m fairly large (230#) so I take 2 scoops, and that is about right for me.  No upset stomach or jitters afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this due to the fact that I&#x27;m usually getting up at 0530 to head to the gym, and often don&#x27;t get more than 7 hours of sleep per nite.  I would not recommend for someone hitting the gym in the evening and expecting to go to sleep a couple hours later.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product matches description and ease of order.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> ***Do not buy this product if you think this is the key to lose weight, there is no short cut in fitness.  You must have the fundamental believes and practice. Self-discipline and goal setting is what I am all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the skinny dudes out there - Do not buy this product and think that you will get bigger by taking it.  I would invest all the money on Whey protein such as ON Gold Standard. Whey Protein before I buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the fat dudes out there - do not buy this product and think you will lose fat.  You will in the beginning but at the end this product will have a major impact on your nature metabolism system and you will eventually get fatter because you still haven&#x27;t been honest with yourself and you think that there&#x27;s a quick fix.  You need to rebuild a relationship with food and change your eating behavior pattern first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very strict diet and workout plan and I workout twice a day average 3 to 4 hours per day, 6 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;I consume 220 to 275GM of protein per day and I eat 5 to 8 times per day.  I eat every hour and 45 min.&lt;br /&gt;- 24 Egg whites&lt;br /&gt;- 5 servings of chicken breast or fish&lt;br /&gt;- Veggies&lt;br /&gt;- 5 When Protein shakes&lt;br /&gt;- Almonds&lt;br /&gt;- Veggies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having a very awesome fitness journey and I am just NOW started taking pre-workout to help me to lift heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;70LB dumbbells FLY with a perfect keg hugging form.  I am awesome like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never take it more than twice a week and I always wait 3 days period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take C4 with Creatine and BCAA and then 2 scoops of Whey protein... Warm up for 30 min then I make the machine cry like hell.&lt;br /&gt;***There is no point to take C4 without taking any protein and creatine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experience any weird  side effects such as dizziness, light headed, high heart rate...etc.  It fades out within 2 to 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not take this product if you have hypertension or any pre-existing heart condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with your water intake, timing is everything.  I would wait at least 30 to 40 min before start drinking any water.... I don&#x27;t want to water down the ingredient.  Once you&#x27;ve waited enough of time you better hit the weights hard and drink a lot of water... i drink at least half of gallon when I am at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instruction C4 provides and make sure you are loaded on protein and creatine before you hit it or else you are just burning money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT take it more than twice a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good diet plan is more important than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Gaining !!!</li>
            <li> Tasty and doesn&#x27;t lead me to an after workout crash!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you are feeling a little draggy before a workout. It will pep you up and give you the energy to get that one last rep. I will caution though this stuff is not for all. There is a ton of warnings on the back and you should them. No preworkouts should ever be taken if you have pre-existing medical conditions. With that said though, this stuff does work. I would say you probably get twice the workout done using this.</li>
            <li> Its no Bull-Nox or Hemo Rage. It is a servicable, but not great pre-workout. i use it on days when i am doing lighter training so i dont get burned out on other better pre workouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lifting for 3 years now. I&#x27;ve went through my phases and now have a very limited supplement list that I would recommend. If you&#x27;re reading reviews good job. Don&#x27;t just blindly purchase something because the guy bigger than you recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PW&#x27;s Generalized:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preworkout supplements are great ways to get a little extra boost at the gym. Key word is boost. These shouldn&#x27;t be a staple in any lifters regimen. I went through a phase of taking Jack3d (the original) during every session. I loved the rush and the results. After awhile I realized that I didn&#x27;t need to be so dependent on it, oh yea and some people apparently died from it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to scale down on PW&#x27;s in general, trying a few of the most recommended (C4, Assault, Jack3d micro) in small doses. After about 2 years of experimenting I will continue the review with my short summary on PW use and will follow it up with the reason why C4 made the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PW recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take only when well rested&lt;br /&gt;Take on your 3rd or 4th day of lifting. It&#x27;s not necessary when you&#x27;ve had a day or more off.&lt;br /&gt;Take half of the recommended dosage to start. See if you see benefit.&lt;br /&gt;Take in 1 month cycles. If you scale down usage as much as I do 2 month cycles is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take daily&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take for cardio&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take for cardio&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take for cardio&lt;br /&gt;Under no circumstance should you take under cardio&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take if you&#x27;ve been lifting for a year or less - You have plenty more to learn before maximizing a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take for more than 1-2 months in a row. Challenge your body to perform as well off PW as you do on PW. It&#x27;s tough but if it was easy you wouldn&#x27;t gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cellucor C4-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack3d was killing people&lt;br /&gt;Assault was giving me lava diarrhea&lt;br /&gt;Jack3d micro was like dating the ugly sister and touting the family name&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C4 gave me a similar pump to that of Jack3d. I take 1/2 the recommended dosage for a pump up that equals about 2 cups of good coffee. I have a horrible case of gym sweats so I avoid multiple cups of coffee. I sweat when using C4 but not as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixability - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Taste - 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Watermelon - In my opinion this is the best C4 Flavor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you found this review helpful. If not I will erase the entire thing take 2 scoops and try again in a direction geared more for motivation than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ask any questions that you have below. I had a ton of questions when first starting and still have plenty now. I&#x27;d be happy to share my opinions on things that I have read into or personally experienced.e 1/2 the recommended dosage for a pump up that equals about 2 cups of good coffee.

            <li> Works great.  The tingles are nice  You get used to them</li>
            <li> Really worked on my friends but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. The taste was good though</li>
            <li> Very powerful pre-workout supplement. Great taste! Gets you in the mood to workout and give you a decent pump as well</li>
            <li> I use it before i go to Gym every morning and it work for me Jim</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRE WORKOUT....5 STARS</li>
            <li> Great price. Will buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic taste, gives me the drive to make the 3rd circuit. As a woman it&#x27;s hard to get the right mix without getting the tingles and hot from the mix. C4 doesnt give me any funky or tingly feelings. Great for Women</li>
            <li> Same delicious product, exceedingly speedy delivery! C4 itself has definitely become my preworkout of choice. It works exceedingly well, and with such an abundance of great flavors, it&#x27;s a treat to drink!</li>
            <li> I was using the blue raspberry for a while, it clumps something horrible no matter how well I try to store it. It may be the humidity of the south! I liked the raspberry taste. I thought I would try something new, but the Watermelon has too much fake sweet taste. I like C4 and would recommend it, but I would not say to get the Watermelon flavor.</li>
            <li> This product contains substances banned by many professional sports organizations as well as the NCAA and a number of high school sports governing bodies.  There have also been claims that it can cause a positive reading on drug tests.  This can cause an athlete to be banned from sports participation!  If you are a high school, college, or professional athlete, stay away from this stuff.  If you are using it... stop.  Instead, go about your work out the old fashioned way... eat a good balance diet, drink lots of fluids (water, Gatorade), get lots of rest, and simply know that if you are training correctly that you will have sore, tired muscles.</li>
            <li> Great product and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product for preworkout</li>
