            <li>Also smells nice.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really nice too.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine finishing spray - very light yet with good holding.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Fast service and good price!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s as fine as a frogs hair!</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love your product.  </li>
            <li>It holds my hair in place and I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky like many hairsprays.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray smells really good and holds really well.  </li>
            <li>love it ... holds my very fine hair very well :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>Does not build up on hair either and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine texture</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done I give my hair a light mist with the Joico Finishing Spray and my style stays put all day.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li>that it somehow &amp;#34;tucks&amp;#34; all the ends of my hair in and gives a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I like this hairspray because it it very powerful when it comes out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Love this product very much.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for your  hair because it has extra strengthening technology built into it.</li>
            <li>Great hair spray goes dryer than other hair sprays, can use a lift comb to lift hair and spray again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Do not confuse this with Joico&#x27;s Joimist Firm - which is nice, but not the light, fine finishing spray that Powerspray is.</li>
            <li>Hold nicely, yet can do a little more styling after spraying.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and still allows my hair to move freely while keeping my style in-tact.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and doesn&#x27;t take curl well, but this is the best hairspray I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants a product that not only smells good but holds without being sticky or pasty.</li>
            <li>If I comb it out it gets soft and full, no yucky sticky hair!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your speedy service!</li>
            <li>Received exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, flat, straight hair</li>
            <li>I received my order in a very timely manner as well.</li>
            <li>Really like this product as it holds well through wind and humidity.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>reason I like Joico Finishing Spray so much is</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m rocking the homeless look (which is most days), I&#x27;ll spray a little on my hands and run my fingers through the frizzy strands for a cleaner, sleeker look.</li>
            <li>I love it, it keeps my hair in place after spraying a few layers.</li>
            <li>and this is the first hairspray I have ever used that actually holds my hairstyle and does not make it feel sticky</li>
            <li>The next day, my hair is mostly in place WITHOUT that sticky feeling that you sometimes get with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked this product but it did tend to make my hair a little dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy on your hair and it lasts all day</li>
            <li>Good hair spray unfortunately my hair is finer than maybe this was made for.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and most hairsprays weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>It is unlike any Joico products I&#x27;ve used in the past, it smells cheap, clumps and makes your hair look sprayed.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Joico hairsprays are more and more difficult to find, in salons and online; not sure what the problem is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a spray that will hold my fine hair for the day without making it sticky or dull looking.  </li>
            <li>I also found that it came out of the can so fast and hard that I was using too much of it</li>
            <li>The spray is amazing and holds just as the label states; no hard, sticky white ugly residue on hair.</li>

            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a firm but silky hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martie Sluga</li>
            <li> and the can didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is goes so fast.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the hold lasts very long.  </li>
            <li> I use to use several joico products but always had such a hard time finding them.</li>
            <li> Ordered a few cans of the finishing spray.. and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Joico and Kenra products for years with absolutely no complaints,  however, this is being returned.  </li>

            <li> It leaves my hair looking flat and dull.</li>
            <li> After a few hours my hair seemed weighed down.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky, or weighed down!</li>
            <li> Fairly heavy.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding hairsprays that truly hold.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with hairspray.</li>
            <li> And to make things worse it leaves a buildup in my hair.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a bad hairspray smell.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed with this!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fairly heavy. After a few hours my hair seemed weighed down. I prefer lighter weight sprays. Sorry!</li>
            <li> Great product - lightly holds.</li>
            <li> I use to use several joico products but always had such a hard time finding them. I just happened to check Amazon and found it all. Ordered a few cans of the finishing spray.. and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Holds well without drying.  I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s as fine as a frogs hair!</li>
            <li> I liked this product but it did tend to make my hair a little dry.  I also found that it came out of the can so fast and hard that I was using too much of it and the can didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading in a Beauty Magazine that it was number 1 for 2013. I love it, it keeps my hair in place after spraying a few layers. If I sleep on it I put my hair in a bun and spray again the next day , it just brings back my bouncy curls. If I comb it out it gets soft and full, no yucky sticky hair!  It&#x27;s just what a I want in a hairspray and it&#x27;s good for your  hair because it has extra strengthening technology built into it.</li>
            <li> I have used this finishing spray for awhile now. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky, or weighed down!</li>
            <li> Great hairspray!  Holds up well and very light!!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It&#x27;s not heavy on your hair and it lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a fine finishing spray - very light yet with good holding.  It&#x27;s easy to brush through.  I am no longer washing my hair just to get the hair spray out of it!  I love this product.  Do not confuse this with Joico&#x27;s Joimist Firm - which is nice, but not the light, fine finishing spray that Powerspray is.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray!!  Fast service and good price!</li>
            <li> Love everything about this Joico hairspray! I received my order in a very timely manner as well. Very pleased customer here!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s PERFECT! My hair is thin and doesn&#x27;t take curl well, but this is the best hairspray I have ever used! You will NOT be disappointed with this!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product very much. Works great on my hair. It holds and then combs out without ant residue. Thanks for your speedy service!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. I have thin, fine hair and most hairsprays weigh my hair down. This one doesn&#x27;t but it holds up well.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your prompt delivery.  I love your product.  It holds my hair in place and I love the fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t take allot to get them job done.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve tried. Dries fast and still allows my hair to move freely while keeping my style in-tact. When I&#x27;m rocking the homeless look (which is most days), I&#x27;ll spray a little on my hands and run my fingers through the frizzy strands for a cleaner, sleeker look. No helmet hair here. Also smells nice.</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray. It is lightweight and actually doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it is stuck together. It also doesn&#x27;t have a bad hairspray smell. My husband tells me my hair looks shiny when I use this as well which usually is a good thing</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me a travel size of this hairspray to try and I was immediately hooked.  I use another hairspray as I&#x27;m styling my hair.  When I&#x27;m done I give my hair a light mist with the Joico Finishing Spray and my style stays put all day.  My hair is fine texture but I have a lot of it.  I have a hard time finding hairsprays that truly hold.  Love this hairspray!</li>
            <li> Good hair spray unfortunately my hair is finer than maybe this was made for. My hair ends up weighed down by afternoon.</li>

            <li> I have very fine, flat, straight hair and this is the first hairspray I have ever used that actually holds my hairstyle and does not make it feel sticky or like I have a ton of product in it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product as it holds well through wind and humidity.  I will continue to use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have use this finishing spray for several years.  It holds the hair style without making my hair &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.  Does not build up on hair either and washes out easily.</li>

            <li> JOICO never disappoints my hair! The spray is amazing and holds just as the label states; no hard, sticky white ugly residue on hair. Just beautiful, awesome hair :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells really good and holds really well.  Not sticky like many hairsprays.  It is worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray because it it very powerful when it comes out of the bottle and I feel like it covers well but I don&#x27;t think the hold lasts very long.  It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this hairspray.  I&#x27;ve finally found a spray that will hold my fine hair for the day without making it sticky or dull looking.  The fragrance is really nice too.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than delivery date indicated, very happy.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! Received exactly what I ordered.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and received it very quickly.  My only complaint is that is goes so fast.  Do they make a larger size?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like Joico Finishing Spray so much is that it somehow &amp;#34;tucks&amp;#34; all the ends of my hair in and gives a smooth finish.  The next day, my hair is mostly in place WITHOUT that sticky feeling that you sometimes get with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a firm but silky hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martie Sluga</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants a product that not only smells good but holds without being sticky or pasty.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite hair spray!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this spray on me and I loved it, but didn&#x27;t purchase from her(too pricey) and I found this on amazon and loved their price and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Fine hair holds beautifully with this product.  It does not have a sticky feel to it, leaves hair looking great,</li>
            <li> Great product. Hold nicely, yet can do a little more styling after spraying.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Great hairspray.</li>
