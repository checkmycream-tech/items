            <li>I heard about the Ionic Toothbrush and have found that it lives up in working to keep my gums more healthy.</li>
            <li>I contribute being more healthy because of using the ionic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I could have ordered elsewhere for a better price knowing the heads would for sure fit my brush.</li>
            <li>But the head refills are just fine.</li>
            <li>The heads work just fine - they fit and go on easily and do not come off.  </li>
            <li>My fault for not reading the fine print on amazon.</li>
            <li>One can easily remove plaque just with moistened bristles and light brushing - with no toothpaste and no fluoride.</li>

            <li>Good Morning - thank you for your email earlier this week.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The packaging is secure enough to keep the refill heads secure and clean, yet frustration free when opening.</li>
            <li>Dr Tung&#x27;s really results in an extra-clean, smooth</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>These refills enable you to keep the handle and keep a fresh, hygienic, head on per the manufacturer&#x27;s specs.</li>
            <li>This ionic toothbrush does a better job cleaning my teeth than my old sonic toothbrush and my teeth</li>
            <li>so it will be more clear what is being offered.</li>
            <li>I like that they can be replaced qyuckly and easily, without having the replace the entire toothbrush.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>really love&lt;br /&gt;avoiding</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>It seems to get the particles between my teeth out very efficiently.</li>
            <li>And, you only replace the head, it&#x27;s actually a cool environmental thing.</li>
            <li>Really like the new packaging.</li>
            <li>3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if it works better being ionic</li>
            <li>It helps even to clear out mucous in my throat.</li>
            <li>Not much to say about toothbrush refills other than I like the toothbrush :-)</li>
            <li>I switched back to my old toothbrush while travelling</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Tung&#x27;s for years and haven&#x27;t had to go to the dentist for as many years! (Age 74)</li>
            <li> Believe me, I thought this was hokum. I mean really an Ionic toothbrush. My friend was using one. So I tried it. IT REALLY WORKS. I switched back to my old toothbrush while travelling and there is a film difference! Had to buy one for my travel case. And, you only replace the head, it&#x27;s actually a cool environmental thing. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few years and credit them with keeping my plaque problem to a manageable levels.  I like that they can be replaced qyuckly and easily, without having the replace the entire toothbrush.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if it works better being ionic but it feels cleaner after brushing with it. I noticed that when brushing with a regular brush with the same toothpaste in comparison. It seemed to feel cleaner with the ionic toothbrush. For all I know it can could be psychological. But the head refills are just fine.</li>
            <li> The heads work just fine - they fit and go on easily and do not come off.  The work perfectly in the Ionic brush but I wish there were choices in the types of brush heads and some designs in the brush heads that would reach a bit deeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr Tung&#x27;s toothbrush for several months now, and when my spare brush heads wore out, I switched back to a regular brush. Otherwise, same toothpaste, same process, same dental care frequency. What a difference! I&#x27;d forgotten how &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; my teeth start feeling towards the end of the day with a regular brush. Dr Tung&#x27;s really results in an extra-clean, smooth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered refills and the package got lost in transit (USPS, sigh...). One email to this vendor and they immediately sent me a replacement order, no further questions asks. Outstanding service.</li>
            <li> Good Morning - thank you for your email earlier this week.  I received my order&lt;br /&gt;of the HYG toothbrush replacement heads and was very disappointed.  I thought&lt;br /&gt;I was going to receive 6 replacement heads as shown in the picture on the Amazon&lt;br /&gt;website but I only received 1 package of 2 for a total cost of $14.83.  I think the picture&lt;br /&gt;needs to be  revised especially as I could have bought a package of 2 replacements from&lt;br /&gt;another seller at almost 1/2 the price I was charged and I could see what I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning these to Amazon and buying the heads from another seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely</li>
            <li> Using the toothbrush for a while now. Works great</li>
            <li> Will be using an ionizing toothbrush all my days....really love&lt;br /&gt;avoiding regular/flouride-filled cleanings at a dentist now that&lt;br /&gt;I have these heads and they were so affordable too.  Well worth&lt;br /&gt;it as they last quite a long  time.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite toothbrush. These refills enable you to keep the handle and keep a fresh, hygienic, head on per the manufacturer&#x27;s specs. Great value for the price, so I always buy a supply to last me a year per the refill schedule. The packaging is secure enough to keep the refill heads secure and clean, yet frustration free when opening. This ionic toothbrush does a better job cleaning my teeth than my old sonic toothbrush and my teeth always look so clean, it looks like I just left the hygienist. Really like the new packaging.</li>
            <li> My fault for not reading the fine print on amazon. The show 6 heads for the price and you only get 2 head or 1 set.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Tungs tooth brush is awesome my teeth have never been so clean!  I recommend this toothbrush to anyone who loves  clean teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great - just too bad the refills are so expensive. I just wish they were more affordable.</li>
            <li> I have been having some issues with my gums. I heard about the Ionic Toothbrush and have found that it lives up in working to keep my gums more healthy. My teeth and mouth feel so much cleaner. It seems to get the particles between my teeth out very efficiently. It helps even to clear out mucous in my throat. I have found that when I feel a little irritation in my throat, by my brushing with the Ionic toothbrush, little clumps of mucous comes up and the symptom ends. I contribute being more healthy because of using the ionic toothbrush. For me, it has helped to keep my gums and teeth and mouth extradinarily clean.</li>
            <li> the one I am looking for</li>
            <li> I thought I would get 6 toothbrush heads for this price. I could have ordered elsewhere for a better price knowing the heads would for sure fit my brush. Change your picture on this site to the actual packaging so it will be more clear what is being offered.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. One can easily remove plaque just with moistened bristles and light brushing - with no toothpaste and no fluoride. This technology was once used by dentists. The reason why it isn&#x27;t widely used now (i.e., is intentionally underrated) is simply because it tends to keep people out of the dentist office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of brush for years. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price. They have gotten overpriced. Also, the ad is a little misleading because the picture shows 6 brush heads, but you are actually buying only 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush in the world.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about toothbrush refills other than I like the toothbrush :-)</li>
            <li> Deceptive Picture. There are only 2, not 6</li>
