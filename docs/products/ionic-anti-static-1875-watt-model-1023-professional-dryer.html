            <li>I love this hair dryer!!  </li>
            <li>This dryer is very effective.</li>
            <li>This type of dryer has been remarkable for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this would be a perfect tool for you, but for someone who does not know what he&#x27;s doing - the tool doesn&#x27;t work miracles...</li>
            <li>It is a great hairdryer and comes with good accessory components.</li>
            <li>The power is good.  </li>
            <li>While it worked, this was a good blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li>I loved that hair dryer as did both of my daughters.</li>
            <li>the attachments are really good.</li>
            <li>I needed a comb attachment with the dryer, so I thought that this would be the best fit for me.</li>
            <li>Love it works beautiful on my hair.</li>
            <li>â€¦ It makes it so straight, reduces fly aways/frizz, and makes my hair stay looking great all day!</li>
            <li>She was very pleased.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of this dryer!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The diffuser is fabulous and works beautifully when I want to bring out the wavy in my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Wish it had the speeds in stead of two, but it gets the job done for sure!</li>
            <li>I like the sleekness of it, for sure!</li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooooo glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>We replaced it with an Andis (see my review on that one) -- I liked this one better than that one!</li>
            <li>It also leaves it with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Comes with nice attachments.</li>
            <li>im kind of pissed about that</li>
            <li>After three years it is nice to order a product again and all of features you liked about it are still there.</li>
            <li>They no longer make the kind that I had</li>
            <li>The variety of speed/heat settings is nice too, since a lot of dryers have fewer settings.</li>
            <li>really nice hairdryer for the price</li>
            <li>no frizz, dries hair quick, all the adapters are great.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>It is suitable for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li>I like the Hair Dryer very much as it is very light.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE how very light this model is.  </li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I really love using it.</li>
            <li>my hair looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love that you can pick the speeds and the heat level on this model.</li>
            <li>and we love it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hoping for something to use for more than about 10 months, keep looking.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it damages the hair more, when the hair is wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this dryer, many options.  </li>
            <li>more if I curl the ends or try to give it a shape.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>and I like this one much better.</li>
            <li>All in all, I was OK with this purchase for a while.</li>
            <li>I used it mostly every day.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dryer.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I paid a lot more for this hairdryer at Ulta.  </li>
            <li>Awesome hairdryer and diffuser especially for those with curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than most, so</li>
            <li>She fell in love with this hair dryer when she borrowed it from her roommate</li>
            <li>I love my dryer because it&#x27;s lightweight</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Also, there are two sets of buttons on the handles (they are more like toggles).  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that even though I purchase MANY things from Amazon, nothing has compelled me to write a review like this item.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Went ahead and got this one because of the good reviews on here and used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>I love how light this blow dryer is and how efficiently is works.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking smooth and friiz free.!</li>
            <li>wonderful and worth the money for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>It drys very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair (4 A/B) very quickly.</li>
            <li>It comes with three attachments that are easy to use, and allow me to straighten my hair of poof out my curls.</li>
            <li>This product is durable, but most importantly the speed in which it blows your hair dry is incredible.  </li>
            <li>My hair frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li>Very light, but dries quickly</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>it was light easy to handle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got fine curly hair but TONS of it-</li>
            <li>It drys quickly, maybe not the quickest (but don&#x27;t forget for the price this dryer does more than it should).</li>
            <li>Love it, dries hair quickly without damaging.  </li>
            <li>Awesome little dryer.</li>
            <li>and so they don&#x27;t get a huge workout each day.</li>
            <li>once you use this, you&#x27;ll never settle for a cheap plastic hairdryer again.</li>
            <li>Light, works well.  </li>
            <li>These are great dryers,reducing my wife&#x27;s hair prep time dramatically, but you need to know going in that it will not last forever.</li>
            <li>B000G9WVHU CHI Ceramic Hairstyling Iron for Silk Smooth Hair Model</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going to review this item that works as intended, but I thought it might be important to mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am happy with it overall.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s great hair dryer, lighter and more compact than my previous ones.</li>
            <li>But I loved the fact that this blowdryer had a nice non slippery matte finish and it was less than $50.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this from Ulta originally for 59.00 on sale</li>
            <li>So if you have long hair this Tourmaline is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The buttons are accessible but not in the way.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this one in a retail store but hadn&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li>AND this dryer is super light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and dries hair so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its a strong powerful blow dryer...</li>
            <li>Light weight, heats up hot, cools down quick, &amp; grips great!</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s super light weight!</li>
            <li>I liked this dryer and thought it dried my hair quickly and did a good job minimizing frizz.</li>
            <li>I loved this hair dryer until last week.  </li>
            <li>kind of loud.</li>
            <li>Its fairly quietâ€¦there are quieter ones out there, but again its decently quiet for the dryer it is.</li>
            <li>It did dryer-y things, and that was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of shooting out cool air, it turned the dryer off altogether.</li>
            <li>I really like this blow dryer and love all the attachments</li>
            <li>Works well, has good power to straighten my hair and enough heat.  </li>
            <li>but overall its a good dryer</li>
            <li>I never knew that buying a good hairdryer would make such a difference</li>
            <li>I just love how my hair dries so fast and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Full head of medium thickness, midback length hair-</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this dryer was excellent for blow-drying out the curl (fast and efficiently) and prepping hair for flat iron.</li>
            <li>Second, the diffuser end goes on very easily and securely without having to snap it on, and I love that it has THREE heat options (four if you include the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34;) and THREE speeds.</li>
            <li>Company shippped it quickly and it was packed well.  </li>
            <li>the low setting is perfect for styling,the textured body makes it really easy to hold without slipping....</li>
            <li>More so then the older model.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t get rid of with a quick run through with my straightener.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly without damaging it.  </li>
            <li>It drys the hair quick and comb doesn&#x27;t fall off after a couple times of using.</li>
            <li>While it worked it was great, but again for the price I felt like it would last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I had been buying cheaper blow dryers that would break quickly.  </li>
            <li>done quickly.  </li>
            <li>what do you expect a blow dryer to do.. dries hair quickly and does not cause knots</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and the purple is very pretty.</li>
            <li>honestly love this hair dryer couldn&#x27;t live without it or my Paul Mitchell straightener...</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase and hope this one will also last me as long.</li>
            <li>I have always LOVED Hot Tools products, especially their curling irons...</li>
            <li>, it dries my hair super fast (I have fine hair, no misrepresentations here).  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s really HOT!</li>
            <li>I had a Hot Tools hair dryer before this one that I had for over 10 years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hot!</li>
            <li>I dont know what happened after the first couple uses, but the comb attachment no longer stays attached!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, long cord, light enough, hot heat setting is great</li>
            <li>This one is light weight and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair really fast, leaves it shiny and freeze free</li>
            <li>My hair feels better with this dryer compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft and styles better.  </li>
            <li>The filter is not dirty.</li>
            <li>It does leave my scalp feeling a bit tinged from the heat, but well worth the time saving.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, and then some.</li>
            <li>and I love the nozzle on the end to spacifically direct the air to my hair when I use my brush</li>
            <li>If not I&#x27;d still replace if with the same kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable, its soft and smooth, which is 100 times better than what my last dryer provided for me.</li>
            <li>It seems to be quieter than my last dryer, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the Conair I had replaced.</li>
            <li>and you can handle it very well  because it has a good grip plus it comes with two extra tools for your hair.</li>
            <li>She would (and has) reccomend to anyone looking for an economical but pro-strength hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Also, I have naturally wavy hair, and it seems to make it even more frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Powerful and gets the job</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t very powerful, overall it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>And the cord is super long, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>The blowdryer worked well but would get super hot.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly and the temperature gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;d be fine, considering I still had medium and high heat.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a good blowdryer...</li>
            <li>The buttons are in just the right places to change settings while drying.  </li>
            <li>SO, if you have long hair and it is not treated and sometimes unmanageable, be ready to continuously pick this comb attachment up off the floor every pass, unless you want to put your OVEGLOVE to good use.</li>
            <li>it has high airflow and feels comfortable to grip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I should mention the first one I ordered worked for about 7 uses, then got SUPER hot, and then died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very practical and cheap, so splurging on a $89 hair dryer was very unheard of for me.</li>
            <li>In fact I liked it so much after trying it, I bought a second one for my daughter (since she was always stealing mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to tame my curls in 45 minutes with this blowdryer and get it done better than before.  </li>
            <li>my mom had sucked very much</li>
            <li>It is quiet and has a very comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>Also it has multiple heat and speed settings, which I love.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;m done my hair feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Had the same dryer for many years.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to a high-quality hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I will never buy another Hot Tools dryer</li>
            <li>Sometimes a higher price doesn&#x27;t equate to higher quality.  </li>
            <li>the first one lasted two years.  </li>
            <li>Hot tools quality isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; brand.</li>
            <li>but I purchased another \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; dryer</li>
            <li>I wish I had checked Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>Great product and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Gets too hot and makes hair quite frizzy.</li>
            <li>Gave as a goft and the recipient reports a quiet blower which produces more volume in her hair.</li>
            <li>I researched blowdryers and found out that first came the ceramic ones...</li>
            <li>Alot more power than her last blow dryer, even heat, and all three girls are ready faster!</li>
            <li>worked well for a year, but no longer blows hot air.</li>
            <li>I should of read all the reviews, I noticed this has happened to many people that have purchased the same blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>My first use, I thought it did</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer with high expectations, this dryer is good if you have fine or medium hair however if your hair is thick to the point where you break combs..</li>
            <li>Other than that, we really liked this</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as my older model but still does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting this dryer for a long time, based on the Hot Tools curling iron I love, and the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It only took me around 5 minutes to blow dry my hair this morning and it also a nice full amount of air and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write up reviews on Amazon, but I feel compelled to write up something for this amazing hair dryer.</li>
            <li>With how quick and efficiently this dryer works, the noise is completely negligible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pairing both products together works well for me - I use the blow dryer to dry my hair super fast and then go over it with the straightener for a silky smooth pin stripe straight hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say whether it takes less time to dry my hair, but I have definitely noticed fewer split ends, so that is good.  </li>
            <li>, the dryer is super quiet, gives you a lot of heat options and its powerful.</li>
            <li>I am comparing it to my other Hot Tools hair dryer which I like better.  </li>
            <li>The high is too hot and has burned my hair twice.  </li>
            <li>Drys my hair really fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it looks.</li>
            <li>but it last longer then cheap ones...</li>
            <li>It works fast and doesnt make your hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>it really hasn&#x27;t had a ton of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it just as much.  </li>
            <li>this dryer WILL Not get it bone straight.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how it works because it was a gift for my neice.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t talk to her that much</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves using it.</li>
            <li>I had the lesser priced model with the same wattage and liked it so well decided to step up a notch</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the 2nd dryer for about 2 months and it does a fine job, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype, or the price!</li>
            <li>Medium is too high for low heat needs, like for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this about 9 months ago on the extreme recommendation of a salon and after reading so many reviews here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this problem with many blow dryers over the years (other \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; ones).</li>
            <li>(I have long, fine, wavy hair).  </li>
            <li>I clean the lint collector regularly.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fast way to dry your hair, less damage and to save your own energy, you&#x27;ve just found it!  </li>
            <li>So I was secretly glad when my previous ($35 Andis) dryer of about 5 years died and I was ready to purchase.  </li>
            <li>but it dries it faster than my very old blow dryer without the intense heat that leaves it so much dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is as hot as any other dryer I&#x27;ve used, hotter than cheaper dryers, and it is light weight.</li>
            <li>Low is too cool.  </li>
            <li>day, however, after only six months, I tried to use the cool setting and found that it no longer worked.</li>
            <li>This obviously meant the cool shot button didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>so much I bought a second one to replace the first!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t problem though because I would just alternate from the handle to the nozzle and it got done quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, smooth, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has owned this particular hair dryer for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>Air doesn&#x27;t feel as strong as expected.</li>
            <li>so when my old hairdryer died I decided to spend a little more for a higher quality one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for people with any type of hair.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Just bought my second one because my first one (bought in 1997!) just died.  </li>
            <li>This dryer dries my hair very quickly so there&#x27;s less exposure to intense heat.  </li>
            <li>worth the extra $$$$</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rubberized finish on this is nice, the buttons are still in the wrong place and it is very easy to change the settings as you dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I need a hair dryer that is light, has all the attachments, and gets hot enough to dry my hair without damaging it.  </li>
            <li>It also dries my hair in about half the time as my old dryer, and is more energy efficient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to a hair dryer that only dries on high heat (which, obviously, is not the best for my hair) after less than a year.</li>
            <li>Also note that non of the attachments fit other blow dryers so if the dryer breaks toss everything</li>
            <li>had to search for a new one.</li>
            <li>Started making noises after a month and amazon won&#x27;t let me return for a new one</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as it really does a quick job and keeps the frizzies down to a minimum.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, and it is super course, and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>At first, it was great...powerful with just enough heat to dry my hair quickly but not burn it.</li>
            <li>It worked okay when I was a kid, but recently I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t get hot, and takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>the first lasting 2 years.</li>
            <li>From here on out I will only buy Hot Tools Tourmaline Blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Had looked for one that was not excessively noisy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more quiet than other dryers too.</li>
            <li>It has all of the same features as this Hot Tools dryer.  </li>
            <li>is this dryer does not get hot enough when I am brush curling</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is hot enough that it sometimes burns my scalp if I get too close.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many hot tools product, and I will buy more, never been disappointed.</li>
            <li>Well worth paying a little extra for a better quality and longer lasting dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down on your arm while using it.  </li>
            <li>The medium setting on it was very hot for medium and the low setting was actually cold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The buttons are right under my fingers and it is easy to press them when holding the dryer, which is irritating.</li>
            <li>We tried the same priced Babyliss Pro 2000 Watt Ionic, which I liked because it blew so hard.</li>
            <li>: It is more lightweight than other dryers we&#x27;ve had, it dries hair fairly fast, leaves it shiny, and less frizzy than our old dryer.</li>
            <li>I have been air drying my hair since I was young</li>
            <li>I really like having all the different heat options.  </li>
            <li>and it was putting out too much heat and not enough air.</li>
            <li>Although this didn&#x27;t cut drying time compared to my old hair dryer, it has lots of settings in terms of temperature and air strength.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my daughter natural hair.</li>
            <li>And after nearly a year it shows no sign of breaking.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer on 7/7/2014 and today, it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>I really like the 3 different heat settings.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this hair dryer, it truly is a professional grade unit.  </li>
            <li>: One dryer started making loud fan noises after a year, and we had to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Had to replace my old one which lasted 9 years</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake up the entire house when I&#x27;m getting ready for work in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and the buttons are frequently hit while I&#x27;m blowdrying.  </li>
            <li>As far as the performance of the dryer, it worked well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold, the cord is long, it has a warm and cold function</li>
            <li>My favorite was the round diffuser and the flat funnel-like attachment</li>
            <li>well i went to press the cool shot button and the dryer cracked in half</li>
            <li>Such good reviews &amp; high price for a mediocre hair dryer</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry it any faster, and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything magical to it that my previous dryer (a $25 drugstore purchase) didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>It DID dry my hair quickly, but it did not straighten my hair as my last dryer did.</li>
            <li>First, I normally do not write reviews but thought I should inform people.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but had already used my sister&#x27;s (has exact same one)</li>
            <li>and it was powerful enough to dry it completely in under 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would still have the first one if my European adapters would have worked properly.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of the same exact dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second one, but only because my hubby decided to use the first one on a project in the barn...</li>
            <li>regular retail was 84.99 and found this exact same model here.  </li>
            <li>I had the same exact brand of blow dryer prior to buying this one and that one lasted me over two years.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put much stock in this except that the claim is that Tourmaline plus Ceramic make even MORE negative IONS...which leads to quicker dry</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not willing to spend more money on a product that won&#x27;t last as long as I expect.</li>
            <li>It only has 2, medium and high.  </li>
            <li>I know 3 people including myself that have the same problem with this highly rated dryer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem quite as powerful as I had hoped, but it seems to dry my hair quickly enough.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily thick, but definitely dense hair.</li>
            <li>It gets quite hot so you might want to be careful and watch the heat on it.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new hair dryer, look no further.</li>
            <li>I cleaned the filter and got a little of the power back, but now it&#x27;s pretty much toast.</li>
            <li>I did tons of research before buying this hair dryer and no other hair dryer has it all like this one.</li>
            <li>I recently received my new Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043, same model as my old one.</li>
            <li>My Cheap blow dryers usually last over 5 years and still working, Im just usually in need of an upgrade.</li>
            <li>This is actually my second hair dryer of the same company I had the first one for about 5 yrs which is honestly long seeing a how I use it every day</li>
            <li>Finally bought a professional one, and it broke just after 1 year.</li>
            <li>When I used Revlon or other dryers I noticed the difference by the amount of frizz and the length if time my hair took to dry (about 3-5 more minutes with other dryers).</li>
            <li>I will say that it is a very manageable weight which is necessary since it will take your three times longer to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>However... the previous Hot Tools blow-dryer I purchased died after about a year.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine,  slight wave, untreated, long (mid back).</li>
            <li>I did have a little trouble not changing the settings on accident while I was drying my hair, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll get used</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair daily and always bought cheap blow dryers that typically would just short out after a year of use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a total novice and can&#x27;t seem to learn how to effectively style my hair with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It also is easy to hold and comes with a longer than average cord that makes it easier to dry my hair the way I want to dry it - I am not held hostage by a short cord!  </li>
            <li>The buttons are right where your fingers grip the handle, which is the only downside, as I&#x27;ve accidentally changed settings a few times.  </li>
            <li>Trust me its hard to work in a shop without may favorite item, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li>This one is obviously defective as I&#x27;ve barely used it.</li>
            <li>went for 45 minutes to dry my hair straight, to 10 minutes if I let it air dry a bit before hand.</li>
            <li>The dryer I had previously was cheaper and lasted much much longer</li>
            <li>I have long combination hair (a little wavy in areas, a little curly in areas, and downright a little \\&quot;rough\\&quot; in other areas lol).</li>
            <li>Based on my hairstylist&#x27;s recommendation and other users&#x27; reviews of this hair dryer, I expected to come out of my first use with hair like a girl from a shampoo commercial.</li>

            <li> This dryer is very effective.</li>
            <li> This type of dryer has been remarkable for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am sure this would be a perfect tool for you, but for someone who does not know what he&#x27;s doing - the tool doesn&#x27;t work miracles...</li>
            <li> It is a great hairdryer and comes with good accessory components.</li>
            <li> The power is good.  </li>
            <li> While it worked, this was a good blow-dryer.  </li>

            <li> I like the sleekness of it, for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooooo glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> We replaced it with an Andis (see my review on that one) -- I liked this one better than that one!</li>
            <li> It also leaves it with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Comes with nice attachments.</li>
            <li> im kind of pissed about that</li>
            <li> After three years it is nice to order a product again and all of features you liked about it are still there.</li>
            <li> They no longer make the kind that I had</li>
            <li> The variety of speed/heat settings is nice too, since a lot of dryers have fewer settings.</li>
            <li> really nice hairdryer for the price</li>
            <li> no frizz, dries hair quick, all the adapters are great.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> It is suitable for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>

            <li> I really love using it.</li>
            <li> my hair looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love that you can pick the speeds and the heat level on this model.</li>
            <li> and we love it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hoping for something to use for more than about 10 months, keep looking.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it damages the hair more, when the hair is wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this dryer, many options.  </li>
            <li> more if I curl the ends or try to give it a shape.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> and I like this one much better.</li>
            <li> All in all, I was OK with this purchase for a while.</li>
            <li> I used it mostly every day.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this blowdryer.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dryer.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot more for this hairdryer at Ulta.  </li>
            <li> Awesome hairdryer and diffuser especially for those with curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than most, so</li>
            <li> She fell in love with this hair dryer when she borrowed it from her roommate</li>
            <li> I love my dryer because it&#x27;s lightweight</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Also, there are two sets of buttons on the handles (they are more like toggles).  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that even though I purchase MANY things from Amazon, nothing has compelled me to write a review like this item.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Went ahead and got this one because of the good reviews on here and used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> I love how light this blow dryer is and how efficiently is works.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking smooth and friiz free.!</li>
            <li> wonderful and worth the money for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> It drys very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair (4 A/B) very quickly.</li>
            <li> It comes with three attachments that are easy to use, and allow me to straighten my hair of poof out my curls.</li>
            <li> This product is durable, but most importantly the speed in which it blows your hair dry is incredible.  </li>
            <li> My hair frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li> Very light, but dries quickly</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> it was light easy to handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fine curly hair but TONS of it-</li>
            <li> It drys quickly, maybe not the quickest (but don&#x27;t forget for the price this dryer does more than it should).</li>
            <li> Love it, dries hair quickly without damaging.  </li>
            <li> Awesome little dryer.</li>
            <li> and so they don&#x27;t get a huge workout each day.</li>
            <li> once you use this, you&#x27;ll never settle for a cheap plastic hairdryer again.</li>
            <li> Light, works well.  </li>
            <li> These are great dryers,reducing my wife&#x27;s hair prep time dramatically, but you need to know going in that it will not last forever.</li>
            <li> B000G9WVHU CHI Ceramic Hairstyling Iron for Silk Smooth Hair Model</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to review this item that works as intended, but I thought it might be important to mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s great hair dryer, lighter and more compact than my previous ones.</li>
            <li> But I loved the fact that this blowdryer had a nice non slippery matte finish and it was less than $50.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Ulta originally for 59.00 on sale</li>
            <li> So if you have long hair this Tourmaline is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The buttons are accessible but not in the way.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this one in a retail store but hadn&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> AND this dryer is super light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and dries hair so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its a strong powerful blow dryer...</li>
            <li> Light weight, heats up hot, cools down quick, &amp; grips great!</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s super light weight!</li>
            <li> I liked this dryer and thought it dried my hair quickly and did a good job minimizing frizz.</li>
            <li> I loved this hair dryer until last week.  </li>
            <li> kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Its fairly quietâ€¦there are quieter ones out there, but again its decently quiet for the dryer it is.</li>
            <li> It did dryer-y things, and that was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of shooting out cool air, it turned the dryer off altogether.</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer and love all the attachments</li>
            <li> Works well, has good power to straighten my hair and enough heat.  </li>
            <li> but overall its a good dryer</li>
            <li> I never knew that buying a good hairdryer would make such a difference</li>
            <li> I just love how my hair dries so fast and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Full head of medium thickness, midback length hair-</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this dryer was excellent for blow-drying out the curl (fast and efficiently) and prepping hair for flat iron.</li>
            <li> Second, the diffuser end goes on very easily and securely without having to snap it on, and I love that it has THREE heat options (four if you include the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34;) and THREE speeds.</li>
            <li> Company shippped it quickly and it was packed well.  </li>
            <li> the low setting is perfect for styling,the textured body makes it really easy to hold without slipping....</li>
            <li> More so then the older model.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t get rid of with a quick run through with my straightener.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly without damaging it.  </li>
            <li> It drys the hair quick and comb doesn&#x27;t fall off after a couple times of using.</li>
            <li> While it worked it was great, but again for the price I felt like it would last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I had been buying cheaper blow dryers that would break quickly.  </li>
            <li> done quickly.  </li>
            <li> what do you expect a blow dryer to do.. dries hair quickly and does not cause knots</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and the purple is very pretty.</li>
            <li> honestly love this hair dryer couldn&#x27;t live without it or my Paul Mitchell straightener...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase and hope this one will also last me as long.</li>
            <li> I have always LOVED Hot Tools products, especially their curling irons...</li>
            <li> , it dries my hair super fast (I have fine hair, no misrepresentations here).  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s really HOT!</li>
            <li> I had a Hot Tools hair dryer before this one that I had for over 10 years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hot!</li>
            <li> I dont know what happened after the first couple uses, but the comb attachment no longer stays attached!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, long cord, light enough, hot heat setting is great</li>
            <li> This one is light weight and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair really fast, leaves it shiny and freeze free</li>
            <li> My hair feels better with this dryer compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft and styles better.  </li>
            <li> The filter is not dirty.</li>
            <li> It does leave my scalp feeling a bit tinged from the heat, but well worth the time saving.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, and then some.</li>
            <li> and I love the nozzle on the end to spacifically direct the air to my hair when I use my brush</li>
            <li> If not I&#x27;d still replace if with the same kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable, its soft and smooth, which is 100 times better than what my last dryer provided for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to be quieter than my last dryer, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the Conair I had replaced.</li>
            <li> and you can handle it very well  because it has a good grip plus it comes with two extra tools for your hair.</li>
            <li> She would (and has) reccomend to anyone looking for an economical but pro-strength hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Also, I have naturally wavy hair, and it seems to make it even more frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Powerful and gets the job</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t very powerful, overall it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> And the cord is super long, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> The blowdryer worked well but would get super hot.</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly and the temperature gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;d be fine, considering I still had medium and high heat.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a good blowdryer...</li>
            <li> The buttons are in just the right places to change settings while drying.  </li>
            <li> SO, if you have long hair and it is not treated and sometimes unmanageable, be ready to continuously pick this comb attachment up off the floor every pass, unless you want to put your OVEGLOVE to good use.</li>
            <li> it has high airflow and feels comfortable to grip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I should mention the first one I ordered worked for about 7 uses, then got SUPER hot, and then died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very practical and cheap, so splurging on a $89 hair dryer was very unheard of for me.</li>
            <li> In fact I liked it so much after trying it, I bought a second one for my daughter (since she was always stealing mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to tame my curls in 45 minutes with this blowdryer and get it done better than before.  </li>
            <li> my mom had sucked very much</li>
            <li> It is quiet and has a very comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> Also it has multiple heat and speed settings, which I love.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m done my hair feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Had the same dryer for many years.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to a high-quality hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another Hot Tools dryer</li>
            <li> Sometimes a higher price doesn&#x27;t equate to higher quality.  </li>
            <li> the first one lasted two years.  </li>
            <li> Hot tools quality isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  </li>
            <li> the \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; brand.</li>
            <li> but I purchased another \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; dryer</li>
            <li> I wish I had checked Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> Great product and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Gets too hot and makes hair quite frizzy.</li>
            <li> Gave as a goft and the recipient reports a quiet blower which produces more volume in her hair.</li>
            <li> I researched blowdryers and found out that first came the ceramic ones...</li>
            <li> Alot more power than her last blow dryer, even heat, and all three girls are ready faster!</li>
            <li> worked well for a year, but no longer blows hot air.</li>
            <li> I should of read all the reviews, I noticed this has happened to many people that have purchased the same blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> My first use, I thought it did</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer with high expectations, this dryer is good if you have fine or medium hair however if your hair is thick to the point where you break combs..</li>
            <li> Other than that, we really liked this</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my older model but still does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this dryer for a long time, based on the Hot Tools curling iron I love, and the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It only took me around 5 minutes to blow dry my hair this morning and it also a nice full amount of air and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write up reviews on Amazon, but I feel compelled to write up something for this amazing hair dryer.</li>
            <li> With how quick and efficiently this dryer works, the noise is completely negligible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pairing both products together works well for me - I use the blow dryer to dry my hair super fast and then go over it with the straightener for a silky smooth pin stripe straight hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say whether it takes less time to dry my hair, but I have definitely noticed fewer split ends, so that is good.  </li>
            <li> , the dryer is super quiet, gives you a lot of heat options and its powerful.</li>
            <li> I am comparing it to my other Hot Tools hair dryer which I like better.  </li>
            <li> The high is too hot and has burned my hair twice.  </li>
            <li> Drys my hair really fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it looks.</li>
            <li> but it last longer then cheap ones...</li>
            <li> It works fast and doesnt make your hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> it really hasn&#x27;t had a ton of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it just as much.  </li>
            <li> this dryer WILL Not get it bone straight.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how it works because it was a gift for my neice.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t talk to her that much</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves using it.</li>
            <li> I had the lesser priced model with the same wattage and liked it so well decided to step up a notch</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the 2nd dryer for about 2 months and it does a fine job, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype, or the price!</li>
            <li> Medium is too high for low heat needs, like for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 9 months ago on the extreme recommendation of a salon and after reading so many reviews here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this problem with many blow dryers over the years (other \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; ones).</li>
            <li> (I have long, fine, wavy hair).  </li>
            <li> I clean the lint collector regularly.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fast way to dry your hair, less damage and to save your own energy, you&#x27;ve just found it!  </li>
            <li> So I was secretly glad when my previous ($35 Andis) dryer of about 5 years died and I was ready to purchase.  </li>
            <li> but it dries it faster than my very old blow dryer without the intense heat that leaves it so much dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is as hot as any other dryer I&#x27;ve used, hotter than cheaper dryers, and it is light weight.</li>
            <li> Low is too cool.  </li>
            <li> day, however, after only six months, I tried to use the cool setting and found that it no longer worked.</li>
            <li> This obviously meant the cool shot button didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> so much I bought a second one to replace the first!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t problem though because I would just alternate from the handle to the nozzle and it got done quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, smooth, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has owned this particular hair dryer for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Air doesn&#x27;t feel as strong as expected.</li>
            <li> so when my old hairdryer died I decided to spend a little more for a higher quality one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for people with any type of hair.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just bought my second one because my first one (bought in 1997!) just died.  </li>
            <li> This dryer dries my hair very quickly so there&#x27;s less exposure to intense heat.  </li>
            <li> worth the extra $$$$</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rubberized finish on this is nice, the buttons are still in the wrong place and it is very easy to change the settings as you dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I need a hair dryer that is light, has all the attachments, and gets hot enough to dry my hair without damaging it.  </li>
            <li> It also dries my hair in about half the time as my old dryer, and is more energy efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to a hair dryer that only dries on high heat (which, obviously, is not the best for my hair) after less than a year.</li>
            <li> Also note that non of the attachments fit other blow dryers so if the dryer breaks toss everything</li>
            <li> had to search for a new one.</li>
            <li> Started making noises after a month and amazon won&#x27;t let me return for a new one</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as it really does a quick job and keeps the frizzies down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and it is super course, and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> At first, it was great...powerful with just enough heat to dry my hair quickly but not burn it.</li>
            <li> It worked okay when I was a kid, but recently I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t get hot, and takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> the first lasting 2 years.</li>
            <li> From here on out I will only buy Hot Tools Tourmaline Blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Had looked for one that was not excessively noisy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more quiet than other dryers too.</li>
            <li> It has all of the same features as this Hot Tools dryer.  </li>
            <li> is this dryer does not get hot enough when I am brush curling</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is hot enough that it sometimes burns my scalp if I get too close.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many hot tools product, and I will buy more, never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well worth paying a little extra for a better quality and longer lasting dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down on your arm while using it.  </li>
            <li> The medium setting on it was very hot for medium and the low setting was actually cold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The buttons are right under my fingers and it is easy to press them when holding the dryer, which is irritating.</li>
            <li> We tried the same priced Babyliss Pro 2000 Watt Ionic, which I liked because it blew so hard.</li>
            <li> : It is more lightweight than other dryers we&#x27;ve had, it dries hair fairly fast, leaves it shiny, and less frizzy than our old dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been air drying my hair since I was young</li>
            <li> I really like having all the different heat options.  </li>
            <li> and it was putting out too much heat and not enough air.</li>
            <li> Although this didn&#x27;t cut drying time compared to my old hair dryer, it has lots of settings in terms of temperature and air strength.  </li>
            <li> I use it in my daughter natural hair.</li>
            <li> And after nearly a year it shows no sign of breaking.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer on 7/7/2014 and today, it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> I really like the 3 different heat settings.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair dryer, it truly is a professional grade unit.  </li>
            <li> : One dryer started making loud fan noises after a year, and we had to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my old one which lasted 9 years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up the entire house when I&#x27;m getting ready for work in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and the buttons are frequently hit while I&#x27;m blowdrying.  </li>
            <li> As far as the performance of the dryer, it worked well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold, the cord is long, it has a warm and cold function</li>
            <li> My favorite was the round diffuser and the flat funnel-like attachment</li>
            <li> well i went to press the cool shot button and the dryer cracked in half</li>
            <li> Such good reviews &amp; high price for a mediocre hair dryer</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry it any faster, and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything magical to it that my previous dryer (a $25 drugstore purchase) didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> It DID dry my hair quickly, but it did not straighten my hair as my last dryer did.</li>
            <li> First, I normally do not write reviews but thought I should inform people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but had already used my sister&#x27;s (has exact same one)</li>
            <li> and it was powerful enough to dry it completely in under 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would still have the first one if my European adapters would have worked properly.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the same exact dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second one, but only because my hubby decided to use the first one on a project in the barn...</li>
            <li> regular retail was 84.99 and found this exact same model here.  </li>
            <li> I had the same exact brand of blow dryer prior to buying this one and that one lasted me over two years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put much stock in this except that the claim is that Tourmaline plus Ceramic make even MORE negative IONS...which leads to quicker dry</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not willing to spend more money on a product that won&#x27;t last as long as I expect.</li>
            <li> It only has 2, medium and high.  </li>
            <li> I know 3 people including myself that have the same problem with this highly rated dryer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem quite as powerful as I had hoped, but it seems to dry my hair quickly enough.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily thick, but definitely dense hair.</li>
            <li> It gets quite hot so you might want to be careful and watch the heat on it.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new hair dryer, look no further.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the filter and got a little of the power back, but now it&#x27;s pretty much toast.</li>
            <li> I did tons of research before buying this hair dryer and no other hair dryer has it all like this one.</li>
            <li> I recently received my new Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043, same model as my old one.</li>
            <li> My Cheap blow dryers usually last over 5 years and still working, Im just usually in need of an upgrade.</li>
            <li> This is actually my second hair dryer of the same company I had the first one for about 5 yrs which is honestly long seeing a how I use it every day</li>
            <li> Finally bought a professional one, and it broke just after 1 year.</li>
            <li> When I used Revlon or other dryers I noticed the difference by the amount of frizz and the length if time my hair took to dry (about 3-5 more minutes with other dryers).</li>
            <li> I will say that it is a very manageable weight which is necessary since it will take your three times longer to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> However... the previous Hot Tools blow-dryer I purchased died after about a year.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine,  slight wave, untreated, long (mid back).</li>
            <li> I did have a little trouble not changing the settings on accident while I was drying my hair, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll get used</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair daily and always bought cheap blow dryers that typically would just short out after a year of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a total novice and can&#x27;t seem to learn how to effectively style my hair with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It also is easy to hold and comes with a longer than average cord that makes it easier to dry my hair the way I want to dry it - I am not held hostage by a short cord!  </li>
            <li> The buttons are right where your fingers grip the handle, which is the only downside, as I&#x27;ve accidentally changed settings a few times.  </li>
            <li> Trust me its hard to work in a shop without may favorite item, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> This one is obviously defective as I&#x27;ve barely used it.</li>
            <li> went for 45 minutes to dry my hair straight, to 10 minutes if I let it air dry a bit before hand.</li>
            <li> The dryer I had previously was cheaper and lasted much much longer</li>
            <li> I have long combination hair (a little wavy in areas, a little curly in areas, and downright a little \\&quot;rough\\&quot; in other areas lol).</li>
            <li> Based on my hairstylist&#x27;s recommendation and other users&#x27; reviews of this hair dryer, I expected to come out of my first use with hair like a girl from a shampoo commercial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hot and the watts are probably half of what it was when I bought it less than a year ago.</li>
            <li> SO I did find myself having to follow up the treatment with my ceramic flat iron, which defeated the purpose of the low damage to your hair selling point.</li>
            <li> , I ordered it, tried it...and for the time my old blowdryer used to take to dry my bangs, this one had ALL my hair dry-and my hair is midback length!!!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy a different model next time around, and am considering purchasing another that will dry my hair faster, even though this one should last me another year or two, as this one takes so annoyingly long.  </li>
            <li> (The buttons on my last dryer were placed in such a way that I was always shutting the dryer off while trying to dry my hair...</li>
            <li> For no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> I especially like how long the cord isâ€¦very convenient.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer is very heavy, would much rather have it be lighter in weight.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has never been dropped or damaged in any way, and I only dry my hair once or twice a week, so</li>
            <li> should have spent the extra twenty or thirty dollars on a european made dryer.</li>
            <li> There is even a cold shot buttton and a comb attachment that I can&#x27;t figure out how to use appropriately.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and really long.</li>
            <li> ever that&#x27;s not professional.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it had a long straightening pik un the picture</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought a third dryer of this model is the price had dropped a ton, down to about what a WalMart cheapie would cost.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is really light, so my arms don&#x27;t get tired, and it cuts way down on the frizz, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Save your money and pick up your next dryer for $30 less at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> Works similar to the other one I have at our Summer Home.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is sleek looking and works very quietly compered to other dryers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had VERY long hair when I purchased it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, the hair was dry but puffy and frizzy...</li>
            <li> and it works beautifully on dry hair - even for a clueless person like myself.</li>
            <li> bone dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was thoroughly dry and not frizzy within five minutes on high/hot</li>
            <li> (if I let my hair air dry it takes about 3-4 hours-</li>
            <li> It falls off with the smallest amount of tension, making blow dry sessions</li>
            <li> and it use to take me forever to blow dry hair</li>
            <li> No warning, slow down, funny sounds or anything.  </li>
            <li> above average.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long, thick, color treated hair that usually takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> The buttons are in an inconvenient place on the handle, so it is easy to accidentally change the settings.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned 5 of these of your course of the past few years and they never go much longer then about 5 months.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased two hair dryers from this company and both did not last more than 2 years, which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> it comes with works WONDERS because you dont have to brush with one hand and dry with the other.</li>
            <li> I even got flack from my husband for spending that much on one (We were poor college students at the time and just bought a house.)</li>
            <li> A bit heavier than expected too.</li>
            <li> Purchased a third dryer to replace an identical dead unit that was purchased after number one died.</li>
            <li> The hair straightener works on wet hair as well</li>
            <li> My money was well spent.</li>
            <li> At the price, I feel like this should last me a few years.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much room for your thumb on the handle</li>
            <li> Worst hair dryer I have ever owned...made my fine straight hair feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> but now its dry in less than 5 min</li>
            <li> Very weak airflow, does not consistently stay hot.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> so I returned the other one to the store.  </li>
            <li> It did indeed come with one, so now I&#x27;ll send the other one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, as I have long, thick hair, so after a while, I am conscious of it&#x27;s weight.</li>
            <li> Other than the slight frizzing</li>
            <li> I returned it for another, but I&#x27;m not reviewing that first one, because I don&#x27;t like when people leave a bad review on an item when they obviously received a lemon.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the price</li>
            <li> maybe the forced reduced air flow from the diffuser end constantly being used?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but for what I paid, I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> , it does however take a little longer to dry your hair if you have long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Price on Amazon beat every retailer hands down.</li>
            <li> The dryer doesn&#x27;t dry any faster than drug store hair dryers I&#x27;ve gotten in the past for @ $20.  </li>
            <li> I usually just need to dry my hair on the medium setting.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a new tourmaline 1043 ionic blow dryer this seller less than six months ago and the other day it just randomly stopped working.</li>
            <li> and 2 stars cause it died at less than 3 years old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At less than one-third the price.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, we don&#x27;t even use them daily and when we do, it&#x27;s minimal use.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well, and it does so for much less money.</li>
            <li> My hair came out smoother, and less frizzy than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> so I kept find myself accidentally blowing cold air instead of hot because I would push the buttons</li>
            <li> No thanks, no more.</li>
            <li> So, I have long thick hair:</li>
            <li> Both of our Tourmaline Tools Lite dryers have comb attachments with broken teeth due to it constantly flying off.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very long thick hair</li>
            <li> Well after a few weeks of not changing the attachments/tool, it seems that the  heat melted the attachment ever so slightly</li>
            <li> so thick that if my hair isn&#x27;t layered my ponytail is usually the same size as my wrist</li>
            <li> I tried to save a little $$$</li>
            <li> But even though it leaves it a little frizzy</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot with this little puppy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that other reviewer is talking about.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this dryer will disappoint you in a matter of months.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer absolutely dried my hair in 6 minutes:</li>
            <li> and I had also shared it with my sister who used it everyday</li>
            <li> Dead.  </li>
            <li> After years of buying expensive, professional blow dryers, I tried this after my hairdresser used it on me.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair less frizzy than blow dryers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> and It dryed my hair in almost half the time!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick curly hair and with my previous hair dryer it would take hours to section each piece and blow-dry it out for straightening.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my hair a little bit frizzy but not as bad and the last model I used which was a long time ago.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair of course you&#x27;ll take a little longer.  </li>
            <li> and it came with a short one not happy about it!</li>
            <li> if anyone with thick unruly hard to tame hair, this is not the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> I have to remember to save the warrantee because I&#x27;m sick of buying a new hair dryer every year!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer definitely helps with the frizz factor, however I am disappointed in the amount of time it takes to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that I thought it had 3 settings for the power.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST a year.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been coming out frizzy lately</li>
            <li> have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The product failed within a few months.</li>
            <li> However, it takes way too long to dry my hair, so I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Then I used a friend&#x27;s Hot Tools dryer and realized that my $15 dryer was horrible!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair, and I straighten it often.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m slightly disappointed, but I will keep this dryer for as long as it works.</li>
            <li> (sorry don&#x27;t know the name).&lt;br /&gt;Why 2 stars??</li>
            <li> May be a tad expensive</li>
            <li> These are expensive blow-dryers.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately mine quite working at 17 months.</li>
            <li> I wish they would find a way to cover the buttons though so that you don&#x27;t accidently change the heat or speed buttons or hit the cold shot button.  </li>
            <li> It also has a cold shot button.  </li>
            <li> It is very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I knew that it must be going bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed buying this dryer.</li>
            <li> but then the driers always seem to crap out after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in t heir quality.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> She thought it was the worst product she had ever used.</li>
            <li> very annoying!).  </li>

            <li> Worst hair dryer I have ever owned...made my fine straight hair feel dry and brittle. Dryer&lt;br /&gt;fell apart (literally) after 10 months and I threw it in the garbage.  Will NEVER purchase this&lt;br /&gt;brand again. I tried to save a little $$$ but I will stick with a Solano hairdryer which comes with&lt;br /&gt;2 yr. warranty and they will fix without warranty forever for $ 30.00....worth the extra $$$$</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer. I have A LOT of hair and tend to kill a hair dryer in under a year. This one is light weight and dries fast. This is the 2nd one I have bought...the first lasting 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair. Not necessarily thick, but definitely dense hair. This blow dryer handles it with not problem. I wouldn&#x27;t call it quiet, but I&#x27;ve heard louder hair dryers. With how quick and efficiently this dryer works, the noise is completely negligible. Also, the diffuser on this product works beautifully on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely wonderful and worth the money for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  Drys my hair really fast.  Company shippped it quickly and it was packed well.  I was very happy.</li>
            <li> I have had three of these blowdryers over the years. I love them. I would still have the first one if my European adapters would have worked properly.</li>
            <li> I love the look and feel of this dryer! It is also very quiet, which is definitely a plus. It doesn&#x27;t seem quite as powerful as I had hoped, but it seems to dry my hair quickly enough. Also it has multiple heat and speed settings, which I love.</li>
            <li> First, I normally do not write reviews but thought I should inform people.  I loved this hair dryer until last week.  I have had it for about 9 months.  It overheated and threw a spark.  Now the low functionality does not work and overheats within 5 minutes.  I am looking into returning to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love how light this blow dryer is and how efficiently is works.  My hair feels better with this dryer compared to my old one.  I wish they would find a way to cover the buttons though so that you don&#x27;t accidently change the heat or speed buttons or hit the cold shot button.  Other than that I really love using it.</li>
            <li> This type of dryer has been remarkable for my hair.  Almost no hair is in the brush.  I have fine hair but it dries it faster than my very old blow dryer without the intense heat that leaves it so much dryer.  My hair is shiny and soft and styles better.  On the highest setting it is quiet.  You will not be disappointed buying this dryer.</li>
            <li> The product failed within a few months.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold, the cord is long, it has a warm and cold function and I&#x27;ve had this product for years now. It has never had any problems and drys my hair like it should.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific hair dryer!! I&#x27;ve used this model dryer twice a day for about 3 years and finally burned it out. This is my second purchase of the same exact dryer. I highly recommend it as it really does a quick job and keeps the frizzies down to a minimum.I also bought one for my daughter and she loves it, too.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Lightweight, quiet...the low setting is perfect for styling,the textured body makes it really easy to hold without slipping....this is the 2nd one of these I&#x27;ve owned...once you use this, you&#x27;ll never settle for a cheap plastic hairdryer again.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write up reviews on Amazon, but I feel compelled to write up something for this amazing hair dryer. I blow dry my hair daily and always bought cheap blow dryers that typically would just short out after a year of use. A local salon recommend that I get the Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043. This was 8 years ago. I bought it from the salon at a premium price, but I needed something. I&#x27;m very practical and cheap, so splurging on a $89 hair dryer was very unheard of for me. I even got flack from my husband for spending that much on one (We were poor college students at the time and just bought a house.) However, that blow dryer has lasted me 8 years and the only reason I went a bought another one recently is because I noticed a small crack at the tip of the blow dryer and started noticing sparks and the dryer was not blowing out hot air like it use too. I knew that it must be going bad. I&#x27;VE HAD IT FOR 8 YEARS!! I recently received my new Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043, same model as my old one. There seems to be some updating. It only took me around 5 minutes to blow dry my hair this morning and it also a nice full amount of air and my hair looks fabulous! More so then the older model. I am very happy with my purchase and hope this one will also last me as long. From here on out I will only buy Hot Tools Tourmaline Blow dryer.</li>
            <li> kind of loud. no intermediate speed setting. should have spent the extra twenty or thirty dollars on a european made dryer.</li>
            <li> The best hair dryer I&#x27;ve used. My hair is wavy and really long. After I&#x27;m done my hair feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and don&#x27;t use the hottest setting.  It drys very quickly.  Light weight and easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Very weak airflow, does not consistently stay hot. I will say that it is a very manageable weight which is necessary since it will take your three times longer to dry your hair. Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about hair dryers and I had found one that was cheaper but did not have all the features I wanted so I finally decided on this one. I really like how it looks. It&#x27;s sleek and the purple is very pretty. I love that you can pick the speeds and the heat level on this model. I don&#x27;t like to fry my hair so I always use the medium heat setting and it drys my hair in prob 5 min. It does leave my hair a little bit frizzy but not as bad and the last model I used which was a long time ago. I have been air drying my hair since I was young cause the hair dryer my mom had sucked very much it fried your hair and left it frizzy. But even though it leaves it a little frizzy it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t get rid of with a quick run through with my straightener. I have pretty long, thick, color treated hair that usually takes a long time to dry so 5 min is awesome. It also leaves it with a nice shine. Other than the slight frizzing I love this hair dryer and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an earlier model that I had for years. Dries my hair quickly without damaging it.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Works similar to the other one I have at our Summer Home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blowdryer for years and my mom as well and we love it. It dries your hair really fast, leaves it shiny and freeze free, the dryer is super quiet, gives you a lot of heat options and its powerful.</li>
            <li> Air doesn&#x27;t feel as strong as expected. A bit heavier than expected too. This stays in the guest bathroom now. We bought another lighter and stronger hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Light, works well.  Shorter dryer time.  I really like having all the different heat options.  I have very thick, curly hair, and I straighten it often.  I need a hair dryer that is light, has all the attachments, and gets hot enough to dry my hair without damaging it.  After trying and returning others, this is just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Purchased 4/27/12. I&#x27;m estimating use from 5/2012 until 2/1/2015. Almost 3 years with about 4-5 uses per week at about 7-10 minutes per use. It cost me $50, the dryer came with 3 attachments/tools. My favorite was the round diffuser and the flat funnel-like attachment (sorry don&#x27;t know the name).&lt;br /&gt;Why 2 stars?? Well after a few weeks of not changing the attachments/tool, it seems that the  heat melted the attachment ever so slightly and it seemed to fuse to the barrel of the dryer!! So i could not remove attachment for the last year of it&#x27;s life span. oh, yeah and 2 stars cause it died at less than 3 years old.&lt;br /&gt;Effect of dryer on my hair: above average. My hair is fine,  slight wave, untreated, long (mid back). When I used Revlon or other dryers I noticed the difference by the amount of frizz and the length if time my hair took to dry (about 3-5 more minutes with other dryers).</li>
            <li> I have always LOVED Hot Tools products, especially their curling irons... I LOVE how very light this model is.  However, it takes way too long to dry my hair, so I am very disappointed.  When the company states:  &amp;#34;dries up to 50% faster&amp;#34;, I can&#x27;t imagine which hairdryers they are comparing this one to.  I would definitely buy a different model next time around, and am considering purchasing another that will dry my hair faster, even though this one should last me another year or two, as this one takes so annoyingly long.  Makes me dread washing my hair!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer with lots of power.  Had the same dryer for many years.  Bought this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> This was my daughter&#x27;s Christmas Present. She said she could not get over the quality and how well it dries her hair without matting! She was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Purchased a third dryer to replace an identical dead unit that was purchased after number one died. The only reason I bought a third dryer of this model is the price had dropped a ton, down to about what a WalMart cheapie would cost.These are great dryers,reducing my wife&#x27;s hair prep time dramatically, but you need to know going in that it will not last forever. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m really just renting it for a few months.If you&#x27;re hoping for something to use for more than about 10 months, keep looking.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is sleek looking and works very quietly compered to other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had VERY long hair when I purchased it and it was powerful enough to dry it completely in under 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the hair was dry but puffy and frizzy... Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a total novice and can&#x27;t seem to learn how to effectively style my hair with a hair dryer. If you know what you&#x27;re doing I am sure this would be a perfect tool for you, but for someone who does not know what he&#x27;s doing - the tool doesn&#x27;t work miracles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get [[ASIN:B000G9WVHU CHI Ceramic Hairstyling Iron for Silk Smooth Hair Model No. GF-1001]] as well and it works beautifully on dry hair - even for a clueless person like myself. The hair straightener works on wet hair as well but I feel like it damages the hair more, when the hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pairing both products together works well for me - I use the blow dryer to dry my hair super fast and then go over it with the straightener for a silky smooth pin stripe straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 9 months ago on the extreme recommendation of a salon and after reading so many reviews here at Amazon. It seemed to take forever to arrive, but I patiently waited becuase I was really looking forward to a high-quality hair dryer! At first, it was great...powerful with just enough heat to dry my hair quickly but not burn it. Within months I noticed the blower had lost some power and it was putting out too much heat and not enough air. I cleaned the filter and got a little of the power back, but now it&#x27;s pretty much toast. It&#x27;s very hot and the watts are probably half of what it was when I bought it less than a year ago. The filter is not dirty. I&#x27;ve had this problem with many blow dryers over the years (other \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; ones). We can send someone to the moon, but we can&#x27;t make a blow dryer that lasts! Don&#x27;t waste your money, this dryer will disappoint you in a matter of months.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer, many options.  It&#x27;s my second one, but only because my hubby decided to use the first one on a project in the barn...don&#x27;t ask, but he ruined it.  I like this dryer so much I bought a second one to replace the first!</li>
            <li> I did some research before buying a hair dryer and decided on this one. I travel often so I need two and I ended up buying a second one.  A bit pricey but very pleased. I would recommend buying it. Attachments are included!</li>
            <li> went for 45 minutes to dry my hair straight, to 10 minutes if I let it air dry a bit before hand. It does leave my scalp feeling a bit tinged from the heat, but well worth the time saving.</li>
            <li> Although this didn&#x27;t cut drying time compared to my old hair dryer, it has lots of settings in terms of temperature and air strength.  The buttons are right where your fingers grip the handle, which is the only downside, as I&#x27;ve accidentally changed settings a few times.  But it&#x27;s great hair dryer, lighter and more compact than my previous ones.</li>
            <li> She likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters. it has high airflow and feels comfortable to grip.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it lasts...</li>
            <li> So, I have long thick hair: so thick that if my hair isn&#x27;t layered my ponytail is usually the same size as my wrist: drying my hair has ALWAYS taken me at a minimum 20-30 minutes: more if I curl the ends or try to give it a shape. This hair dryer absolutely dried my hair in 6 minutes: bone dry. The pik it comes with works WONDERS because you dont have to brush with one hand and dry with the other. The diffuser is fabulous and works beautifully when I want to bring out the wavy in my hair. AND this dryer is super light. I feel like I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot with this little puppy. Well worth the price, and then some.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, long cord, light enough, hot heat setting is great--it&#x27;s really HOT! Great price too!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is great, I saw in you tube and thought I give it a try. It drys the hair quick and comb doesn&#x27;t fall off after a couple times of using. I use it in my daughter natural hair. Great dryer</li>
            <li> Purchased on the recommendation of my stylist.  Excellent hair dryer.  I don&#x27;t use the attachments, but that&#x27;s a personal choice.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair dresser. Love it! Well made. Works great.</li>
            <li> Very light, but dries quickly</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. Had looked for one that was not excessively noisy. Adjustable heat settings. Tourmaline Ionic drys hair quicker and leaves it shiny. Comes with nice attachments.</li>
            <li> This is actually my second hair dryer of the same company I had the first one for about 5 yrs which is honestly long seeing a how I use it every day and I had also shared it with my sister who used it everyday it was light easy to handle and I love the nozzle on the end to spacifically direct the air to my hair when I use my brush honestly love this hair dryer couldn&#x27;t live without it or my Paul Mitchell straightener... May be a tad expensive but it last longer then cheap ones...</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, before the suggested date so that was a plus! I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but had already used my sister&#x27;s (has exact same one) and I was very happy with the results. I have very curly hair and this dryer was excellent for blow-drying out the curl (fast and efficiently) and prepping hair for flat iron. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> this blow dryer works great &amp; it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair as it dries it, it does however take a little longer to dry your hair if you have long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries my hair very quickly so there&#x27;s less exposure to intense heat.  It&#x27;s more quiet than other dryers too.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!!  It&#x27;s light and dries hair so quickly.  There is even a cold shot buttton and a comb attachment that I can&#x27;t figure out how to use appropriately.</li>
            <li> I like the Hair Dryer very much as it is very light.  The power is good.  My only disappointment is that I thought it had 3 settings for the power. It only has 2, medium and high.  I wanted one that also had a Low power setting for finishing.  The heat settings are excellent.  I had a Wigo and I like this one much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a snob when it comes to hair and face products. My stepmom owns a salon and she always keeps me up to date with the best hair products, so when I tell you this hair dryer is awesome, I know what I&#x27;m talking about. I did tons of research before buying this hair dryer and no other hair dryer has it all like this one. It drys quickly, maybe not the quickest (but don&#x27;t forget for the price this dryer does more than it should). Its fairly quietâ€¦there are quieter ones out there, but again its decently quiet for the dryer it is. But heres whats so amazingâ€¦ what it does to my hairâ€¦ It makes it so straight, reduces fly aways/frizz, and makes my hair stay looking great all day! Awesome cord length too! I had a Hot Tools hair dryer before this one that I had for over 10 years! Great brand, great product, great price!</li>
            <li> It works fast and doesnt make your hair frizzy. Every time i use it i feel like my hair looks healthier and shiny</li>
            <li> The dryer doesn&#x27;t dry any faster than drug store hair dryers I&#x27;ve gotten in the past for @ $20.  It has two heat settings.  The high is too hot and has burned my hair twice.  Low is too cool.  Save your money and pick up your next dryer for $30 less at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer......</li>
            <li> Dries my hair (4 A/B) very quickly. No heat damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fine curly hair but TONS of it- I struggle with drying my hair without it getting frizzy. I always  need to use a diffuser- but then the driers always seem to crap out after a couple of years. I don&#x27;t know why that is- maybe the forced reduced air flow from the diffuser end constantly being used? Anyways, my last drier crapped out awhile ago... had to search for a new one. Went ahead and got this one because of the good reviews on here and used it for the first time this morning. I&#x27;m impressed! First of all, it&#x27;s super light weight! Second, the diffuser end goes on very easily and securely without having to snap it on, and I love that it has THREE heat options (four if you include the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34;) and THREE speeds. My hair was thoroughly dry and not frizzy within five minutes on high/hot (if I let my hair air dry it takes about 3-4 hours- no joke). Awesome little dryer. I hope it lasts awhile! If not I&#x27;d still replace if with the same kind. It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer has changed my life.  I have a lot of thick curly hair and with my previous hair dryer it would take hours to section each piece and blow-dry it out for straightening.  I was able to tame my curls in 45 minutes with this blowdryer and get it done better than before.  The only challenge with it is that the buttons are on the handle so I kept find myself accidentally blowing cold air instead of hot because I would push the buttons whenI gripped the handle.  It wasn&#x27;t problem though because I would just alternate from the handle to the nozzle and it got done quickly and thoroughly.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Based on my hairstylist&#x27;s recommendation and other users&#x27; reviews of this hair dryer, I expected to come out of my first use with hair like a girl from a shampoo commercial. People were going to throw money at my glorious mane, and men would fall to their knees in my wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That didn&#x27;t happen. This dryer...dried my hair. It didn&#x27;t dry it any faster, and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything magical to it that my previous dryer (a $25 drugstore purchase) didn&#x27;t do. All in all, I was OK with this purchase for a while. It did dryer-y things, and that was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, however, after only six months, I tried to use the cool setting and found that it no longer worked. Instead of shooting out cool air, it turned the dryer off altogether. This obviously meant the cool shot button didn&#x27;t work either. Then I noticed that flipping the switch caused blue sparks behind/around the switch. Note to self: don&#x27;t do that again. I figured it&#x27;d be fine, considering I still had medium and high heat. Well, medium was the next to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m down to a hair dryer that only dries on high heat (which, obviously, is not the best for my hair) after less than a year. This hair dryer has never been dropped or damaged in any way, and I only dry my hair once or twice a week, so it really hasn&#x27;t had a ton of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m contacting the manufacturer in the hope that there&#x27;s a one-year warranty or something; otherwise, I&#x27;d never buy a dryer from this company again.</li>
            <li> While it worked, this was a good blow-dryer.  It left my hair soft, smooth, and manageable.  I was very happy with the purchase.  And then.... it died after about 10 months.  For no apparent reason.  Dead.  Kaput.  I might have thought I simply got a one-per-thousand dud.  However... the previous Hot Tools blow-dryer I purchased died after about a year.  Ridiculous.  These are expensive blow-dryers.  They should last for years.  I will never buy another Hot Tools dryer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this second one died, I decided to purchase a $17 Revlon dryer.  It has all of the same features as this Hot Tools dryer.  I like it just as much.  And after nearly a year it shows no sign of breaking.  At less than one-third the price.  Sometimes a higher price doesn&#x27;t equate to higher quality.  At all.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Granddaughter and she loves it</li>
            <li> I understand hair dryers aren&#x27;t supposed to last forever.  However, when you can buy hair dryers for under $20 I would expect one costing over $50 to last AT LEAST a year.  We&#x27;ve owned 5 of these of your course of the past few years and they never go much longer then about 5 months.  To make matters worse, we don&#x27;t even use them daily and when we do, it&#x27;s minimal use.  AVOID!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one... the first one lasted two years.  Well worth paying a little extra for a better quality and longer lasting dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like this blow dryer and love all the attachments but I do have to say that they are not made of the strongest stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick hair and I worry that my hair will break the teeth on the brush attachment. Also note that non of the attachments fit other blow dryers so if the dryer breaks toss everything</li>
            <li> This lasted approx 1 year.  I used it mostly every day. Hot tools quality isn&#x27;t what it used to be.  I have to remember to save the warrantee because I&#x27;m sick of buying a new hair dryer every year! Very disappointed in t heir quality.</li>
            <li> I owned this hairdryer for about four years before I accidentally dropped it and broke the front. I ordered a new one and am very pleased with it. It is a great hairdryer and comes with good accessory components.</li>
            <li> This is one of the lightest blowdryers I&#x27;ve ever had.  Works well, has good power to straighten my hair and enough heat.  I purchased this from Ulta originally for 59.00 on sale regular retail was 84.99 and found this exact same model here.  Great price.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this blowdryer. I cannot stop bragging about it. It has dramatically changed the appearance of my hair after I blowdry it. My hair is more manageable, its soft and smooth, which is 100 times better than what my last dryer provided for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer on 7/7/2014 and today, it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new tourmaline 1043 ionic blow dryer this seller less than six months ago and the other day it just randomly stopped working. I&#x27;ve tried all of the directions to try to get it working again (resetting,etc.) and it still does not turn on. I had the same exact brand of blow dryer prior to buying this one and that one lasted me over two years. This one is obviously defective as I&#x27;ve barely used it. I would like to exchange it or return it. Please let me know how to handle.</li>
            <li> Wish it had the speeds in stead of two, but it gets the job done for sure! I like the sleekness of it, for sure!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and it is super course, and takes forever to dry. This hair dryer is really light, so my arms don&#x27;t get tired, and it cuts way down on the frizz, which is an added bonus. It also dries my hair in about half the time as my old dryer, and is more energy efficient. It comes with three attachments that are easy to use, and allow me to straighten my hair of poof out my curls. If you are in the market for a new hair dryer, look no further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this dryer for a long time, based on the Hot Tools curling iron I love, and the positive reviews. So I was secretly glad when my previous ($35 Andis) dryer of about 5 years died and I was ready to purchase.  I have to say, I&#x27;m not blown away (no pun intended). I should mention the first one I ordered worked for about 7 uses, then got SUPER hot, and then died. I returned it for another, but I&#x27;m not reviewing that first one, because I don&#x27;t like when people leave a bad review on an item when they obviously received a lemon.  So I&#x27;m going to review this item that works as intended, but I thought it might be important to mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the 2nd dryer for about 2 months and it does a fine job, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype, or the price! The buttons are right under my fingers and it is easy to press them when holding the dryer, which is irritating. It seems to be quieter than my last dryer, which is nice. I just don&#x27;t notice a difference in drying time, or texture of my hair (I have long, fine, wavy hair).  So I&#x27;m slightly disappointed, but I will keep this dryer for as long as it works.</li>
            <li> Best Blow Drier EVER .... love it.  Glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Already starting to pull apart at the seams.  Meticulously stored and has never been dropped, used on med or low heat.  Not as powerful as the Conair I had replaced.</li>
            <li> I had the lesser priced model with the same wattage and liked it so well decided to step up a notch when it broke.&lt;br /&gt;The rubberized finish on this is nice, the buttons are still in the wrong place and it is very easy to change the settings as you dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the attachments so that&#x27;s not a selling point for me.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I am having is this dryer does not get hot enough when I am brush curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the price and I&#x27;m sorry I ordered it. I will use it until it breaks but won&#x27;t order the Tourmaline again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dryer. I only use it about 2x a year well i went to press the cool shot button and the dryer cracked in half im kind of pissed about that but overall its a good dryer</li>
            <li> This is my second one. After three years it is nice to order a product again and all of features you liked about it are still there. Light weight, heats up hot, cools down quick, &amp; grips great!</li>
            <li> I used to think all hair dryers were the same.  Then I used a friend&#x27;s Hot Tools dryer and realized that my $15 dryer was horrible!  I will use this hair dryer from now on.  I really like the 3 different heat settings.  It also is easy to hold and comes with a longer than average cord that makes it easier to dry my hair the way I want to dry it - I am not held hostage by a short cord!  This dryer helps me style my hair the way my hair dresser does.  I never knew that buying a good hairdryer would make such a difference but it does.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law, who is a former hair stylist had bought me this brand of hair dryer five years ago. She had stayed at my house and used the one that I had which was purchased from a local retail store. She thought it was the worst product she had ever used. She then sent me as a gift the \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; brand. I loved that hair dryer as did both of my daughters. Just recently it had blown it&#x27;s last hair style, so I went online to find it again. They no longer make the kind that I had but I purchased another \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; dryer and I absolutely love it. This product is durable, but most importantly the speed in which it blows your hair dry is incredible.  I highly recommend this product for people with any type of hair. My money was well spent.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this hairdryer. We tried the same priced Babyliss Pro 2000 Watt Ionic, which I liked because it blew so hard. But, my hair is short. So if you have long hair this Tourmaline is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer! It makes my hair less frizzy than blow dryers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> After years of buying expensive, professional blow dryers, I tried this after my hairdresser used it on me. It works just as well, and it does so for much less money. It is as hot as any other dryer I&#x27;ve used, hotter than cheaper dryers, and it is light weight. I&#x27;ve bought a second one as a back-up because I can&#x27;t imagine ever using a different one ever again.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot more for this hairdryer at Ulta.  I wish I had checked Amazon first.  The hairdryer is llight, quiet and helps control frizz.  It isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as I expected it to be.  The buttons are in an inconvenient place on the handle, so it is easy to accidentally change the settings. I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for about 6 months and I am happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> Love it works beautiful on my hair. no noise at all and you can handle it very well  because it has a good grip plus it comes with two extra tools for your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair dryer, it truly is a professional grade unit.  She would (and has) reccomend to anyone looking for an economical but pro-strength hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works awesome when it works. I have purchased two hair dryers from this company and both did not last more than 2 years, which is very disappointing. I take very good care of my hair dryers, but the heating element stops producing heat in these dryers. The life of these dryers should be longer. I am now trying a different brand for ionic hair dryers and will write a review for that brand in about 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for over a year now. In fact I liked it so much after trying it, I bought a second one for my daughter (since she was always stealing mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PLUSES: It is more lightweight than other dryers we&#x27;ve had, it dries hair fairly fast, leaves it shiny, and less frizzy than our old dryer. The variety of speed/heat settings is nice too, since a lot of dryers have fewer settings. Our local salon also uses these dryers, although they sometimes complain about the downside to this dryer, which we have also experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DOWNSIDE: The comb attachment. It NEVER stays on!!! Both of our Tourmaline Tools Lite dryers have comb attachments with broken teeth due to it constantly flying off. It is very frustrating! Other than that, we really liked this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: One dryer started making loud fan noises after a year, and we had to get rid of it. We replaced it with an Andis (see my review on that one) -- I liked this one better than that one!</li>
            <li> Awesome hairdryer and diffuser especially for those with curly hair!  Great product and long lasting.  Had to replace my old one which lasted 9 years (cord eventually wore out)</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer with high expectations, this dryer is good if you have fine or medium hair however if your hair is thick to the point where you break combs.. this dryer WILL Not get it bone straight. if anyone with thick unruly hard to tame hair, this is not the dryer for you. ide reccomend twin turbo blowdryers, these are the dryers they use in Dominican salons.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. Gets too hot and makes hair quite frizzy. I actually burnt my scalp with this. It gets quite hot so you might want to be careful and watch the heat on it.  I am comparing it to my other Hot Tools hair dryer which I like better.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again if this one went kaput.</li>
            <li> This thing was just as advertised. It&#x27;s really hot! I really don&#x27;t know how it works because it was a gift for my neice. Thats what she wanted and I don&#x27;t talk to her that much</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these hairdryers in the last 3 years. The hairdryer is great while it works. Both dryers stopped working after about 18 months or so. I clean the lint collector regularly. I have short hair and so they don&#x27;t get a huge workout each day. Of course they stop functioning when they are out of the warranty period. I will contact the manufacturer before considering a third purchase.</li>
            <li> This dryer was recommended to me by my daughter.  I just love how my hair dries so fast and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> This item, Tourmaline 1043, does not have the speed and heat settings advertised on the box! We purchased it for the advertised 8 speed and heat settings. It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. Low heat is no heat. Medium is too high for low heat needs, like for fine hair. This is misleading advertising by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hairdryer.  It&#x27;s so light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down on your arm while using it.  The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is hot enough that it sometimes burns my scalp if I get too close.  I usually just need to dry my hair on the medium setting.  It also has a cold shot button.  This is by far the BEST hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  I even want to order another just as a backup.</li>
            <li> At the price, I feel like this should last me a few years.  It lasted almost 2 years and one day it just would not turn on.  While it worked it was great, but again for the price I felt like it would last much longer.  The blowdryer worked well but would get super hot.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because it is the same model my stylist uses.  It&#x27;s quieter than most, so I don&#x27;t wake up the entire house when I&#x27;m getting ready for work in the morning.  The buttons are accessible but not in the way.  (The buttons on my last dryer were placed in such a way that I was always shutting the dryer off while trying to dry my hair...very annoying!).  I can&#x27;t honestly say whether it takes less time to dry my hair, but I have definitely noticed fewer split ends, so that is good.  And the cord is super long, which is nice.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> She fell in love with this hair dryer when she borrowed it from her roommate and she absolutely loves using it. I can say that I have benefited from using this product as well. It leaves my hair looking smooth and friiz free.!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fast way to dry your hair, less damage and to save your own energy, you&#x27;ve just found it!  I love my dryer because it&#x27;s lightweight, it dries my hair super fast (I have fine hair, no misrepresentations here).  If you have thick hair of course you&#x27;ll take a little longer.  It keeps my hair healthy and shiny.  No complaints at all, just good stuff!</li>
            <li> I just received this hairdryer last week.  My hair has been coming out frizzy lately so when my old hairdryer died I decided to spend a little more for a higher quality one.  This hairdryer definitely helps with the frizz factor, however I am disappointed in the amount of time it takes to dry my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure what that other reviewer is talking about.  I think it actually takes longer than the last hairdryer I had.  Also, there are two sets of buttons on the handles (they are more like toggles).  There&#x27;s not much room for your thumb on the handle and the buttons are frequently hit while I&#x27;m blowdrying.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but for what I paid, I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> Use this on my daughter hair, she is only 6 and it does wonders - the comb works great, _</li>
            <li> Gave as a goft and the recipient reports a quiet blower which produces more volume in her hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this hair dryer.  Used a friend of mine&#x27;s and had to get one for myself.  Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought..no frizz, dries hair quick, all the adapters are great.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> My daughter has owned this particular hair dryer for a couple of years.  When I used hers I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair.  My hair frizzes easily.  I&#x27;m sooooo glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer ever that&#x27;s not professional. My hair dries quickly and the temperature gets really hot. It smooths flyaways and the attachments are really good.</li>
            <li> I researched blowdryers and found out that first came the ceramic ones...then the NEXT generation blow dryers were Tourmaline (which is essentially a ceramic plate with a ground up jewel [tourmaline] in the ceramic itself).  I didn&#x27;t put much stock in this except that the claim is that Tourmaline plus Ceramic make even MORE negative IONS...which leads to quicker dry times.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I thought this was all  a bunch of sales pitch.  But I loved the fact that this blowdryer had a nice non slippery matte finish and it was less than $50.&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered it, tried it...and for the time my old blowdryer used to take to dry my bangs, this one had ALL my hair dry-and my hair is midback length!!!  So, being from a scientific background, I felt compelled to time it the next time.  Full head of medium thickness, midback length hair- 4min26seconds. No joke.  Tourmaline works.  Ha, who knew?!</li>
            <li> Save your money. I know 3 people including myself that have the same problem with this highly rated dryer. The comb wont stay attached. Such good reviews &amp; high price for a mediocre hair dryer</li>
            <li> She likes it alot!  Alot more power than her last blow dryer, even heat, and all three girls are ready faster!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and this dryer does a great job.  The location of the buttons is perfect in that you don&#x27;t turn the dryer off and on accidentally while drying your hair.  I especially like how long the cord isâ€¦very convenient.</li>
            <li> worked well for a year, but no longer blows hot air.</li>
            <li> I received this item when I enrolled in beauty school, in my student kit. From the first time I used it I was pleased. 10 months later after months of constant use they burned out. So i bought another one via amazon and I am soooo happy. Trust me its hard to work in a shop without may favorite item, I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> I should of read all the reviews, I noticed this has happened to many people that have purchased the same blow dryer. My Cheap blow dryers usually last over 5 years and still working, Im just usually in need of an upgrade. VERY disappointed in this blow dryer. Finally bought a professional one, and it broke just after 1 year. I would NOT recommend this item. and don&#x27;t think amazon should put their name on it either</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I feel like I get a salon look  from the hair dryer!  I have bought many hot tools product, and I will buy more, never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it had a long straightening pik un the picture and it came with a short one not happy about it! Other than that its a good blowdryer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two now, my second one just died this morning.  No warning, slow down, funny sounds or anything.  Just won&#x27;t turn on anymore.  No thanks, no more.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my older model but still does the job.</li>
            <li> I had been buying cheaper blow dryers that would break quickly.  I originally bought this one in a retail store but hadn&#x27;t used it yet. I saw the price on Amazon was a lot cheaper so I returned the other one to the store.  I am very happy with this one.  It is quiet and has a very comfortable grip.  The buttons are in just the right places to change settings while drying.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend it.  Hopefully it will last longer... haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell yet.</li>
            <li> really nice hairdryer for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very long thick hair and this dryer does the trick!  Just bought my second one because my first one (bought in 1997!) just died.  I&#x27;ve never had a dryer last so long...highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer for a couple of years and the handle of the dryer totally peeled and flaked every time I would use it. As far as the performance of the dryer, it worked well. The medium setting on it was very hot for medium and the low setting was actually cold.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very heavy, would much rather have it be lighter in weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same Conair $20 dryer for about 10 years. It worked okay when I was a kid, but recently I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t get hot, and takes a long time to dry my hair. Also, I have naturally wavy hair, and it seems to make it even more frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait for this dryer to come in the mail. I looked a lot of reviews, and this one seemed the best for the amount of money I wanted to spend. I used it for the first time this morning and It dryed my hair in almost half the time! My hair came out smoother, and less frizzy than it has been in years. I am already a BIG fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer said that the buttons are in the way of holding the handle. I did have a little trouble not changing the settings on accident while I was drying my hair, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it didn&#x27;t specify that it came with a diffuser attachment, so I bought one separately. It did indeed come with one, so now I&#x27;ll send the other one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, BIG fan! And, from the reviews I&#x27;ve looked at, it should last me a while.</li>
            <li> Started making noises after a month and amazon won&#x27;t let me return for a new one</li>
            <li> This is one of the best blow dryers I ever had.  Powerful and gets the job done quickly.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that even though I purchase MANY things from Amazon, nothing has compelled me to write a review like this item. I purchased this about 1 year ago- not only for the 1875 Watts, but for the tourmaline Ionic combo. I have long combination hair (a little wavy in areas, a little curly in areas, and downright a little \\&quot;rough\\&quot; in other areas lol). I needed a comb attachment with the dryer, so I thought that this would be the best fit for me. My first use, I thought it did okay. It DID dry my hair quickly, but it did not straighten my hair as my last dryer did. SO I did find myself having to follow up the treatment with my ceramic flat iron, which defeated the purpose of the low damage to your hair selling point. Now to get to the downfall... I dont know what happened after the first couple uses, but the comb attachment no longer stays attached! It falls off with the smallest amount of tension, making blow dry sessions A PAIN in the you know what... I have tried everything to make it stay, but now I have resorted to using an OVEGLOVE to hold the dern thing together everytime I make a pass....SO, if you have long hair and it is not treated and sometimes unmanageable, be ready to continuously pick this comb attachment up off the floor every pass, unless you want to put your OVEGLOVE to good use. I am thinking about purchasing a universal attachment and if that doesnt work, I will be back to purchasing another Yellow Bird blow dryer....!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, as I have long, thick hair, so after a while, I am conscious of it&#x27;s weight.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it use to take me forever to blow dry hair but now its dry in less than 5 min</li>
            <li> This dryer is very effective. It is suitable for it&#x27;s intended purpose. The tip does fall off in the hair.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer was great while it worked.  But 6 months after I purchased it it just stopped working in the middle of drying my hair.  I tried to determine the problem but can&#x27;t figure anything out.  And of course I&#x27;m out of the return policy time.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t very powerful, overall it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Love it, dries hair quickly without damaging.  Price on Amazon beat every retailer hands down.</li>
            <li> I liked this dryer and thought it dried my hair quickly and did a good job minimizing frizz. However my mom was upset when hers stopped working at just over a year and I figured it was a fluke. Unfortunately mine quite working at 17 months. The dryer I had previously was cheaper and lasted much much longer and I&#x27;m not willing to spend more money on a product that won&#x27;t last as long as I expect. Trying a different brand for the next one.</li>
            <li> Its a strong powerful blow dryer...what do you expect a blow dryer to do.. dries hair quickly and does not cause knots</li>
