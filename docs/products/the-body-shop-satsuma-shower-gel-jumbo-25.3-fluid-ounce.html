            <li>This is the absolute greatest scent of any body wash.</li>

            <li>If you like the smell of oranges then you will love this scent.</li>

            <li>but now at more than $1 per ounce</li>
            <li>I love Satsuma.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this body wash.</li>
            <li>I have been a b.shop user for many years</li>
            <li>Pump on top not kid proof.</li>
            <li>Now it is much more challenging to get the soap out.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Theres nothing better than showering with this in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This is my favorite showergel.....</li>
            <li>Wanted some wonderful smelling body wash for the recovery room after the birth of my second child.</li>
            <li>So long as the bottle isn&#x27;t abused, you will probably be very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it to bathe my toddler, but loved the scent so much that I started using it for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and she wants MORE!</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST shower gel/ wash for the morning or when you feel you need a little lift.  </li>
            <li>I reorder this product yeary it has a great odor which enhances not only your body but adjacent rooms.</li>
            <li>the cost is no longer justified.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy this shower gel.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth and</li>
            <li>I will instead focus on some important aspects of useage and the bottle itself</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin really smooth.  </li>
            <li>This fit the bill</li>
            <li>It is also good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and also leaving my whole bathroom smelling the same.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and this size is super economical.</li>
            <li>I love to give it as a gift; it&#x27;s always received very well.</li>
            <li>The reviews are true.  </li>
            <li>first body wash my husband and I will both use!  </li>
            <li>I even got the clycerine soap version, and now my entire bathroom smells amazing all the time.</li>
            <li>The price is worth the size the bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and the bottle has enough to last a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly clean with just the right kind of citrus smell that you can only get with satsumas (Japanese clementines).</li>
            <li>general - a good overall value.</li>
            <li>Love the scent so much I use it regularly anyway.</li>
            <li>less lather and less wonderful mandarin sell</li>
            <li>At nearly $1/oz, I don&#x27;t think its really worth it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>Then you might wish it didn&#x27;t weigh so much.</li>
            <li>It smells like tangerines and lathers really really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The aforementioned 2 year old who drops bottles - happened to break the pump off the top.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the other people said this product is refreshing and lathers well.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong and long lasting citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>Most my other liquid soaps have those &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; open lids, but its nice to just push the nozzle down to get the soap.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend The Body Shop Satsuma Shower Gel.</li>
            <li>We have several other &amp;#34;smell-good&amp;#34; liquid soaps, some of which are fairly costly, and this is at least twice the size of most of them.</li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but its a nice little feature making this soap easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very rich citrus smell but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Well, let me just say that it looks nice not having ANOTHER solid white or black shampoo bottle sitting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>scent is a natural citrus with a pop of sweetness.  </li>
            <li>Not so girlie that my other half won&#x27;t use it either :)</li>
            <li>Disappointed... this is not the intense aroma that I has experienced in the same product I have bought in the store..</li>
            <li>Generally I use this with a sponge.</li>
            <li>And more irritating, it does not lather well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> first body wash my husband and I will both use!  Only issue is it doesn&#x27;t create a lot of suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also love body shop products for no animal testing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I originally purchased it to bathe my toddler, but loved the scent so much that I started using it for me. I shower w/it at home and will not travel without it.  I love to give it as a gift; it&#x27;s always received very well.</li>
            <li> Satsuma is my favorite Body Shop scent ever.  I have an affinity toward the smell of oranges for some reason and this scent is spot on.  It smells like the freshest, juiciest, and ripest oranges.  The scent of this soap doesn&#x27;t linger like a lot of hand soaps do unfortunately.  This jumbo size has lasted me about eight months with daily use.  It has a thicker consistency and you really only need one pump.  If you like the smell of oranges then you will love this scent.</li>
            <li> I just received this for Christmas, along with the Body Butter.  It&#x27;s an amazing fragrance, and it lingers on your skin.  It smells like orange zest - if you like citrusy fragrances, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love this one!</li>
            <li> Most awesome shower product ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she wants MORE! She said the smell is unbelievable and her skin feels like silk after. I would highly recommend The Body Shop Satsuma Shower Gel.</li>
            <li> I reorder this product yeary it has a great odor which enhances not only your body but adjacent rooms. It is also good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the other people said this product is refreshing and lathers well. It smells like weird cheap soap, nothing fancy about it. And more irritating, it does not lather well and it sure is not moisturizing. I had to mix it with another body wash to give me extra lathering and skin softener.&lt;br /&gt;I just stopped using it after awhile, waste of money. Stick with Dove!</li>
            <li> Wish this product was sulfate-free.  Love the scent so much I use it regularly anyway.</li>
            <li> We love the smell and the fact that it is a competent body wash but now at more than $1 per ounce the cost is no longer justified. The Body Shop continues to out price its value.</li>
            <li> I love Satsuma. I have used it for years, the large bottle is great! It came quickly and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Fragrant and amazing product!</li>
            <li> Resist the urge to drink this stuff. Every time I shower I just want to rip the pump off this thing and pour it down my throat. But don&#x27;t do it. It tastes like soap. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the price. At nearly $1/oz, I don&#x27;t think its really worth it. But, it might be. I&#x27;m hoping I can find it cheaper somewhere else, because I don&#x27;t know if I can give it up. It&#x27;s like crack for my olfactory system.</li>
            <li> My favourite bath/shower gel from the body shop. Love the fragrance and this size is super economical. Not so girlie that my other half won&#x27;t use it either :)</li>
            <li> Disappointed... this is not the intense aroma that I has experienced in the same product I have bought in the store.. less lather and less wonderful mandarin sell.. why is that I ask?  So sad how can this happen I ask? Did I get scammed?  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, love this in the shower. Wish the pump spout stuck out further so pumping onto a shower pouf would be&lt;br /&gt;easier. And sadly the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger as long as I would like after the shower. Nice to use before the body cream.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash. It lathers well and feels great on the skin. The price is worth the size the bottle it comes in. Definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is that beautiful fragrant smell... Mmmmm... I love it!!!!!! This is a product that is always in my shower.</li>
            <li> Great Value for the price.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy this shower gel. It leaves my skin silky smooth and the best thing about this product is the fact that it smells the whole house of tangerines and clementine. A must buy.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST shower gel/ wash for the morning or when you feel you need a little lift.  I have been a b.shop user for many years -&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a natural citrus with a pop of sweetness.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I would say buy it from The Body Shop site but L&#x27;Oreal owns them now and..... well it doesn&#x27;t matter.  They always have great deals though.  I also recommend the bar soaps.</li>
            <li> Instead of repeating what others have said (yes, it smells good) I will instead focus on some important aspects of useage and the bottle itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Its a big bottle. We have several other &amp;#34;smell-good&amp;#34; liquid soaps, some of which are fairly costly, and this is at least twice the size of most of them. If you like specialty soaps, this is generally a good value for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The pump on the bottle is a good feature. Most my other liquid soaps have those &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; open lids, but its nice to just push the nozzle down to get the soap. I know this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but its a nice little feature making this soap easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The orange color adds a nice decorative pallete to my shower. You say you don&#x27;t care about shower aesthitics eh? Well, let me just say that it looks nice not having ANOTHER solid white or black shampoo bottle sitting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Its a big bottle. Didn&#x27;t I just say this was a pro? Yes - UNLESS you happen to drop it on your foot. Or your two-year-old drops it on his foot. Then you might wish it didn&#x27;t weigh so much. Be careful with handling in a wet shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Pump on top not kid proof. The aforementioned 2 year old who drops bottles - happened to break the pump off the top. Now it is much more challenging to get the soap out. Be careful not to damage this component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I would like. Generally I use this with a sponge. I understand lather isn&#x27;t necessary, but I personally like it in my soaps. This product doesn&#x27;t lather nearly as well as some of my other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general - a good overall value. Smells great, and the bottle has enough to last a while. So long as the bottle isn&#x27;t abused, you will probably be very happy with this purchase. 4 stars!</li>
            <li> Yes you can go for this product although I am planning to get strawberry the next!! It definitely prevents your skin from getting too dry.. Softness is its nature.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute greatest scent of any body wash. It&#x27;s incredibly clean with just the right kind of citrus smell that you can only get with satsumas (Japanese clementines). I even got the clycerine soap version, and now my entire bathroom smells amazing all the time. You cannot go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  I read the reviews on here and other reviews prior to ordering it.  The reviews are true.  It smells wonderful and also leaving my whole bathroom smelling the same.  It has a very rich citrus smell but not overwhelming.  It also leaves my skin really smooth.  I decided to use shower gel instead of soap because soap leaves my skin really dry especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Satsuma body wash!  It has a very strong and long lasting citrus scent.  One bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 10 years now and I still cant get enough. It smells like tangerines and lathers really really well.&lt;br /&gt;My skin smells so wonderful when I come out of a shower...and the smell lifts my spirits. Theres nothing better than showering with this in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It makes you feel so uplifted....the smell of tangerine is incredible...This is my favorite showergel.....</li>
            <li> Always have loved this smell from the body shop.</li>
            <li> Wanted some wonderful smelling body wash for the recovery room after the birth of my second child. This fit the bill and I have put the extra in our guest bath.  So glad I found this!</li>
