            <li>Really nice trimmer!</li>
            <li>Outstanding trimmer one of the best</li>
            <li>great product - my boyfriend is very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>Works great, so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>The guards work good for that.</li>
            <li>It has good power, holds a charge, and is light-weight,</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to a stylist looking for a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge, and it works fairly well as a balding clipper as well, if you don&#x27;t mind taking your time.  </li>
            <li>Quality isn&#x27;t really good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed that you don&#x27;t have to spend that much more to get a trimmer that is exponentially better.</li>
            <li>But I seriously love this tool!</li>
            <li>This clipper is great for it&#x27;s intended use, probably one of the best rechargeable clippers out there and probably the only one that&#x27;s still made here in the good ole USA.  </li>
            <li>Come on Andis, you can do better than this!        </li>
            <li>It charges well and stays charged for a great amount of time, however I feel I have to go over a spot to get a good clean edge.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this is the best trimmer out there, but it certainly does it for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer as a finishing trimmer for my wife to use to help me finish after I cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Had one almost identical and it lasted many years with good service  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this trimmer for 5 years and it&#x27;s still working nicely and holding a charge well.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and my husband uses so much without any complaints.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase thanks.</li>
            <li>This is a my 4th set of cordless trimmers and by far the best.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve found as far as a cordless goes</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I ever had.  </li>
            <li>The most surprising and impressive feature is how long it holds a charge.</li>
            <li>Being cordless, the life of the trimmer is also very important, and this one gets an A+</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s maneuverable and easy to operate around the ears and mustache- beard area and the t-blade is precise on the hairline-edges, with a good ground steel blade.</li>
            <li>As with any Andis product you need to properly zero gap the blade for best results.</li>
            <li>Many years ago I bought a Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>It was rechargeable and also worked well for many years.</li>
            <li>After looking for something worthwhile I found the Andis.</li>
            <li>This is really built well and does a great job with my beard.</li>
            <li>Mostly use it to trim my beard.</li>
            <li>This is more of a preference for wanting that option</li>
            <li>its ok ...  </li>
            <li>They are outstanding for trimming your beard.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this trimmer a lot more.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size and weight, and fits comfortably in the hand while trimming the beard (what I use it for exclusively).    </li>
            <li>It also has better speed than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I was able to set the blade for a even closer cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of cheaply made but which affordable ones aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Used it for touch ups mostly.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot better than the Peanut I used to use.</li>
            <li>I love the 1/16 \\&quot;zero\\&quot; guard attachment.  </li>
            <li>I bang this trimmer on the counter top</li>
            <li>The Edger II also didn&#x27;t glide across my face as well as my Outliner II, causing more irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer in everyway except it has no cover for the blade</li>
            <li>and I would be completely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;beard\\&quot; trimmer is just OK.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li>The shave is much better than the shave from the Andis Slim Line 2 Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>After charging the unit and feeling the integrity of the unit , I was more than satisfied with the cost Value for product.</li>
            <li>Works great when I cut my wife&#x27;s hair, worth the money but does not work as good as a straight razor on the neck area.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product more than five years</li>
            <li>&quot; they are probably the best cordless trimmers out here, and a solid investment for under $40.</li>
            <li>My clients love it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s lot better than the Wahl I was using.</li>
            <li>thus I have had many trimmers.  </li>
            <li>They are great for grooming and has a decent line.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, its precise, and does not pinch at all.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good Edger.</li>
            <li>Works good and gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>Pretty good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>does a good job trimming and evening beards, I use mine weekly to get a nice clean look, holds a charge decently</li>
            <li>Love this edger, light efficient.</li>
            <li>The size is good and the stainless steel teeth on the clippers won&#x27;t scratch or nick your skin one bit.  </li>
            <li>Stays charged for a long time, quite neat, Best one for the price, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>We have owned probably 5 other brands over the years,she says this is the best without a doubt.</li>
            <li>Work great, I use it for quick touch ups and mustache trimming mainly.  </li>
            <li>Bought two of these and gave one to my son and he&#x27;s found it so easy to use as well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold because the size isn&#x27;t bulky.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Its easy to maintain and use.</li>
            <li>Its still going strong.</li>
            <li>but the motor is still going strong</li>
            <li>I charged for the first time and clipped my own hair in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The comb attachments have good stable integrity and after reading the manual over a few times , I figured the operating usage on keeping the battery at an optimum charge and hopefully extend the life of it to allow for many years of service.</li>
            <li>These edgers are okay and cut is not bad.</li>
            <li>(Whal, Andis, CHI &amp; Oster) are fine but the Andis T-Edjer II just does a tighter line with easier control.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge and works just fine.</li>
            <li>does it make a huge difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars but the charger/cradle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>Trims very evenly and fast great</li>
            <li>Worked great, lasting a lot of years.</li>
            <li>After years of replacing cheap namebrand beard trimmers all-too-often, I gave Andis a try.  </li>
            <li>For heavy use, this may not be the best option.  </li>
            <li>These things are light weight</li>
            <li>Cuts close, doesnt pull or catch hairs, and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>While it is true that the plastic attachments could have benefited from more teeth (guides), this is a sturdy machine that is not going to give out quickly, and it holds a charge for longer so that you don&#x27;t lose power towards the end.  </li>
            <li>they just didn&#x27;t cut my hair right for me, I sent more time trying to cut my hair than anything else in my day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as the corded trimmer I have, but it works great, is very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise, doesn&#x27;t vibrate in your hand too much and is so easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer at first.  </li>
            <li>So not wanting to have to deal with a corded unit, and hoping that a higher end cordless trimmer would do a better job, I decided that for the money, this trimmer was about what I was looking for.    </li>
            <li>I need it to be able to scoop more when I cut around the ears and it takes a bit more going over the same spot.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted me more than a year.</li>
            <li>When I found another one on Amazon, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>(you can hear it start to downcycle after barely 30 seconds, but it will keep going for a good while.)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Works well, cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li>They work good for the most part, but the minute that the blade needs to be changed, be careful.</li>
            <li>Very precise, straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it most of a year now and must say I really like it.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full capability</li>
            <li>you can use it with no attachments on your face for that permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow - which my wife hates - but its a cool weekend look</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>Battery has a good enough charge life.</li>
            <li>This is a good basic trimmer.</li>
            <li>I really did love these cordless clippers for the price, but I guess i will continue my search.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars only because all cordless trimmers to me are not as good as corded.</li>
            <li>I was really suprised to see any less-than-5 star reviews for the T-Edjer II, because I feel this is hands down the best beard trimmer money can buy.</li>
            <li>The blades on the Andis Trimmer are not very sharp, so you do not get a nice, clean trim.  </li>
            <li>but i thought it would be a great beard trimmer based on some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer was working fine for the first 3 months, but then the two screws holding the blade to the unit started getting looser and looser.</li>
            <li>Nice Trimmers ,Fast Ship, Thanks</li>
            <li>Nice product fast shipping Thanks again</li>
            <li>Luckily that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the T top to the blades as that gives me more ability to get a closer trim and to get around my ears and my upper lip while not chopping off my mustache or beard.</li>
            <li>Super close shave</li>
            <li>The corded are more powerful, but much louder and made for the head, not the beard.</li>
            <li>It great when it works, but not worth the price until the mechanical issues are resolved.</li>
            <li>As an Afro-American...these trim with great precision hands down.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This litte trimmer is outstanding, small but very powerful, for the close trimming around the ears, and neckline, and keeps beard nice and even.</li>
            <li>great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It was cheaply made and pulled as much as it cut.</li>
            <li>Extremely light and fast for a cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what you can get for an extra 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go as far as saying it&#x27;s an elegantly designed product.  </li>
            <li>but it sounds like it&#x27;s going to die even after a fresh charge.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairdresser and most of my clients are men.</li>
            <li>then I would have exchanged it for another because it does seem well built and powerful for its size.</li>
            <li>Now I can trim my self up in my bathroom in no time i&#x27;m always fresh now....</li>
            <li>-right without it&#x27;s charger.</li>
            <li>The price is right and comparable to the price I paid at a beauty supply for licensed professionals.</li>
            <li>just right i can get it to turn on.</li>
            <li>but it just won&#x27;t do me right</li>
            <li>Right out the box</li>
            <li>Right on time.  </li>
            <li>It does what I need it to do, but I&#x27;m sure someone could do a little better for this price point.</li>
            <li>The wahls were alright performance wise, but weren&#x27;t particularly impressive...they did an ok job for shortening, but didn&#x27;t leave extremely clean lines, especially after a few months of use.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to replace my corded Andis for these.</li>
            <li>This thing is so powerful and cuts very close</li>
            <li>The first lasted about 8 months and stopped charging.</li>
            <li>I have the exact unit and this is a backup, It will be used someday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to handle my entire head with it.      </li>
            <li>I ruined mine the first week and had to ship it in for repairs...</li>
            <li>The first one lasted fifteen years.  </li>
            <li>Seems pretty underpowered also.</li>
            <li>Had the same for many years before the battery went south.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have cut my facial hair a lot better and closer, it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I just used them for the first time today and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i made this my second purchase, I always trust Andis for a quality product and they didn&#x27;t disappoint with this model.</li>
            <li>These also hold a charge pretty darn well.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a short term replacement after dropping my favorite clippers.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed in order to make the project I was working on work.  </li>
            <li>and they were super helpful and got a new comb out immediately.</li>
            <li>Just love it and just as good as expensive brands.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking just to do some very minor trimming, this may be for you, and I can say it does seem to have considerably better build quality than the cheaper ones that I have owned.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would change is that the switch comes on somewhat easily, so I&#x27;ve ended up with no charge a couple of times after putting it in my toiletries bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Extra points for being easy to maintain and well-built.</li>
            <li>I am a super busy stylist who does approx 40 mens cuts per week...</li>
            <li>The beard and face area will not definitely not get as close as most will like, but if it&#x27;s for trimming the beard and mustache down from homeless to sexy level, then it will do.</li>
            <li>I have used them for years love this product very reliable and easy care , only had to replace last set because they were very old and plastic cracked .</li>
            <li>Was looking for sharp clean cuts with this but a best it leaves behind a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as robust or quiet as the heavy duty corded models but does a great job for trimming and touch up.  </li>
            <li>After the initial 10 minutes, the sound starts lowering in volume.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it was really designed for beards.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more careful now.  </li>
            <li>NIMH batteries are very susceptible to damage from overcharging.</li>
            <li>Tighten the screw too much and the housing of the screw will break.</li>
            <li>use the 3/8\\&quot; attachment on sideburns / around ears and skip a whole haircut @</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work very well for shaving my face.  </li>
            <li>so I had to let it go because  it  cost me too much because  of the life it lives .</li>
            <li>I wish I had time to purchase this item from Amazon, but I paid twice as much for it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the trimmer for a couple of months now and it keeps a good charge for a least 2 weeks unpluged .</li>
            <li>I have previosuly owned a couple cheap wahl cordless trimmers, for simple trimming of facial hair, and to clean up my neck every so often.    </li>
            <li>This is a really powerful trimmer and is exactly the same one I&#x27;ve seen at hair salons.  </li>
            <li>I have a particularly rough/course stubble, and this is the only trimer that I have used that was able to cut it down comfortably.</li>
            <li>, I feel that if you take the time to care for your trimmer or any clipper you own, it will last a very long time)</li>
            <li>It is much faster and better than the previous &#x27;home&#x27; trimmer that I had before.  </li>
            <li>The teeth on them are so far apart that it makes them less than effective in guiding hair towards the blade.</li>
            <li>It was fine because one hour is very long for a battery powered clipper.  </li>
            <li>My previous two were retired after many years &amp; a decade of services upon clients.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my previous for that.  </li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>You can replace the battery on this product, but I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you have decent electronics repair (including soldering) skills.</li>
            <li>Sadly, the performance gain over the cheaper wahl units is marginal at best, and I&#x27;ll probably be looking at conceding the point, and just getting a nicer corded model in the future.    </li>
            <li>It holds a decent charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Edger II did trim hair decently well, but since I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose</li>
            <li>They come with the guards and they hold a charge a decent time.</li>
            <li>Andis T-Edjer II is a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Since I shave my facial hair every day, I had to find a replacement trimmer quickly.  </li>
            <li>reviews had many different responses to these questions , but the final evaluation is needed to get maximum longevity of the unit.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for any one who doesn&#x27;t like the larger , more cumbersome corded or larger cordless trimmers.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was its use of induction charging over charge points, as every charge point shaver I&#x27;ve purchased has eventually corroded or stopped charging at some point.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;d say they arrived in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you whether the new battery actually lives up to its 5000mAh rating or how long it will last in this device, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the upgrade.</li>
            <li>Another flaw of this trimmer is that , the blade gets very hot after only a min.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Andis products, but not their cordless line.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really liking this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Professional Stylist is using this product and bought this as a replacement for one that just died recently after many years of almost daily ise in a salon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly powerful for its size and would knock off sideburns and hair on the back of my neck no problem.  </li>
            <li>Battery is long lasting, it is unbelivable, could run more than fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>Other customer reviews indicate that this may be a fine product, but I don&#x27;t plan to find out.  </li>
            <li>Other trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past, although not terrible, would need recharging much more frequently.</li>
            <li>They last for years if you treat them right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried replacement blades but they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as a new razor.</li>
            <li>Works like new now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, fits comfortably in the hand, and the blade has retained its sharpness after about 10 months of use... not daily use, mind you, but fairly regular use.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve spent over $700 on the same liner I love</li>
            <li>They are quiet and very precise - the total opposite of these.  </li>
            <li>However, this trimmer is loud!</li>
            <li>This is our second, as our first lasted quite a number of years, until was donated to a friend who had none.</li>
            <li>Also mine, after the initial full charge, was defective and would not charge back up again.</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer about every-other day and the battery life seems to be kind of weak.</li>
            <li>Good edger for the price, better than the other random 3 that I&#x27;ve owned over the years!</li>
            <li>Did not last very long  until a cheap plastic support part inside the trimmer broke .</li>
            <li>Great clippers for cutting around the neck line and the edges of my boys&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>My wife cuts my and my son&#x27;s hair and this was a great addition to her home hair cutting tools.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too loud.</li>
            <li>I am a professional stylist and I think it must be really loud for my clients to have to listen to.</li>
            <li>After 3 months it died completely so I tossed it.</li>
            <li>That is because Andis assumed it would be used professionally all day.  </li>
            <li>A wire brush fixed it</li>
            <li>I dropped mine and they were loud</li>
            <li>very well made &amp; solid feel.  </li>
            <li>I also used&lt;br /&gt;Andis T-Edjer II Professional trimmers to shave.</li>
            <li>I have friends who do hair professionally and recommended the brand.</li>
            <li>a professional hairdresser</li>
            <li>These are loud and don&#x27;t get that close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I currently use an Andis Outliner II to shave my face, which works very well.  </li>
            <li>I fixed one up myself</li>
            <li>I Have had to contact Andis customer service when I broke a tooth on the comb of my old edger</li>
            <li>This keeps its charge, but the overall blade speed is very lackluster</li>
            <li>OLD Review:</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I use this professionally</li>
            <li>I have been been using them professionally for 9 years.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is exactly the same model that i have owned for the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>It is the 2nd time I have bought the same model, however, first time off of amazon.</li>
            <li>For me, it pulls your hair and sort of does not trim the beard even or seems like the blades is not fast enough to trim like a true hair cutter.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m hesitant to believe that, i think it&#x27;s pretty rough on your face.  </li>
            <li>This one that I&#x27;ve had for a few months already is still on it&#x27;s first charge!    </li>
            <li>I just got this trimmer after reading all the positive reviews about how this thing is sharp and how it doesn&#x27;t nip or scratch the skin.</li>
            <li>but if u are not going to use it frequently then i would definitely get the 04710 pro trimmer.</li>
            <li>My old one finally died after well over 10 years of use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s American made, no-frills and professional.  </li>
            <li>The last 2 have been complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently it started buzzing loudly during use, so I pulled the blades off and gave them a run over the sharpening stone, cleaned the hair out and re-greased the parts.</li>
            <li>Not built for long life or black people  hair or stubborn  and  strong grey course hair</li>
            <li>-- this cordless one is much louder and not as sharp..</li>
            <li>It not sharp enough to shave</li>
            <li>It got to the point that I could barely get my standard touch-up job -- eyebrows, sideburns, and over the ears -- done before the power ran out.  </li>
            <li>My old one would not hold a charge as long, and i had never replaced the blades..</li>
            <li>the salon (that&#x27;s usually the only reason I had to go so often) and only go when you need a full haircut.    </li>
            <li>ON/OFF switch is loose and loudly vibrates when shaver is on!</li>
            <li>The daily  personal beard- grooming - The multiple Stylist Professional constant work unit-</li>
            <li>Wipe excess oil off with a soft dry cloth...</li>
            <li>I dry shave with my Andis T-Outliner, but I travel overseas frequently</li>
            <li>and unfortunately it&#x27;s impossible to find a good neck trimmer that&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li>To clean the blades we suggest to immerse (sic) the blades only into a shallow pan of Andis Clipper Oil while the clipper is running.\\&quot;    Yikes.</li>

            <li> Outstanding trimmer one of the best</li>
            <li> great product - my boyfriend is very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Works great, so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> The guards work good for that.</li>
            <li> It has good power, holds a charge, and is light-weight,</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to a stylist looking for a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge, and it works fairly well as a balding clipper as well, if you don&#x27;t mind taking your time.  </li>
            <li> Quality isn&#x27;t really good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed that you don&#x27;t have to spend that much more to get a trimmer that is exponentially better.</li>
            <li> But I seriously love this tool!</li>
            <li> This clipper is great for it&#x27;s intended use, probably one of the best rechargeable clippers out there and probably the only one that&#x27;s still made here in the good ole USA.  </li>
            <li> Come on Andis, you can do better than this!        </li>
            <li> It charges well and stays charged for a great amount of time, however I feel I have to go over a spot to get a good clean edge.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is the best trimmer out there, but it certainly does it for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer as a finishing trimmer for my wife to use to help me finish after I cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Had one almost identical and it lasted many years with good service  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this trimmer for 5 years and it&#x27;s still working nicely and holding a charge well.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and my husband uses so much without any complaints.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a my 4th set of cordless trimmers and by far the best.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve found as far as a cordless goes</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I ever had.  </li>
            <li> The most surprising and impressive feature is how long it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> Being cordless, the life of the trimmer is also very important, and this one gets an A+</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maneuverable and easy to operate around the ears and mustache- beard area and the t-blade is precise on the hairline-edges, with a good ground steel blade.</li>
            <li> As with any Andis product you need to properly zero gap the blade for best results.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I bought a Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It was rechargeable and also worked well for many years.</li>
            <li> After looking for something worthwhile I found the Andis.</li>
            <li> This is really built well and does a great job with my beard.</li>
            <li> Mostly use it to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> This is more of a preference for wanting that option</li>
            <li> its ok ...  </li>
            <li> They are outstanding for trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this trimmer a lot more.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size and weight, and fits comfortably in the hand while trimming the beard (what I use it for exclusively).    </li>
            <li> It also has better speed than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I was able to set the blade for a even closer cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of cheaply made but which affordable ones aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Used it for touch ups mostly.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot better than the Peanut I used to use.</li>
            <li> I love the 1/16 \\&quot;zero\\&quot; guard attachment.  </li>
            <li> I bang this trimmer on the counter top</li>
            <li> The Edger II also didn&#x27;t glide across my face as well as my Outliner II, causing more irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer in everyway except it has no cover for the blade</li>
            <li> and I would be completely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;beard\\&quot; trimmer is just OK.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li> The shave is much better than the shave from the Andis Slim Line 2 Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> After charging the unit and feeling the integrity of the unit , I was more than satisfied with the cost Value for product.</li>
            <li> Works great when I cut my wife&#x27;s hair, worth the money but does not work as good as a straight razor on the neck area.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product more than five years</li>
            <li> &quot; they are probably the best cordless trimmers out here, and a solid investment for under $40.</li>
            <li> My clients love it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lot better than the Wahl I was using.</li>
            <li> thus I have had many trimmers.  </li>
            <li> They are great for grooming and has a decent line.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, its precise, and does not pinch at all.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good Edger.</li>
            <li> Works good and gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> Pretty good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> does a good job trimming and evening beards, I use mine weekly to get a nice clean look, holds a charge decently</li>
            <li> Love this edger, light efficient.</li>
            <li> The size is good and the stainless steel teeth on the clippers won&#x27;t scratch or nick your skin one bit.  </li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time, quite neat, Best one for the price, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> We have owned probably 5 other brands over the years,she says this is the best without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Work great, I use it for quick touch ups and mustache trimming mainly.  </li>
            <li> Bought two of these and gave one to my son and he&#x27;s found it so easy to use as well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold because the size isn&#x27;t bulky.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Its easy to maintain and use.</li>
            <li> Its still going strong.</li>
            <li> but the motor is still going strong</li>
            <li> I charged for the first time and clipped my own hair in about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The comb attachments have good stable integrity and after reading the manual over a few times , I figured the operating usage on keeping the battery at an optimum charge and hopefully extend the life of it to allow for many years of service.</li>
            <li> These edgers are okay and cut is not bad.</li>
            <li> (Whal, Andis, CHI &amp; Oster) are fine but the Andis T-Edjer II just does a tighter line with easier control.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge and works just fine.</li>
            <li> does it make a huge difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the charger/cradle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Trims very evenly and fast great</li>
            <li> Worked great, lasting a lot of years.</li>
            <li> After years of replacing cheap namebrand beard trimmers all-too-often, I gave Andis a try.  </li>
            <li> For heavy use, this may not be the best option.  </li>
            <li> These things are light weight</li>
            <li> Cuts close, doesnt pull or catch hairs, and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> While it is true that the plastic attachments could have benefited from more teeth (guides), this is a sturdy machine that is not going to give out quickly, and it holds a charge for longer so that you don&#x27;t lose power towards the end.  </li>
            <li> they just didn&#x27;t cut my hair right for me, I sent more time trying to cut my hair than anything else in my day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as the corded trimmer I have, but it works great, is very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise, doesn&#x27;t vibrate in your hand too much and is so easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer at first.  </li>
            <li> So not wanting to have to deal with a corded unit, and hoping that a higher end cordless trimmer would do a better job, I decided that for the money, this trimmer was about what I was looking for.    </li>
            <li> I need it to be able to scoop more when I cut around the ears and it takes a bit more going over the same spot.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted me more than a year.</li>
            <li> When I found another one on Amazon, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> (you can hear it start to downcycle after barely 30 seconds, but it will keep going for a good while.)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works well, cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li> They work good for the most part, but the minute that the blade needs to be changed, be careful.</li>
            <li> Very precise, straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it most of a year now and must say I really like it.   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full capability</li>
            <li> you can use it with no attachments on your face for that permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow - which my wife hates - but its a cool weekend look</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> Battery has a good enough charge life.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic trimmer.</li>
            <li> I really did love these cordless clippers for the price, but I guess i will continue my search.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars only because all cordless trimmers to me are not as good as corded.</li>
            <li> I was really suprised to see any less-than-5 star reviews for the T-Edjer II, because I feel this is hands down the best beard trimmer money can buy.</li>
            <li> The blades on the Andis Trimmer are not very sharp, so you do not get a nice, clean trim.  </li>
            <li> but i thought it would be a great beard trimmer based on some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer was working fine for the first 3 months, but then the two screws holding the blade to the unit started getting looser and looser.</li>
            <li> Nice Trimmers ,Fast Ship, Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice product fast shipping Thanks again</li>
            <li> Luckily that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the T top to the blades as that gives me more ability to get a closer trim and to get around my ears and my upper lip while not chopping off my mustache or beard.</li>
            <li> Super close shave</li>
            <li> The corded are more powerful, but much louder and made for the head, not the beard.</li>
            <li> It great when it works, but not worth the price until the mechanical issues are resolved.</li>
            <li> As an Afro-American...these trim with great precision hands down.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This litte trimmer is outstanding, small but very powerful, for the close trimming around the ears, and neckline, and keeps beard nice and even.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It was cheaply made and pulled as much as it cut.</li>
            <li> Extremely light and fast for a cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what you can get for an extra 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go as far as saying it&#x27;s an elegantly designed product.  </li>
            <li> but it sounds like it&#x27;s going to die even after a fresh charge.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairdresser and most of my clients are men.</li>
            <li> then I would have exchanged it for another because it does seem well built and powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> Now I can trim my self up in my bathroom in no time i&#x27;m always fresh now....</li>
            <li> -right without it&#x27;s charger.</li>
            <li> The price is right and comparable to the price I paid at a beauty supply for licensed professionals.</li>
            <li> just right i can get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> but it just won&#x27;t do me right</li>
            <li> Right out the box</li>
            <li> Right on time.  </li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do, but I&#x27;m sure someone could do a little better for this price point.</li>
            <li> The wahls were alright performance wise, but weren&#x27;t particularly impressive...they did an ok job for shortening, but didn&#x27;t leave extremely clean lines, especially after a few months of use.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to replace my corded Andis for these.</li>
            <li> This thing is so powerful and cuts very close</li>
            <li> The first lasted about 8 months and stopped charging.</li>
            <li> I have the exact unit and this is a backup, It will be used someday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to handle my entire head with it.      </li>
            <li> I ruined mine the first week and had to ship it in for repairs...</li>
            <li> The first one lasted fifteen years.  </li>
            <li> Seems pretty underpowered also.</li>
            <li> Had the same for many years before the battery went south.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have cut my facial hair a lot better and closer, it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I just used them for the first time today and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i made this my second purchase, I always trust Andis for a quality product and they didn&#x27;t disappoint with this model.</li>
            <li> These also hold a charge pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a short term replacement after dropping my favorite clippers.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed in order to make the project I was working on work.  </li>
            <li> and they were super helpful and got a new comb out immediately.</li>
            <li> Just love it and just as good as expensive brands.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking just to do some very minor trimming, this may be for you, and I can say it does seem to have considerably better build quality than the cheaper ones that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change is that the switch comes on somewhat easily, so I&#x27;ve ended up with no charge a couple of times after putting it in my toiletries bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extra points for being easy to maintain and well-built.</li>
            <li> I am a super busy stylist who does approx 40 mens cuts per week...</li>
            <li> The beard and face area will not definitely not get as close as most will like, but if it&#x27;s for trimming the beard and mustache down from homeless to sexy level, then it will do.</li>
            <li> I have used them for years love this product very reliable and easy care , only had to replace last set because they were very old and plastic cracked .</li>
            <li> Was looking for sharp clean cuts with this but a best it leaves behind a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as robust or quiet as the heavy duty corded models but does a great job for trimming and touch up.  </li>
            <li> After the initial 10 minutes, the sound starts lowering in volume.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it was really designed for beards.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more careful now.  </li>
            <li> NIMH batteries are very susceptible to damage from overcharging.</li>
            <li> Tighten the screw too much and the housing of the screw will break.</li>
            <li> use the 3/8\\&quot; attachment on sideburns / around ears and skip a whole haircut @</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work very well for shaving my face.  </li>
            <li> so I had to let it go because  it  cost me too much because  of the life it lives .</li>
            <li> I wish I had time to purchase this item from Amazon, but I paid twice as much for it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the trimmer for a couple of months now and it keeps a good charge for a least 2 weeks unpluged .</li>
            <li> I have previosuly owned a couple cheap wahl cordless trimmers, for simple trimming of facial hair, and to clean up my neck every so often.    </li>
            <li> This is a really powerful trimmer and is exactly the same one I&#x27;ve seen at hair salons.  </li>
            <li> I have a particularly rough/course stubble, and this is the only trimer that I have used that was able to cut it down comfortably.</li>
            <li> , I feel that if you take the time to care for your trimmer or any clipper you own, it will last a very long time)</li>
            <li> It is much faster and better than the previous &#x27;home&#x27; trimmer that I had before.  </li>
            <li> The teeth on them are so far apart that it makes them less than effective in guiding hair towards the blade.</li>
            <li> It was fine because one hour is very long for a battery powered clipper.  </li>
            <li> My previous two were retired after many years &amp; a decade of services upon clients.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my previous for that.  </li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> You can replace the battery on this product, but I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you have decent electronics repair (including soldering) skills.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the performance gain over the cheaper wahl units is marginal at best, and I&#x27;ll probably be looking at conceding the point, and just getting a nicer corded model in the future.    </li>
            <li> It holds a decent charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Edger II did trim hair decently well, but since I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose</li>
            <li> They come with the guards and they hold a charge a decent time.</li>
            <li> Andis T-Edjer II is a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Since I shave my facial hair every day, I had to find a replacement trimmer quickly.  </li>
            <li> reviews had many different responses to these questions , but the final evaluation is needed to get maximum longevity of the unit.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any one who doesn&#x27;t like the larger , more cumbersome corded or larger cordless trimmers.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was its use of induction charging over charge points, as every charge point shaver I&#x27;ve purchased has eventually corroded or stopped charging at some point.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;d say they arrived in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you whether the new battery actually lives up to its 5000mAh rating or how long it will last in this device, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the upgrade.</li>
            <li> Another flaw of this trimmer is that , the blade gets very hot after only a min.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Andis products, but not their cordless line.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Professional Stylist is using this product and bought this as a replacement for one that just died recently after many years of almost daily ise in a salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly powerful for its size and would knock off sideburns and hair on the back of my neck no problem.  </li>
            <li> Battery is long lasting, it is unbelivable, could run more than fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> Other customer reviews indicate that this may be a fine product, but I don&#x27;t plan to find out.  </li>
            <li> Other trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past, although not terrible, would need recharging much more frequently.</li>
            <li> They last for years if you treat them right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried replacement blades but they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as a new razor.</li>
            <li> Works like new now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, fits comfortably in the hand, and the blade has retained its sharpness after about 10 months of use... not daily use, mind you, but fairly regular use.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve spent over $700 on the same liner I love</li>
            <li> They are quiet and very precise - the total opposite of these.  </li>
            <li> However, this trimmer is loud!</li>
            <li> This is our second, as our first lasted quite a number of years, until was donated to a friend who had none.</li>
            <li> Also mine, after the initial full charge, was defective and would not charge back up again.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer about every-other day and the battery life seems to be kind of weak.</li>
            <li> Good edger for the price, better than the other random 3 that I&#x27;ve owned over the years!</li>
            <li> Did not last very long  until a cheap plastic support part inside the trimmer broke .</li>
            <li> Great clippers for cutting around the neck line and the edges of my boys&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my and my son&#x27;s hair and this was a great addition to her home hair cutting tools.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loud.</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist and I think it must be really loud for my clients to have to listen to.</li>
            <li> After 3 months it died completely so I tossed it.</li>
            <li> That is because Andis assumed it would be used professionally all day.  </li>
            <li> A wire brush fixed it</li>
            <li> I dropped mine and they were loud</li>
            <li> very well made &amp; solid feel.  </li>
            <li> I also used&lt;br /&gt;Andis T-Edjer II Professional trimmers to shave.</li>
            <li> I have friends who do hair professionally and recommended the brand.</li>
            <li> a professional hairdresser</li>
            <li> These are loud and don&#x27;t get that close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I currently use an Andis Outliner II to shave my face, which works very well.  </li>
            <li> I fixed one up myself</li>
            <li> I Have had to contact Andis customer service when I broke a tooth on the comb of my old edger</li>
            <li> This keeps its charge, but the overall blade speed is very lackluster</li>
            <li> OLD Review:</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I use this professionally</li>
            <li> I have been been using them professionally for 9 years.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly the same model that i have owned for the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> It is the 2nd time I have bought the same model, however, first time off of amazon.</li>
            <li> For me, it pulls your hair and sort of does not trim the beard even or seems like the blades is not fast enough to trim like a true hair cutter.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m hesitant to believe that, i think it&#x27;s pretty rough on your face.  </li>
            <li> This one that I&#x27;ve had for a few months already is still on it&#x27;s first charge!    </li>
            <li> I just got this trimmer after reading all the positive reviews about how this thing is sharp and how it doesn&#x27;t nip or scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> but if u are not going to use it frequently then i would definitely get the 04710 pro trimmer.</li>
            <li> My old one finally died after well over 10 years of use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s American made, no-frills and professional.  </li>
            <li> The last 2 have been complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently it started buzzing loudly during use, so I pulled the blades off and gave them a run over the sharpening stone, cleaned the hair out and re-greased the parts.</li>
            <li> Not built for long life or black people  hair or stubborn  and  strong grey course hair</li>
            <li> -- this cordless one is much louder and not as sharp..</li>
            <li> It not sharp enough to shave</li>
            <li> It got to the point that I could barely get my standard touch-up job -- eyebrows, sideburns, and over the ears -- done before the power ran out.  </li>
            <li> My old one would not hold a charge as long, and i had never replaced the blades..</li>
            <li> the salon (that&#x27;s usually the only reason I had to go so often) and only go when you need a full haircut.    </li>
            <li> ON/OFF switch is loose and loudly vibrates when shaver is on!</li>
            <li> The daily  personal beard- grooming - The multiple Stylist Professional constant work unit-</li>
            <li> Wipe excess oil off with a soft dry cloth...</li>
            <li> I dry shave with my Andis T-Outliner, but I travel overseas frequently</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it&#x27;s impossible to find a good neck trimmer that&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> To clean the blades we suggest to immerse (sic) the blades only into a shallow pan of Andis Clipper Oil while the clipper is running.\\&quot;    Yikes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough or on enough clients to have dulled the blades yet.</li>
            <li> (Less by far then in local shops too)</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last to long</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they last.</li>
            <li> All the other trimmers seem to start at 1/8, which really cuts down on the options.  </li>
            <li> I suspect few people will go to this much trouble to keep this product useful.</li>
            <li> Not a professional in the field.  </li>
            <li> WELL COMES WITH ATTACHMENTS AND A LONG BATTERY LIFE.</li>
            <li> This trimmer can go for a long time off of a charge.  </li>
            <li> I do not know about this products longevity because I have not had it long.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long to test the batteries</li>
            <li> Also holds a charge for a long while.</li>
            <li> I spent about 3 weeks researching different cordless trimmers, reading reviews etc...</li>
            <li> I hope this one does as well, and lasts as long.  </li>
            <li> battery does seem to last for a long time, i haven&#x27;t taken any trips with it yet due to</li>
            <li> To get the blades to perform like real Edgers, you have to take a small phillips head screwdriver and a small flat head screwdriver, open up the trimming head, then adjust\push the blades</li>
            <li> I think the only complaint I have is how LOUD it is.</li>
            <li> The first one only had to be replaced due to being dropped and broken.  </li>
            <li> But the fact that it was used and they (amazon.com warehouse itself, not a private seller) still sent it to me as a \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; item is just not right.</li>
            <li> I buy a new one annually because the blades become dull.</li>
            <li> Finally, the price at Amazon costs about half of what it costs in stores.</li>
            <li> Dont&#x27; get me wrong, I have used Whal trimmers too, and have had success with them, but when it comes to getting a sharp line on my beard and dry shaving, Andis is my trusted brand.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m in the military, always on the go so there serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> Bought it for travel and it&#x27;s not too big or heavy.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected, My wife has cut my hair for 25 years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just what I expected</li>
            <li> Just what we expected when were ordered this product quality.</li>
            <li> I travel to different salons and was able to take these without the base because they lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Blade could be wider to cut down on how long it takes to trim&lt;br /&gt;Requires oil before, during, and after use, which is a pain&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint</li>
            <li> My other clippers and trimmers, corded &amp; cordless</li>
            <li> They cut just as sharp as my Andis M3 trimmers once they are adjusted.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d be happier with the other model.  </li>
            <li> The other is the charger.</li>
            <li> The comb guards that came with it are just about like any other comb guards I have used before.</li>
            <li> I used it 2 times and haven&#x27;t since because I still had to use other trimmers to get a closer trim.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go to Waltmart and get those other trimmers to save a buck.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the charger with this trimmer is just a dumb charge all the time type.</li>
            <li> One thing though, be sure not to leave it sitting base down on counter that gets wet because the electrical contacts will corrode.  </li>
            <li> Late last year I replaced it with a Remington (don&#x27;t know the model)</li>
            <li> let some of the charge go down and hope that helps....would not buy again.</li>
            <li> take it off the charger until I think it should be about run down then charge for another day.</li>
            <li> However, when you put the guards on to trim your beard down this Edger does not work well.</li>
            <li> This may be for people who have 10 days of beard growth and want to shave it down.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little noisy.</li>
            <li> Note that The T-edjer II has a slightly wider blade and doesn&#x27;t work as well for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s typical of what happens when bean counters (rather than engineers) make parts purchasing decisions.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be nicked with this trimmer unlike my previous one.  </li>
            <li> Less pull.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold up to use in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> I bought this less than a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> This one lasted a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t take the cheaply made plastic switch vibrating like crazy!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is not good for tight details to outline.</li>
            <li> COULD BE A LITTLE BIT SHARPER BUT DOES ITS JOB</li>
            <li> a little close together\even at the edges.</li>
            <li> Little noisy</li>
            <li> so I have a little irritation, but thats my fault.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over 1 year ago and the battery keeps going dead after each use of about 1 minute.</li>
            <li> The blades are as poor as any generic, mass produced blades that are sold for 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li> Place a few drops of Andis Clipper Oil on the front and side of the cutter blades.  </li>
            <li> These 2 new ones would barely make it through the day staying on the base in between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 in the past year and half.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a razor is very uncomfortable and I was really amazed at how well these trimmers work.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really too bad because this could have been a five-star review.</li>
            <li> I use it to cut my hair when I&#x27;m too lazy for the razor.</li>
            <li> It also seems to have a bit a trouble just cutting through the course hair in general.  </li>
            <li> perhaps i am a delicate flower</li>
            <li> I always had a lot of trouble with razors and electric razors irritating my face.  </li>
            <li> for  lite jobs  not a with thick course hair</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have a thick beard</li>
            <li> When i say 30 minutues, I mean its after charging it for over 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Rusted in less than 6 month&#x27;s and never was wet or placed in a damp environment!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but with just the metal piece on your bare face, it will scrape you and your shaves/trims will be painful.  </li>
            <li> Mine was used when i received it, it had a few hairs on the blade (not good!!!!)  </li>
            <li> This is frustrating the heck out of me as clipping my dogs hair now takes over 2 sessions with charges in between.  </li>
            <li> I always leave the unit in the base to keep a charge as this is the second one of these I have owned.  </li>
            <li> The cutting was every dull with weak power.</li>
            <li> The trimmer will still work, but the loud overpower buzz will drive you insane.</li>
            <li> I pushed mine too close past the edge and the rotating blade cut up my darn skin bad.</li>
            <li> and because of that it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable when you are trying to trim around the ears.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> distasteful heathens.</li>
            <li> the plugs are not aus its fake machines never again</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sharp teeth and nasty claws.</li>
            <li> It has started pulling hair out instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for ever on this bad boy.  </li>
            <li> but this trimmer can be painful to shave with.  </li>
            <li> My 2 issues are that when using it for manscaping without a guard it pulls hair, and that&#x27;s just painful</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> very disappointed how the quality has drastically diminished..</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Worst clippers I ever owned.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too loud. I am a professional stylist and I think it must be really loud for my clients to have to listen to. I am trying&lt;br /&gt;to let some of the charge go down and hope that helps....would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for ever on this bad boy.  I use it as a body trimmer and it works great</li>
            <li> Owned this for over a year know. Stays charged for a long time, quite neat, Best one for the price, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Work great, I use it for quick touch ups and mustache trimming mainly.  As with any Andis product you need to properly zero gap the blade for best results.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer at first.  I charged for the first time and clipped my own hair in about 15 minutes.  I recharged and clipped my dogs hair and it lost power in one hour.  It was fine because one hour is very long for a battery powered clipper.  As time went on, whenever i recharge to clip my dogs hair, the battery life became shorter and shorter.  Not it can barely last over 30 minutes and its only been about 4 months.  After the initial 10 minutes, the sound starts lowering in volume.  When i say 30 minutues, I mean its after charging it for over 2 days.  This is frustrating the heck out of me as clipping my dogs hair now takes over 2 sessions with charges in between.  If i can return this product I definitely would.</li>
            <li> Decent product. However, this trimmer is loud! and because of that it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable when you are trying to trim around the ears.  Mine was used when i received it, it had a few hairs on the blade (not good!!!!)  Another flaw of this trimmer is that , the blade gets very hot after only a min.  I trimmed my sideburns and the side and back of my neck and it performed well. But the fact that it was used and they (amazon.com warehouse itself, not a private seller) still sent it to me as a \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; item is just not right. So watch out for that.</li>
            <li> Best cordless trimmer out there to me! I have tried them all.  Once u zero gap the blade the give some crispy line ups.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  Not a professional in the field.  Was looking for sharp clean cuts with this but a best it leaves behind a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow.  The blades are as poor as any generic, mass produced blades that are sold for 1/3 the price.  Blades cant be adjusted for a sharper cut.  Once again, save your cash.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I bought a Wahl beard trimmer. It took AA batteries. Worked great, lasting a lot of years. I replaced it with a Conair (that was all the drug store had). It was rechargeable and also worked well for many years. Late last year I replaced it with a Remington (don&#x27;t know the model) but if you didn&#x27;t hold the thing just so, you would end up with bald patches. I returned that and bought another Wahl based on my prior experience. It was cheaply made and pulled as much as it cut. After 3 months it died completely so I tossed it. After looking for something worthwhile I found the Andis. This is really built well and does a great job with my beard. I ask my barber and he only uses Andis products. I initially  gave it 4 stars because the teeth on the attachments could be closes together but I don&#x27;t think it was really designed for beards. Works great anyway. I read a comment about oiling the shaver before during and after use. That is because Andis assumed it would be used professionally all day.  AND IT IS MADE IN THE U.S.A. For that, I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser.  I do a lot of detail work with my Andis T-Edjer II&#x27;s.  I am expecting my 3rd set to arrive around the 8th of November, 2011.  My previous two were retired after many years &amp; a decade of services upon clients.  I keep going back to this specific model by Andis because of the detail performance &amp; continuity.  My other clippers and trimmers, corded &amp; cordless (Whal, Andis, CHI &amp; Oster) are fine but the Andis T-Edjer II just does a tighter line with easier control.  Yes, I know it&#x27;s all subjective and personal preference.  But I seriously love this tool!</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last to long</li>
            <li> great product - my boyfriend is very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> 3rd one I have ordered  over 2 years. Works great&lt;br /&gt;For awhile then dies out. Hope this one lasts because when&lt;br /&gt;Works it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a little over 1 year ago and the battery keeps going dead after each use of about 1 minute. I can&#x27;t return it now and don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. These products probably sits on a shelf for years before they get sold. Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really powerful trimmer and is exactly the same one I&#x27;ve seen at hair salons.  It is much faster and better than the previous &#x27;home&#x27; trimmer that I had before.  Also, it holds a charge for weeks without having to be replaced on the cradle.  Finally, the price at Amazon costs about half of what it costs in stores.</li>
            <li> This is a my 4th set of cordless trimmers and by far the best. They cut just as sharp as my Andis M3 trimmers once they are adjusted. I&#x27;&#x27;m in the military, always on the go so there serve the purpose. As an Afro-American...these trim with great precision hands down. I also bought the Andis e.Logica Cordless Clipper which produce great results as well. I&#x27;m willing to replace my corded Andis for these. Bothe great products for people on the go.</li>
            <li> Nice Trimmers ,Fast Ship, Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice product fast shipping Thanks again</li>
            <li> i bought this to shave/trim my beard - i don&#x27;t shave with a razor ever.  perhaps i am a delicate flower and i have a low tolerance for pain in my beard/moustache/neck area but this trimmer can be painful to shave with.  i know it&#x27;s a hair (and not truly designed as a beard/facial hair) trimmer but i thought it would be a great beard trimmer based on some of the other reviews.  it&#x27;s a solid beard shaver/trimmer if you use the plastic guards for a specific length but with just the metal piece on your bare face, it will scrape you and your shaves/trims will be painful.  perhaps it&#x27;s me but i&#x27;m hesitant to believe that, i think it&#x27;s pretty rough on your face.  with that said, it does provide a closer shave when used with just the metal piece and no plastic guards than my wahl did.  with the plastic guards on it does a great job.  battery does seem to last for a long time, i haven&#x27;t taken any trips with it yet due to it&#x27;s sharp teeth and nasty claws.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time but 395060 is the model number for the T-edjer II, not the edjer II.  Note that The T-edjer II has a slightly wider blade and doesn&#x27;t work as well for mustache trimming. I guess I&#x27;ll probably keep it but I&#x27;d be happier with the other model.  I&#x27;ve had it most of a year now and must say I really like it.   One thing though, be sure not to leave it sitting base down on counter that gets wet because the electrical contacts will corrode.  A wire brush fixed it but I&#x27;m more careful now.  *  I&#x27;ve had the trimmer for just over 11 months and today the battery died.  NIMH batteries are very susceptible to damage from overcharging. As far as I can tell the charger with this trimmer is just a dumb charge all the time type. I&#x27;ll probably go with corded from now on but what I intend to do if I try another one of these is instead of leaving it on the charger all the time to charge for a day then take it off the charger until I think it should be about run down then charge for another day. BTW the battery is soldered in on this unit so it can&#x27;t be replaced unless you want to get into that.</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis. They work good for the most part, but the minute that the blade needs to be changed, be careful. Tighten the screw too much and the housing of the screw will break. Then it becomes junk. Sometimes the vibration through use breaks the housing as well. The trimmer will still work, but the loud overpower buzz will drive you insane. This will last you 7 months tops. Also it gets only stubble close on the head area. The beard and face area will not definitely not get as close as most will like, but if it&#x27;s for trimming the beard and mustache down from homeless to sexy level, then it will do. The guards work good for that.</li>
            <li> COULD BE A LITTLE BIT SHARPER BUT DOES ITS JOB WELL COMES WITH ATTACHMENTS AND A LONG BATTERY LIFE. I USE IT ABOUT EVERY OHTER DAY</li>
            <li> There is a lot to like about this product. It&#x27;s convenient, fits comfortably in the hand, and the blade has retained its sharpness after about 10 months of use... not daily use, mind you, but fairly regular use. I&#x27;d go as far as saying it&#x27;s an elegantly designed product.  My low rating for this product has to do with battery performance. After just over a half-year of use, I noticed the battery would poop out sooner and sooner. It got to the point that I could barely get my standard touch-up job -- eyebrows, sideburns, and over the ears -- done before the power ran out.  There are two possible causes for this. One is obviously the use of a cheap-a$$ battery. It&#x27;s typical of what happens when bean counters (rather than engineers) make parts purchasing decisions. The other is the charger. It&#x27;s likely a &amp;#34;stupid&amp;#34; charger that doesn&#x27;t take into account battery charge state. That can shorten service life.  You can replace the battery on this product, but I don&#x27;t recommend it unless you have decent electronics repair (including soldering) skills. You want to source a high-capacity Sub-C size NiMH battery with solder tabs. I replaced the factory battery with a Tenergy Model 10514 5000mAh High-Drain battery. I can&#x27;t tell you whether the new battery actually lives up to its 5000mAh rating or how long it will last in this device, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the upgrade. I shaved off an entire winter beard with power to spare.  I suspect few people will go to this much trouble to keep this product useful. And it&#x27;s really too bad because this could have been a five-star review.</li>
            <li> Mostly use it to trim my beard. Also works for shaving my head.</li>
            <li> ON/OFF switch is loose and loudly vibrates when shaver is on! So disappointing! This thing is so powerful and cuts very close but I can&#x27;t take the cheaply made plastic switch vibrating like crazy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave a deep shape up line like andis out liners</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer as a finishing trimmer for my wife to use to help me finish after I cut my own hair.  It has good power, holds a charge, and is light-weight, all qualities I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer about every-other day and the battery life seems to be kind of weak. I don&#x27;t keep it on a continuous charge however I do charge it to it&#x27;s full capability but it sounds like it&#x27;s going to die even after a fresh charge. Luckily that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.&lt;br /&gt;Outside of that, the butt of the trimmer is rounded so it can&#x27;t stand up-right without it&#x27;s charger. This is more of a preference for wanting that option</li>
            <li> I also have the gray corded Andis T trimmer. -- this cordless one is much louder and not as sharp.. so if u want it to just trim your nose hairs..etc every couple 4 days its ok ...  but if u are not going to use it frequently then i would definitely get the 04710 pro trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very good does the job</li>
            <li> Will not hold a charge</li>
            <li> Bought two of these and gave one to my son and he&#x27;s found it so easy to use as well.  Keeps the charge so you don&#x27;t have to leave it plugged in.  Easy to hold because the size isn&#x27;t bulky.  Just love it and just as good as expensive brands.</li>
            <li> way too noisy,and too fragile</li>
            <li> Professional Stylist is using this product and bought this as a replacement for one that just died recently after many years of almost daily ise in a salon.</li>
            <li> I have been using the trimmer for a couple of months now and it keeps a good charge for a least 2 weeks unpluged . The only thing is that it is not good for tight details to outline.</li>
            <li> It not sharp enough to shave</li>
            <li> I used these for the last 4 years. They were my fav and my coworkers all ordered them because they were great quality &amp; value. I dropped mine and they were loud so I ordered 2 sets because I like a back up. The first lasted about 8 months and stopped charging. So I opened the 2 and it lasted 4 months! I travel to different salons and was able to take these without the base because they lasted all day. These 2 new ones would barely make it through the day staying on the base in between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed how the quality has drastically diminished.. I will be switching to oster.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly the same model that i have owned for the last 10 years. They are outstanding for trimming your beard. My old one would not hold a charge as long, and i had never replaced the blades..</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It is the 2nd time I have bought the same model, however, first time off of amazon. The price is right and comparable to the price I paid at a beauty supply for licensed professionals. Being cordless, the life of the trimmer is also very important, and this one gets an A+</li>
            <li> This litte trimmer is outstanding, small but very powerful, for the close trimming around the ears, and neckline, and keeps beard nice and even.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer.  very well made &amp; solid feel.  use the 3/8\\&quot; attachment on sideburns / around ears and skip a whole haircut @ the salon (that&#x27;s usually the only reason I had to go so often) and only go when you need a full haircut.    you can use it with no attachments on your face for that permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow - which my wife hates - but its a cool weekend look</li>
            <li> I grabbed this trimmer after my Philips Norelco G370 took a header onto the bathroom floor.  I am enjoying this trimmer a lot more.  I feel that I&#x27;m getting a closer shave.  I have yet to be nicked with this trimmer unlike my previous one.  The only thing that I noticed is that with the attachment combs it takes several passes to trim my beard. For the money I think this a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this trimmer. It is a nice size and weight, and fits comfortably in the hand while trimming the beard (what I use it for exclusively).    The most surprising and impressive feature is how long it holds a charge. Other trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past, although not terrible, would need recharging much more frequently. This one that I&#x27;ve had for a few months already is still on it&#x27;s first charge!    My only minor complaint (if you can even call it that) is with the attachment combs. The teeth on them are so far apart that it makes them less than effective in guiding hair towards the blade.</li>
            <li> Other customer reviews indicate that this may be a fine product, but I don&#x27;t plan to find out.  What I wish I&#x27;d known is the degree of care the trimmer calls for.  To quote the instruction booklet:  \\&quot;Blades should be oiled before, DURING, and after each use...The clipper/trimmer should be held in a position shown in Diagram A to prevent oil from getting into motor.  Place a few drops of Andis Clipper Oil on the front and side of the cutter blades.  Wipe excess oil off with a soft dry cloth...To clean the blades we suggest to immerse (sic) the blades only into a shallow pan of Andis Clipper Oil while the clipper is running.\\&quot;    Yikes. Call me a whiner but I don&#x27;t have time--ok, the patience--for this amount of hand-holding.</li>
            <li> does a good job trimming and evening beards, I use mine weekly to get a nice clean look, holds a charge decently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one. It&#x27;s reliable and works well.  Would recommend it to a stylist looking for a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Sucked bought because they are made in USA , wish someone would have stole them from work. Worst clippers I ever owned.</li>
            <li> After years of replacing cheap namebrand beard trimmers all-too-often, I gave Andis a try.  While it is true that the plastic attachments could have benefited from more teeth (guides), this is a sturdy machine that is not going to give out quickly, and it holds a charge for longer so that you don&#x27;t lose power towards the end.  It also has better speed than others I have tried.  I&#x27;m really impressed that you don&#x27;t have to spend that much more to get a trimmer that is exponentially better.</li>
            <li> The blades on the Andis Trimmer are not very sharp, so you do not get a nice, clean trim.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is the best trimmer out there, but it certainly does it for me.  It all depends on what people use it for.  I use it occasionally and it&#x27;s good enough.  For heavy use, this may not be the best option.  Otherwise, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used them for years love this product very reliable and easy care , only had to replace last set because they were very old and plastic cracked . Years of use !!</li>
            <li> I was able to set the blade for a even closer cut. And get the type of line up on my beard that looked like I had been to a barber shop. I also used&lt;br /&gt;Andis T-Edjer II Professional trimmers to shave. Great product, and the battery life on one charge is great. Buy this product!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good Edger. I am a blackhead guy who does different beard styles. To get the blades to perform like real Edgers, you have to take a small phillips head screwdriver and a small flat head screwdriver, open up the trimming head, then adjust\push the blades a little close together\even at the edges. I pushed mine too close past the edge and the rotating blade cut up my darn skin bad. I then readjusted it a tad bit. However, when you put the guards on to trim your beard down this Edger does not work well. For me, it pulls your hair and sort of does not trim the beard even or seems like the blades is not fast enough to trim like a true hair cutter.</li>
            <li> I buy a new one annually because the blades become dull. I&#x27;ve tried replacement blades but they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as a new razor. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it holding a charge.</li>
            <li> My old one finally died after well over 10 years of use so it was a given I would replace it with the same quality trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a quality beard trimmer this is it!</li>
            <li> I have the exact unit and this is a backup, It will be used someday. I don&#x27;t like having to meet a word quota.</li>
            <li> I have previosuly owned a couple cheap wahl cordless trimmers, for simple trimming of facial hair, and to clean up my neck every so often.    The wahls were alright performance wise, but weren&#x27;t particularly impressive...they did an ok job for shortening, but didn&#x27;t leave extremely clean lines, especially after a few months of use.    So not wanting to have to deal with a corded unit, and hoping that a higher end cordless trimmer would do a better job, I decided that for the money, this trimmer was about what I was looking for.    Sadly, the performance gain over the cheaper wahl units is marginal at best, and I&#x27;ll probably be looking at conceding the point, and just getting a nicer corded model in the future.    If you&#x27;re looking just to do some very minor trimming, this may be for you, and I can say it does seem to have considerably better build quality than the cheaper ones that I have owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of cheaply made but which affordable ones aren&#x27;t. Works good and gets pretty close. Battery has a good enough charge life. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought it for travel and it&#x27;s not too big or heavy. It holds a decent charge. Charged it only once on a two week vacation. Used it for touch ups mostly. Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the plugin version but I did not adjust the blade as was suggested by another reviewer. Still happy with the product the way it is.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver. They last for years if you treat them right.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and the price was perfect</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairdresser and most of my clients are men. This is the best CORDLESS trimmer I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not as powerful as the corded trimmer I have, but it works great, is very lightweight, doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise, doesn&#x27;t vibrate in your hand too much and is so easy to travel with. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good edger for the price, better than the other random 3 that I&#x27;ve owned over the years! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product did not deliver. The cutting was every dull with weak power.</li>
            <li> Had one almost identical and it lasted many years with good service  hope this one does also</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot better than the Peanut I used to use. It is quieter and seems to trim my goatee a lot smoother. Less pull.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this trimmer. I currently can&#x27;t use it and I&#x27;ve only had it 2 months. It has started pulling hair out instead of cutting it. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough or on enough clients to have dulled the blades yet. Of course, at this point, I&#x27;m just beyond my 60 days and can&#x27;t return it. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I have friends who do hair professionally and recommended the brand. Product is as described and works well. Once guard doesn&#x27;t like to stay on but it could be my inexperience with hair and all things hair. Works great for our needs</li>
            <li> It charges well and stays charged for a great amount of time, however I feel I have to go over a spot to get a good clean edge.  I need it to be able to scoop more when I cut around the ears and it takes a bit more going over the same spot.  It doesn&#x27;t nip or cut anyone&#x27;s skin so I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold up to use in less than a year.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was really suprised to see any less-than-5 star reviews for the T-Edjer II, because I feel this is hands down the best beard trimmer money can buy. I have a particularly rough/course stubble, and this is the only trimer that I have used that was able to cut it down comfortably. My mom bought me one about 8 years ago, and it just died this week. It held charges like a champ; I only needed to charge it once or twice a month. I will be buying another one ASAP. (Note: I religiously cleaned and oiled my blade, I feel that if you take the time to care for your trimmer or any clipper you own, it will last a very long time)</li>
            <li> Works great, so glad I bought this! (Less by far then in local shops too)</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great. I have used it countless times. I use it on my beard and on some man scaping. I like the T top to the blades as that gives me more ability to get a closer trim and to get around my ears and my upper lip while not chopping off my mustache or beard. The comb guards that came with it are just about like any other comb guards I have used before. I think the only complaint I have is how LOUD it is. Its easy to maintain and use.</li>
            <li> they just didn&#x27;t cut my hair right for me, I sent more time trying to cut my hair than anything else in my day.</li>
            <li> Has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Best I&#x27;ve found as far as a cordless goes</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer.  It&#x27;s American made, no-frills and professional.  I love the 1/16 \\&quot;zero\\&quot; guard attachment.  This allows for a short, 3 day trim.  All the other trimmers seem to start at 1/8, which really cuts down on the options.  It holds a charge, and it works fairly well as a balding clipper as well, if you don&#x27;t mind taking your time.  I&#x27;m able to handle my entire head with it.      If you&#x27;re traveling, always tape the power switch so it doesn&#x27;t turn on in transit.  I ruined mine the first week and had to ship it in for repairs...</li>
            <li> died before I used it for 2 months. This is the 3rd set i&#x27;ve owned. The first lasted me more than a year. The last 2 have been complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser and unfortunately it&#x27;s impossible to find a good neck trimmer that&#x27;s cordless. These are loud and don&#x27;t get that close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I bang this trimmer on the counter top just right i can get it to turn on. My clients are noticing how GHETTO that looks. Otherwise it&#x27;s just garbage.</li>
            <li> I have a plethora of hair all over my body and this is perfect for creating intricate designs and patterns within my jungle of Pili erectus.I tried to include a photo of some of my work however Amazon deemed it to &amp;#34;graphic&amp;#34; to be published on their website... distasteful heathens.</li>
            <li> I currently use an Andis Outliner II to shave my face, which works very well.  I always had a lot of trouble with razors and electric razors irritating my face.  The Outliner II doesn&#x27;t irritate although the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade or electric.  However, for traveling I was looking for something smaller and battery powered and chose this one based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work very well for shaving my face.  The best way I can describe it is that it results in a five o&#x27;clock shadow to match my Outliner II on the day AFTER I shave with the Outliner II.  The Edger II also didn&#x27;t glide across my face as well as my Outliner II, causing more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edger II did trim hair decently well, but since I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Rusted in less than 6 month&#x27;s and never was wet or placed in a damp environment!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> not the closest shave and likes to nibble skin - especially the sack</li>
            <li> Perfect  pencil liner . But I&#x27;ve spent over $700 on the same liner I love but it just won&#x27;t do me right it keeps on cheating  on me so I had to let it go because  it  cost me too much because  of the life it lives . Not built for long life or black people  hair or stubborn  and  strong grey course hair</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer in everyway except it has no cover for the blade and I am using it in a Salon and it needs a cover this is the only time I have purchased a trimmer that didn&#x27;t have a blade cover.  I fixed one up myself but this would have been a 5 Star purchase and I would be completely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> These edgers are okay and cut is not bad. They are great for grooming and has a decent line. They come with the guards and they hold a charge a decent time. For the price you cant beat it but as a pro I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. But for personal grooming until you can get to a barber, jump on them at this price.</li>
            <li> Love this edger, light efficient. Little noisy but it does the job. Super close shave</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on schnauzers&#x27; ears and it works great.  Have used a Andis clipper for many years and have had great luck!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to to replace some liners that I had for years.  There is just no substitute for Andis corded liners.  They are quiet and very precise - the total opposite of these.  I highly recommend Andis products, but not their cordless line.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;beard\\&quot; trimmer is just OK.  It&#x27;s certainly powerful for its size and would knock off sideburns and hair on the back of my neck no problem.  Much better than my previous for that.  My 2 issues are that when using it for manscaping without a guard it pulls hair, and that&#x27;s just painful, I don&#x27;t care who you are.  Also mine, after the initial full charge, was defective and would not charge back up again. I returned it for a refund.  If it weren&#x27;t a hair puller then I would have exchanged it for another because it does seem well built and powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> Had to send it back. Did not work out of the box.</li>
            <li> I have had this same edger for years now with no problems. One of the best edgers on the market for the price. I Have had to contact Andis customer service when I broke a tooth on the comb of my old edger and they were super helpful and got a new comb out immediately. Great product from a great company.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic trimmer. I&#x27;ve used it since the end of 2008 and see no reason why I won&#x27;t have it for years to come. Love that it&#x27;s made in the USA. Only thing I would change is that the switch comes on somewhat easily, so I&#x27;ve ended up with no charge a couple of times after putting it in my toiletries bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Update: August 2013 --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this trimmer for 5 years and it&#x27;s still working nicely and holding a charge well. Recently it started buzzing loudly during use, so I pulled the blades off and gave them a run over the sharpening stone, cleaned the hair out and re-greased the parts. Works like new now. Extra points for being easy to maintain and well-built.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than a year and a half ago.  I always leave the unit in the base to keep a charge as this is the second one of these I have owned.  The first one lasted fifteen years.  This one lasted a year and a half.  I can&#x27;t even finish a trim without the thing dying on me.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected, My wife has cut my hair for 25 years. We have owned probably 5 other brands over the years,she says this is the best without a doubt.Nice close cut for trimming,holds acharge for ever, a great product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> for  lite jobs  not a with thick course hair</li>
            <li> Andis T-Edjer II is a decent trimmer.  Andis T-Edjer II does not shave as close as a razor.  The shave is much better than the shave from the Andis Slim Line 2 Trimmer.  The Andis T-Edjer II shave is comparable to a shave from the Wahl Bling Trimmer.  My Wahl Bling Trimmer went out after years of use.  Since I shave my facial hair every day, I had to find a replacement trimmer quickly.  I wish I had time to purchase this item from Amazon, but I paid twice as much for it at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  The Andis T-Edjer II is charged by a charging dock.  You do not need to leave the charging dock plugged in all the time.  This trimmer can go for a long time off of a charge.  I do not know about this products longevity because I have not had it long.  For a closer and quieter shave try the Andis Slim Line Pro Trimmer.</li>
            <li> We received one as a gift and my husband lost it.  When I found another one on Amazon, I was so excited.  It is wonderful and my husband uses so much without any complaints.</li>
            <li> Great Machine! Very lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Quality isn&#x27;t really good. Seems pretty underpowered also. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have a thick beard</li>
            <li> Great clippers for cutting around the neck line and the edges of my boys&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> This clipper is great for it&#x27;s intended use, probably one of the best rechargeable clippers out there and probably the only one that&#x27;s still made here in the good ole USA.  It&#x27;s not as robust or quiet as the heavy duty corded models but does a great job for trimming and touch up.  If you follow the instructions and regularly oil the blades with the provided oil you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.  The size is good and the stainless steel teeth on the clippers won&#x27;t scratch or nick your skin one bit.  Just get it and don&#x27;t look back, there are cheaper models out there but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 in the past year and half. My newest T-Edjer II died after 2 months. It great when it works, but not worth the price until the mechanical issues are resolved. I also notice that Sally&#x27;s Beauty no longer has the product on their site.</li>
            <li> The battery life could be longer, but the hair trimmer it&#x27;s just what I expected, I had another one just like this one.</li>
            <li> I just got this trimmer after reading all the positive reviews about how this thing is sharp and how it doesn&#x27;t nip or scratch the skin. Right out the box I will say that this trimmer is not shaving close to the skin. This may be for people who have 10 days of beard growth and want to shave it down. This is not a every day trimmer. With that said, I will adjust the trimmer with my screwdriver to get it to shave closer if I can. I will post a update of the results soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 26, 2013: I adjusted the clippers and boy does it make a huge difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I unscrewed the blades, slid them closer together, and now it cuts like my corded Andis T outliners! These things are light weight and it&#x27;s easier to edge up my beard and get a close shave to areas where hair is not needed. I haven&#x27;t had it long to test the batteries so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they last.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. Works perfectly. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little noisy. But I&#x27;ve had noisier. Best cordless one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Had the same for many years before the battery went south.</li>
            <li> Pretty good trimmer.  I use it to cut my hair when I&#x27;m too lazy for the razor. It cuts it short but it probably should be zero gapped as it definitely does not seem like 0.1 mm as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Use&lt;br /&gt;Holds a Charge for Quite a While&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;Feels Solidly Built&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The Blade could be wider to cut down on how long it takes to trim&lt;br /&gt;Requires oil before, during, and after use, which is a pain&lt;br /&gt;Does not have a blade guard or storage pouch</li>
            <li> I would think Andis would supply different scenarios for usage , ie.  The daily  personal beard- grooming - The multiple Stylist Professional constant work unit- The monthly hair &amp; Beard maintenance. Their recommendation on leaving on all the time ( Will it degrade the batteries life length ? )or taking it off for a prolonged period &amp; charging , say 8-12 hours before using .The reviews had many different responses to these questions , but the final evaluation is needed to get maximum longevity of the unit.They should add these to their manual. ** ( Added edited comment ) After charging the unit and feeling the integrity of the unit , I was more than satisfied with the cost Value for product. The comb attachments have good stable integrity and after reading the manual over a few times , I figured the operating usage on keeping the battery at an optimum charge and hopefully extend the life of it to allow for many years of service. I would recommend this for any one who doesn&#x27;t like the larger , more cumbersome corded or larger cordless trimmers. It&#x27;s maneuverable and easy to operate around the ears and mustache- beard area and the t-blade is precise on the hairline-edges, with a good ground steel blade.</li>
            <li> Works great when I cut my wife&#x27;s hair, worth the money but does not work as good as a straight razor on the neck area.</li>
            <li> Works well, cuts cleanly.  Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this clipper in my beauty salon it is great for trimming</li>
            <li> I have been using this product more than five years and I am happy that I could buy it again.Battery is long lasting, it is unbelivable, could run more than fifteen minutes.Product have to be regularly maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Milisav</li>
            <li> Like there edgers but within 2 days one of the teeth broke off... Not dropped. And is sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> I pluged it in to charge it and it blew up its rubbish the plugs are not aus its fake machines never again</li>
            <li> This edger is excellent, just make sure you read the directions pertaining to the best care for the battery. My wife cuts my and my son&#x27;s hair and this was a great addition to her home hair cutting tools. Very easy to use, its precise, and does not pinch at all.</li>
            <li> Did not last very long  until a cheap plastic support part inside the trimmer broke . I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Really nice trimmer! Cuts close, doesnt pull or catch hairs, and its easy to clean. Also holds a charge for a long while. I would have given it 5 stars but the charger/cradle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> I bought this for close detail areas for facial hair.  I thought it would have cut my facial hair a lot better and closer, it didn&#x27;t.  It is perfect for necklines and anything head hair trimming.  For me on my course facial hair, it does not cut as close as I would like.  It also seems to have a bit a trouble just cutting through the course hair in general.  I used it 2 times and haven&#x27;t since because I still had to use other trimmers to get a closer trim.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a &#x27;fancy&#x27; shaver from the drug store. The main reason I bought this was its use of induction charging over charge points, as every charge point shaver I&#x27;ve purchased has eventually corroded or stopped charging at some point. This keeps its charge, but the overall blade speed is very lackluster (you can hear it start to downcycle after barely 30 seconds, but it will keep going for a good while.) It does what I need it to do, but I&#x27;m sure someone could do a little better for this price point.</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW 1/15/2015:  The trimmer was working fine for the first 3 months, but then the two screws holding the blade to the unit started getting looser and looser. The screw holders are now stripped and I can&#x27;t use the thing anymore. Such a shame. I really did love these cordless clippers for the price, but I guess i will continue my search. Come on Andis, you can do better than this!        OLD Review: Wow. this is a solid cordless trimmer in my book. I dry shave with my Andis T-Outliner, but I travel overseas frequently so i needed something portable and cordless to get the job done while over there. When they arrived, I followed the instructions in the booklet and charged it overnight before using. I also adjusted the blade for a shorter cut. I just used them for the first time today and all I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;. This is the best cordless trimmer i have used to date. I actually set the blade too close so I have a little irritation, but thats my fault. But I just goes to show that the quality of the blade won&#x27;t disappoint. Trust me, before I made this purchase I spent about 3 weeks researching different cordless trimmers, reading reviews etc... I even purchased the Andis Slim Line 2 from Sallys, but returned it because i couldn&#x27;t adjust the blade on that model. I&#x27;m glad i made this my second purchase, I always trust Andis for a quality product and they didn&#x27;t disappoint with this model. These also hold a charge pretty darn well. If you are on the fence like I was, I say \\&quot; Get these\\&quot; they are probably the best cordless trimmers out here, and a solid investment for under $40. Don&#x27;t go to Waltmart and get those other trimmers to save a buck. Dont&#x27; get me wrong, I have used Whal trimmers too, and have had success with them, but when it comes to getting a sharp line on my beard and dry shaving, Andis is my trusted brand.    Only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have only used them once. After a my upcoming long-term TDY overseas is over, I will update the review to a 5 if the trimmer holds up.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a short term replacement after dropping my favorite clippers. Shaving with a razor is very uncomfortable and I was really amazed at how well these trimmers work. I&#x27;ll keep these for travel from now on instead of carrying my actual clippers that I have to plug in.  I had these shipped overseas and i&#x27;d say they arrived in a decent amount of time. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used</li>
            <li> after two uses it stopped working....</li>
            <li> trims well and holds the charge!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer ever!!!! I love Andis brand!!!!!</li>
            <li> Trims very evenly and fast great andis product been using them for 20 years or so and i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase thanks.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this trimmer. It holds a charge and works just fine. I gave it four stars only because all cordless trimmers to me are not as good as corded. But it does what I need it to do so I would recommend it</li>
            <li> This is one of the best battery powered trimmers out there. The corded are more powerful, but much louder and made for the head, not the beard. This is our second, as our first lasted quite a number of years, until was donated to a friend who had none. Its still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers out there.  I bought my BF this, and is only the second one he&#x27;s owned.  The first one only had to be replaced due to being dropped and broken.  He had the that one for over 12 years with several times a month use.  I hope this one does as well, and lasts as long.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Extremely light and fast for a cordless trimmer. My clients love it</li>
            <li> Beats going to the barber shop and waiting 1 hour to get a cut or shape up. Now I can trim my self up in my bathroom in no time i&#x27;m always fresh now....</li>
            <li> Right on time.  Exactly what I needed in order to make the project I was working on work.  Will do it again.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought they were gone be</li>
            <li> I use this professionally and it&#x27;s great. Good product.</li>
            <li> Just what we expected when were ordered this product quality.</li>
            <li> Great rechargeable shaver. Will recommend it for travel.</li>
            <li> I am a super busy stylist who does approx 40 mens cuts per week...I have been using these for 2 years and they still work well! I need to replace the blade at this point but the motor is still going strong and they hold a charge well.</li>
            <li> These are salon-quality trimmers.</li>
            <li> Outstanding trimmer one of the best</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s lot better than the Wahl I was using. Battery lasts about a week off of the charger.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for 39 yrs. thus I have had many trimmers.  This is by far the best I ever had.  It&#x27;s amazing what you can get for an extra 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have been been using them professionally for 9 years. one of the safest and best items for kids too. trust me!</li>
            <li> Very precise, straight out of the box. Very good trimmer.</li>
