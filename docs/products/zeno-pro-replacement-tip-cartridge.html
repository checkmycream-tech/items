    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I had an awesome experience with the product and the purchaser..</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price on these replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>I have used Zeno for a couple years now and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Zeno is the best way to zap underground zits.  </li>
            <li>had been blessed with great, nearly flawless skin for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for stopping a developing pimple.</li>
            <li>This product works great for that.</li>
            <li>I think it works great.  </li>
            <li>Plus what a great value this was.  </li>
            <li>Item works great in conjuction with the Zeno.</li>
            <li>, I was very happy when I was able to find this cartridge repacement in the 90 count.</li>
            <li>YEAH, THIS TIP WORKS GOOD WITH THE ZENO....</li>
            <li>More reviews to come!</li>
            <li>I love my zeno!</li>
            <li>but I honestly can&#x27;t think of anything else to attribute this to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Zeno, it has greatly reduced my blemishes better than any dermatologist prescribing medication to me could.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was at a good price!!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and good response</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now and love it.</li>
            <li>The price of this item and the rate of speed of the merchant&#x27;s shipping was outstanding.</li>
            <li>but when you have acne most of your life you will try anything at any cost.</li>
            <li>I did have to use it more often on my cystic acne</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re treating a face covered with cystic acne, it requires more time.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>i love this product...</li>
            <li>The 90 tip may cost more but is a better value per tip.</li>
            <li>I love my replacement cartidges.  </li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and worked just as well as the original cartridge.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, portable, no lotions or creams needed...</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>Some were huge and sticking out while others looked \\&quot;embedded\\&quot; in my skin.  </li>
            <li>When I realized Zeno was actually eliminating ALL my pimples, some faster than others, I was SOOOO happy.  </li>
            <li>This product has been discontinued at our local stores, so I was happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li>This is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My aesthetician uses a high frequency wand, which has shown to be more effective with a higher cost up front with no replacement accessories required, so I just bought that too.</li>
            <li>I have found that by using the Zeno in conjunction with Proactive Solution I have cleared my face significantly of acne.</li>
            <li>, there is a good chance it will be gone by the next day.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and cheaper then what I would  have been able to purchase at Ulta.</li>
            <li>It felt like a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it was purchased by AMEX.</li>
            <li>The Zeno is good for pimples, specifically pustules, when they first form, so you need to catch them early at the first sign of redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re truly bothered by your acne as I was, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>But it was worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>If it has gotten to the point where your acne is lowering your self-image and making you want to \\&quot;hide your face\\&quot; from people, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>If it has gotten to the point where your acne is lowering your self-image and making you want to \\&quot;hide your face\\&quot; from people, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>it is so well worth the money if you&#x27;re experiencing a skin problem.  </li>
            <li>and I arrived very fast</li>
            <li>If you use it 2-3 times the first day you feel one (even if you cannot see it yet)</li>
            <li>The 90 refill cartridge is the way to go, it can last a year (or more), depending on the severity of your acne.</li>
            <li>IF YOU USE IT ON MULTIPLE PIMPLES (LIKE MOST PEOPLE DO)</li>
            <li>course I HIGHLY recommend this product to ANYONE (teens and adults) who are suffering from ANY type of acne (mild to severe).  </li>
            <li>course I HIGHLY recommend this product to ANYONE (teens and adults) who are suffering from ANY type of acne (mild to severe).  </li>
            <li>EXPENSIVE BUT EFFECTIVE TREATMENT TO OWN.</li>
            <li>I kept reading all the positive reviews on it and how it worked wonders for people.  </li>
            <li>Using it on cystic acne does mean it will be more time consuming and cost more as I was going through replacement cartridges quite fast.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think this thing was going to work...</li>
            <li>FAST TOO</li>
            <li>Can you really put a price on your face and skin?</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>I received my shipment in a very efficient manner.  </li>
            <li>which was very convienient.  </li>
            <li>The company doesn&#x27;t recommend it for cystic acne, but I&#x27;ve found it to be effective in halting cysts from progressing any further if caught soon enough (and you know when one is forming).  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel that it&#x27;s hotter more than other times, but it&#x27;s bearable and does depend where on the face.</li>
            <li>The small mirror inside the case has proven to be handy.</li>
            <li>It even stopped new breakouts from occuring!  </li>
            <li>It even stopped new breakouts from occuring!  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because of the two minutes you have to hold it on your face, the redness, and the mild discomfort from the heat.</li>
            <li>I did get regular pimple breakouts in addition to cystic acne and it worked on my regular pimples like magic.  </li>
            <li>And my so-called regular pimples disappeared quickly as promised.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but it does, you have to be a little more patient.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to use it a few more times, so</li>
            <li>gross right.</li>
            <li>Beats me as to why they limit usage - looks exactly the same as 60 count (they have a chip which doesnt let you use it anymore after the limit is reached)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>You literally just pull the old one off and snap the new one on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s SO simple to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and eliminates normal acne fast.  </li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and fast delivery</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had clear skin, even as a teenager.  </li>
            <li>It does not work very well at all on cystic ance, but for basic zits or pimples it takes care of them in a day or two.</li>
            <li>Then, in my early 30&#x27;s, I started to develop cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>-- I&#x27;m 45 years old and have hormonally induced occassional blemishes...</li>
            <li>place on the pimple as directed and by next day either decrease in size or ready to pop, I know</li>
            <li>I is completely in sanitary.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this item new from the manufacturer several times and  the plastic was always a pouch...never glued.  </li>
            <li>I was finally out of \\&quot;hiding\\&quot; and willing to go out in public again (NOT constantly worrying about how hideous my acne covered</li>
            <li>major bonus</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s quite easy to use and requires no clean up.</li>
            <li>Now you can do it yourself at home with a device you can use and re-use for a lot less money, so I was ready to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeno</li>
            <li>I discovered that people would go to a salon for a professional facial treatment that was similar to using the Zeno device which cost them hundreds of dollars for one single treatment, I was intrigued.  </li>

            <li> As I said, I&#x27;ll still get occasional pimples, but after consistently treating my cystic acne with Zeno for about six months, my acne vanished without ANY scarring remaining behind.  </li>

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this thing was going to work...but when you have acne most of your life you will try anything at any cost. I have found that by using the Zeno in conjunction with Proactive Solution I have cleared my face significantly of acne. The Zeno product does take some time to use, as you have to hold it to the pimple for approx. two minutes. It causes redness on that area for about 10 minutes and is only mildly uncomfortable when you first put it on the pimple. After a day or two the acne is gone. It&#x27;s weird, but it works! I only gave it 4 stars because of the two minutes you have to hold it on your face, the redness, and the mild discomfort from the heat. Other than that, it&#x27;s quite easy to use and requires no clean up. You just have to charge it periodically and after 90 uses you have to replace the tip. Replacing it is so simple. You literally just pull the old one off and snap the new one on. This is a VERY simple device and it does the trick. It does not work very well at all on cystic ance, but for basic zits or pimples it takes care of them in a day or two.</li>
            <li> This product is great for stopping a developing pimple. If you use it 2-3 times the first day you feel one (even if you cannot see it yet), there is a good chance it will be gone by the next day. Try to catch them while they are still small, they heal so much faster. I am over 50 and have hormonal acne in the chin and nose area. This product works great for that. Amazon has the best price on these replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> I wish the Zeno had been invented years ago, it would&#x27;ve spared me suffering from acne and acne scarring (physical AND mental). This product stops the problem dead in its tracks, before it can get any larger or painful. The company doesn&#x27;t recommend it for cystic acne, but I&#x27;ve found it to be effective in halting cysts from progressing any further if caught soon enough (and you know when one is forming).  The 90 refill cartridge is the way to go, it can last a year (or more), depending on the severity of your acne. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Ulta was selling this product and then decided to stop selling it. I ended up with a device that I couldn&#x27;t use because I had no replacement head, I was very happy when I was able to find this cartridge repacement in the 90 count. Ulta only sold one that had a 60 count. The price was reasonable and cheaper then what I would  have been able to purchase at Ulta.</li>
            <li> YEAH, THIS TIP WORKS GOOD WITH THE ZENO....BUT LIKE ALL ZENO PRODUCTS TOO PRICEY !!!!  IT RUNS OUT FAST TOO IF YOU USE IT ON MULTIPLE PIMPLES (LIKE MOST PEOPLE DO) EXPENSIVE BUT EFFECTIVE TREATMENT TO OWN.</li>
            <li> The Zeno is good for pimples, specifically pustules, when they first form, so you need to catch them early at the first sign of redness. This is not effective for black heads, which should be extracted. Sometimes I feel that it&#x27;s hotter more than other times, but it&#x27;s bearable and does depend where on the face. This is quick and easy to use. The small mirror inside the case has proven to be handy. The replacement tip cartridge is a bit pricey, but I have seen it on sale once in awhile recently. Although it&#x27;s a bit pricey, Zeno does offer the unit at different price points depending on the number of treatments. Can you really put a price on your face and skin? I definitely would recommend this to friends and family. I also recommend using the Clarisonic Pro facial/body brush too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS My aesthetician uses a high frequency wand, which has shown to be more effective with a higher cost up front with no replacement accessories required, so I just bought that too. More reviews to come!</li>
            <li> Replacing the cartridge on your Zeno device is extremely simple.  If you&#x27;re truly bothered by your acne as I was, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had clear skin, even as a teenager.  I&#x27;d get the occasional pimple/blemish from time to time but never had \\&quot;problem skin.\\&quot;  Then, in my early 30&#x27;s, I started to develop cystic acne.  It was EVERYWHERE.  I was SO embarrassed by it and couldn&#x27;t even stand to look at myself.  I even refused to go out in public without a ton of makeup on to cover the acne (although, of course, you could still see that I had acne underneath my make-up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was aware that Zeno didn&#x27;t have a high recommendation for cystic acne, but I was desperate.  I kept reading all the positive reviews on it and how it worked wonders for people.  I felt it was worth a try.  By this point, I DID try everything else - from acne kits to prescription cream my doctor prescribed.  NONE of these helped in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I discovered that people would go to a salon for a professional facial treatment that was similar to using the Zeno device which cost them hundreds of dollars for one single treatment, I was intrigued.  I started looking into salons and found out that some of them DID offer this type of treatment.  Now you can do it yourself at home with a device you can use and re-use for a lot less money, so I was ready to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeno DID work for me.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.  I did get regular pimple breakouts in addition to cystic acne and it worked on my regular pimples like magic.  I did have to use it more often on my cystic acne but it DID work.  My face was COVERED with ugly cystic acne.  Some were huge and sticking out while others looked \\&quot;embedded\\&quot; in my skin.  And, as I said, I was also getting regular pimples.  My self-confidence was at a rock bottom low.  When I realized Zeno was actually eliminating ALL my pimples, some faster than others, I was SOOOO happy.  It felt like a dream come true.  Just having this product increased my self-esteem immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it took longer on cystic acne.  I&#x27;d have to use it a few more times, so it&#x27;d take an additional couple of days.  But after just one use, it DID at least make it much smaller and less noticeable.  And my so-called regular pimples disappeared quickly as promised. Using it on cystic acne does mean it will be more time consuming and cost more as I was going through replacement cartridges quite fast.  But it was worth it to me.  I was finally out of \\&quot;hiding\\&quot; and willing to go out in public again (NOT constantly worrying about how hideous my acne covered face looked while I was talking to someone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s SO simple to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and eliminates normal acne fast.  When you&#x27;re treating a face covered with cystic acne, it requires more time.  I&#x27;d sit with a mirror propped up at a nearby table/desk and use it on my cystic acne while watching a movie or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major bonus I was NOT expecting is I don&#x27;t have ANY acne or blemish scars.  The heat must prevent scarring.  I still get an occasional pimple now and then, but the ultimate bonus is my cystic acne breakouts STOPPED!  After using Zeno for several months, my breakouts began lessening, and then I suddenly stopped getting cystic acne breakouts.  Maybe it&#x27;s a coincidence or maybe I did something else that was \\&quot;correct\\&quot; but I honestly can&#x27;t think of anything else to attribute this to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it was 4 to 5 years ago since I last had a cystic acne breakout.  As I said, I&#x27;ll still get occasional pimples, but after consistently treating my cystic acne with Zeno for about six months, my acne vanished without ANY scarring remaining behind.  At my worst time, I was going through replacement cartridges quite quickly on my cystic acne (probably needing a new one at least once a month).  But that&#x27;s because they WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been blessed with great, nearly flawless skin for 30 years.  Developing my first cystic acne breakout when I was in my early 30&#x27;s was devastating.  And these breakouts were severe.  I only wished that I had discovered Zeno sooner.  It definitely changed my life.  I had NO idea how depressing, stressful, frustrating &amp; embarrassing acne could be until I started getting extreme breakouts (and I was an adult when they started, so I can only imagine how difficult and life altering it is for teenagers to go through the same thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I HIGHLY recommend this product to ANYONE (teens and adults) who are suffering from ANY type of acne (mild to severe).  If it has gotten to the point where your acne is lowering your self-image and making you want to \\&quot;hide your face\\&quot; from people, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  You can&#x27;t put a price on confidence OR self-esteem.  It wasn&#x27;t even recommended for my type of acne (much less the severity of it), but it DID work.  It made my acne \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; and eliminated all my flaws.  It also lessened the number of breakouts I&#x27;d receive as time went by after using it on a regular basis for a few months and even prevented any scarring or blemish \\&quot;marks\\&quot; from forming. It even stopped new breakouts from occuring!  Really... What more can you ask for?eloping my first cystic acne breakout when I was in my early 30&#x27;s was devastating.

            <li> Z E N O ....It does wast it says it will for me -- I&#x27;m 45 years old and have hormonally induced occassional blemishes...</li>
            <li> just get it early, the pimple, and in a few days its gone.  it says it doesn&#x27;t work with cystic acne....but it does, you have to be a little more patient.  thank-you zeno, i wish i could buy stock in the company</li>
            <li> i love this product...it is so well worth the money if you&#x27;re experiencing a skin problem.  easy to use, portable, no lotions or creams needed...just my little leather case!</li>
            <li> Item works great in conjuction with the Zeno. I love the Zeno, it has greatly reduced my blemishes better than any dermatologist prescribing medication to me could. The 90 tip may cost more but is a better value per tip. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Zeno is the best way to zap underground zits.  a couple of applications and they are gone.  It kills the bacteria and it dissolves.  Not for above ground zits or blackheads!</li>
            <li> I love my replacement cartidges.  They are very easy to use and worked just as well as the original cartridge.  Wow!</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued at our local stores, so I was happy to find it here.  Shipped fast and was at a good price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I was informed that I had to now purchase it on line, so I did.  This product was the same as always and I arrived very fast which was very convienient.  I will continue to purchase from this resource.  Thank you so much.[[ASIN:B000JR4OP6 Zeno Pro Replacement Tip Cartridge, 90 Count]]</li>
            <li> 5 stars because I have been using this product forever now. would recommend of course. I always buy the replacements, for those stubborn blemishes. place on the pimple as directed and by next day either decrease in size or ready to pop, I know gross right. but hey. My husband always thought I was nuts until he tried it, now when I can&#x27;t find it I know where to look :/ . I love my zeno!</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I received an item that they said was &amp;#34;not boxed because the box was damaged in shipment&amp;#34;  the item was wrapped in plastic that had been glued together.  I have purchased this item new from the manufacturer several times and  the plastic was always a pouch...never glued.  When I opened the plastic, there was paint missing from the plastic tip and what looks like skin, dirt or makeup surrounding the metal tip.  I is completely in sanitary.  I have sent them an email for a refund 2 times and have only heard responses that include &amp;#34;we will call you&amp;#34; yet never received the call.  Luckily it was purchased by AMEX.</li>
