            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Smells like one of the ladies that is always at the bus stop and not sensual, lol.</li>

            <li>Honestly, this stuff does not smell great.</li>
            <li>Its a shame because I loved their Germ Fighter.  </li>
            <li>, it looks like a good brand although I have never bought any others.</li>
            <li>not so good, im going to use for add to cleaning products but not on my skin</li>
            <li>My husband LOVED it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re good in that department.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good place to look.</li>
            <li>You get a good value/amount of oil here.  </li>

            <li>I love the fragrance of this and it works great.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure the quality of the oil is great</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with all products I have ever gotten from Plant Therapy.</li>

            <li>Pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>, I love the scent!</li>
            <li>Maybe it will smell better diluted in the bath?!?</li>
            <li>It smells lovely in here!</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and loved the blend of this oil!</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This product blends nicely with Beeswax and Covonut oil.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented, patchouli is a standout note followed by sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is nice.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice calming sent.</li>
            <li>in a warm bath.</li>
            <li>so I get nice whiffs every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I add a drop or two into my candles as they burn or a drop to my lamp bulbsand house smells really warm and relaxing and.</li>
            <li>, many of their blends seem to have good synergy from what I have seen, if not all of them.</li>
            <li>Nice thing is when you get a massage with it seems to heat up your body temperature which is nice.</li>
            <li>I thought the balance of scents was nice and well rounded.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a stinky perfume neither my husband or I liked it.</li>
            <li>I get a warm aroma, though I find the \\&quot;Aphrodisiac\\&quot; label quite a stretch.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t care for this scent.</li>
            <li>However once I diffused it, it gave my room a great unique smell.</li>
            <li>This oil has a lovely sensual scent that is very appealing.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, and it seems like a good quality oil, just not our taste.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Very strong sense.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent and you either like it or</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t purchase many blends as I like to mix my own when the ingredients are listed.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use to make perfume because the bless of pulls sounded like they would smell nice but the patchouli was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Its a super nice fragrance!</li>
            <li>At first smell it doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li>The blend was received with positive feedback and I am happy to say it is a winner.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and certainly sets the mood.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the aroma this oil gives.</li>
            <li>oil, however, has such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>and I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>Sensual Synergy Aphrodisiac Essential Oil is great!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and</li>
            <li>Well its ok.</li>
            <li>and perhaps it would be better to buy separately these mixes oils.</li>
            <li>I love the smell from the sensual synergy.</li>
            <li>It ended up a bit more fruity than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this company, their oils, packaging, shipping, labeled bottles, and customer service is phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Others seem to be pleased by the scent when entering the room.  </li>
            <li>and I add it to home made lotions and creams and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and gives my concoctions a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since added it to some homemade granite top cleaner.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, a blend that I use for many applications, somewhat of a spicy aroma, one of my favorites</li>
            <li>I love this aroma.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into essential oils; this one is great!!!</li>
            <li>speedy shipping , great product, wonderful smell, really puts you in that mood, overall Plant therapy company has a whole lots of amazing products to choose from, very affordable for the excellent quality items they provide.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Plant Therapy Blends.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something a bit more traditional/sweet smelling, somewhat like BBW&#x27;s Sensual Amber.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to acclimate myself to the smell yet.</li>
            <li>It smells like something that had been sitting on my grandmothers shelf for too many years and was rancid.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this oil is really exotic and tranquil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice now and my customers love this as an addition to their body creams.</li>
            <li>I am able to use these three oils and will be buying</li>
            <li>Has a wonderful blend of all of the oils to create a personal experience.</li>
            <li>I now add lavendar to this to make it more &#x27;palletable&#x27; to my tastes.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>More then sensual reminds me of soap.</li>
            <li>I love to use it in my diffuser when I&#x27;m cleaning.</li>
            <li>This has an awesome scent perfect for male or female.  </li>
            <li>I have more of this brand and love them.</li>
            <li>Love the way this synergy smells.</li>
            <li>nothing sexual</li>
            <li>Love wearing it.</li>
            <li>perfectly calming and that says alot with construction going on outside.</li>
            <li>definately going to order more</li>
            <li>; I would just use my citrus oils which are much more pleasing scents.</li>
            <li>Okay scent.</li>
            <li>This blend contains many of my favorites, including sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>Buy and be satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is ok, the scent wasn&#x27;t something I would buy again.</li>
            <li>But others might love it.</li>
            <li>This had a more medicine smell to it.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this oil straight from the bottle, when I put about 5 drops with water in my oil burner it had a very nice smell that permeated the room.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I found this.  </li>
            <li>Only two drops in water and the aroma was strong and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It smells warm and a bit woody with a sweet finish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Musky, woody, scent... perfect to relax to at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>In the oil warmer at first it smelled very pleasant, but the sweet orange or something quickly burned away and the resulting odor was nauseating.</li>
            <li>, I still wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it after my first whiff, but it grew on me!  </li>
            <li>I felt the lavender note was too strong and was  hoping to find more ylang ylang, patchouli and maybe neroli instead of orange.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance was strong, delivery was quick and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>It is more of a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this I thought it would be a warm, sexy fragrance, but it really doesn&#x27;t have an appealing smell (to me).  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t have a good feedback to give.  </li>
            <li>It is well marked and has a very nice essence.  </li>
            <li>I can easily pick out the ylang ylang and patchouli notes, and the orange, jasmine, and sandalwood seem to soften them.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like a strong perfume.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li>Product has nice, strong scent - one doesn&#x27;t have to use very much - I use it to scent lotions I make at home.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it stays in the whole downstairs area of a 2700+ square feet house!</li>
            <li>- kinda smells healthy without being sweet.</li>
            <li>Though its pure I liked the scent</li>
            <li>so i put a few drops in and it smells so great !</li>
            <li>Smells great, lots of &#x27;orange&#x27; but the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I still get to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I also noticed, everyone in my household was much more calm</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t all that fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several things from them and been happy.</li>
            <li>Our clothes have such a great aroma.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that was close to a scent I experienced at a facial.  </li>
            <li>so I could enjoy out of the house.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so potent that you really don&#x27;t need more than 2 drops.</li>
            <li>It smells strong and pure but not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The oil is good and the scent is just strong enough, however the scent takes some adjusting to.</li>
            <li>I expected the smell to be more pleasant.</li>
            <li>Keeps my back porch smelling nice!</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL POST:  </li>
            <li>this is my first time with the oils i love this.</li>
            <li>No one seem to get excited</li>
            <li>I am not a lavender fan, but love the other ingredients, so I thought it might be pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Great product, not too strong at all, earthy, just slightly floral but light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy, they have quality oils, deliver fast and accurately.</li>
            <li>Wow, such a wonderful blend of aromas.  </li>
            <li>It is true that higher notes fade faster than the deeper, musky scents but that is true with most oils as I understand.</li>
            <li>The right blend of floral and spicy for me!</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments when wearing just a few drops of this amazing scent!</li>
            <li>I can really pick out each of the different oils in this beautiful blend.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted more of the jasmine scent by itself.  </li>
            <li>all the different uses it is good for.</li>
            <li>The smell can be a bit too much for me personally, so be sure you use it in drops.</li>
            <li>sensual oil is a sweet and spicy smell all in one.</li>
            <li>I choose this oil because I trust this brand to be true to description.</li>
            <li>I could tell it was still full</li>
            <li>I prefer the sweet fruity scents like orange.</li>
            <li>I thought the blend would really smell great, but it turned out that the patchouli is really overwhelming and I can&#x27;t focus on any of the other notes like the orange, lavender or sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Upon first opening this oil I thought the smell was strong and manly.</li>
            <li>It would also make a great fragrance for home made soaps or other home made body care</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>and they all fade quickly.  </li>
            <li>The item was well packed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered 2 other oils from this company and have been very impressed with the quality in comparison to Young Living.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got your oils stored somewhere where you don&#x27;t immediately see the label this really makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>That being said, I haven&#x27;t yet discovered a great way to put them to use, as I am new on the Essential Oil Scene and still doing a lot of reading.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was great, in a sealed bubble wrap pack and surrounded by the little bags of air in a box.  </li>
            <li>You do not have to add much because it is very strong (a little goes a long way), but the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li>The aroma of the oil is pleasant, but the blends seem to all resemble each other to me.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong or too weak; a great blend of sweet and earthy notes.</li>
            <li>My family doctors with a Chinese doctor and have seen the amazing benefits of the ancient wisdom.  </li>
            <li>and they come out smelling so fresh.</li>
            <li>I really like be able to purchase my oils for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this natural solution.</li>
            <li>Guess who wins?</li>
            <li>is good, as are their other oils that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>These oils are high quality, I can tell that they&#x27;re made with good essential oils.  </li>
            <li>The scent does not stay on for very long, and is kind of watery versus oily.</li>
            <li>The Chinese have used essential oils all throughout history, so I have great hopes of these working when used correctly.</li>
            <li>but this was very much not my thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s a decent oil, thus the 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>It is a strong scent and lingers for a long while, I used a bit too much the first time not knowing it was that strong and had to turn the fan on in my window.  </li>
            <li>When i first smelled this oil i wasnt sure what i thought but mixed it for homemade febreeze and used it.</li>
            <li>It probably could have been left out altogether to make the blend more &amp;#34;sensual.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Hope to make more purchases in the future.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more products from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>LOVE to diffuse this essential oil!!!</li>
            <li>I probably should&#x27;ve read the bottle more carefully as none of the components are supposed to be &#x27;sweet&#x27; smelling.</li>
            <li>I love all essential oils, and buy according to need.</li>
            <li>This one is as lovely as it gets with quality essential oil ingredients- hence no overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience</li>
            <li>Balanced fragrance fills the air with a lovely Lavender bouquet, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Oil is of high quality packed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I have only used it in my diffuser, so far, and it adds a nice pleasing aroma to the room.</li>
            <li>I looked far and wide for a good price on a predominately ylang ylang, patchouli fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the actually aphrodisiac effects, but my girlfriend seems to enjoy the smell, as do I.  Very nice for just relaxing, reading, talking...</li>
            <li>I was honestly hoping to enjoy using this oil and hoping to get a little action from the husband...</li>
            <li>It was not a very pleasant smell but after reading the blend of oils I thought it would be pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Im not sure the smell is good.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, subtle scent, not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Even when blended, the sandalwood/lavender still manages to crawl its way to the top, so all I smell is this, for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Could have been mixed too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really strong &amp; not everyone has the same aromatherapy reaction.</li>
            <li>This is pure, concentrated oil.</li>
            <li>The top notes are a little strong, but don&#x27;t let that deter you as they are only top notes,  the middle and bottom notes do come out over time.  </li>
            <li>After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li>It is hard to put a smell in words for me, but this stuff has a bit of a floral scent, a bit woody, but it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>The shipper sent the product quickly after purchase and offers many other varieties which I will try.</li>
            <li>You only need a few drops but experienced noses can still pick out the scent at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very useful,fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I will absolutely keep using it.</li>
            <li>Smells really funky....</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this with a carrier oil as a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The problem for me is that the orange is very overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>Very calming aroma, the floral scent of the jasmine and the ylang ylang really come through.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li>That, or I just smelled sandalwood too much in my childhood for it to have any sex appeal for me.</li>
            <li>Used whole bottle with 16 oz coconut oil.</li>
            <li>This oil blend is really well made.</li>
            <li>WAY to much Patchouli.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000B1TG7Q JASMINE ABSOLUTE &amp; JOJOBA</li>
            <li>so much easier than mixing all these essences myself.</li>
            <li>Still not what i wanted even when I diluted it in the very neutral scented or no scent grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li>Received this product extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I like that this company mixes the oils for me in a ready to use product</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping I would really like this belnd, but it&#x27;s not working for me.  </li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my warm bath for a relaxing and sensual experience.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes it settles into a really nice scent.</li>
            <li>We make our own laundry liquid and wanted a different essential oil to use.  </li>
            <li>Thats right, old lady came to mind when I opened the bottle</li>
            <li>(I should note that I have several different oils that are not blends, and those are very easy to tell by their smell. )</li>
            <li>Warning however, be careful how much you use as it can be quite strong in the finished product.  </li>
            <li>Not only that after using 1 drop in my cool mist diffuser and it doesn&#x27;t matter what I diffuse</li>
            <li>The sandalwood and patchouli are subtle, as I had been hoping, they really just help to balance out the floral notes in a way I find very appealing.  </li>
            <li>Less is more when used in a product that you would use all over the body.</li>
            <li>I like the blend of these particular oil fragrances.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really particular about how my house smells.  </li>
            <li>She told me the main ingredients were ylang ylang, sandalwood and lavender.</li>
            <li>The blend is well balanced and the oils used seem to be of a high quality.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, necessarily--I might blend it with vanilla, or use it for an air freshener in my car (which it might be perfect for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>This is a really cool, complex, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am rather new to aromatherapy</li>
            <li>I live in Vermont.</li>
            <li>and I like the company very much, and remember that scent is a very personal sensation.</li>
            <li>I think the price is very reasonable, just wish the scent would last longer than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>High quality, natural smelling.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to make some homemade body wash, but some other scents in the recipe would have overpowered this.</li>
            <li>I found that this essential oil blend is exactly the fragrance I wanted for my home-made body lotion.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several oils from PTEO and they  are high quality, &amp; pure oil.</li>
            <li>: why is it that the most unpleasant scents often have the most staying power?</li>
            <li>Long lasting and huge amount of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Sensual Synergy Aphrodisiac Essential Oil WAS USED TO CREATE A NEW FRAGRANCE FOR CANDLES AND FOR AIR FRESHENERS; THUS FAR THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN POSITIVE</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells but as far as Aphrodiasic, the jury is still out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far in my diffuser</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a complete repellant</li>
            <li>Smells like heaven, very sensual...floral, woodsy, all in all a deep aroma.</li>
            <li>, Im not an old lady yet....</li>
            <li>As you can guess, the heated unit for winter, and the natural diffuser for the summer months.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how woodsy this oil turned out to be.</li>
            <li>really like Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>My local Whole Foods had a 10ml bottle for $29.99.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really get the sensual part of it, but definitely calming for me.  </li>
            <li>I found that when I did it a second time I put too much on and it changed the scent</li>
            <li>The sensual scent is very relaxing, which is the reason for my purchase, but really don&#x27;t want the other scents that are added.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what species would find this an aphrodisiac, but it&#x27;s not anywhere close to enjoyable for the human race.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, long lasting and will buy product again.</li>
            <li>And the quality seems right up there with the other major/pricier brands.  </li>
            <li>I use a few drops when I make candles for myself or for gifts to special friends.</li>
            <li>It is a strange smell that did nothing for me or my significant other.</li>
            <li>I have found no other that measures up to the quality of this blend.</li>
            <li>It is not feminine or masculine, but a little of both, pretty neutral.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the main purpose of this lovely scent is going to be yet, but so far I have mixed it with some coconut oil and sea salt to use as a body scrub, I have added a few drops to my laundry and I leave the bottle on my night stand</li>
            <li>This product is heavier on the patchouli note than I had expected, so I probably won&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the apartment cleaned professionally, I&#x27;ve kept the windows open,</li>
            <li>Smells terrible straight out of the bottle, and I wasn&#x27;t that big of a fan when I added to oil and wore it, but it is beautiful in a diffuser!</li>
            <li>I melted down cocoa butter with almond oil and castor oil and filled a couple empty lip balm tubes, but you could just even just add it to almond oil.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again but will try something else first to see if less medicine smell and see what&#x27;s out there in this field.</li>
            <li>They really compliment each other.</li>
            <li>When I first received my package, I opened up the bottle and dabbed a little on my wrists.  </li>
            <li>but this is very woodsy manly but is a sour way.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this one because it&#x27;s all essential oils and at the time I was missing two of them in the pure oil.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This product blends nicely with Beeswax and Covonut oil.</li>
            <li> Nicely scented, patchouli is a standout note followed by sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is nice.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice calming sent.</li>
            <li> in a warm bath.</li>
            <li> so I get nice whiffs every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a drop or two into my candles as they burn or a drop to my lamp bulbsand house smells really warm and relaxing and.</li>
            <li> , many of their blends seem to have good synergy from what I have seen, if not all of them.</li>
            <li> Nice thing is when you get a massage with it seems to heat up your body temperature which is nice.</li>
            <li> I thought the balance of scents was nice and well rounded.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a stinky perfume neither my husband or I liked it.</li>
            <li> I get a warm aroma, though I find the \\&quot;Aphrodisiac\\&quot; label quite a stretch.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t care for this scent.</li>
            <li> However once I diffused it, it gave my room a great unique smell.</li>
            <li> This oil has a lovely sensual scent that is very appealing.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong, and it seems like a good quality oil, just not our taste.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Very strong sense.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent and you either like it or</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t purchase many blends as I like to mix my own when the ingredients are listed.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use to make perfume because the bless of pulls sounded like they would smell nice but the patchouli was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Its a super nice fragrance!</li>
            <li> At first smell it doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li> The blend was received with positive feedback and I am happy to say it is a winner.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and certainly sets the mood.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the aroma this oil gives.</li>
            <li> oil, however, has such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> and I have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> Sensual Synergy Aphrodisiac Essential Oil is great!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and</li>
            <li> Well its ok.</li>
            <li> and perhaps it would be better to buy separately these mixes oils.</li>
            <li> I love the smell from the sensual synergy.</li>
            <li> It ended up a bit more fruity than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this company, their oils, packaging, shipping, labeled bottles, and customer service is phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others seem to be pleased by the scent when entering the room.  </li>
            <li> and I add it to home made lotions and creams and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and gives my concoctions a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since added it to some homemade granite top cleaner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, a blend that I use for many applications, somewhat of a spicy aroma, one of my favorites</li>
            <li> I love this aroma.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into essential oils; this one is great!!!</li>
            <li> speedy shipping , great product, wonderful smell, really puts you in that mood, overall Plant therapy company has a whole lots of amazing products to choose from, very affordable for the excellent quality items they provide.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Plant Therapy Blends.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit more traditional/sweet smelling, somewhat like BBW&#x27;s Sensual Amber.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to acclimate myself to the smell yet.</li>
            <li> It smells like something that had been sitting on my grandmothers shelf for too many years and was rancid.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is really exotic and tranquil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice now and my customers love this as an addition to their body creams.</li>
            <li> I am able to use these three oils and will be buying</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful blend of all of the oils to create a personal experience.</li>
            <li> I now add lavendar to this to make it more &#x27;palletable&#x27; to my tastes.  </li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> More then sensual reminds me of soap.</li>
            <li> I love to use it in my diffuser when I&#x27;m cleaning.</li>
            <li> This has an awesome scent perfect for male or female.  </li>
            <li> I have more of this brand and love them.</li>
            <li> Love the way this synergy smells.</li>
            <li> nothing sexual</li>
            <li> Love wearing it.</li>
            <li> perfectly calming and that says alot with construction going on outside.</li>
            <li> definately going to order more</li>
            <li> ; I would just use my citrus oils which are much more pleasing scents.</li>
            <li> Okay scent.</li>
            <li> This blend contains many of my favorites, including sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> Buy and be satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is ok, the scent wasn&#x27;t something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> But others might love it.</li>
            <li> This had a more medicine smell to it.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this oil straight from the bottle, when I put about 5 drops with water in my oil burner it had a very nice smell that permeated the room.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited when I found this.  </li>
            <li> Only two drops in water and the aroma was strong and wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It smells warm and a bit woody with a sweet finish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Musky, woody, scent... perfect to relax to at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> In the oil warmer at first it smelled very pleasant, but the sweet orange or something quickly burned away and the resulting odor was nauseating.</li>
            <li> , I still wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it after my first whiff, but it grew on me!  </li>
            <li> I felt the lavender note was too strong and was  hoping to find more ylang ylang, patchouli and maybe neroli instead of orange.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance was strong, delivery was quick and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> It is more of a light floral scent.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I thought it would be a warm, sexy fragrance, but it really doesn&#x27;t have an appealing smell (to me).  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have a good feedback to give.  </li>
            <li> It is well marked and has a very nice essence.  </li>
            <li> I can easily pick out the ylang ylang and patchouli notes, and the orange, jasmine, and sandalwood seem to soften them.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like a strong perfume.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Product has nice, strong scent - one doesn&#x27;t have to use very much - I use it to scent lotions I make at home.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it stays in the whole downstairs area of a 2700+ square feet house!</li>
            <li> - kinda smells healthy without being sweet.</li>
            <li> Though its pure I liked the scent</li>
            <li> so i put a few drops in and it smells so great !</li>
            <li> Smells great, lots of &#x27;orange&#x27; but the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I still get to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I also noticed, everyone in my household was much more calm</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t all that fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several things from them and been happy.</li>
            <li> Our clothes have such a great aroma.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was close to a scent I experienced at a facial.  </li>
            <li> so I could enjoy out of the house.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is so potent that you really don&#x27;t need more than 2 drops.</li>
            <li> It smells strong and pure but not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The oil is good and the scent is just strong enough, however the scent takes some adjusting to.</li>
            <li> I expected the smell to be more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Keeps my back porch smelling nice!</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL POST:  </li>
            <li> this is my first time with the oils i love this.</li>
            <li> No one seem to get excited</li>
            <li> I am not a lavender fan, but love the other ingredients, so I thought it might be pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Great product, not too strong at all, earthy, just slightly floral but light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy, they have quality oils, deliver fast and accurately.</li>
            <li> Wow, such a wonderful blend of aromas.  </li>
            <li> It is true that higher notes fade faster than the deeper, musky scents but that is true with most oils as I understand.</li>
            <li> The right blend of floral and spicy for me!</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments when wearing just a few drops of this amazing scent!</li>
            <li> I can really pick out each of the different oils in this beautiful blend.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted more of the jasmine scent by itself.  </li>
            <li> all the different uses it is good for.</li>
            <li> The smell can be a bit too much for me personally, so be sure you use it in drops.</li>
            <li> sensual oil is a sweet and spicy smell all in one.</li>
            <li> I choose this oil because I trust this brand to be true to description.</li>
            <li> I could tell it was still full</li>
            <li> I prefer the sweet fruity scents like orange.</li>
            <li> I thought the blend would really smell great, but it turned out that the patchouli is really overwhelming and I can&#x27;t focus on any of the other notes like the orange, lavender or sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Upon first opening this oil I thought the smell was strong and manly.</li>
            <li> It would also make a great fragrance for home made soaps or other home made body care</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> and they all fade quickly.  </li>
            <li> The item was well packed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 2 other oils from this company and have been very impressed with the quality in comparison to Young Living.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got your oils stored somewhere where you don&#x27;t immediately see the label this really makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> That being said, I haven&#x27;t yet discovered a great way to put them to use, as I am new on the Essential Oil Scene and still doing a lot of reading.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was great, in a sealed bubble wrap pack and surrounded by the little bags of air in a box.  </li>
            <li> You do not have to add much because it is very strong (a little goes a long way), but the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The aroma of the oil is pleasant, but the blends seem to all resemble each other to me.  </li>
            <li> It is not too strong or too weak; a great blend of sweet and earthy notes.</li>
            <li> My family doctors with a Chinese doctor and have seen the amazing benefits of the ancient wisdom.  </li>
            <li> and they come out smelling so fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like be able to purchase my oils for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this natural solution.</li>
            <li> Guess who wins?</li>
            <li> is good, as are their other oils that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> These oils are high quality, I can tell that they&#x27;re made with good essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The scent does not stay on for very long, and is kind of watery versus oily.</li>
            <li> The Chinese have used essential oils all throughout history, so I have great hopes of these working when used correctly.</li>
            <li> but this was very much not my thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s a decent oil, thus the 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> It is a strong scent and lingers for a long while, I used a bit too much the first time not knowing it was that strong and had to turn the fan on in my window.  </li>
            <li> When i first smelled this oil i wasnt sure what i thought but mixed it for homemade febreeze and used it.</li>
            <li> It probably could have been left out altogether to make the blend more &amp;#34;sensual.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Hope to make more purchases in the future.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more products from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> LOVE to diffuse this essential oil!!!</li>
            <li> I probably should&#x27;ve read the bottle more carefully as none of the components are supposed to be &#x27;sweet&#x27; smelling.</li>
            <li> I love all essential oils, and buy according to need.</li>
            <li> This one is as lovely as it gets with quality essential oil ingredients- hence no overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience</li>
            <li> Balanced fragrance fills the air with a lovely Lavender bouquet, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Oil is of high quality packed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have only used it in my diffuser, so far, and it adds a nice pleasing aroma to the room.</li>
            <li> I looked far and wide for a good price on a predominately ylang ylang, patchouli fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the actually aphrodisiac effects, but my girlfriend seems to enjoy the smell, as do I.  Very nice for just relaxing, reading, talking...</li>
            <li> I was honestly hoping to enjoy using this oil and hoping to get a little action from the husband...</li>
            <li> It was not a very pleasant smell but after reading the blend of oils I thought it would be pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure the smell is good.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice, subtle scent, not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Even when blended, the sandalwood/lavender still manages to crawl its way to the top, so all I smell is this, for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Could have been mixed too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really strong &amp; not everyone has the same aromatherapy reaction.</li>
            <li> This is pure, concentrated oil.</li>
            <li> The top notes are a little strong, but don&#x27;t let that deter you as they are only top notes,  the middle and bottom notes do come out over time.  </li>
            <li> After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> It is hard to put a smell in words for me, but this stuff has a bit of a floral scent, a bit woody, but it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li> The shipper sent the product quickly after purchase and offers many other varieties which I will try.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops but experienced noses can still pick out the scent at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very useful,fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I will absolutely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Smells really funky....</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this with a carrier oil as a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The problem for me is that the orange is very overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Very calming.</li>
            <li> Very calming aroma, the floral scent of the jasmine and the ylang ylang really come through.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li> That, or I just smelled sandalwood too much in my childhood for it to have any sex appeal for me.</li>
            <li> Used whole bottle with 16 oz coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This oil blend is really well made.</li>
            <li> WAY to much Patchouli.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000B1TG7Q JASMINE ABSOLUTE &amp; JOJOBA</li>
            <li> so much easier than mixing all these essences myself.</li>
            <li> Still not what i wanted even when I diluted it in the very neutral scented or no scent grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> Received this product extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I like that this company mixes the oils for me in a ready to use product</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping I would really like this belnd, but it&#x27;s not working for me.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my warm bath for a relaxing and sensual experience.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it settles into a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> We make our own laundry liquid and wanted a different essential oil to use.  </li>
            <li> Thats right, old lady came to mind when I opened the bottle</li>
            <li> (I should note that I have several different oils that are not blends, and those are very easy to tell by their smell. )</li>
            <li> Warning however, be careful how much you use as it can be quite strong in the finished product.  </li>
            <li> Not only that after using 1 drop in my cool mist diffuser and it doesn&#x27;t matter what I diffuse</li>
            <li> The sandalwood and patchouli are subtle, as I had been hoping, they really just help to balance out the floral notes in a way I find very appealing.  </li>
            <li> Less is more when used in a product that you would use all over the body.</li>
            <li> I like the blend of these particular oil fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really particular about how my house smells.  </li>
            <li> She told me the main ingredients were ylang ylang, sandalwood and lavender.</li>
            <li> The blend is well balanced and the oils used seem to be of a high quality.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, necessarily--I might blend it with vanilla, or use it for an air freshener in my car (which it might be perfect for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> This is a really cool, complex, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am rather new to aromatherapy</li>
            <li> I live in Vermont.</li>
            <li> and I like the company very much, and remember that scent is a very personal sensation.</li>
            <li> I think the price is very reasonable, just wish the scent would last longer than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> High quality, natural smelling.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to make some homemade body wash, but some other scents in the recipe would have overpowered this.</li>
            <li> I found that this essential oil blend is exactly the fragrance I wanted for my home-made body lotion.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several oils from PTEO and they  are high quality, &amp; pure oil.</li>
            <li> : why is it that the most unpleasant scents often have the most staying power?</li>
            <li> Long lasting and huge amount of compliments.  </li>
            <li> Sensual Synergy Aphrodisiac Essential Oil WAS USED TO CREATE A NEW FRAGRANCE FOR CANDLES AND FOR AIR FRESHENERS; THUS FAR THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN POSITIVE</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells but as far as Aphrodiasic, the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far in my diffuser</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a complete repellant</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven, very sensual...floral, woodsy, all in all a deep aroma.</li>
            <li> , Im not an old lady yet....</li>
            <li> As you can guess, the heated unit for winter, and the natural diffuser for the summer months.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how woodsy this oil turned out to be.</li>
            <li> really like Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> My local Whole Foods had a 10ml bottle for $29.99.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really get the sensual part of it, but definitely calming for me.  </li>
            <li> I found that when I did it a second time I put too much on and it changed the scent</li>
            <li> The sensual scent is very relaxing, which is the reason for my purchase, but really don&#x27;t want the other scents that are added.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what species would find this an aphrodisiac, but it&#x27;s not anywhere close to enjoyable for the human race.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, long lasting and will buy product again.</li>
            <li> And the quality seems right up there with the other major/pricier brands.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops when I make candles for myself or for gifts to special friends.</li>
            <li> It is a strange smell that did nothing for me or my significant other.</li>
            <li> I have found no other that measures up to the quality of this blend.</li>
            <li> It is not feminine or masculine, but a little of both, pretty neutral.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the main purpose of this lovely scent is going to be yet, but so far I have mixed it with some coconut oil and sea salt to use as a body scrub, I have added a few drops to my laundry and I leave the bottle on my night stand</li>
            <li> This product is heavier on the patchouli note than I had expected, so I probably won&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the apartment cleaned professionally, I&#x27;ve kept the windows open,</li>
            <li> Smells terrible straight out of the bottle, and I wasn&#x27;t that big of a fan when I added to oil and wore it, but it is beautiful in a diffuser!</li>
            <li> I melted down cocoa butter with almond oil and castor oil and filled a couple empty lip balm tubes, but you could just even just add it to almond oil.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again but will try something else first to see if less medicine smell and see what&#x27;s out there in this field.</li>
            <li> They really compliment each other.</li>
            <li> When I first received my package, I opened up the bottle and dabbed a little on my wrists.  </li>
            <li> but this is very woodsy manly but is a sour way.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this one because it&#x27;s all essential oils and at the time I was missing two of them in the pure oil.</li>
            <li> I like other oils I have gotten from this company so far.</li>
            <li> This same blend that I bought from a different maker didn&#x27;t seem to be as long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I could imagine how it might smell based on the ingredients and other reviews, but I was still a little nervous to buy this essential oil blend without testing it out first.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and definitely relaxing.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as I anticipated</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little odd smelling at first.</li>
            <li> And, considering other purchases I made from Plant Therapy, I will not make future purchases.</li>
            <li> This is even nicer than a more expensive version I have bought!</li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent, just remember it is an oil and a very little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I spent the whole day smelling around department stores looking for a new fragrance until I just got ill.</li>
            <li> I use it as a fragrance, but I also added a few drops to my facial cream and have noticed a change in the texture and appearance of my mid 30s skin.</li>
            <li> and you loos the characteristic aroma of jasmine and sandal wood ect.</li>
            <li> No more pulling every.single.bottle.up and finally finding it with the last bottle you grab.</li>
            <li> There are no better air fresheners that you can buy, The auto air fresheners available all smell so fake, or they are so \\&quot;bright\\&quot; that they are actually oppressive.</li>
            <li> At first the lavender smells too heavy but after heating this oil or rubbing it on the skin, the other scents emerge and it is indeed a complex sensual smell.</li>
            <li> but again these small bottles don&#x27;t last long for the price.</li>
            <li> arrived before it was expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit green, but there isn&#x27;t enough ylang ylang and jasmine.  </li>
            <li> Though it has a stronger earthy smell than I expected, but I suppose the patchouli will do that.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell at all.  </li>
            <li> OIL]]It wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I use oils daily and the cost does become a factor after a few months.</li>
            <li> The brand is not pure.</li>
            <li> The smell was strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> No scent over power the other.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This brand was nearly twice as expensive as the other maker but lasted twice as long.  </li>
            <li> The two ways that I use it are either in a heated blotter diffuser that plugs into my cigarette lighter, or I&#x27;ll use a natural diffuser like a piece of terracotta, (a shard of a broken flower pot)thrown under a seat or the rear floor.</li>
            <li> You will either love or hate this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s woodsy and slightly floral.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too overbearing and has a slightly spicy under tone.</li>
            <li> I catch slight hints of each EO in the blend on occasion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering and adds a little ambiance.</li>
            <li> So today I decided to try it in my brass oil warmer with a little water</li>
            <li> When getting a massage you tend to heat up a little.  </li>
            <li> A little bit medicine smell.</li>
            <li> Although a little pricey for the size, I would buy again and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Not really liking this oil, I was expecting to have at least a little bit of results but</li>
            <li> I am skeptical to buy the mixed essential oils because its hard to know if I will like them before buying them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it was sent by lazer ship and if i had not signed up for text alerts thru amazon for my packages I would not have known it was in my apartment complex&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops, along with vinegar in my downy ball, and toss it in the wash with my sheets and towels</li>
            <li> As for me, the smell is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Put in a bottle as a mist, or a few drops and diffuse it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a heavy dilution with a carrier oil to see if that helps.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy and works well in my difusser</li>
            <li> Still, \\&quot;Sensual\\&quot; and \\&quot;Aphrodisiac\\&quot;... quite a stretch, except for a few niche fetishes.</li>
            <li> My husband and I put a few drops on our pillows before bed.</li>
            <li> I diffuse it everyday in our home.</li>
            <li> Not sure who this is supposed to turn on.</li>
            <li> As for create sensual not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which scent part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll use it for</li>
            <li> and in small fragrance atomizer diluted with distilled water.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered three other scents in the same order and they were just as bad.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time telling the difference between the three just by smelling them.  </li>
            <li> Cheap oil makes horrible blends.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted at least for a day like some soaps and shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> The drops come out quickly, so go slow.</li>
            <li> Very small amount needed and</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering and not to subtle either.</li>
            <li> My use may be thought of as wasteful or ridiculous, but so be it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m tired of department store fragrances, so i ventured into the world of essences.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I received a bad batch - or perhaps the fragrance changed due to age(?).  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is very subtle when used this way.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed with any of them and will continue to try the other blends.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells terrible.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> and it was probably just a fluke, but I still thought it was weird.</li>
            <li> They do not smell fake, or artificial, or have a chemical smell like some do.</li>
            <li> us dirty hippies and our obsession with patchouli scented anything...</li>
            <li> How could it be an aphrodisiac if it stinks?</li>
            <li> Still bad.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to find another use for this one &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I can not get rid of all of the Patchouli smell :(.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent, but my husband doesn&#x27;t :(  </li>
            <li> I would advise a drop or 2 in a carrier base, even lotion works, to avoid overkill.</li>
            <li> Not over powering and blends well with grapeseed oil base for massage.</li>
            <li> I hated the thought of wasting money on this, so I was thinking of ways to repurpose the oil blend.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s was disgusting.</li>
            <li> This smells awful to me, I like woodsy</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, nothing sensual about it.  </li>
            <li> the candle.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was just awful.</li>
            <li> worst part is that for two weeks I have been trying to air out my apartment and</li>
            <li> This gave me a terrible headache and heartburn.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Im not sure the smell is good.  I would recommend different smells but same company</li>
            <li> I LOVE the aroma this oil gives. It smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a different scent that was suppose to be \\&quot;sensual\\&quot; (that wasn&#x27;t it&#x27;s name though), from a different brand, and it&#x27;s was disgusting. It made my head hurt and my stomach ache, when I diffused it.&lt;br /&gt;This oil, however, has such a beautiful scent! I absolutely love it in the diffuser. I&#x27;m looking forward to making this into a body mist.</li>
            <li> When I read the description of oil scents that were used it sounded very nice. When I received the oils in the mail and opened them (I bought three different ones) I found all of them offensive. I tried putting a drop on a paper and letting it sit, thinking it just needed to air. Still bad. So, I diluted each one, which helped, but I was imagining scents of different things that I would never want to smell on purpose. Maybe it&#x27;s my nose and someone else might think they&#x27;re wonderful, but I won&#x27;t be using them.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! The smell is amazing and it stays in the whole downstairs area of a 2700+ square feet house! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Thank you!  Just what I wanted!  I will order more soon!  Lots of complements! Keeps my back porch smelling nice!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I put a few drops, along with vinegar in my downy ball, and toss it in the wash with my sheets and towels and they come out smelling so fresh. The fragrance is very subtle when used this way.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! I use it as a fragrance, but I also added a few drops to my facial cream and have noticed a change in the texture and appearance of my mid 30s skin.</li>
            <li> arrived before it was expected&lt;br /&gt;everything is perfect</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. Smells great and certainly sets the mood.</li>
            <li> This product blends nicely with Beeswax and Covonut oil.</li>
            <li> Nicely scented, patchouli is a standout note followed by sandalwood. I used some sunflower oil as a carrier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil in my mix for my diffuser and it makes a wonderful mixture that fills the room. The sent lingers for days and I have received many compliments. Oil is of high quality packed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I really wanted more of the jasmine scent by itself.  The sensual scent is very relaxing, which is the reason for my purchase, but really don&#x27;t want the other scents that are added.  It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> very useful,fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Sensual Synergy Aphrodisiac Essential Oil is great! I love the smell and all the different uses it is good for. The smell can be a bit too much for me personally, so be sure you use it in drops.</li>
            <li> The oil is good and the scent is just strong enough, however the scent takes some adjusting to. At first smell it doesn&#x27;t smell great but then you think... Well its ok.</li>
            <li> I expected the smell to be more pleasant. As for me, the smell is a bit heavy and perhaps it would be better to buy separately these mixes oils.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful while diffusing</li>
            <li> I appreciate Plant Therapy for making affordable essential oils. This blend is a great smelling oil and a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the smell from the sensual synergy. It does not smell like a strong perfume. It is more of a light floral scent.</li>
            <li> This product is heavier on the patchouli note than I had expected, so I probably won&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Pleasant,calm and relaxing scent-smells great! After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product but once and I really don&#x27;t have a good feedback to give.  I like the way it smells but as far as Aphrodiasic, the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this scent.  It ended up a bit more fruity than I thought it would be.  Otherwise, it is nice.  Smells like a summer scent.</li>
            <li> us dirty hippies and our obsession with patchouli scented anything...what is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s woodsy and slightly floral.  Quite pleasant to come home to the day after it&#x27;s been burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I burn this oil with a 1/4 tsp of coconut oil and it fills the room plenty!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Not sure what species would find this an aphrodisiac, but it&#x27;s not anywhere close to enjoyable for the human race.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this oil. It smells warm and a bit woody with a sweet finish.&lt;br /&gt;I like the effect it has on my mood as well. Go for it.</li>
            <li> I like it - use it. I don&#x27;t know about it being an aphrodisiac but I like the scent - kinda smells healthy without being sweet.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful. I haven&#x27;t noticed aphrodisiac qualities yet but I will absolutely keep using it.</li>
            <li> When i first smelled this oil i wasnt sure what i thought but mixed it for homemade febreeze and used it. I love it ! I used unscented soap so i put a few drops in and it smells so great !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t purchase many blends as I like to mix my own when the ingredients are listed. I purchased this one because it&#x27;s all essential oils and at the time I was missing two of them in the pure oil. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far in my diffuser and it&#x27;s really nice. It&#x27;s not overpowering and adds a little ambiance. I can easily pick out the ylang ylang and patchouli notes, and the orange, jasmine, and sandalwood seem to soften them. Even though it&#x27;s advertised as an aphrodisiac blend, I think it&#x27;s just a great blend to use at any time. Plant Therapy does a great job with packaging, labeling, and I trust their quality. I also like the fact that each bottle is labeled on the cap. If you&#x27;ve got your oils stored somewhere where you don&#x27;t immediately see the label this really makes it easy to see what you&#x27;re looking for. No more pulling every.single.bottle.up and finally finding it with the last bottle you grab.</li>
            <li> Set the mood perfectly for Valentines! It is easy to use and perfect for massage or for burning in your diffuser!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this company, their oils, packaging, shipping, labeled bottles, and customer service is phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sensual oil is a sweet and spicy smell all in one. Not too overpowering to wear as a perfume. Put in a bottle as a mist, or a few drops and diffuse it. Wonderful choice!</li>
            <li> Great product, not too strong at all, earthy, just slightly floral but light and not overpowering.  I wear as a daily perfume and use it in handmade soap and body lotion.</li>
            <li> Others seem to be pleased by the scent when entering the room.  I have seen that it seems to relax people a bit too.</li>
            <li> I used this essential oil to make Christmas gifts for friends, I made sugar scrub and body butter, and it smelled heavenly. Everyone was very pleased with my gifts.</li>
            <li> Smells really funky....I think if you want to mate with squirrels this will help you. Otherwise it&#x27;s a complete repellant</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL POST:  Just got my order today.  I agree 100% with another poster.  Don&#x27;t like the smell.  Based on the description of the blend I was really looking forward to using this with a carrier oil as a fragrance.  The problem for me is that the orange is very overpowering.  Reminds me of a citrus-based cleaner. It probably could have been left out altogether to make the blend more &amp;#34;sensual.&amp;#34;  But I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  I&#x27;ll try a heavy dilution with a carrier oil to see if that helps.  If not I&#x27;ll just use it for my car or something.  I&#x27;ll update once I&#x27;ve tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (7/18/15):  Updated my review from two to three stars.  I haven&#x27;t changed my mind about not liking this blend as a fragrance oil for the body.  Too orangey-patchouli for me.  I hated the thought of wasting money on this, so I was thinking of ways to repurpose the oil blend.  So today I decided to try it in my brass oil warmer with a little water and I actually like it!  My living room smells great.  Very calming.</li>
            <li> Loved this scent! Smells terrible straight out of the bottle, and I wasn&#x27;t that big of a fan when I added to oil and wore it, but it is beautiful in a diffuser! Very calming aroma, the floral scent of the jasmine and the ylang ylang really come through.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I thought it would be a warm, sexy fragrance, but it really doesn&#x27;t have an appealing smell (to me).  I had hoped to add it to some massage oil or dab it on pressure points, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to figure out what to do with it. Definitely not using if for anything I apply to myself!</li>
            <li> The scent is really great. On the site they have alot of scents to pick from. Hope to make more purchases in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, subtle scent, not too overpowering.  We like to use it on our linens and towels and I add it to home made lotions and creams and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and gives my concoctions a lovely scent.  I will definitely be back for more.  I shopped around a lot and this seller seems to have some of the best prices.</li>
            <li> This is a great sent. Not too overpowering and not to subtle either. I put 4-5 drops in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Not sure who this is supposed to turn on. It is a strange smell that did nothing for me or my significant other.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells terrible. I had ordered three other scents in the same order and they were just as bad. I just found out I cannot return any as they are flammable. I am very disappointed. I will not be ordering from this company again</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to make some homemade body wash, but some other scents in the recipe would have overpowered this. I&#x27;ve since added it to some homemade granite top cleaner. Smells delightful while I clean.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name fool you, a blend that I use for many applications, somewhat of a spicy aroma, one of my favorites</li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent, just remember it is an oil and a very little bit goes a long way. It does take a minute to meld into your personal scent.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful but made my eyes swell when used in a diffuser. Will add to another oil to dilute.  Hope it works</li>
            <li> I love this aroma.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  I am using it in body creams.  Maybe if you are using it in room deodorizers it would work.  I will try again before I give up on it.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This oil has a lovely sensual scent that is very appealing. The blend is well balanced and the oils used seem to be of a high quality.  It was just what I hoped it would be. The price was reasonable as well.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Good price. Quick shipping.  I will purchase more products from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent. I&#x27;m into essential oils; this one is great!!!</li>
            <li> I simply do not like the Sensual Synergy fragrance.  The mixture of oils does not work for me.  Perhaps I received a bad batch - or perhaps the fragrance changed due to age(?).  I don&#x27;t know since there are no dates to indicate the bottling or expiration of the product.  And, considering other purchases I made from Plant Therapy, I will not make future purchases.</li>
            <li> wonderful blend.  Not too heavy and works well in my difusser</li>
            <li> It has a nice calming sent. It relaxes the mind and gives some sensual hora.&lt;br /&gt;nice in a warm bath.</li>
            <li> speedy shipping , great product, wonderful smell, really puts you in that mood, overall Plant therapy company has a whole lots of amazing products to choose from, very affordable for the excellent quality items they provide. I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Plant Therapy Blends.  I have yet to be disappointed with any of them and will continue to try the other blends. I use for candles and detergent and am always getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I am not a lavender fan, but love the other ingredients, so I thought it might be pleasant.  I don&#x27;t find it sensual at all.  It&#x27;s a bit green, but there isn&#x27;t enough ylang ylang and jasmine.  Still, I believe the quality of ingredients is good and I like the company very much, and remember that scent is a very personal sensation.</li>
            <li> Smell good. When getting a massage you tend to heat up a little.  Place on shoulders for best effect. As for create sensual not sure.</li>
            <li> I was honestly hoping to enjoy using this oil and hoping to get a little action from the husband...but it didn&#x27;t phase him.  He noticed the scent and commented on it, but that&#x27;s it.  I guess I need to find another use for this one &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Bought this product to be used in a line of massage candles for my business.  The blend was received with positive feedback and I am happy to say it is a winner.  Warning however, be careful how much you use as it can be quite strong in the finished product.  Note: Less is more when used in a product that you would use all over the body.</li>
            <li> LOVE to diffuse this essential oil!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit more traditional/sweet smelling, somewhat like BBW&#x27;s Sensual Amber. However, in mine, the sandalwood seems to be the strongest scent (backed by a peppery lavender), so instead of sensuality, I&#x27;m reminded of homeopathic medicines, masculinity, or an old sophistication. That, or I just smelled sandalwood too much in my childhood for it to have any sex appeal for me. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, necessarily--I might blend it with vanilla, or use it for an air freshener in my car (which it might be perfect for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/12/14: why is it that the most unpleasant scents often have the most staying power? Even when blended, the sandalwood/lavender still manages to crawl its way to the top, so all I smell is this, for a very long time. I haven&#x27;t been able to acclimate myself to the smell yet. I probably should&#x27;ve read the bottle more carefully as none of the components are supposed to be &#x27;sweet&#x27; smelling. Still, \\&quot;Sensual\\&quot; and \\&quot;Aphrodisiac\\&quot;... quite a stretch, except for a few niche fetishes.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t real impressed, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It smells so great. I put a few drops in a warmer and let it permeate my whole bedroom. Its a super nice fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is even nicer than a more expensive version I have bought!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells! I&#x27;ve ordered 2 other oils from this company and have been very impressed with the quality in comparison to Young Living. I love how affordable they are as well!</li>
            <li> The product itself is very very nice.  The problem I had was with the smell of the product.  It was not a very pleasant smell but after reading the blend of oils I thought it would be pleasant.  But I was wrong.  It smells like something that had been sitting on my grandmothers shelf for too many years and was rancid.  It will definately not stop me from trying another scent though.  This one just made me gag.  But don&#x27;t let this stop you from trying one of their products because the service is awesome and the product itself was packaged nicely and the oil feels silky and devine.  It was just the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> Great product. Though it has a stronger earthy smell than I expected, but I suppose the patchouli will do that.</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is really exotic and tranquil. It&#x27;s not too overbearing and has a slightly spicy under tone. I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice now and my customers love this as an addition to their body creams.</li>
            <li> Love this smell and the energy that comes with it!</li>
            <li> This essential oil was just what I needed for the product I wanted to make. The strength of scent was perfect and the quality of the product was excellent. Thank you</li>
            <li> I would not buy again. I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it.  Not much of a smell at all.  Also doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> Not really liking this oil, I was expecting to have at least a little bit of results but no such luck</li>
            <li> This smells awful to me, I like woodsy but this is very woodsy manly but is a sour way.  I was disappointed</li>
            <li> This smells like someone&#x27;s underarms, it might be somebody&#x27;s idea of &#x27;sensual&#x27; aphrodisiac, but I&#x27;m not from this school of scent. And to think I bought 2 (TWO) of them.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, nothing sensual about it.  I can&#x27;t imagine for whom this scent would be an aphrodisiac.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it was an aphrodisiac. Could have been mixed too strong. Used whole bottle with 16 oz coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the main purpose of this lovely scent is going to be yet, but so far I have mixed it with some coconut oil and sea salt to use as a body scrub, I have added a few drops to my laundry and I leave the bottle on my night stand so I get nice whiffs every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To describe the scent, I would say it is:&lt;br /&gt;Woodsy&lt;br /&gt;Earthy&lt;br /&gt;Lightly Floral&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, very lovely. I think the ylang ylang, lavender and sandlewood notes come out the strongest.</li>
            <li> This oil blend is really well made. It smells strong and pure but not at all overwhelming. I add a few drops to my warm bath for a relaxing and sensual experience.</li>
            <li> WAY to much Patchouli.  I have tried diffusing it a few different ways and even one drop just has way to much.  Not only that after using 1 drop in my cool mist diffuser and it doesn&#x27;t matter what I diffuse I can not get rid of all of the Patchouli smell :(.  Smells like one of the ladies that is always at the bus stop and not sensual, lol.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000B1TG7Q JASMINE ABSOLUTE &amp; JOJOBA OIL]]It wasn&#x27;t what I expected but the products will make a great home use for freshening up the air&lt;br /&gt;in the house. I have a problem with scented products of all types, however since essential oils&lt;br /&gt;are made from organics and not petro chemicals I am able to use these three oils and will be buying&lt;br /&gt;more in the future. This review is for all three oils that I ordered, therefore I am not going to give&lt;br /&gt;separate reviews for each.. I feel the same way about all three.</li>
            <li> Great item as decribed.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this oil straight from the bottle, when I put about 5 drops with water in my oil burner it had a very nice smell that permeated the room.  I like the blend of these particular oil fragrances.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the scent and gave it to my daughter. She said that it was probably the Jasmine in it that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven, very sensual...floral, woodsy, all in all a deep aroma. I would advise a drop or 2 in a carrier base, even lotion works, to avoid overkill. I also use it in the oils I use on my scalp, but only a drop. It&#x27;s really strong &amp; not everyone has the same aromatherapy reaction. Finally, I sometimes mix a drop with with a drop or 2 of Kiehl&#x27;s Musk oil. Folks are always asking me for the name of my perfume!</li>
            <li> Smells horrid!  Perhaps I got a spoiled one...???</li>
            <li> Smells great!!! Wonderful room deodorizer!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this stuff does not smell great.</li>
            <li> I used this oil to make an air freshener in my car and to add to candles. You do not have to add much because it is very strong (a little goes a long way), but the smell is wonderful! Everyone who road in my car asked where I got my air freshener!</li>
            <li> Cheap oil makes horrible blends. Whoever mixied this formula does not know what they are doing and should get another job...</li>
            <li> These oils are high quality, I can tell that they&#x27;re made with good essential oils.  The top notes are a little strong, but don&#x27;t let that deter you as they are only top notes,  the middle and bottom notes do come out over time.  They blend well with lotions and grapeseed oil for skin, and burn well in an oil burner as well.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. Love it! Has a wonderful blend of all of the oils to create a personal experience.</li>
            <li> This same blend that I bought from a different maker didn&#x27;t seem to be as long lasting.  It is true that higher notes fade faster than the deeper, musky scents but that is true with most oils as I understand. I have found the scent to be relaxing, promoting a feeling of physical safety and wellbeing.  This brand was nearly twice as expensive as the other maker but lasted twice as long.  I am rather new to aromatherapy and so I have a lot to learn. It seems that all of the relaxation/calming/stress relieving blends contain patchuli which overpowers the lighter scents.  What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> so much easier than mixing all these essences myself. i&#x27;m tired of department store fragrances, so i ventured into the world of essences. so much more grounding!</li>
            <li> The blend isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call sensual.  I&#x27;ll pick up some others and see what works best.  I now add lavendar to this to make it more &#x27;palletable&#x27; to my tastes.  It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s a decent oil, thus the 4 stars.  I&#x27;m not a Patchouli fan, and it&#x27;s either that or the ylang ylang that&#x27;s giving me pause.  Something I&#x27;m not accustomed to seems to dominate the blend.</li>
            <li> The smell was strong and unpleasant. I bought it to use as an air freshener and my husband asked me not to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this and it works great.  I had read it was a musky smell and so I was a bit nervous about it but the fragrance is not all that musky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which scent part I didn&#x27;t care for but this was very much not my thing.  My spouse didn&#x27;t like it either.  It had a musk like scent so if your not a fan of musk this won&#x27;t be for you.  Its a shame because I loved their Germ Fighter.  In fact I will buy that one again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s a perfect blend and still has a patchouli undertone that lasts all day. You only need a few drops but experienced noses can still pick out the scent at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little odd smelling at first. After a few minutes it settles into a really nice scent. I have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Thats right, old lady came to mind when I opened the bottle, Im not an old lady yet.... so someday I might get back around to attempt using this. Still not what i wanted even when I diluted it in the very neutral scented or no scent grapeseed oil. I was going to put it in my homemade moisturizers with beeswax coconut oil and grapeseed. One star for the smell but I&#x27;m sure the quality of the oil is great, it looks like a good brand although I have never bought any others.</li>
            <li> didnt like the product smell  not so good, im going to use for add to cleaning products but not on my skin</li>
            <li> Smells great, lots of &#x27;orange&#x27; but the scent doesn&#x27;t last.  I mix several drops into body lotion after shower - mixes well &amp; it feels great on my skin.  I don&#x27;t know why the scent doesn&#x27;t last - thought oils were supposed to hold scent the best.  I&#x27;ve bought several oils (this brand) and they all fade quickly.  I think the price is very reasonable, just wish the scent would last longer than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> great EO for the price!</li>
            <li> The product smell is not what I was looking for. More then sensual reminds me of soap. The scent does not stay on for very long, and is kind of watery versus oily. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The best and strongest scent in comparison to dozens of others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Fills the room with a pleasant, relaxing scent.  I would highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> This item was a very nice blend of oils. I&#x27;m using it in a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping. This is a seller I recommend and a product that I recommend as well.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great. I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it, but it came with a kit of 14 various oil. thought I&#x27;d put some on just for the heck of it. My husband LOVED it. I like it too.</li>
            <li> The combination of oils helps to relax you. My husband and I put a few drops on our pillows before bed.</li>
            <li> It is well marked and has a very nice essence.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I felt the lavender note was too strong and was  hoping to find more ylang ylang, patchouli and maybe neroli instead of orange.&lt;br /&gt;it mixes well with coconut oil but the softer, sweeter notes do not persist</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t purchase products like this to wear or diffuse in my home. My use may be thought of as wasteful or ridiculous, but so be it I still get to enjoy it. I have been using essential oils for years now to perfume the inside of my cars. There are no better air fresheners that you can buy, The auto air fresheners available all smell so fake, or they are so \\&quot;bright\\&quot; that they are actually oppressive. This way I can choose what I want my interior to smell like. The two ways that I use it are either in a heated blotter diffuser that plugs into my cigarette lighter, or I&#x27;ll use a natural diffuser like a piece of terracotta, (a shard of a broken flower pot)thrown under a seat or the rear floor. As you can guess, the heated unit for winter, and the natural diffuser for the summer months. I live in Vermont. I wasn&#x27;t sure that I was going to like this blend, but it has revealed itself to be perfect in this application.</li>
            <li> Received this product extremely fast. (Always a bonus)  The aroma of the oil is pleasant, but the blends seem to all resemble each other to me.  I also bought the \\&quot;Germ Fighting\\&quot; blend and the \\&quot;Breathe Easy\\&quot; blend.  I have a hard time telling the difference between the three just by smelling them.  (I should note that I have several different oils that are not blends, and those are very easy to tell by their smell. )That being said, I haven&#x27;t yet discovered a great way to put them to use, as I am new on the Essential Oil Scene and still doing a lot of reading.  My family doctors with a Chinese doctor and have seen the amazing benefits of the ancient wisdom.  The Chinese have used essential oils all throughout history, so I have great hopes of these working when used correctly.</li>
            <li> At first the lavender smells too heavy but after heating this oil or rubbing it on the skin, the other scents emerge and it is indeed a complex sensual smell. The right blend of floral and spicy for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really particular about how my house smells.  There are only 2 kinds of candles i will burn...n Yankee isn&#x27;t one of them. This makes my house smell wonderful!  I add a drop or two into my candles as they burn or a drop to my lamp bulbsand house smells really warm and relaxing and. ...inviting.  if it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac i can&#x27;t tell.  We&#x27;re good in that department.</li>
            <li> This scent makes my day. I love to use it in my diffuser when I&#x27;m cleaning.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and loved the blend of this oil! Not over powering and blends well with grapeseed oil base for massage.</li>
            <li> Though its pure I liked the scent but again these small bottles don&#x27;t last long for the price. Dilute it if you must but produce larger bottles please. I use oils daily and the cost does become a factor after a few months.</li>
            <li> The product does smell great, but I have never smelt it from another brand so I can&#x27;t say if it is the correct scent or not. It is a unisex scent, my boyfriend likes to wear it sometimes. I found it made my skin itchy even when mixed with a lot of carrier oil, so I only use it in my hair now and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments when wearing just a few drops of this amazing scent! Will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> It is hard to put a smell in words for me, but this stuff has a bit of a floral scent, a bit woody, but it&#x27;s all good.  It is a strong scent and lingers for a long while, I used a bit too much the first time not knowing it was that strong and had to turn the fan on in my window.  I am not sure about the actually aphrodisiac effects, but my girlfriend seems to enjoy the smell, as do I.  Very nice for just relaxing, reading, talking... I like that this company mixes the oils for me in a ready to use product, many of their blends seem to have good synergy from what I have seen, if not all of them.</li>
            <li> I choose this oil because I trust this brand to be true to description. I love all essential oils, and buy according to need.</li>
            <li> This has an awesome scent perfect for male or female.  I am using it as a perfume and also in my oil warmer for my home.  The packaging was great, in a sealed bubble wrap pack and surrounded by the little bags of air in a box.  My only complaint was that it was sent by lazer ship and if i had not signed up for text alerts thru amazon for my packages I would not have known it was in my apartment complex&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> High quality, natural smelling. Beautiful scent. I have more of this brand and love them. They do not smell fake, or artificial, or have a chemical smell like some do.</li>
            <li> Love the way this synergy smells. I have only used it in my diffuser, so far, and it adds a nice pleasing aroma to the room. I catch slight hints of each EO in the blend on occasion. It is not too strong or too weak; a great blend of sweet and earthy notes. I also noticed, everyone in my household was much more calm and we all had a pleasant disposition about us...nothing sexual (I have to say this because it says it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac). I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> If Ron Burgandy had a cologne, this would definitely be in there. I was surprised by how woodsy this oil turned out to be. This stuff is so potent that you really don&#x27;t need more than 2 drops.</li>
            <li> Great company, great customer service, too! I have ordered several oils from PTEO and they  are high quality, &amp; pure oil. This one is as lovely as it gets with quality essential oil ingredients- hence no overpowering scents. Love wearing it.</li>
            <li> I thought the blend would really smell great, but it turned out that the patchouli is really overwhelming and I can&#x27;t focus on any of the other notes like the orange, lavender or sandalwood. My husband doesn&#x27;t like it either, he says it smells like licorice.  The scent is strong, and it seems like a good quality oil, just not our taste.  I will try to find someone I know who enjoys patchouli and give it to them.</li>
            <li> I have just started using essential oils to add fragrance to some of my Do-it-myself homemade products.  I found that this essential oil blend is exactly the fragrance I wanted for my home-made body lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like be able to purchase my oils for a reasonable price. It&#x27;s a good place to look. Thanks</li>
            <li> Upon first opening this oil I thought the smell was strong and manly. However once I diffused it, it gave my room a great unique smell. Not to overpowering..I&#x27;m in love! I diffuse it everyday in our home.</li>
            <li> I wish you could sample the smells of these online.  You will either love or hate this one.  It is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really like Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  You get a good value/amount of oil here.  And the quality seems right up there with the other major/pricier brands.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> this is my first time with the oils i love this. perfectly calming and that says alot with construction going on outside. beutiful fragrance. highly recommended. definately going to order more</li>
            <li> I put this oil in my burner, and seconds after smelling it blew out the candle.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was just awful. It smelled like the inside of a moldy VW bus.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that for two weeks I have been trying to air out my apartment and the smell just won&#x27;t go away!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the apartment cleaned professionally, I&#x27;ve kept the windows open, I&#x27;ve tried everything, and the smell remains...</li>
            <li> Sorry. Probably it&#x27;s a personal thing but this did not appeal to me. How could it be an aphrodisiac if it stinks? Decided if I wanted to &amp;#34;perk up&amp;#34; I would just use my citrus oils which are much more pleasing scents. Maybe it was just me.</li>
            <li> I am skeptical to buy the mixed essential oils because its hard to know if I will like them before buying them. But they mixture in this one has smells I like, so I figured I&#x27;d like it. Pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t all that fantastic.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> The brand is not pure. This gave me a terrible headache and heartburn.</li>
            <li> I have used Ylang ylang oils for massages but never in a candle warmer.  This was my first experience and I was very pleased with it.  Only two drops in water and the aroma was strong and wonderful.  I think I will be using this all the time.</li>
            <li> Very strong sense. A little bit medicine smell. However still giving it a try. Nice thing is when you get a massage with it seems to heat up your body temperature which is nice. Will buy again but will try something else first to see if less medicine smell and see what&#x27;s out there in this field.</li>
            <li> Okay scent. Not what I seek for personal use. I like my scents stronger.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy, they have quality oils, deliver fast and accurately. I&#x27;ve bought several things from them and been happy. However, this stuff did not do it for me. In the oil warmer at first it smelled very pleasant, but the sweet orange or something quickly burned away and the resulting odor was nauseating. It did not seem \\&quot;sensual\\&quot; to me at all.</li>
            <li> the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as I anticipated it would</li>
            <li> I thought the balance of scents was nice and well rounded. No scent over power the other. The item was well packed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Sensual Synergy Aphrodisiac Essential Oil WAS USED TO CREATE A NEW FRAGRANCE FOR CANDLES AND FOR AIR FRESHENERS; THUS FAR THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN POSITIVE</li>
            <li> I was searching for a fragrance oil for my oil warmer and I really like this one. It has a strong scent, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even like the way this smells. Not for me. I like other oils I have gotten from this company so far.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, but my husband doesn&#x27;t :(  Good product, good oil</li>
            <li> This oil has the most wonderful smell.  I can really pick out each of the different oils in this beautiful blend.  We make our own laundry liquid and wanted a different essential oil to use.  It works really well.  Our clothes have such a great aroma.  It is not feminine or masculine, but a little of both, pretty neutral.  When I first received my package, I opened up the bottle and dabbed a little on my wrists.  Wow, such a wonderful blend of aromas.  They really compliment each other.</li>
            <li> Had a wonderful scent. Although a little pricey for the size, I would buy again and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This blend contains many of my favorites, including sandalwood.  The scent is light and pleasant.  The drops come out quickly, so go slow.</li>
            <li> This is a really cool, complex, clean fragrance.  The only problem I have with it, is that the scent disappears from my skin within about two hours (at the longest).  Wish it lasted at least for a day like some soaps and shampoos do.  Other than that, I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in agreement with the others who don&#x27;t care for this scent.  I found it medicinal smelling and I really don&#x27;t like it.  I tried to give it a chance and tried it a couple of times, but I don&#x27;t want myself or my home to smell like this.  I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll use it for or if I&#x27;ll throw it away, but for aromatherapy or perfume - just no, not for me.  It&#x27;s overpoweringly floral and astringent, which I don&#x27;t like.  I can&#x27;t smell the sandalwood in it at all.  I like this company and the quality of this oil is good, as are their other oils that I&#x27;ve purchased.  However, I feel I made a mistake with this choice.</li>
            <li> I spent the whole day smelling around department stores looking for a new fragrance until I just got ill. I&#x27;m so pleased with this natural solution. Smells so yummy.</li>
            <li> I could imagine how it might smell based on the ingredients and other reviews, but I was still a little nervous to buy this essential oil blend without testing it out first.  I have to say, I still wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it after my first whiff, but it grew on me!  The sandalwood and patchouli are subtle, as I had been hoping, they really just help to balance out the floral notes in a way I find very appealing.  I ended up using this oil to make some solid perfume, if you are planning to use this oil as a perfume, I recommend diluting it with another oil in some way because otherwise I think it could be a bit overpowering.  I melted down cocoa butter with almond oil and castor oil and filled a couple empty lip balm tubes, but you could just even just add it to almond oil.  It would also make a great fragrance for home made soaps or other home made body care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed when I got it.  I could tell it was still full and it was probably just a fluke, but I still thought it was weird.</li>
            <li> This oil blend from Plant Therapy smells absolutely delicious! I have been very pleased with all products I have ever gotten from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Balanced fragrance fills the air with a lovely Lavender bouquet, will definitely purchase again. The shipper sent the product quickly after purchase and offers many other varieties which I will try.</li>
            <li> No one seem to get excited</li>
            <li> The combination of Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, Orange, and Lavender oils creates a perfect blend of fragrances. I use a few drops when I make candles for myself or for gifts to special friends. This is pure, concentrated oil. I have found no other that measures up to the quality of this blend.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the scent to be sweeter, based on my knowledge of the individual oils used in Sensual Synergy.  But all mixed together it becomes to over powering and you loos the characteristic aroma of jasmine and sandal wood ect.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent and you either like it or you don&#x27;t.  I like it, wife does not.  Guess who wins?</li>
            <li> Makes a great perfume.</li>
            <li> Was hoping I would really like this belnd, but it&#x27;s not working for me.  It reminds me of a stinky perfume neither my husband or I liked it.</li>
            <li> Horrible! All I can smell is a funky orange. Maybe it will smell better diluted in the bath?!?</li>
            <li> Musky, woody, scent... perfect to relax to at the end of a long day. A friend of mine commented that it smelled like an Aveda salon when I used it in my oil warmer.</li>
            <li> Product has nice, strong scent - one doesn&#x27;t have to use very much - I use it to scent lotions I make at home.  Very nice, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I looked far and wide for a good price on a predominately ylang ylang, patchouli fragrance. My local Whole Foods had a 10ml bottle for $29.99. Ouch! This product is great. I get a warm aroma, though I find the \\&quot;Aphrodisiac\\&quot; label quite a stretch. By now, science has proven that the only reliable aphrodisiac is a picture of a short, white, bald guy with glasses named \\&quot;Ben\\&quot; and the number \\&quot;100\\&quot; in the corners. Call me jaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t turned my wife into an insatiable nymphomaniac, but it&#x27;s a great ingredient in recipe of an atmosphere for intimacy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was close to a scent I experienced at a facial.  She told me the main ingredients were ylang ylang, sandalwood and lavender. I could tell there was some patchouli in it as well.  I was very excited when I found this.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier now that I have it.  It&#x27;s almost identical to what I had been looking for.  I use it in a burner and it is wonderful.  Long lasting and definitely relaxing.  Don&#x27;t really get the sensual part of it, but definitely calming for me.  I even put a dash on my wrist so I could enjoy out of the house.  I found that when I did it a second time I put too much on and it changed the scent and I didn&#x27;t like it. I will keep it for the house.  It smells lovely in here! I&#x27;ve been basically burning it nonstop in the 3 days since it arrived.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> Worth the money, long lasting and will buy product again. Good purchase. Buy and be satisfied. Happy returns. Two words</li>
            <li> This is ok, the scent wasn&#x27;t something I would buy again.But others might love it.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t care for this scent. I bought it to use to make perfume because the bless of pulls sounded like they would smell nice but the patchouli was overwhelming. I gave it to a friend who loves patchouli. The fragrance was strong, delivery was quick and the packaging was nice. My dislike was just personal preference.</li>
            <li> Just personal preference I&#x27;m not a big fan of this scent. I prefer the sweet fruity scents like orange. This had a more medicine smell to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this blend to use in diffuser and it is wonderful.  Very small amount needed and scent lasts for days.  I am also using as a personal fragrance (one drop to body lotion) and in small fragrance atomizer diluted with distilled water.  Long lasting and huge amount of compliments.  Highly recommend this product and I will be purchasing more from this seller.</li>
