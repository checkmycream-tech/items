            <li>Love this light summer scent.  </li>
            <li>light &amp; easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a FRESH non musky scent, not like flowers, more like after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Love this light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Love the mild fresh clean smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh not to strong smell</li>
            <li>I love the Heart scent, but this perfume stick does not have much staying power.  </li>
            <li>Convenient for your purse and quick refresh.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, i love the size (about 1/3 longer and a tad bigger in diameter than a lipstick).</li>
            <li>Put it on in the morning smell fresh out of the shower all day.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is pretty.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and light.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really pretty and lasts.</li>
            <li>its okay, not the same scent???</li>
            <li>A pretty intense scent.</li>
            <li>The solid stick will be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t care for perfume much, so thats a positive for this one.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that I&#x27;d like this perfume, but...  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve really got to like the smell of flowers.</li>
            <li>Very overpowering.</li>
            <li>very convenient when I don&#x27;y check in my luggage</li>
            <li>Smells very citrusy on me.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have pointed out, this would probably be most well suited for travel</li>
            <li>smells really nice but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>but I risked it and was so DELIGHTED I went and later ordered the actual bottled same smelling &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; perfume.  </li>
            <li>The Heart Solid Perfume stick smells good, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers - nice smell but does not last.</li>
            <li>I take this with me when I travel which is quite frequent, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different but this is a sweet scent on me but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like to carry a large bottle that might break or open.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll probably go with the regular perfume, which seems to last a little better.  </li>
            <li>It really let me down.  </li>

            <li> The Heart Solid Perfume stick smells good, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> light &amp; easy.  good for purse &amp; travel.  to me-- it has ample staying power.  the fragrance is pretty.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that I&#x27;d like this perfume, but...  It really let me down.  You&#x27;ve really got to like the smell of flowers. Very overpowering.</li>

            <li> I love it, has a real clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> very convenient when I don&#x27;y check in my luggage</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s risky business buying perfume over the internet you can&#x27;t smell but I risked it and was so DELIGHTED I went and later ordered the actual bottled same smelling &amp;#34;Heart&amp;#34; perfume.  I love it when I workout because even when I applied it in the morning as I heat up and sweat in my afternoon workout the fragrance reignites and smells fresh and wonderful.  It&#x27;s a FRESH non musky scent, not like flowers, more like after a shower.  So if you want to smell fresh and energetic and the scent return when you need it most, go ahead and order it!</li>
            <li> I love the Heart scent, but this perfume stick does not have much staying power.  Next time I&#x27;ll probably go with the regular perfume, which seems to last a little better.  The other downside to this perfume stick--I rubbed some on my neck and it ended up wearing off on my hair and made my hair a little oily on the underside.  A minor thing, but a little annoying because this stick leaves a residue on your skin.  Like other reviewers have pointed out, this would probably be most well suited for travel so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a liquid bottle.</li>
            <li> Perfect to carry in a purse.  Don&#x27;t like to carry a large bottle that might break or open.  That&#x27;s what I like about this size.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for 20 years now and I still get compliments everyday .. It has a clean fresh not to strong smell</li>
            <li> Like it. Aroma very subtle. I like the idea of a solid stick perfume. It&#x27;s handy to throw in your purse for retouches throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this perfume bar. I love the smell, i love the size (about 1/3 longer and a tad bigger in diameter than a lipstick). Very happy. Like one reviewer said, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a splash or spray but that is not a big thing to me. I keep one in my purse and just touch up once in awhile. Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Heart is my favorite scent. It is so soft and light. Every time I wear it I get complements. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this light summer scent.  Put it on in the morning smell fresh out of the shower all day.  I am in love!</li>
            <li> Okay love the citrus smell!</li>
            <li> I take this with me when I travel which is quite frequent, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different but this is a sweet scent on me but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this light, fresh scent. Only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t last long enough. Hubby likes it too. He doesn&#x27;t care for perfume much, so thats a positive for this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not too crazy about the smell. Smells very citrusy on me.</li>
            <li> Love the mild fresh clean smell.  Always get compliments when I wear it. The solid stick will be easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and safe to take traveling.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, but convenient. A pretty intense scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted a solid perfume for travel (no danger of spills). The fragrance is really pretty and lasts. It does \\&quot;turn\\&quot; a bit after wearing for a while but many perfumes do this. Still getting used to the oily feeling, though...</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of soap or laundry detergent, then you&#x27;ll love this product.  I&#x27;m not sure why anyone likes the smell of this.</li>
            <li> This smells good and will not spill, love it!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers - nice smell but does not last.</li>
            <li> its okay, not the same scent???</li>
            <li> smelled nice. My dog ate it, so I will have to rebuy it.</li>
            <li> Love it. I think this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I love this scent and having this to travel with is excellent!  Nice size, compact and stable for travel. Will buy again!</li>
