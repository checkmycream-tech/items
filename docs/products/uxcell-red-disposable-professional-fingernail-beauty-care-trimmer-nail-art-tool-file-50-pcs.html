            <li>and they do a great job keeping my nails looking good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also a good size to stick in your pocket/purse for nail emergencies, but I use them at my craft table.  </li>

            <li>As an Independent Jamberry Nails consultant, I thought these would be perfect for handing out with nail wrap samples.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these more than once and will order again.</li>
            <li>Pretty good deal for all these files.</li>

            <li>Love this product because you get your money&#x27;s worth and</li>
            <li>I do nails for a lot of friends, so these are great, they can only be used once, but that&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li>One nail file is good enough for about 3 full Jamberry nail wrap applications.  </li>

            <li>These are minI - as described,  but they are easy too small to handle a full out filing of all nails.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for mailing, they are about 2.5 inches long in length, so small but not too small, and a good firm material not  flimsy papaer.</li>
            <li>They appear to be slightly thinner than standard emery boards, so a bit more flexible, but not like the ones that clearly state flexible.  </li>
            <li>They are nice in size, however extremely thin.  </li>
            <li>Strong enough to file down excesses wraps, but not a very high grit.  </li>

            <li> Too small, waste of money.</li>
            <li> for this price it is okay</li>
            <li> As an Independent Jamberry Nails consultant, I thought these would be perfect for handing out with nail wrap samples.  They are nice in size, however extremely thin.  Strong enough to file down excesses wraps, but not a very high grit.  One nail file is good enough for about 3 full Jamberry nail wrap applications.  Took 3-4 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but they still work well</li>
            <li> My mistake Ichose wrong</li>
            <li> These little wonders are the perfect size for smoothing the edges of my polymer clay pieces.  One side is a finer grit than the other, so I get two levels of sanding done with one small file.  They&#x27;re also a good size to stick in your pocket/purse for nail emergencies, but I use them at my craft table.  They appear to be slightly thinner than standard emery boards, so a bit more flexible, but not like the ones that clearly state flexible.  Because I use them on small pieces, they work very well.  And each one will work for several clay pieces for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product because you get your money&#x27;s worth and it&#x27;s just the right size to hand out at parties.  They work great and are easy to carry. unlike the long ones. I need them for hand outs for nail wraps and can&#x27;t pay much for them. I have ordered these more than once and will order again.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of these because they fit in my purse and they do a great job keeping my nails looking good. Also, they are very reasonable for the amount.</li>
            <li> Came just as pictured. Pretty good deal for all these files. I plan on using them added to give-aways at nail parties.</li>
            <li> I like the size because I wanted small but they are the thin cardboard which I was not really happy about. I thought they would be a bit thicker than what they are.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for what I needed! As a Independent Jamberry consultant I needed the files I give away with samples, to be small enough to mail without adding to shipping cost. But also affordable without being low quality.......... These met all of my expectations!! They are perfect for mailing, they are about 2.5 inches long in length, so small but not too small, and a good firm material not  flimsy papaer. the two side have slightly different grits as a bonus.</li>
            <li> These are tiny so you can take them anywhere; they also file really well</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re alot smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> worked great for a jamberry party</li>
            <li> These were much smaller than I had initially thought they would be, but they are a nice quality, they get the job done and fit in my purse etc well.  I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shorter than the normal ones you usually buy - about 4 inches vs 6 inches. But they&#x27;re also supposed to be disposable after each use, which is probably why. But they work well.</li>
            <li> I do nails for a lot of friends, so these are great, they can only be used once, but that&#x27;s not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> These are minI - as described,  but they are easy too small to handle a full out filing of all nails.  May go through four for all ten fingers. Shipping was very slow and highly disappointed that I was not informed of shipping speed until after purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and they work great!</li>
