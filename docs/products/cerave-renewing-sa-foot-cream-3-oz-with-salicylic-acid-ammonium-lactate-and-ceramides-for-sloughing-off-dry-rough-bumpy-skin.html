            <li>Maybe if more people call them they will change their mind.</li>
            <li>This product soothes and does do a good job of keeping calluses at bay, mainly because of the salycitic acid, but it is also very emollient and feels very good.</li>

            <li>It seems a little on the pricey side, but it certainly does work well</li>

            <li> Great cream! This works wonders for deep cracks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. I still notice my heels are dry even applying right after shower. They aren&#x27;t as dry, but still somewhat dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works on my husband&#x27;s feet , he is very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Without going into a lot of detail, I have experience with skincare as an RN/aesthetician.  And every once in awhile, I come across a product meant for one thing but find it works well for another use.  This is one of those products.  I have used CeraVe hydrating cleanser preferring it to another big name seller.  This winter, so far, my skin has been like sandpaper.  My usual regimen just wasn&#x27;t working, and I was getting frustrated.  After all, people look to me for great skin.  It&#x27;s been my trademark all my life. I originally bought this for my dry dry dry feet but thought, what the heck, I&#x27;m trying this on my face.  OMG!!! One night made all the difference!  I woke up to baby-bottom smooth skin all over my face, neck, and decollette!  I cannot say enough about this discovery!  My skin glows like it is supposed to even In this harsh dry, cold climate.  If you purchase this rich cream you may find it good for more than just your feet.  I am going to buy more of this SA in the biggest container I can find and recommend it to everyone I see.  I wish you could see just how pretty my skin looks without makeup, and my cuticles from hell are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> recommended for REAL by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> great for feet and elbows.  Gets rid of dry, flaky skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> My feet were transformed from rough to soft and smooth in just days.  Before going to bed I applied the CeraVe foot cream and socks. The results bordered on the miraculous!</li>
            <li> I have many allergies and all of CeraVe&#x27;s products work well, including this one.  None of them are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Works wonders !!! I have tried so many foot creams in the past and this one is the BEST by far !!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Within a week I could see a huge difference in my feet.  I wish I would have seen this earlier but they don&#x27;t sell it in any stores around me!</li>
            <li> I finished the tube but didn&#x27;t see any improvement that I didn&#x27;t see using the other CeraVe Renewing lotions.</li>
            <li> After one use I noticed a huge difference</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery. I love the product, Best for dry feet.. It rejuvenates and hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!!!  Overnight miracle creame.  I will use forever.  Price is average, arrived quickly.  Will purchase w/o hesitation.</li>
            <li> I currently use the skin regimen from CeraVe for my face and love it.  I decided to try the foot cream based on my experience with the other products.  I was very surprised from the results.  This is a great product!  It does not have an odor and it immediately softens the rough skin on my feet.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Cerave foot cream on my feet for about 2 weeks now. The results have been wonderful. My feet/ heels are softer than they have been in many years. I have tried other products over the years and nothing else has ever come close.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the company allowed the sale of this in stores instead of having to go through a podiatrist or finding it on amazon for sometimes outrages prices. Maybe if more people call them they will change their mind.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by doctors</li>
            <li> Rwcommended by my Dermatologist and really helped my rough, dry heel</li>
            <li> These products are great!</li>
            <li> I am on my third tube and do not see nearly as much results on my feet as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> Helpful, not very special but ok.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet soft and reduces the dry scale that feet so often get.  Also helps keep down cuticle build up on nail bed. Even my pedicurist commented on my soft feet and lack of cuticle last time I went.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible!  I tried numerous creams including Lamisal, but none did the trick.  You will be amazed at how quickly your heel will be softened.  Highly recommended.  Also, Amazon is the only Web site that sells this cream.  Very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I ever used but way too expensive for 3 oz.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my foot doctor.  I have extremely dry feet with calluses and have tried many products.  This product soothes and does do a good job of keeping calluses at bay, mainly because of the salycitic acid, but it is also very emollient and feels very good.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my podiatrist.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product and will certainly reorder when my current cream gets down low.</li>
            <li> It seems a little on the pricey side, but it certainly does work well and I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult to find in stores.  They have all the other CeraVe products, but the foot cream doesn&#x27;t seem to be among them.</li>
