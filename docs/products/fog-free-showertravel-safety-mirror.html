            <li>As someone who travels 90% of the time, and shaves their head, this product is great.  </li>
            <li>It can be used in a tiled shower as well, just procure a suction cup hook to hang it from.&lt;br /&gt;Nearly indestructible plastic &amp; great mirror in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are inclined to shave in shower, this is great.</li>
            <li>and since I never had a great place to hook it in our shower.</li>

            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>The hanging feature is very handy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become adept to finding the perfect spot on hotel shower heads to hang the mirror from to give a good reflection angle.  </li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Good if you don&#x27;t need a precision mirror in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, happy to be able to shave in the shower even when I travel now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BE SURE TO PEEL THE PROTECTIVE FILM OFF THE MIRROR BEFORE USE!  </li>
            <li>amazing product.</li>
            <li>The built in hanger works well over my shower head and when not in use, also hangs nicely on our shower rod tucked out of the way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits in my luggage nicely.  </li>
            <li>It hangs nicely on hook, or shower head or door knob.  </li>
            <li>mirror hangs nicely from the shower head and its durability gives me no worries that it would ever break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, hangs on shower head perfect, has hole for razor, and appears unbreakable under normal conditions.  </li>
            <li>it collects fog very easily</li>
            <li>This mirror is lightweight, to me is \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; (perfect for travel pack), easy to hold, and hangs in the shower ready for use.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself in it any better than looking into the tile on the shower wall.</li>
            <li>It works well for that, and is safe for her to play with elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Holding the mirror allows for a better view of the area being shaved.  </li>
            <li>I love how it hangs in the shower and holds my razor but as a mirror it leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Bonus points for being able to hang it on shower</li>
            <li>Is it better than not having a mirror in the shower?  </li>
            <li>I thought it might be too big, but it is perfect for shaving in the show.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped this many times and not a scratch on it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>man I enjoy shaving in the shower...  time saver, so much better than over the sink, refreshing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to shave 5 times or so on a recent trip, and it fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>She was pretty nice while it lasted, maybe a year at most, then it eventually became cloudy and wasn&#x27;t as reflective as I would have liked or as it originally was.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a nice, handy mirror for the shower.</li>
            <li>I treat it with a Rain-X typeproduct (Note: I don&#x27;t think you can use Rain-X on plastic, so make sure yours will not damage it) and that significantly increases my shaving pleasure.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for easy return.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy since you can \\&quot;uninstall\\</li>
            <li>&quot; it so easily.</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>but I figure it would be easy to carry it in a suitcase without the risk of breakage.</li>
            <li>Good price for a decent product.  </li>
            <li>then it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to hang anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Works great and has made shaving in the shower easy and possible.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and works fine.</li>
            <li>This little mirror works great!  </li>
            <li>I put plastic wrap around the can and secure it with rubber bands</li>
            <li>It is not fog free, but just stick it under the water and you&#x27;ll have fog free use for a bit.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively cheap option then this might work well for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Great for it not being fragile.  </li>
            <li>I got this for a disabled person who needed to see the bottom of his feet, it worked perfect.  </li>
            <li>It is fog free.  </li>
            <li>Just a cheap plastic item, my husband threw away after a month use.</li>
            <li>fog free, it does get foggy</li>
            <li>Clears easily with a quick spray of water.  </li>
            <li>If you like things that do exactly what they are supposed to, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>The original didn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>Once the film is peeled off, the mirror is nice and clear.  </li>
            <li>keep it truly fog free (and not impossibly dirty)</li>
            <li>Way cool mirror.  </li>
            <li>The mirror DOES steam up, but a quick rinse with the water</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the fog-free effect like my home mirror, but a quick rinse in a hotel shower fixes the fog issue for a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give a quick update on things.</li>
            <li>mirror is large and enables easy viewing of my face to shower with.  </li>
            <li>I really love how light it is and because it isn&#x27;t permanently attached to anything I can hold it in my hand and use it to get a better view or see other angles.</li>
            <li>Defogging is fast and easy: just run it under the water you&#x27;re already standing in.</li>
            <li>rinse and ready to roll!!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s easy to defog in a second -- put a little soap on it and wash it off, and the mirror stays fog-free for 5-10 minutes, which is perfect for my shave.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve only been to one hotel where the shower head wasn&#x27;t able to hold the mirror at a good enough angle to use.  </li>
            <li>and it defogs simply by putting it under the warm water of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I just kept leaning it against the wall of a built-in shelf in the shower until one day it fell from there, right onto my foot, leaving me with a nice deep puncture wound from which blood spurted like a geyser.  </li>
            <li>Handy storage and helps it dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Nothing has really changed from the original review.  </li>
            <li>better if you leave the door/window open and shave right away.</li>
            <li>This mirror is very light weight, which could initially make you question its quality, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li>so you definitely see more of your reflection.    </li>
            <li>Being a male who shaves his face and head in the shower, a good mirror is essential.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very lightweight and seems fairly sturdy given that I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times.</li>
            <li>I got him this for use at my house and he liked it so much he ditched his old one and takes it back &amp; forth from his place to mine.</li>
            <li>Clean, clear reflection and very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>It stays clear and is super lightweight.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s fairly large</li>
            <li>This is a simple, plastic mirror that hooks just fine onto our soap/shampoo rack.</li>
            <li>it is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought this because of the hook - I lived in an apartment where suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick well on the bathtub walls - and I was looking for something fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable, works as expected and makes shaving waaaay more</li>
            <li>I really like not having glass in the shower.  </li>
            <li>, I save so much time as I shave while taking a shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for over 4 months now, and it has saved me so much time and aggravation when shaving.</li>
            <li>The shower head hook and hole for hanging a razor are both really convenient too.</li>
            <li>Light weight, nice size, compact enough to pack in a suitcase if needed, or for kids to use, but big enough for adult use as well.  </li>
            <li>( I know it was in the luggage ), but it&#x27;s cheap enough and worthy enough to purchase another.</li>
            <li>Also I am on a well and it picked up some of the white calcium we have out here, and it wiped clean.  </li>
            <li>It is not merely foil laminated to clear plastic, but appears to be a quality product.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband to replace an older Z&#x27;ladro</li>
            <li>I hold no ill will against the mirror as it was my own fault and continue to use it to this day, although I did just secretly order new, smaller, fog free mirror and will throw this one to the curb, but let&#x27;s just keep that between you and me.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work really well for him so far!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have a couple more comments, after using this for a little over a week.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy too install (just hang it on the shower head or any other place you&#x27;d like).</li>
            <li>You can slide the \\&quot;hook\\&quot; down the shower head too in order to help get the best angle for use (tilts the mirror forward and back, but there is no \\&quot;up\\&quot; range past perpendicular to eyesight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In today&#x27;s media market, it is not hard to post a correct photo or show variations of a product.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m going to go order another one right now as a back up and for traveling.</li>
            <li>It keeps it in like new condition.</li>
            <li>and I think in the wide open dormitory bathrooms it should be ok</li>
            <li>and this is the first item going back.  </li>
            <li>Provided that you follow the instructions (run hot water through the front and back of the mirror for 3 seconds)</li>
            <li>One minor nit is that  new shower head angles slightly downward, and the mirror will slide off more often, thus how I&#x27;ve dropped it.  </li>
            <li>Not even a clear mirror.  </li>
            <li>Just run water on it to clear fog.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fog, but you&#x27;ll need to wipe the water drops off to see clearly.</li>
            <li>There are no scratches on the mirror so far.</li>
            <li>This product fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It hangs on all the shower heads I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised at what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li>It does not scratch (so far) or break.  </li>
            <li>, I can stuff it in my suitcase with minimal concern that it will break and become a nightmare to clean up, and I can see the back of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love things that function perfectly and have no unnecessary and stupid, expensive frills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is 1/4 inch deep and 3/4 inch long notch cut out along the right lower edge as it hangs.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does fog up, but since you are holding it with one hand while shaving with the other, it is simple to quickly rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It fogs up some, but a quick splash of water fixes it for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just toss it in with my shirts and slacks - no sharp edges on the mirror, so it hasn&#x27;t damaged my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most mirrors they sell for little kids are small and crappy, this one is big enough to have some fun with.</li>
            <li>This mirror is extremely light, hangs around the shower head and almost hard to break.</li>
            <li>It also helps to keep the mirror clean of soap scum.</li>
            <li>dropped countless times and it prevails with not a single scratch, let alone shatter.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they are placed too far back on counter, sometimes too high up (am not tall), sometimes just very oddly placed.  </li>

            <li> However, it&#x27;s easy to defog in a second -- put a little soap on it and wash it off, and the mirror stays fog-free for 5-10 minutes, which is perfect for my shave.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve only been to one hotel where the shower head wasn&#x27;t able to hold the mirror at a good enough angle to use.  </li>
            <li> and it defogs simply by putting it under the warm water of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I just kept leaning it against the wall of a built-in shelf in the shower until one day it fell from there, right onto my foot, leaving me with a nice deep puncture wound from which blood spurted like a geyser.  </li>
            <li> Handy storage and helps it dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Nothing has really changed from the original review.  </li>
            <li> better if you leave the door/window open and shave right away.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very light weight, which could initially make you question its quality, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> so you definitely see more of your reflection.    </li>
            <li> Being a male who shaves his face and head in the shower, a good mirror is essential.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very lightweight and seems fairly sturdy given that I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times.</li>
            <li> I got him this for use at my house and he liked it so much he ditched his old one and takes it back &amp; forth from his place to mine.</li>
            <li> Clean, clear reflection and very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> It stays clear and is super lightweight.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s fairly large</li>
            <li> This is a simple, plastic mirror that hooks just fine onto our soap/shampoo rack.</li>
            <li> it is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this because of the hook - I lived in an apartment where suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick well on the bathtub walls - and I was looking for something fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable, works as expected and makes shaving waaaay more</li>
            <li> I really like not having glass in the shower.  </li>
            <li> , I save so much time as I shave while taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for over 4 months now, and it has saved me so much time and aggravation when shaving.</li>
            <li> The shower head hook and hole for hanging a razor are both really convenient too.</li>
            <li> Light weight, nice size, compact enough to pack in a suitcase if needed, or for kids to use, but big enough for adult use as well.  </li>
            <li> ( I know it was in the luggage ), but it&#x27;s cheap enough and worthy enough to purchase another.</li>
            <li> Also I am on a well and it picked up some of the white calcium we have out here, and it wiped clean.  </li>
            <li> It is not merely foil laminated to clear plastic, but appears to be a quality product.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband to replace an older Z&#x27;ladro</li>
            <li> I hold no ill will against the mirror as it was my own fault and continue to use it to this day, although I did just secretly order new, smaller, fog free mirror and will throw this one to the curb, but let&#x27;s just keep that between you and me.</li>
            <li> This one seems to work really well for him so far!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have a couple more comments, after using this for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy too install (just hang it on the shower head or any other place you&#x27;d like).</li>
            <li> You can slide the \\&quot;hook\\&quot; down the shower head too in order to help get the best angle for use (tilts the mirror forward and back, but there is no \\&quot;up\\&quot; range past perpendicular to eyesight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s media market, it is not hard to post a correct photo or show variations of a product.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m going to go order another one right now as a back up and for traveling.</li>
            <li> It keeps it in like new condition.</li>
            <li> and I think in the wide open dormitory bathrooms it should be ok</li>
            <li> and this is the first item going back.  </li>
            <li> Provided that you follow the instructions (run hot water through the front and back of the mirror for 3 seconds)</li>
            <li> One minor nit is that  new shower head angles slightly downward, and the mirror will slide off more often, thus how I&#x27;ve dropped it.  </li>
            <li> Not even a clear mirror.  </li>
            <li> Just run water on it to clear fog.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog, but you&#x27;ll need to wipe the water drops off to see clearly.</li>
            <li> There are no scratches on the mirror so far.</li>
            <li> This product fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It hangs on all the shower heads I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised at what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li> It does not scratch (so far) or break.  </li>
            <li> , I can stuff it in my suitcase with minimal concern that it will break and become a nightmare to clean up, and I can see the back of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love things that function perfectly and have no unnecessary and stupid, expensive frills.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is 1/4 inch deep and 3/4 inch long notch cut out along the right lower edge as it hangs.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does fog up, but since you are holding it with one hand while shaving with the other, it is simple to quickly rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It fogs up some, but a quick splash of water fixes it for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just toss it in with my shirts and slacks - no sharp edges on the mirror, so it hasn&#x27;t damaged my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most mirrors they sell for little kids are small and crappy, this one is big enough to have some fun with.</li>
            <li> This mirror is extremely light, hangs around the shower head and almost hard to break.</li>
            <li> It also helps to keep the mirror clean of soap scum.</li>
            <li> dropped countless times and it prevails with not a single scratch, let alone shatter.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they are placed too far back on counter, sometimes too high up (am not tall), sometimes just very oddly placed.  </li>
            <li> (If you have a window open in the bathroom, it&#x27;s entirely possible the air will be dry enough that you won&#x27;t even have to do this.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does actually fog up and not a very clear mirror.</li>
            <li> Very durable, so far hasn&#x27;t broken or scratch.  </li>
            <li> A little rinse under the water and it is crystal clear again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just resort to the old swim goggle trick: a little bit of spit always does the trick.</li>
            <li> Overall, the setup works very well, and I&#x27;ve become addicted to in-shower shaving.</li>
            <li> I just gave it three stars because I didn&#x27;t want to use the hang on feature and it wouldn&#x27;t work with our shower head which comes down from above.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of mirrors, all either fogged up and were hard to clear, or the majority ended up broke eventually.  </li>
            <li> I have several, and use them everyday.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tossed the mirror in my belonging for several moves and have taken it for a few trips with no problem.</li>
            <li> never really truly stayed fog-free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seen some rough handling and has a few tiny scratches on it, that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li> hold it with one hand and shave with the other...  </li>
            <li> Or you can hold it in one hand while shaving with the other.</li>
            <li> However, when I received was not exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it broke off the hook end leaving a sharp corner.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to shaving in the shower, guys, you will never want to shave any other way.  </li>
            <li> and this baby just wet it down,</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t break (certainly not something you would want to have happen in a SHOWER!)</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> The reviewer who complained about the mirror being dirty may not have realized there was a plastic coating that you&#x27;re supposed to peel off to reveal the shiny and clean mirror underneath.</li>
            <li> After I used it a few times, the anti fog feature is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped this mirror a countless number of times and it&#x27;s not chipped or broken.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t rust or discolor when constantly wet.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> If you live in cold places where the mirror defogs during winter, the wait is even longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loaded it in my luggage for a trip, and unfortunately the TSA left a \\&quot;searched\\&quot; message in my luggage and the mirror was gone.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why they would have removed it</li>
            <li> This is not nearly as good looking as on picture.  </li>
            <li> There is an easy-to-remove protective film covering the mirror -- some may mistaken it for poor mirror quality.</li>
            <li> What a terrible excuse for a mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has any anti-fog technology built in, but I didn&#x27;t notice it being an annoying problem when I was using it.</li>
            <li> It does have edges which could be dangerous if this ever falls on your toe.</li>
            <li> Awful product!</li>

            <li> saves time. now I don&#x27;t have to trudge back and forth to the show. this has save me probably 10 min a day. that&#x27;s a lot of time to save! I still use shaving cream but hey that&#x27;s me. I put plastic wrap around the can and secure it with rubber bands so I don&#x27;t get the rust ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great mirror. get one. you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> it fogs in an enclosed bathroom. better if you leave the door/window open and shave right away. I bought it so my son can take it to college and I think in the wide open dormitory bathrooms it should be ok</li>
            <li> This is not nearly as good looking as on picture.  It is actually a piece of plastic with some plastic foil glued to it on one side.  Not even a clear mirror.  It also came with a piece bitten out of it on the side...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I saw this mirror in a store, wouldn&#x27;t buy it even for 99 cents.  I have been buying a lot online and this is the first item going back.  Thank you Amazon for easy return.</li>
            <li> saves hours of time over the year...  man I enjoy shaving in the shower...  time saver, so much better than over the sink, refreshing, no need to carry shaving cream...  and this baby just wet it down, hold it with one hand and shave with the other...  rinse and ready to roll!!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this shower/travel mirror.  It does the job well without any worries of breaking/cracking.  The built in hanger works well over my shower head and when not in use, also hangs nicely on our shower rod tucked out of the way.  Light weight, nice size, compact enough to pack in a suitcase if needed, or for kids to use, but big enough for adult use as well.  It is not fog free, but just stick it under the water and you&#x27;ll have fog free use for a bit.  BE SURE TO PEEL THE PROTECTIVE FILM OFF THE MIRROR BEFORE USE!  Once the film is peeled off, the mirror is nice and clear.  The hole for the razor works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a mirror! What a terrible excuse for a mirror. I can&#x27;t see myself in it any better than looking into the tile on the shower wall. Awful product!</li>
            <li> the mirror is not fog-free. it collects fog very easily but then just a splash of water and it clears up of course. it is very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 9/26/2016: been over 6 years since i got this. dropped countless times and it prevails with not a single scratch, let alone shatter. amazing product.</li>
            <li> Not metal but plastic mirror.  should last if not scratched.  won&#x27;t break if dropped.  good/safe if kids around.  rather they didn&#x27;t have hole (just hook), limits mirrorored space.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, plastic mirror that hooks just fine onto our soap/shampoo rack. NOTE: There is an easy-to-remove protective film covering the mirror -- some may mistaken it for poor mirror quality. Not so.    Since it&#x27;s plastic, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it shattering should it ever be dropped. I also like that it&#x27;s fairly large so you definitely see more of your reflection.    No fogging issues yet. But no matter. I&#x27;d just resort to the old swim goggle trick: a little bit of spit always does the trick. It also helps to keep the mirror clean of soap scum.</li>
            <li> This mirror is lightweight, to me is \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; (perfect for travel pack), easy to hold, and hangs in the shower ready for use.  I&#x27;ve used it to shave 5 times or so on a recent trip, and it fit the bill perfectly.  Just rinse if it gets a bit fogged and go!</li>
            <li> I bought this to hang over the sink because my 2-year-old couldn&#x27;t see to brush her teeth.  It works well for that, and is safe for her to play with elsewhere.  It&#x27;s seen some rough handling and has a few tiny scratches on it, that&#x27;s all.  It&#x27;s a perfect mirror, no warping.  Edit: I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it&#x27;s still great. I&#x27;m going to buy another as a baby shower gift for the mom who already has everything. Most mirrors they sell for little kids are small and crappy, this one is big enough to have some fun with.</li>
            <li> Just bought this mirror and I love it. Light weight and works fine. Would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a nice, handy mirror for the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave in the shower both at home and in the gym, and it works well for both.  There is no such thing as \\&quot;truly fog-free,\\&quot; as fog is the condensation of the humid air/water in the shower on the colder mirror surface.  However, it&#x27;s easy to defog in a second -- put a little soap on it and wash it off, and the mirror stays fog-free for 5-10 minutes, which is perfect for my shave.  (If you have a window open in the bathroom, it&#x27;s entirely possible the air will be dry enough that you won&#x27;t even have to do this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is large and enables easy viewing of my face to shower with.  The hook works well; for the gym, I pair it with a bag that has a suction cup, which I can hook it off of.  At home, I use it with a suction cup hook, and hang the razor on the bottom, just as the image describes.  Overall, the setup works very well, and I&#x27;ve become addicted to in-shower shaving.</li>
            <li> If you like things that do exactly what they are supposed to, you will love this product. Not fancy, but just perfect. It hangs from the pipe that feeds your shower head. Or you can hold it in one hand while shaving with the other. If you just run the shower on it for about 2 seconds, it will not fog. And, it is plastic, so it does not break if you drop it. To add the final touch, there is a cutout at the bottom in which you can insert your razor. Handy storage and helps it dry quickly. I love things that function perfectly and have no unnecessary and stupid, expensive frills.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my more expensive shower mirror that had water running across the face to keep from fogging, because it finally cracked.  Although skeptical, this mirror works even better for my needs.  Yes it does fog up, but since you are holding it with one hand while shaving with the other, it is simple to quickly rinse it off.  Holding the mirror allows for a better view of the area being shaved.  It hangs simply on the shower head when not in use, and includes a convenient slot to hold the razor.</li>
            <li> The reviewer who complained about the mirror being dirty may not have realized there was a plastic coating that you&#x27;re supposed to peel off to reveal the shiny and clean mirror underneath. Extremely easy too install (just hang it on the shower head or any other place you&#x27;d like). Cleaning is easy since you can \\&quot;uninstall\\&quot; it so easily. I&#x27;m not sure if it has any anti-fog technology built in, but I didn&#x27;t notice it being an annoying problem when I was using it. It isn&#x27;t made of glass so it won&#x27;t break easily. I can imagine it would be great to travel with since it is lightweight and durable. I would buy this product again.    Update 12/29/2010  I have a couple more comments, after using this for a little over a week. The mirror DOES steam up, but a quick rinse with the water and I&#x27;m good to go. I really love how light it is and because it isn&#x27;t permanently attached to anything I can hold it in my hand and use it to get a better view or see other angles. There are no scratches on the mirror so far.</li>
            <li> As someone who travels 90% of the time, and shaves their head, this product is great.  I&#x27;ve had to resort to shaving in front of hotel mirrors instead of using my \\&quot;home\\&quot; routine of shaving in the shower.  This product fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits in my luggage nicely.  Very durable, so far hasn&#x27;t broken or scratch.  I just toss it in with my shirts and slacks - no sharp edges on the mirror, so it hasn&#x27;t damaged my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hangs on all the shower heads I&#x27;ve used so far.  You can slide the \\&quot;hook\\&quot; down the shower head too in order to help get the best angle for use (tilts the mirror forward and back, but there is no \\&quot;up\\&quot; range past perpendicular to eyesight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fogs up some, but a quick splash of water fixes it for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, happy to be able to shave in the shower even when I travel now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for quite some time now.  Nothing has really changed from the original review.  It doesn&#x27;t have the fog-free effect like my home mirror, but a quick rinse in a hotel shower fixes the fog issue for a couple minutes.  I&#x27;ve become adept to finding the perfect spot on hotel shower heads to hang the mirror from to give a good reflection angle.  I think I&#x27;ve only been to one hotel where the shower head wasn&#x27;t able to hold the mirror at a good enough angle to use.  I&#x27;m purchasing a second one now.  The original didn&#x27;t break.  I loaded it in my luggage for a trip, and unfortunately the TSA left a \\&quot;searched\\&quot; message in my luggage and the mirror was gone.  Not sure why they would have removed it ( I know it was in the luggage ), but it&#x27;s cheap enough and worthy enough to purchase another.</li>
            <li> You can hang this mirror from the shower curtain hooks, the shower head itself or wherever you fancy. It can be used in a tiled shower as well, just procure a suction cup hook to hang it from.&lt;br /&gt;Nearly indestructible plastic &amp; great mirror in general.&lt;br /&gt;To keep it truly fog free (and not impossibly dirty) I use a spray on, no scrub shower cleanser on it every time I shower. It keeps it in like new condition.</li>
            <li> Best there is. I have several, and use them everyday. I travel all the time.</li>
            <li> I just gave it three stars because I didn&#x27;t want to use the hang on feature and it wouldn&#x27;t work with our shower head which comes down from above.  However, it works very well.  If you are inclined to shave in shower, this is great.</li>
            <li> After I used it a few times, the anti fog feature is gone. Have to use the scuba diving skill that I leaned in anti fogging goggles - spit on the glass to create the anti fog.&lt;br /&gt;Easily scratched.</li>
            <li> Just received this item.  I won&#x27;t be using it in the shower -- just wanted to hang it when needed then put away, in my RV.  So, I can&#x27;t attest at this time to how resistant it might be to fog or shattering.  However, when I received was not exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is 1/4 inch deep and 3/4 inch long notch cut out along the right lower edge as it hangs.  I don&#x27;t see this as a problem or that it interferes with the function.  It&#x27;s just I wonder why the photo and what I received was not identical.  In today&#x27;s media market, it is not hard to post a correct photo or show variations of a product.</li>
            <li> I gave this mirror to my husband as one of his birthday gifts and he loves it. It stays clear and is super lightweight. A little rinse under the water and it is crystal clear again.</li>
            <li> Being a male who shaves his face and head in the shower, a good mirror is essential.  I have tried dozens of mirrors, all either fogged up and were hard to clear, or the majority ended up broke eventually.  This mirror is very light weight, which could initially make you question its quality, but that is not the case.  It is not merely foil laminated to clear plastic, but appears to be a quality product.  I have been using it for a month, and is pefect.  It is lightweight, hangs on shower head perfect, has hole for razor, and appears unbreakable under normal conditions.  Clears easily with a quick spray of water.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love how it hangs in the shower and holds my razor but as a mirror it leaves a lot to be desired.  This thing fogs up constantly.  I either have to keep wiping it off or showering it off to get rid of the fog.  Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this item back in January and it&#x27;s been working well 10 months later. I initially bought this because of the hook - I lived in an apartment where suction cups wouldn&#x27;t stick well on the bathtub walls - and I was looking for something fairly cheap. Provided that you follow the instructions (run hot water through the front and back of the mirror for 3 seconds) then it works just fine. After awhile, it could fog up again but that&#x27;s to be expected - just run the water through and it&#x27;s back to working well. I haven&#x27;t tried traveling with it but it&#x27;s very lightweight and seems fairly sturdy given that I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times. If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively cheap option then this might work well for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 12/11/12&lt;br /&gt;Thought I&#x27;d give a quick update on things. I&#x27;ve dropped this mirror a countless number of times and it&#x27;s not chipped or broken. I&#x27;ve tossed the mirror in my belonging for several moves and have taken it for a few trips with no problem.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best bang-for-buck purchase I ever made on Amazon. It&#x27;s durable, works as expected and makes shaving waaaay more pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: About every 4 months I treat it with a Rain-X typeproduct (Note: I don&#x27;t think you can use Rain-X on plastic, so make sure yours will not damage it) and that significantly increases my shaving pleasure. It makes the water bead off the mirror surface while showering. It also slows the buildup of minerals from the water on the mirror surface. Even if you don&#x27;t use a plastic treatment, take some time to buff off the minerals every month or so. You&#x27;ll be surprised at what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li> This is something you would expect to find at the dollar store.  The mirror fogs immediately upon turning on the shower.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I have to use a medicated shampoo twice a week and leave it in for 10 minutes - got this so I wasn&#x27;t just standing around.  It is functional, smaller than I imagined but does do what I purchased it to do.</li>
            <li> Way cool mirror.  Great for it not being fragile.  The hanging feature is very handy.  I got this for a disabled person who needed to see the bottom of his feet, it worked perfect.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Good price for a decent product.  Bonus points for being able to hang it on shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Fog free\\&quot;, though?  No.  This is not a fog-free mirror.  Maybe if it&#x27;s not in the shower.  In the shower, however, it fogs up.  Is it better than not having a mirror in the shower?  I guess so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it.  Just gotta keep wiping it as you shave.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband to replace an older Z&#x27;ladro (spelling?) shaving/shower mounted mirror he used to have from Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond that never really truly stayed fog-free. This one seems to work really well for him so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago, have used it on 4 different vacations/trips.  It is fog free.  It does not scratch (so far) or break.  It hangs nicely on hook, or shower head or door knob.  One of my pet peeves in hotel rooms are the mirrors.  Sometimes they are placed too far back on counter, sometimes too high up (am not tall), sometimes just very oddly placed.  And..... I like to see the back of my hair when I am dressing up for a night out, and this mirror fits the bill.  I can place it where I want it, I can stuff it in my suitcase with minimal concern that it will break and become a nightmare to clean up, and I can see the back of my hair.  I would definitely recommend this, especially to travelers.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be too big, but it is perfect for shaving in the show.  Just run water on it to clear fog.  Weighs almost nothing, and has a variety of notches to help hang it, or hold it.  I really like not having glass in the shower.  Update 7/12/2014:  I&#x27;ve dropped this many times and not a scratch on it.  Also I am on a well and it picked up some of the white calcium we have out here, and it wiped clean.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.  One minor nit is that  new shower head angles slightly downward, and the mirror will slide off more often, thus how I&#x27;ve dropped it.  Not the mirror&#x27;s fault of course, but a rougher/grippier edge would help.  Update 7/18/2016:  Still Awesome.  Dropped over 20 times, expect it to outlast me!</li>
            <li> Works great and has made shaving in the shower easy and possible.  I&#x27;m never going to go without one again.</li>
            <li> She was pretty nice while it lasted, maybe a year at most, then it eventually became cloudy and wasn&#x27;t as reflective as I would have liked or as it originally was.  I dropped it once and it broke off the hook end leaving a sharp corner. I wasn&#x27;t too concerned as it wasn&#x27;t glass and since I never had a great place to hook it in our shower. So I just kept leaning it against the wall of a built-in shelf in the shower until one day it fell from there, right onto my foot, leaving me with a nice deep puncture wound from which blood spurted like a geyser.  I hold no ill will against the mirror as it was my own fault and continue to use it to this day, although I did just secretly order new, smaller, fog free mirror and will throw this one to the curb, but let&#x27;s just keep that between you and me.</li>
            <li> Just a cheap plastic item, my husband threw away after a month use. It is not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Does actually fog up and not a very clear mirror. At least it doesn&#x27;t rust or discolor when constantly wet. Good if you don&#x27;t need a precision mirror in the shower.</li>
            <li> I got him this for use at my house and he liked it so much he ditched his old one and takes it back &amp; forth from his place to mine.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  It&#x27;s light weight and easy to hang anywhere.  I simply screwed in a hook into the wall just above the shower stall, hung the mirror and started using it that day.  It keeps the fog away and if it gets mucked up at all with water drops, one simple swipe of my hand and I&#x27;m good to go.  For the price and ease of use, I give this mirror a five star rating.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday for shaving in the shower. Will not break. If it does fog up, just rinse it; it&#x27;ll stay fog-free.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break if you drop it. Doesn&#x27;t fog, but you&#x27;ll need to wipe the water drops off to see clearly.</li>
            <li> Great item. Clean, clear reflection and very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Made of plastic, not glass so it&#x27;s safer for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and don&#x27;t look back!</li>
            <li> Needed a simple mirror for the shower and all the suction cup ones never seem to work right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror hangs nicely from the shower head and its durability gives me no worries that it would ever break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see taking this mirror with me on trips so that I have it everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> Anyone who likes to shower and then shave knows that it adds time to your routine. If you live in cold places where the mirror defogs during winter, the wait is even longer.&lt;br /&gt; How about a mirror that allows you to shave and shower at the same time? And is also practically fog free.&lt;br /&gt;I found this mirror and it is practically a life saver, I save so much time as I shave while taking a shower. This mirror is extremely light, hangs around the shower head and almost hard to break. It does have edges which could be dangerous if this ever falls on your toe. The mirror is almost- fog free, it does get foggy but then you have to simply wipe the fog with either your hand or hold it under the shower.  I have not traveled with this mirror but I figure it would be easy to carry it in a suitcase without the risk of breakage. The price and the quality can&#x27;t be beat, as well as the pleasure of in shower shaving. Five stars. 11/15/2012</li>
            <li> Once you get used to shaving in the shower, guys, you will never want to shave any other way.  This little mirror works great!  It won&#x27;t break (certainly not something you would want to have happen in a SHOWER!) and it defogs simply by putting it under the warm water of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it.  In fact, I&#x27;m going to go order another one right now as a back up and for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for over 4 months now, and it has saved me so much time and aggravation when shaving. Defogging is fast and easy: just run it under the water you&#x27;re already standing in. The shower head hook and hole for hanging a razor are both really convenient too. Maybe when I drop it on my foot I&#x27;ll have something to complain about, but it won&#x27;t be the product&#x27;s fault!</li>
