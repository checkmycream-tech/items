            <li> I ordered these for my granddaughters Frozen birthday party. They are really cute and I think her friends will love them.

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! These are so cute. We had extra so I grabbed one lol :)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for the kids to open their treat bags and see them!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER, BECAUSE ME AND HER WENT TO SEE THE MOVIE TOGETHER AND WE LOVED IT. I GAVE MY GRANDDAUGHTER ABOUT FIVE OF THEM AND THE REST I GAVE TO MY CHURCH GIRLS AND THEY LOVED THEM. I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW THAT THEY ALL CAME WITH A CHAIN OF THEIR OWN. SO IT WORKED OUT PERFECTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WHO IS GIVING GIFTS TO ANY LITTLE GIRL. THEY&#x27;LL LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> These arrived very quickly and the kids loved them!  They are great for party favors.  And the boys liked them too because there were Kristof and Olaf options.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, very nice quality and will be perfect for my daughter&#x27;s Frozen birthday party!  I received a very nice variety of bottle caps and my daughter and I had a blast putting them together!</li>
            <li> These were a great hit at the birthday party!!!! Wish I bought more of these! Great price, and I was impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter&#x27;s classmates wore these to school the day after her birthday party.  Everyone loved them, (ages 4-6).  I was so happy that the chains were not tangled when they arrived.  You need to attach each cap to its chain.  Great idea for birthday treats!</li>
            <li> These were given as party favors at my niece&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; Birthday party.  We were concerned that they would not arrive in time, even though they said they were shipped 24 hours after I ordered them.  They arrived 8 days later, just in time for the party the next day! The children loved them (boys and girls) and were wearing them before they left the party! The quality was very good.</li>
            <li> Used them as party favors. Both the boys and girls loved them.</li>
            <li> We bought these to go in goodie bags at a Frozen party. All of the kids wanted more than one! They LOVED them! Recommend! Comes with bottle cap pendant and necklaces for each one. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> They are perfect, and came very well packaged awesome deal!</li>
            <li> I used these for a frozen party with my granddaughters and they were perfect.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter is head over heels for Frozen. This was a hit with her.</li>
            <li> The hooks don&#x27;t close properly, but OK for gifts to kids.</li>
            <li> Ordered these as party favors for my 4-year-old&#x27;s birthday party. They were a big hit for both boys and girls! Cute!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughters party as part of birthday giveaways. i underestimate the delivery date, the item arrived day late. I just keep it because my daughters like it and plays with it. But the product is nice and kids will probably like it if they had the chance to receive it.</li>
            <li> I got this today, it comes with necklaces, if you wanted, you could make bracelets, hair bows, yes, they have frozen ribbon on amazon. You could also buy charms to add go them as well. The possibilities are endless. I just love how each bottle cap has a different character from the movie. I will be pretty entertained making necklaces and bracelets from all 15, who knows, I may even make a few hair bows too!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Big hit at my daughter&#x27;s party.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Nice product love them!</li>
            <li> The biggest hit in the goody bag, for sure!</li>
            <li> They were so cute and the girls loved them!</li>
            <li> everyone loved them, couldn&#x27;t get enough of the ahhhhhhhh,uhhhhhhh beautiful necklace. I made bows and and the necklace and put them on sandals.</li>
            <li> i love these for my daughter. she is absesed with frozen. who has seen the movie in theater&#x27;s i have i love ir</li>
            <li> Awesome product at an awesome price we ordered 30 for party favors kids loved then</li>
            <li> Very cute!  Great quality.  Made a great birthday party favor!</li>
            <li> These were so cool! My kids and I enjoyed them so much. My sister and I even wanted one. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered these necklaces as party favors for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  Because I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would make it here in time, I messaged the seller and requested they get them in the mail as soon as possible.  The seller was nice enough to respond and they even got here the day before the party!  The girls love the necklaces and they are great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for Frozen party fabors</li>
            <li> I bought ribbon waxed cord necklaces to go with these. They look great. They come with a chain and in retrospect I don&#x27;t think I would have bought the ribbons. The chains would have worked fine.</li>
            <li> these necklaces are beautiful, good quality and loved how they were shipped, can&#x27;t wait for her party this Saturday, they are for the gift bags.</li>
            <li> My daughter is having a Frozen themed birthday party and when we found these she was so excited. When they arrived, her excitement continued because they are as beautiful and colorful as described. They are the perfect gift for her friends and the variety of characters was a nice touch (gotta have Olof and Sven, right!).&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;drawback&amp;#34; I can see is that the chains for the necklaces are too short to just slip over the head of a child my daughters age (6-7) so they have to be clasped in the back (makes independent on and off difficult). But the product itself is wonderful:)</li>
            <li> These were the hit of my daughters birthday party. Very attractive and very happy at how quickly they got to us.</li>
            <li> These were a HUGE hit @ my daughters birthday party!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price.  All the girls loved their necklaces.  Especially when it&#x27;s so hard to find Frozen items, we were so happy to have these for our goody bags for our Frozen party.  My girls only questioned why Hans was included in the lot.  Hans is the bad guy and no one wanted that one.  But great item!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, very high quality.  Great favors for frozen birthday party.</li>
            <li> The kids really enjoyed getting these in their goodie bags, but over the course of the week my daughter kept telling me about how her friends necklaces were breaking.</li>
            <li> good for party favor - kids loved them</li>
            <li> We used this at my daughter&#x27;s birthday party, and they were a hit!  They cute and well-made.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are going to be so much fun for our girls&#x27; party.  They wanted to keep them, but are excited to have their friends enjoy them, too.</li>
