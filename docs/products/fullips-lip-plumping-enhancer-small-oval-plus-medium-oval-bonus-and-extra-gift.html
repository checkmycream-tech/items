            <li>So I guess it&#x27;s good for a couple of selfie. ........</li>
            <li>Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li>, it is very easy to use, and you will receive great customer service, all for $20...</li>
            <li>The owner of Fullips is the nicest, kindest, most beautiful woman in the world, no joke.</li>
            <li>Amazing, amazing product!</li>
            <li>Love , love , love !!!!</li>
            <li>The seller is awesome too, she sent an additional enhancer (medium) which was exciting</li>
            <li>Very sincere.</li>
            <li>Very cute</li>
            <li>Once I figured that out, I didn&#x27;t mind the process at all, and the effects looked really awesome if you overlook some pinkness around your lips (which I did, because my foundation/concealer would cover the redness right up with no problem).</li>
            <li>I love both!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments i have gotten!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>

            <li>Absolutely the best product out there!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep using a good lip balm while using this product.</li>
            <li>Until now...I can honestly say this product does work.  </li>
            <li>The instructions basically tell you that you&#x27;ll find your own way of figuring it out.</li>
            <li>Nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Although the effects are temporary (about 2 hours), it is very easy to carry around and reapply [there are reviews and how-to videos on youtube you should check out if you are hesitant to buy it].</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m happy thmx so much!!</li>

            <li>It can make your lips more plump.</li>
            <li>and she sends you a FREE medium one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a much more noticeable lip line.</li>

            <li>my bottom more than the top, and now both lips look more full and pouty.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips very full.</li>
            <li>I received a free medium oval as a gift with my purchase (another $20 value), and a lovely, handwritten note from the seller with my instructions.</li>
            <li>Absolutely effective and completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying it off of the original web site you will get more product from the seller.</li>
            <li>Made my lips look luscious and full!</li>
            <li>These ingenious little devices are incredible!!</li>
            <li>SO COOL!</li>
            <li>Other than that...works great!</li>
            <li>and I only have good things to say about it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, and I got immediate results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to find on their website.</li>
            <li>Attached is a snapchat photo of my bruised lips the next morning (bruised but beautiful</li>
            <li>Thank you full lips :)</li>
            <li>In this case, not only does the product give true results, but the customer service is absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well at plumping my top lip which I&#x27;m focusing on getting more symmetrical in size with my bottom lip.</li>
            <li>haha love it!</li>
            <li>This little one is the best.</li>
            <li>Because lets be real, its like giving your own mouth a hickey.</li>
            <li>and she was extremely courteous and very prompt and her response.</li>
            <li>And they sent another enhancer for free.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for a selfie, I would say it lasts for an hour it decreases but it does last for just about an hour.</li>
            <li>This is very good, but only if you get the right size.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend :)!</li>
            <li>It was an easy, and surgery-free way to get full lips for a night.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Im still excited about my purchase &amp;</li>
            <li>I received the small and medium ovals and they work perfectly for my problem areas(upper</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>But this Small Oval is PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and so fun!</li>
            <li>100% worth the money and the little bit of time to get the perfect lips!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still fine tuning the size and buying more but the instant results are so satisfying, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>applied this to my top lip only, and when inhaling it had a very strong grip.</li>
            <li>My daughter LOVES the look of her lips after using Full Lips.</li>
            <li>Full Lips 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋</li>
            <li>I saw this product and thought &amp;#34;this is too good to be true&amp;#34; and actually, it kinda is.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re full again.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get the full effects of it .  </li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed by it, though i would have to play with it more and get use to it to get the desire lip shape  and structure  as my mouth and lips are pretty small</li>
            <li>AN WILL GO AWAY QUICKLY ....</li>
            <li>I finally saw a noticeable difference after trying many, many times over like an hour period.</li>
            <li>actually that might be my favorite time to use it  :)</li>
            <li>A quick re-plump and your lips are luscious as ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since, I&#x27;ve been more delicate and am so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li>I will not repurchase, but I am just glad I got to try it myself and realize some things that seem too good to be true, usually are.</li>
            <li>This is definatly a beauty A+ in my book, ill keep spreading the word on this amazing , fun, safe and needle free way to get a sexy pout!</li>
            <li>Thanks Full lips!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my new favorite things</li>
            <li>Let me say, I&#x27;m thirty years old and love the look of full lips, so im</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED it off of hear and it came so fast and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Came in such cute packaging &amp; the seller wrote a sweet note!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how this product does work not just to plump your lips but to make them feel better!</li>
            <li>What I like about this is that it is oval, and fits over the mouth better than a standard lotion cap, and I get best suction on the small oval.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not thinking about returning any of them, it really works!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering trying out the middle oval one to see if better results are achieved!</li>
            <li>This  really works!!</li>
            <li>and my lips don&#x27;t fit in the large ones.</li>
            <li>You can be sure that in New Caledonia where I normally live, i&#x27;m gonna spread the word!!!</li>
            <li>If you do not wear lipstick on a daily basis, which I often just use a lip cream, might now be amazingly beneficial.</li>
            <li>and is fun to use before going out.</li>
            <li>wins the race.</li>
            <li>Every Woman in American should own all sizes.  </li>
            <li>but it is fun while it lasts.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun to use it when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup too..</li>
            <li>I wish it last longer because I liked  the effect,  but it didn&#x27;t  </li>
            <li>Which is so nice, because I got it prior to my birthday.</li>
            <li>Simple but effective.</li>
            <li>I  do it and remove it right away because of the bruising  </li>
            <li>but I didn’t get much time with full lips for the amount of work I put in.</li>
            <li>Thnx linda so much for emailing me so quick</li>
            <li>I have very narrow (width wise) lips, but pretty full</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use this much, but when I do it really works!!</li>
            <li>As someone who uses a ton of different lip products, I am really impressed with what this little piece of plastic can do!</li>
            <li>OVERALL IS OK.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I really like these!</li>
            <li>Overall, i absolutely love the enhancers and their liners and lip</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has commented on my lips several times saying they look more plump.</li>
            <li>The effects last 2-4 hours and over time they have become more permanately fuller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li>I only use this for before a date or trying out a makeup look where I want a more pouty look.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot to fullips for thinking ahead!</li>
            <li>It works when used as directed, but results do not last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Satisfied overall!</li>
            <li>It came so fast!</li>
            <li>However, one time I was able to keep it on and it did make my lips temporarily bigger</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work exactly like on video.</li>
            <li>Linda is a doll, I love my extra!</li>
            <li>And my fullips arrived so fast!</li>
            <li>Even when I left the product on for more than 20 minutes it still didn&#x27;t give me any effect longer than an hour.</li>
            <li>She sent a beautifuly decorated package and an unexpected free gift.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times, my lips turned purple.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s review:: First, I would like to say</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>but the plumpness doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour</li>
            <li>hahaha!</li>
            <li>(3) I received a second, medium sized lip enhancer for free!</li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use with instant results.</li>
            <li>I love it purely because you can use it vertically as well as horizontally on the middle and both sides of your lips.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants full lips without the expense of injections and a huge dent I ones wallet .</li>
            <li>so I figured I would give this product a try based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>(height wise), so I went with the small oval and use it vertically.</li>
            <li>Overall hundred percent satisfied and highly recommend the seller and the product</li>
            <li>Of course the beautifully plumped effect does not last forever, maybe a few hours.</li>
            <li>I experimented after trying to use these, I used a shot glass, it actually stayed on unlike these, but quickly removed as I didn&#x27;t want a ring around my mouth!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>It really gets your lips used to the enhancer, as well as making the plumpness</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your help...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I have been plumping my lips with various lotion caps through suction prior with great results, so why not splurge on a device actually created for it?</li>
            <li>It really works  .</li>
            <li>Really does plump my lips.</li>
            <li>This product is a very genius idea for those of us who refuse to use plastic surgeons to get the look we want.</li>
            <li>works really well...</li>
            <li>Hence, i wanted to really avoid this.</li>
            <li>I really would not recommend this.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It looked like I was stung by a bee or something haha</li>
            <li>It really work for 20- 30min</li>
            <li>at least like 30 min. would&#x27;ve been good.</li>
            <li>I have been using the large round full lip enhancer for about 2 weeks &amp; seen a huge difference in my lips.</li>
            <li>but I should have been more careful!</li>
            <li>I got a large Fullips as a gift that came with my purchase, and I contacted Linda (the owner of this company) asking her if she thinks that Medium will work better since I have really thin lips, and she got back to me right away, and she is sending me the medium size to give it a try :)...</li>
            <li>This is an effective product and does that it is meant to, however results do not last as long as you might think (30 minutes to an hour)</li>
            <li>Beautiful packaging and the seller sent an extra medium (I order the small) lip plumper!  </li>
            <li>but you see results instantly then over time!I already have full lips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned my enhancers for a few hours now, but this is the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent on a beauty product!</li>
            <li>The packaging was beautiful and I got an extra little present and a sweet personal note from Linda!!!</li>
            <li>Mine lasts around 3 hours now, and i only need to do a quick touch up</li>
            <li>Contacted customer service for a particular reason</li>
            <li>I love it even though it only lasts for a short period of time..</li>
            <li>my lips were still a bit plump when I woke up, so I included an older photo to show how my lips looked before.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to get any area around my lip, just the pink part only, which is why I prefer the small oval best.  </li>
            <li>Everything came beautifully packaged in red organza bags, and shipping only took a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its small, portable, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking the time to write a stellar review for this product and all of the people behind it because such a personal customer service is seldom seen anymore and it deserves to be more widely known especially since their products are so great!!</li>
            <li>When it arrives, it comes in a cute little drawstring bag with a handwritten note from the maker.</li>
            <li>and they looked great but was sad to see them start deflating after 30 mins.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it too much, since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole mouth (top and bottom lips at same time), and it gives me the center fullness and pouty-ness</li>
            <li>AND mine actually came with a complimentary medium sized fullip enhancer too.</li>
            <li>Company seems nice, but again, a real waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for women without live in Jackson.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many lip glosses that promised to make your lips bigger, but really they never did anything other than giving you a tingling feeling for couple of minutes...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but my lips look very smooth once the puffiness does go down and the fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li>It is fun for the first few days, but I don&#x27;t recommend wasting money on this especially if want more lasting results</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to use and it takes less than minute (depending on how big you want your lips to be...</li>
            <li>I received both a small and medium oval (thank you very much for the complimentary gift by the way!)</li>
            <li>of course, I&#x27;d have to be consistent in doing it several times per week.  </li>
            <li>I think she looks natural too!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>They come in pretty red pouches with directions, tips and how to&#x27;s .</li>
            <li>I ordered small oval &amp; got medium oval for free with it!</li>
            <li>Totally unexpected!</li>
            <li>they feel alive!</li>
            <li>last sooooo much longer!</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised and it has found use too!</li>
            <li>Then, I switch to the medium oval (vertical not horizontal), and for the first time in my life, I have actual lips.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and only wish I had known about it earlier!</li>
            <li>I always got replies within 24 hours with my questions and they even sent me a free large enhancer and lip gloss when I expressed the small oval wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>but I receive the 3 item pack instead because as I currently live in France it was to far away to exchange, so</li>
            <li>glosses too, the company is amazing, the products are well made and small enough to just chuck in your bag.</li>
            <li>The seller was nice enough to include the small size as well</li>
            <li>I actually liked the big oval and recommend it for everyone even if you have small lips.</li>
            <li>Amazing, i was so skeptical until i received my Full lips and tried them personally!  </li>
            <li>If you wear lipstick everyday to cover up bruising then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips huge temporarily but with continued use it does keep them  a little plumper..</li>
            <li>My fault completely....</li>
            <li>With that said, I have ordered this in all three sizes after my nine year old son found the product on a youtube video about the &amp;#34;dumbest things to buy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It does work and maybe if you’re very committed it can last a bit</li>
            <li>Coming from a 20 year old, I think the product does what it say it will do.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Aaamazing product shows real results instantly.</li>
            <li>I had to cover it with makeup and was self conscious about it all night.</li>
            <li>Lips look naturally fuller.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old</li>
            <li>I have to do it every hour or two, but it only takes a few minutes at most</li>
            <li>Small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>When you see it its pretty much just a little plastic thing.</li>
            <li>Personally thought it was pretty simple to figure out</li>
            <li>If used incorrectly, you will probably break some blood vessels and end up with a red ring around your mouth, so I highly recommend you watch it before trying to use your enhancer.</li>
            <li>It works for like 20 mins then your lips go back to normal</li>
            <li>I would reccoment getting the largest round size, as the other two don&#x27;t fit around my lips (I use them to target certain areas).</li>
            <li>No worries, the lip enhancer is small enough to fit in your handbag.</li>
            <li>The personal details in the packaging are so dear; the company clearly cares for this product.</li>
            <li>And I am pleasantly surprised, it actually WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of work and if you&#x27;re not careful you will hurt your lips and mouth.</li>
            <li>BUT, for me at least ,no matter how long or many times I did it, it only lasted about 4 minutes, then it completely went away.</li>
            <li>The medium is a bit more difficult to get the suction just on the lip, and the large round is just too large.</li>
            <li>The rim is also thicker than a general bottle cap, and therefore doesn&#x27;t leave a deep indentation on the lips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious about my thin upper lip, especially when I smile, but thanks to this thing</li>
            <li>I would really like this product if the effects lasted for longer than a half hour.</li>
            <li>I sucked too hard when trying the product the first night, and they hurt!</li>
            <li>I really tried a half a dozen times and aside from giving me a big red ring around my mouth</li>
            <li>Now I want to try the large round enhancer for myself as well.</li>
            <li>Love this Small Oval!!!</li>
            <li>The Large Round was wayyy too big ....</li>
            <li>this thing makes them even bigger, but it did absolutely nothing on my little bird lips.  </li>
            <li>and it is a bit awkward to use at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to figure out what method you&#x27;re comfortable with.</li>

            <li> IS GOOD</li>
            <li> Good product if you want temporary fullness.</li>
            <li> I truly loved this purchase.</li>
            <li> So I guess it&#x27;s good for a couple of selfie. ........</li>
            <li> Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> , it is very easy to use, and you will receive great customer service, all for $20...</li>
            <li> The owner of Fullips is the nicest, kindest, most beautiful woman in the world, no joke.</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love , love , love !!!!</li>
            <li> The seller is awesome too, she sent an additional enhancer (medium) which was exciting</li>
            <li> Very sincere.</li>
            <li> Very cute</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out, I didn&#x27;t mind the process at all, and the effects looked really awesome if you overlook some pinkness around your lips (which I did, because my foundation/concealer would cover the redness right up with no problem).</li>
            <li> I love both!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments i have gotten!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Also the customer service was AMAZING.</li>

            <li> Absolutely the best product out there!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to keep using a good lip balm while using this product.</li>
            <li> Until now...I can honestly say this product does work.  </li>
            <li> The instructions basically tell you that you&#x27;ll find your own way of figuring it out.</li>
            <li> Nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Although the effects are temporary (about 2 hours), it is very easy to carry around and reapply [there are reviews and how-to videos on youtube you should check out if you are hesitant to buy it].</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m happy thmx so much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick with my own lips:)</li>
            <li> So all together this is a great fun product to have</li>
            <li> so I was using very light suction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so very much!!!  </li>
            <li> I THINK I NEED TO DO THIS MORE OFTEN  </li>

            <li> and I only have good things to say about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, and I got immediate results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to find on their website.</li>
            <li> Attached is a snapchat photo of my bruised lips the next morning (bruised but beautiful</li>
            <li> Thank you full lips :)</li>
            <li> In this case, not only does the product give true results, but the customer service is absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well at plumping my top lip which I&#x27;m focusing on getting more symmetrical in size with my bottom lip.</li>
            <li> haha love it!</li>
            <li> This little one is the best.</li>
            <li> Because lets be real, its like giving your own mouth a hickey.</li>
            <li> and she was extremely courteous and very prompt and her response.</li>
            <li> And they sent another enhancer for free.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for a selfie, I would say it lasts for an hour it decreases but it does last for just about an hour.</li>
            <li> This is very good, but only if you get the right size.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend :)!</li>
            <li> It was an easy, and surgery-free way to get full lips for a night.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Im still excited about my purchase &amp;</li>
            <li> I received the small and medium ovals and they work perfectly for my problem areas(upper</li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> But this Small Oval is PERFECT!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and so fun!</li>
            <li> 100% worth the money and the little bit of time to get the perfect lips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fine tuning the size and buying more but the instant results are so satisfying, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> applied this to my top lip only, and when inhaling it had a very strong grip.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES the look of her lips after using Full Lips.</li>
            <li> Full Lips 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋</li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought &amp;#34;this is too good to be true&amp;#34; and actually, it kinda is.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re full again.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get the full effects of it .  </li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed by it, though i would have to play with it more and get use to it to get the desire lip shape  and structure  as my mouth and lips are pretty small</li>
            <li> AN WILL GO AWAY QUICKLY ....</li>
            <li> I finally saw a noticeable difference after trying many, many times over like an hour period.</li>
            <li> actually that might be my favorite time to use it  :)</li>
            <li> A quick re-plump and your lips are luscious as ever.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since, I&#x27;ve been more delicate and am so happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> I will not repurchase, but I am just glad I got to try it myself and realize some things that seem too good to be true, usually are.</li>
            <li> This is definatly a beauty A+ in my book, ill keep spreading the word on this amazing , fun, safe and needle free way to get a sexy pout!</li>
            <li> Thanks Full lips!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my new favorite things</li>
            <li> Let me say, I&#x27;m thirty years old and love the look of full lips, so im</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED it off of hear and it came so fast and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Came in such cute packaging &amp; the seller wrote a sweet note!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how this product does work not just to plump your lips but to make them feel better!</li>
            <li> What I like about this is that it is oval, and fits over the mouth better than a standard lotion cap, and I get best suction on the small oval.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not thinking about returning any of them, it really works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering trying out the middle oval one to see if better results are achieved!</li>
            <li> This  really works!!</li>
            <li> and my lips don&#x27;t fit in the large ones.</li>
            <li> You can be sure that in New Caledonia where I normally live, i&#x27;m gonna spread the word!!!</li>
            <li> If you do not wear lipstick on a daily basis, which I often just use a lip cream, might now be amazingly beneficial.</li>
            <li> and is fun to use before going out.</li>
            <li> wins the race.</li>
            <li> Every Woman in American should own all sizes.  </li>
            <li> but it is fun while it lasts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun to use it when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup too..</li>
            <li> I wish it last longer because I liked  the effect,  but it didn&#x27;t  </li>
            <li> Which is so nice, because I got it prior to my birthday.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> I  do it and remove it right away because of the bruising  </li>
            <li> but I didn’t get much time with full lips for the amount of work I put in.</li>
            <li> Thnx linda so much for emailing me so quick</li>
            <li> I have very narrow (width wise) lips, but pretty full</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this much, but when I do it really works!!</li>
            <li> As someone who uses a ton of different lip products, I am really impressed with what this little piece of plastic can do!</li>
            <li> OVERALL IS OK.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I really like these!</li>
            <li> Overall, i absolutely love the enhancers and their liners and lip</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has commented on my lips several times saying they look more plump.</li>
            <li> The effects last 2-4 hours and over time they have become more permanately fuller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li> I only use this for before a date or trying out a makeup look where I want a more pouty look.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot to fullips for thinking ahead!</li>
            <li> It works when used as directed, but results do not last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Satisfied overall!</li>
            <li> It came so fast!</li>
            <li> However, one time I was able to keep it on and it did make my lips temporarily bigger</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work exactly like on video.</li>
            <li> Linda is a doll, I love my extra!</li>
            <li> And my fullips arrived so fast!</li>
            <li> Even when I left the product on for more than 20 minutes it still didn&#x27;t give me any effect longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> She sent a beautifuly decorated package and an unexpected free gift.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times, my lips turned purple.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review:: First, I would like to say</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> but the plumpness doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour</li>
            <li> hahaha!</li>
            <li> (3) I received a second, medium sized lip enhancer for free!</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use with instant results.</li>
            <li> I love it purely because you can use it vertically as well as horizontally on the middle and both sides of your lips.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants full lips without the expense of injections and a huge dent I ones wallet .</li>
            <li> so I figured I would give this product a try based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> (height wise), so I went with the small oval and use it vertically.</li>
            <li> Overall hundred percent satisfied and highly recommend the seller and the product</li>
            <li> Of course the beautifully plumped effect does not last forever, maybe a few hours.</li>
            <li> I experimented after trying to use these, I used a shot glass, it actually stayed on unlike these, but quickly removed as I didn&#x27;t want a ring around my mouth!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> It really gets your lips used to the enhancer, as well as making the plumpness</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your help...</li>
            <li> Thank you so much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have been plumping my lips with various lotion caps through suction prior with great results, so why not splurge on a device actually created for it?</li>
            <li> It really works  .</li>
            <li> Really does plump my lips.</li>
            <li> This product is a very genius idea for those of us who refuse to use plastic surgeons to get the look we want.</li>
            <li> works really well...</li>
            <li> Hence, i wanted to really avoid this.</li>
            <li> I really would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It looked like I was stung by a bee or something haha</li>
            <li> It really work for 20- 30min</li>
            <li> at least like 30 min. would&#x27;ve been good.</li>
            <li> I have been using the large round full lip enhancer for about 2 weeks &amp; seen a huge difference in my lips.</li>
            <li> but I should have been more careful!</li>
            <li> I got a large Fullips as a gift that came with my purchase, and I contacted Linda (the owner of this company) asking her if she thinks that Medium will work better since I have really thin lips, and she got back to me right away, and she is sending me the medium size to give it a try :)...</li>
            <li> This is an effective product and does that it is meant to, however results do not last as long as you might think (30 minutes to an hour)</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging and the seller sent an extra medium (I order the small) lip plumper!  </li>
            <li> but you see results instantly then over time!I already have full lips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned my enhancers for a few hours now, but this is the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent on a beauty product!</li>
            <li> The packaging was beautiful and I got an extra little present and a sweet personal note from Linda!!!</li>
            <li> Mine lasts around 3 hours now, and i only need to do a quick touch up</li>
            <li> Contacted customer service for a particular reason</li>
            <li> I love it even though it only lasts for a short period of time..</li>
            <li> my lips were still a bit plump when I woke up, so I included an older photo to show how my lips looked before.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to get any area around my lip, just the pink part only, which is why I prefer the small oval best.  </li>
            <li> Everything came beautifully packaged in red organza bags, and shipping only took a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its small, portable, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking the time to write a stellar review for this product and all of the people behind it because such a personal customer service is seldom seen anymore and it deserves to be more widely known especially since their products are so great!!</li>
            <li> When it arrives, it comes in a cute little drawstring bag with a handwritten note from the maker.</li>
            <li> and they looked great but was sad to see them start deflating after 30 mins.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it too much, since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole mouth (top and bottom lips at same time), and it gives me the center fullness and pouty-ness</li>
            <li> AND mine actually came with a complimentary medium sized fullip enhancer too.</li>
            <li> Company seems nice, but again, a real waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for women without live in Jackson.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many lip glosses that promised to make your lips bigger, but really they never did anything other than giving you a tingling feeling for couple of minutes...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but my lips look very smooth once the puffiness does go down and the fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li> It is fun for the first few days, but I don&#x27;t recommend wasting money on this especially if want more lasting results</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use and it takes less than minute (depending on how big you want your lips to be...</li>
            <li> I received both a small and medium oval (thank you very much for the complimentary gift by the way!)</li>
            <li> of course, I&#x27;d have to be consistent in doing it several times per week.  </li>
            <li> I think she looks natural too!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> They come in pretty red pouches with directions, tips and how to&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> I ordered small oval &amp; got medium oval for free with it!</li>
            <li> Totally unexpected!</li>
            <li> they feel alive!</li>
            <li> last sooooo much longer!</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised and it has found use too!</li>
            <li> Then, I switch to the medium oval (vertical not horizontal), and for the first time in my life, I have actual lips.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and only wish I had known about it earlier!</li>
            <li> I always got replies within 24 hours with my questions and they even sent me a free large enhancer and lip gloss when I expressed the small oval wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> but I receive the 3 item pack instead because as I currently live in France it was to far away to exchange, so</li>
            <li> glosses too, the company is amazing, the products are well made and small enough to just chuck in your bag.</li>
            <li> The seller was nice enough to include the small size as well</li>
            <li> I actually liked the big oval and recommend it for everyone even if you have small lips.</li>
            <li> Amazing, i was so skeptical until i received my Full lips and tried them personally!  </li>
            <li> If you wear lipstick everyday to cover up bruising then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> It makes your lips huge temporarily but with continued use it does keep them  a little plumper..</li>
            <li> My fault completely....</li>
            <li> With that said, I have ordered this in all three sizes after my nine year old son found the product on a youtube video about the &amp;#34;dumbest things to buy.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It does work and maybe if you’re very committed it can last a bit</li>
            <li> Coming from a 20 year old, I think the product does what it say it will do.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Aaamazing product shows real results instantly.</li>
            <li> I had to cover it with makeup and was self conscious about it all night.</li>
            <li> Lips look naturally fuller.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old</li>
            <li> I have to do it every hour or two, but it only takes a few minutes at most</li>
            <li> Small and easy to use.</li>
            <li> When you see it its pretty much just a little plastic thing.</li>
            <li> Personally thought it was pretty simple to figure out</li>
            <li> If used incorrectly, you will probably break some blood vessels and end up with a red ring around your mouth, so I highly recommend you watch it before trying to use your enhancer.</li>
            <li> It works for like 20 mins then your lips go back to normal</li>
            <li> I would reccoment getting the largest round size, as the other two don&#x27;t fit around my lips (I use them to target certain areas).</li>
            <li> No worries, the lip enhancer is small enough to fit in your handbag.</li>
            <li> The personal details in the packaging are so dear; the company clearly cares for this product.</li>
            <li> And I am pleasantly surprised, it actually WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of work and if you&#x27;re not careful you will hurt your lips and mouth.</li>
            <li> BUT, for me at least ,no matter how long or many times I did it, it only lasted about 4 minutes, then it completely went away.</li>
            <li> The medium is a bit more difficult to get the suction just on the lip, and the large round is just too large.</li>
            <li> The rim is also thicker than a general bottle cap, and therefore doesn&#x27;t leave a deep indentation on the lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious about my thin upper lip, especially when I smile, but thanks to this thing</li>
            <li> I would really like this product if the effects lasted for longer than a half hour.</li>
            <li> I sucked too hard when trying the product the first night, and they hurt!</li>
            <li> I really tried a half a dozen times and aside from giving me a big red ring around my mouth</li>
            <li> Now I want to try the large round enhancer for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Love this Small Oval!!!</li>
            <li> The Large Round was wayyy too big ....</li>
            <li> this thing makes them even bigger, but it did absolutely nothing on my little bird lips.  </li>
            <li> and it is a bit awkward to use at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to figure out what method you&#x27;re comfortable with.</li>
            <li> it took me a few tries to get it just right.</li>
            <li> my small lips look the same, just too much effort for me to even try again.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it I got a bruise,  I went too hard on it.</li>
            <li> the small one, however, really made a difference.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The plump only last a few minutes so far... and</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wished.</li>
            <li> And results don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The only defaul is that they dont stay very long</li>
            <li> After faithfully using daily every time you apply lip balm and using the medium nightly to really pulling my upper and lower lips in individually, The cumulative effect is LESS noticeable lip lines!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can still get your lips big but slow and steady</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard plastic, which doesn&#x27;t make much sense.</li>
            <li> Hope they don&#x27;t stay purple for too long</li>
            <li> But only for like 10-15 mins then it starts to go back down.</li>
            <li> THE OTHER VERY BIG.</li>
            <li> is about what I&#x27;m getting out of it, also be very careful when using it that skin around your lips is not sucked in, I have learned this the hard way with very noticeable bruising around my lower lip</li>
            <li> Also the plump only lasted about half hour.</li>
            <li> It can turn them black and blue if you don&#x27;t do it carefully.kind of pricey for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> However, the effects last maybe a half hour.</li>
            <li> so I used the medium for overall fullness on my upper lip and then used the small vertically to plump both.</li>
            <li> My mouth is wide and my lips medium, the small oval is too little, but the  medium oval works for me really well.</li>
            <li> The Medium Oval was a little too big ....</li>
            <li> When I want a little extra oomph to my look, I use it.</li>
            <li> My lips did look a lot plumper, but it kind of was a little painful</li>
            <li> It was a little bigger then I expected.</li>
            <li> The material was a little harder than I expected, but after getting use to, it&#x27;s simple.</li>
            <li> I came across this gadget and I thought that I should to give it a try since its is only $20, so I wont feel too guilty for spending too much money on it if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it claims to do, but sadly the results don&#x27;t last forever (which I know isn&#x27;t the fault of the manufacturer).</li>
            <li> frank times are rough and I don&#x27;t want to keep wasting my money away.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> Results lasted shorted than expected.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally fuller bottom lip but fairly thin upper lip-</li>
            <li> I experimented with leaving the cup on for different times with very little change.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Be careful!</li>
            <li> The results last a mere 20 minutes before going back to me regular lip size.</li>
            <li> Do gently at least twice daily for a few days and the results last longer.</li>
            <li> So if you think you may have a mouth that leans on the smaller side, try this Small Oval!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the small oval and got the medium oval, for freebut none gave me lasting results though:/</li>
            <li> Be careful, if you don&#x27;t do it correctly or get overzealous, you will have some purple to explain!</li>
            <li> Using it looks pretty silly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I forgot to take before and after photos when I first used it; I planned on taking them today, but to my surprise</li>
            <li> I thought it was silly at first</li>
            <li> My husband also has noticed the change along woh other family members.</li>
            <li> had created hundreds of tiny broken blood cells above my lip.</li>
            <li> It sounded so wonderfully dumb, that naturally I had to order it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fun.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a small  red bag with small oval shaped enhancer and as bonus it included a medium oval enhancer,a small lip exfoliating  red brush with their trade mark name printed on it and of course the instructions for the use of your lip enhancers.</li>
            <li> The only piece of advice I would give anyone is to start slow (which is stated in the directions).</li>
            <li> I just had a baby and was feeling so down on myself ...</li>
            <li> and I had a black bruise on my face for a week.</li>
            <li> Just tried for the first time &amp; I&#x27;m already obsessed!</li>
            <li> It does work for a little while but your lips ate bruised for a couple of days after.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it but disappointed once I did.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice.  </li>
            <li> It works for a little while.</li>
            <li> Be careful though..and don&#x27;t suck too hard.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting injections in approximately three months and wanted to just test out sizes and such.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> and my lips seem to stay plump for a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li> if even for just a few moments.  </li>
            <li> Assuming this was the correct way to use it, I was horrified to see just a few seconds with this thing</li>
            <li> I prefer the round one to the oval.</li>
            <li> As i have extremely small lips and have even thought about lip injections as i was not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ordered the small round and it came with a medium oval.</li>
            <li> I bought a small oval because I have a really small mouth (which gives a lot of trouble to my dentist)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the small round and medium ovals for the past week and don&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use; does not easily suck the lips in, due to poor seal between the product and the mouth.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I was using it correctly because I feared bruising my lips</li>
            <li> I read on line to get the size small.</li>
            <li> The size is too small and won&#x27;t work to get a suction.</li>
            <li> I do think the small is just for target areas.</li>
            <li> I ordered the small and got a medium as a bonus ...</li>
            <li> I have tried about every day for the past 2 weeks and still it will not stay on if I do not keep &amp;#34;sucking in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I did get a small brusie</li>
            <li> I have small heart-shaped lips and found what works for me is to put some EOS on before and start with the small oval, but turn it</li>
            <li> :/ didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thin lips either, just average.</li>
            <li> As the instructions say, don&#x27;t suck too hard or it will bruise your lips.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t suck too hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;ve got pale blue sickly lips.</li>
            <li> I usually plump my lips before I go out a couple of times!</li>
            <li> I ordered the small oval and they sent me a medium oval as a gift!  </li>
            <li> I have very small lips</li>
            <li> ONE IS VERY SMALL</li>
            <li> You look ridiculous doing it.</li>
            <li> If it sounds insane, it is, but I have an insanely fuller upper lip vs an upper lip that disappears when I smile.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t determine size until you use it, so it&#x27;s a little expensive for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Btw i had to suck hard for those results and it hurt moderately. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for the one who want to save money</li>
            <li> Dumb purchase for me.</li>
            <li> And as an added bonus the finest customer service, hands down!&lt;br /&gt;Three sizes to choose from and instructions on how to use the lil’ sucker!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to keep on.</li>
            <li> So while the idea may seem stupid, its actually legit and does work once you find the size that works for you.  </li>
            <li> I have the thinnest lips that needed a miracle short of painful expensive filler.  </li>
            <li> I have thin lips</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT WORK for us thin lipped ladies.  </li>
            <li> I have thin lips</li>
            <li> This is one serious confidence booster!</li>
            <li> Highly suggest adding this to your makeup arsenal (just don&#x27;t go too crazy or you will bruise your lips!!!).</li>
            <li> The plastic is too hard compared to others I&#x27;ve used, there is no way to develop any suction because the plastic is too hard :(</li>
            <li> swells lips up perfectly, no surgery needed</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t like that the instructions were so vague.</li>
            <li> -sadly.  </li>
            <li> Sounds silly...</li>
            <li> This is soooo weird.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I hated my small lips.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about anything to avoid lip injections and bought expensive products and none seemed to do the trick for my wittle lips :(.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed  it won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so stupid.</li>
            <li> Really stupid product.  </li>
            <li> We got it as a joke but can&#x27;t hate on it because it does what it says...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say a bad word about them!</li>
            <li> And very painful.</li>
            <li> it surprises me how affected I can get by our insane culture.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This little one is the best. It helps concentrate on smaller sections. Or if you have a smaller mouth it will fit perfect for that. A must have!!</li>
            <li> IS GOOD I SEE  MY LIPS  GET BIGGER  AN WILL GO AWAY QUICKLY ....I THINK I NEED TO DO THIS MORE OFTEN  OVERALL IS OK.</li>
            <li> I really like it! Works for me, I used for  pics, parties, or especial events, my daughter love it too... My mouth is wide and my lips medium, the small oval is too little, but the  medium oval works for me really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out too well for me but I&#x27;m not sure I was using it correctly because I feared bruising my lips so I was using very light suction. Im still excited about my purchase &amp; im going to continue using it until I get the hang of it. The seller is awesome too, she sent an additional enhancer (medium) which was exciting &amp; I received my order 2 days after placing it.. Incredible! Awesome customer service! Thank you Linda!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and this is my alternative to getting botox/fillers.  I feel this may help to keep my lips cute &amp; plump as I age - of course, I&#x27;d have to be consistent in doing it several times per week.  Overall, I&#x27;ve found that it truly does work!</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES the look of her lips after using Full Lips. I think she looks natural too! My dog chewed on a couple so I had to replace them but that is not a problem.  Customer service is excellent as well so I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> It took awhile for it to start working, but once I figured out what worked best for my lips, it did the job. I have to do it every hour or two, but it only takes a few minutes at most and I can do it during my bathroom breaks. I absolutely LOVE this product. I received the small and medium ovals and they work perfectly for my problem areas(upper lip, cupids bow). I recommend this to ANYONE who desires fuller lips.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  Amazing, i was so skeptical until i received my Full lips and tried them personally!  They come in pretty red pouches with directions, tips and how to&#x27;s . This is definatly a beauty A+ in my book, ill keep spreading the word on this amazing , fun, safe and needle free way to get a sexy pout! Thanks Full Lips 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋</li>
            <li> I ordered small oval &amp; got medium oval for free with it! Totally unexpected! Beautiful packaging with a personalized thank you note! Just tried for the first time &amp; I&#x27;m already obsessed!</li>
            <li> This is an effective product and does that it is meant to, however results do not last as long as you might think (30 minutes to an hour) is about what I&#x27;m getting out of it, also be very careful when using it that skin around your lips is not sucked in, I have learned this the hard way with very noticeable bruising around my lower lip&lt;br /&gt;Be careful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for the one who want to save money</li>
            <li> I have very narrow (width wise) lips, but pretty full (height wise), so I went with the small oval and use it vertically. It makes my lips very full.</li>
            <li> You need to do it all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this. Plumps like angelina jolie. Gave one to my mom. Thank you fullips!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on my face. It&#x27;s hard plastic, which doesn&#x27;t make much sense. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I initially saw this product plastered all over my Instagram. I spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on fillers and to be quit frank times are rough and I don&#x27;t want to keep wasting my money away. I saw this product and thought &amp;#34;this is too good to be true&amp;#34; and actually, it kinda is. I ordered the medium size. The seller was nice enough to include the small size as well and I&#x27;m glad she did. it took me a few tries to get it just right. The medium size did nothing for my lips- the small one, however, really made a difference. My lips did look a lot plumper, but it kind of was a little painful and I could tell some of veins in my lips turned blue. The results last a mere 20 minutes before going back to me regular lip size. I will not repurchase, but I am just glad I got to try it myself and realize some things that seem too good to be true, usually are.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use; does not easily suck the lips in, due to poor seal between the product and the mouth. Design needs to definitely  be improved</li>
            <li> Works very well, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This definitely works! However, my lips were bruised for days after. My toddler continuely asks me why I&#x27;m wearing purple lipstick. It looks like I&#x27;ve got pale blue sickly lips. If you wear lipstick everyday to cover up bruising then you&#x27;ll be fine. If you do not wear lipstick on a daily basis, which I often just use a lip cream, might now be amazingly beneficial. I plan on getting injections in approximately three months and wanted to just test out sizes and such.</li>
            <li> I really like these! I ordered the small round and it came with a medium oval. I love both! They both work well and get different areas of your lips so you can get them to look how you want. The results aren&#x27;t permanent of course but I just do it throughout the day! It&#x27;s one of my new favorite things haha love it!</li>
            <li> It does not work. And very painful.</li>
            <li> Dumb purchase for me. Doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, doesn&#x27;t even stay put TO work. I don&#x27;t have thin lips either, just average. Company seems nice, but again, a real waste of money for me. I experimented after trying to use these, I used a shot glass, it actually stayed on unlike these, but quickly removed as I didn&#x27;t want a ring around my mouth! I&#x27;ll just stick with my own lips:)</li>
            <li> They must report that is not for sencibles lips. He puts purple lips</li>
            <li> Came in such cute packaging &amp; the seller wrote a sweet note! -Product WORKS and is fun to use before going out. Highly suggest adding this to your makeup arsenal (just don&#x27;t go too crazy or you will bruise your lips!!!). Attached is a snapchat photo of my bruised lips the next morning (bruised but beautiful haha). My fault completely....I sucked too hard when trying the product the first night, and they hurt! (I&#x27;m a dingus)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can still get your lips big but slow and steady wins the race. Works best when you are well hydrated. Have fun!</li>
            <li> There is no change in my lips at all. I just can&#x27;t seem to get it to enhance my lips.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this. It&#x27;s so stupid. It doesn&#x27;t last long. You look ridiculous doing it. It&#x27;s not fun. It makes you drool into the thing and its gross. It&#x27;s just not for me I guess. I wouldnt recommend it. Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Every Woman in American should own all sizes.  After faithfully using daily every time you apply lip balm and using the medium nightly to really pulling my upper and lower lips in individually, The cumulative effect is LESS noticeable lip lines!!!! I have been using for about 3 weeks!!  Even my friends notice!! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</li>
            <li> absolutely in love!! I can&#x27;t stress enough how this product does work not just to plump your lips but to make them feel better! they feel alive! as we age they get thinner I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments i have gotten! i tried every lip plumper on the market nothing does what this does!!! The packaging was beautiful and I got an extra little present and a sweet personal note from Linda!!! 💜thank you!!</li>
            <li> I like it I just wish it lasted longer than 30 mins</li>
            <li> It does work for a little while but your lips ate bruised for a couple of days after.</li>
            <li> Good product if you want temporary fullness. As the instructions say, don&#x27;t suck too hard or it will bruise your lips. But for one evening or a dance, this gives you great added fullness.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best purchase i have ever made. I have all three of the Fullips Enhancers, but the small over is my absolute FAVOURITE! I love it purely because you can use it vertically as well as horizontally on the middle and both sides of your lips. I came up with a way of stopping bruising, just by simply using the enhancer for 4 minutes a day, starting off in 30 second intervals with 2 minutes break in between and gradually working your way up to 2 minute intervals with a minute break! Work your way up over the course of about 7 days and viola! It really gets your lips used to the enhancer, as well as making the plumpness last sooooo much longer! Mine lasts around 3 hours now, and i only need to do a quick touch up and they&#x27;re full again. The customer service is absolutely amazing, and they&#x27;re so helpful if you don&#x27;t know what size to get and so on, cannot fault them at all! Overall, i absolutely love the enhancers and their liners and lip glosses too, the company is amazing, the products are well made and small enough to just chuck in your bag. Can&#x27;t say a bad word about them! Love love love love love them!!!! 100% worth the money and the little bit of time to get the perfect lips! Lip injections are so last year! -PS - The owner of Fullips is the nicest, kindest, most beautiful woman in the world, no joke.</li>
            <li> Really stupid product.  You ban suck your life away and all I got was discomfort and no results.</li>
            <li> It was a little bigger then I expected. I have to use it more often then I thought I was going too. It doesn&#x27;t make my lips as big as I thought it was going too.</li>
            <li> What does the  color of plastic have to do with this item?</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as expected. Results lasted shorted than expected.</li>
            <li> Results are not what they say they are. I finally saw a noticeable difference after trying many, many times over like an hour period. And results don&#x27;t last very long. It works, but have low expectations.</li>
            <li> I have always been a skeptic when it comes to products that promise to make your lips bigger. I have purchased many lip glosses that promised to make your lips bigger, but really they never did anything other than giving you a tingling feeling for couple of minutes... I came across this gadget and I thought that I should to give it a try since its is only $20, so I wont feel too guilty for spending too much money on it if it didn&#x27;t work. And I am pleasantly surprised, it actually WORKS!!! It is pretty easy to use and it takes less than minute (depending on how big you want your lips to be...I got a large Fullips as a gift that came with my purchase, and I contacted Linda (the owner of this company) asking her if she thinks that Medium will work better since I have really thin lips, and she got back to me right away, and she is sending me the medium size to give it a try :)... So all together this is a great fun product to have, it is very easy to use, and you will receive great customer service, all for $20... I highly recommend :)!</li>
            <li> Definitely wish I&lt;br /&gt;Could get my money back. Made my lips bruised and purple and fat! Hope they don&#x27;t stay purple for too long</li>
            <li> Customer service is the key to a successful business, and Linda nailed that! Thank you so much for your help... Oh yeah, and this product is great! Truly works.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product! It shipped to me within two days!! This gave me my confidence back I hated my small lips. They have awesome customer service as well I emailed them and I got a reply within minutes. I recommend this product/company to all my friends and family! Thank you so much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Let me say, I&#x27;m thirty years old and love the look of full lips, so im no teenager doing the #kyliejennerchallenge. With that said, I have ordered this in all three sizes after my nine year old son found the product on a youtube video about the &amp;#34;dumbest things to buy.&amp;#34;  It sounded so wonderfully dumb, that naturally I had to order it.  Confession: I have been plumping my lips with various lotion caps through suction prior with great results, so why not splurge on a device actually created for it? What I like about this is that it is oval, and fits over the mouth better than a standard lotion cap, and I get best suction on the small oval. The rim is also thicker than a general bottle cap, and therefore doesn&#x27;t leave a deep indentation on the lips.  I don&#x27;t like to get any area around my lip, just the pink part only, which is why I prefer the small oval best.  The medium is a bit more difficult to get the suction just on the lip, and the large round is just too large. Does it hurt? Well, the discomfort comes from the actual act of suctioning the lips, rather from the device itself.  Because lets be real, its like giving your own mouth a hickey. If it sounds insane, it is, but I have an insanely fuller upper lip vs an upper lip that disappears when I smile. And yeah, the results may be temporary, but so liquid lip plumpers and the makeup I wash off my mug every night. And perhaps over time this will stimulate blood flow, just as facial cupping is an acupuncture technique that does the same for plumping wrinkles.  So while the idea may seem stupid, its actually legit and does work once you find the size that works for you.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> I read on line to get the size small. The size is too small and won&#x27;t work to get a suction. I am really disappointed  it won&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t even know how to exchange the product.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!! Do gently at least twice daily for a few days and the results last longer. I also like to use a lip plumper gloss to make results even better. Don&#x27;t suck too hard I gave myself bruising that lasted 3 days because I didn&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to use. They sent me a second one, the medium oval as well. I was happily surprised and it has found use too! Works great as a temportary lip plumper</li>
            <li> Its great! I would reccoment getting the largest round size, as the other two don&#x27;t fit around my lips (I use them to target certain areas). Also the customer service was AMAZING. I always got replies within 24 hours with my questions and they even sent me a free large enhancer and lip gloss when I expressed the small oval wasn&#x27;t working. Very sincere. My boyfriend has commented on my lips several times saying they look more plump. The effects last 2-4 hours and over time they have become more permanately fuller.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it but disappointed once I did. It would plump my bottom lip and not my tablet. Also the plump only lasted about half hour.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice.  The effect lasts for maybe an hour but it is fun while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for women without live in Jackson. I use them and it really works and plump sure lips up very nicely. Contacted customer service for a particular reason and she was extremely courteous and very prompt and her response. Overall hundred percent satisfied and highly recommend the seller and the product</li>
            <li> This product really does what it claims to do, but sadly the results don&#x27;t last forever (which I know isn&#x27;t the fault of the manufacturer). I do love to use them and will do it before an event. Great product.</li>
            <li> It comes with a DVD instruction,but I didn&#x27;t actually watch it. It makes your lips huge temporarily but with continued use it does keep them  a little plumper.. It can turn them black and blue if you don&#x27;t do it carefully.kind of pricey for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> swells lips up perfectly, no surgery needed</li>
            <li> I have thin lips so I figured I would give this product a try based on all the positive reviews.  This product DOES NOT WORK for us thin lipped ladies.  Maybe if you already have big lips this thing makes them even bigger, but it did absolutely nothing on my little bird lips.  Save your money!!</li>
            <li> It does work and maybe if you’re very committed it can last a bit but I didn’t get much time with full lips for the amount of work I put in.</li>
            <li> It is not often that I receive an item so impressive that it prompts me to leave a review. In this case, not only does the product give true results, but the customer service is absolutely incredible. I received a free medium oval as a gift with my purchase (another $20 value), and a lovely, handwritten note from the seller with my instructions. Everything came beautifully packaged in red organza bags, and shipping only took a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more of these as gifts. Now I want to try the large round enhancer for myself as well. I&#x27;m impressed, Fullips!</li>
            <li> I love my fullips enhancer. I usually plump my lips before I go out a couple of times! The only defaul is that they dont stay very long</li>
            <li> I seem to be the only one who doesn&#x27;t like this product. it didn&#x27;t make any difference in lip size and I had a black bruise on my face for a week.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well at plumping my top lip which I&#x27;m focusing on getting more symmetrical in size with my bottom lip. They give you a bonus lip enhancer (I got the medium as my freebie) which is awesome! I only use this for before a date or trying out a makeup look where I want a more pouty look. The results don&#x27;t last unless you repeat it. Thank you full lips :)</li>
            <li> I bought a small oval because I have a really small mouth (which gives a lot of trouble to my dentist) but I receive the 3 item pack instead because as I currently live in France it was to far away to exchange, so thanks a lot to fullips for thinking ahead!, But I&#x27;m not thinking about returning any of them, it really works!! I&#x27;m taking the time to write a stellar review for this product and all of the people behind it because such a personal customer service is seldom seen anymore and it deserves to be more widely known especially since their products are so great!! You can be sure that in New Caledonia where I normally live, i&#x27;m gonna spread the word!!!</li>
            <li> It works when used as directed, but results do not last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Coming from a 20 year old, I think the product does what it say it will do. Its small, portable, and very easy to use. The material was a little harder than I expected, but after getting use to, it&#x27;s simple. I do think the small is just for target areas. I&#x27;m considering trying out the middle oval one to see if better results are achieved! Satisfied overall!</li>
            <li> I love it even though it only lasts for a short period of time.. it&#x27;s fun to use it when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup too.. actually that might be my favorite time to use it  :)</li>
            <li> Love this Small Oval!!! The Large Round was wayyy too big .... couldn&#x27;t get it to work or even stay on! The Medium Oval was a little too big .... I could get it to work, but it poufed out the outside corners of my mouth in an unflattering way. But this Small Oval is PERFECT!  I use it on my whole mouth (top and bottom lips at same time), and it gives me the center fullness and pouty-ness that I want, without making the corners of my mouth pouf out. Perfect! So if you think you may have a mouth that leans on the smaller side, try this Small Oval!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company and Great products!  :)</li>
            <li> I have very small lips and my lips don&#x27;t fit in the large ones. The plastic is too hard compared to others I&#x27;ve used, there is no way to develop any suction because the plastic is too hard :(</li>
            <li> Thank you for the freebie! Loving it!</li>
            <li> I truly loved this purchase. It was an easy, and surgery-free way to get full lips for a night. When I want a little extra oomph to my look, I use it. I definitely would recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s inexpensive and so fun!</li>
            <li> I love this .  It really works  . The only con is that it makes my lips purple like a bruise .  I  do it and remove it right away because of the bruising  so I don&#x27;t get the full effects of it .  It may just be me .  It does plump up your lips and it looks awesome .  I ordered the small and got a medium as a bonus ... Love , love , love !!!! Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants full lips without the expense of injections and a huge dent I ones wallet .</li>
            <li> Love this product! Really does plump my lips. She even sent me the medium oval one to try and i love it.</li>
            <li> It came so fast! And it works! buy it!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to keep on. I have tried about every day for the past 2 weeks and still it will not stay on if I do not keep &amp;#34;sucking in&amp;#34;. However, one time I was able to keep it on and it did make my lips temporarily bigger</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product out there! Fuller, healthier-looking lips without a medical procedure. And as an added bonus the finest customer service, hands down!&lt;br /&gt;Three sizes to choose from and instructions on how to use the lil’ sucker! Of course the beautifully plumped effect does not last forever, maybe a few hours. No worries, the lip enhancer is small enough to fit in your handbag. A quick re-plump and your lips are luscious as ever.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product! 5 star! Top Notch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit the website www.fullips.com as they are currently honoring women who have dealt with ER + breast cancer. The campaign is called KISSING CANCER GOODBYE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world needs more people like the founder, Linda Gomez.</li>
            <li> It does work on my lips but only for 10 min. I wish it last longer because I liked  the effect,  but it didn&#x27;t  (((</li>
            <li> This is very good, but only if you get the right size. You can&#x27;t determine size until you use it, so it&#x27;s a little expensive for a piece of plastic. If it came with two different sizes, this would be a five star product.</li>
            <li> This is tricky. It didn&#x27;t work exactly like on video. It&#x27;s a bit of work and if you&#x27;re not careful you will hurt your lips and mouth.</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered this product she used it for a couple days and then gave up. It works for a little while.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!! I PURCHASED it off of hear and it came so fast and is so easy to use. I would recommend buying it off of the original web site you will get more product from the seller. For one price.</li>
            <li> It works. But only for like 10-15 mins then it starts to go back down. So I guess it&#x27;s good for a couple of selfie. ........</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use with instant results. Doesn&#x27;t last very long, but my lips look very smooth once the puffiness does go down and the fine lines have disappeared. It&#x27;s a great was to tighten the skin around your mouth. Just make sure to keep using a good lip balm while using this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I love the packaging, it&#x27;s easy to use, and I got immediate results. Goes great with the new lipstick I got.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much!!!  Amazing customer service. Linda is a doll, I love my extra!</li>
            <li> It definately works but results go away within the hour. I have thin lips and it did plump them up a lot and they looked great but was sad to see them start deflating after 30 mins. Btw i had to suck hard for those results and it hurt moderately. :(</li>
            <li> Amazing! Wow.  I def recommend this product.  Make sure you read the directions and watch the videos.  I did end up with bruising but only because I didn&#x27;t watch the video.  Product really really works and is a great alternative for needle free plump lips! I can&#x27;t wait to share with my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Made my lips look luscious and full! The customer service was absolutely amazing too. And my fullips arrived so fast! Be careful though..and don&#x27;t suck too hard. I did get a small brusie but I should have been more careful!</li>
            <li> Love this so much!!!! Absolutely effective and completely worth it. The personal details in the packaging are so dear; the company clearly cares for this product. I have small heart-shaped lips and found what works for me is to put some EOS on before and start with the small oval, but turn it so it&#x27;s vertical and not horizontal (I hope this makes sense). Then, I switch to the medium oval (vertical not horizontal), and for the first time in my life, I have actual lips. Recommend this 1,000 percent, but there is a learning curve. You have to play with it and figure out what sizes and techniques work for you.</li>
            <li> I would really like this product if the effects lasted for longer than a half hour. And I didn&#x27;t like that the instructions were so vague. You basically have to create suction in your mouth with one of the cups on in order to make your lips be drawn into the cups. Once I figured that out, I didn&#x27;t mind the process at all, and the effects looked really awesome if you overlook some pinkness around your lips (which I did, because my foundation/concealer would cover the redness right up with no problem). However, the effects last maybe a half hour. I was so disappointed. I experimented with leaving the cup on for different times with very little change. Even when I left the product on for more than 20 minutes it still didn&#x27;t give me any effect longer than an hour. I gave it two stars because it basically does what it promises, but knocked off three stars because what is the point of using it if the effect is so short-lived?</li>
            <li> Leaves bruises on my lips!!!</li>
            <li> This  really works!! First time I tried it I got a bruise,  I went too hard on it. Since, I&#x27;ve been more delicate and am so happy with the results. My lips are plump and so cute.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> It works for like 20 mins then your lips go back to normal :/ didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> I had been researching this product for some time until I finally decided to order. Once received, I was amazed at how well this product worked. It is foolproof and will work for anyone! The only piece of advice I would give anyone is to start slow (which is stated in the directions). This product can and will bruise your lips! Amazing, amazing product!</li>
            <li> Just made my lips red</li>
            <li> These ingenious little devices are incredible!! I use them before photoshootsall the time and the effect really does last for a few hours. And the Iinventor is so nice! She sent a beautifuly decorated package and an unexpected free gift.</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm. The first couple of times, my lips turned purple. However the more I used it, that stopped happening. When it arrives, it comes in a cute little drawstring bag with a handwritten note from the maker. AND mine actually came with a complimentary medium sized fullip enhancer too. SO COOL!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review:: First, I would like to say, I got this product way sooner than I thought I would. Which is so nice, because I got it prior to my birthday. A pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I got an medium size one as a gift!! Talk about double whammy!&lt;br /&gt;I already tried the product and I am very excited with the results. I didn&#x27;t use it too much, since I have sensitive skin I didn&#x27;t want to bruise. :) I can see my lips plumping and filling out already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again. This product is a very genius idea for those of us who refuse to use plastic surgeons to get the look we want.</li>
            <li> Great seller and product. Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging and the seller sent an extra medium (I order the small) lip plumper!  I haven&#x27;t use this much, but when I do it really works!!</li>
            <li> WHOA lips! works really well... almost too well ;)</li>
            <li> Aaamazing product shows real results instantly.</li>
            <li> I just received this product. I  purchased this product to try and have been amazed on how this product seemed to be working for a lot of people. I have friends who have it and seen a craze of it on you tube. As i have extremely small lips and have even thought about lip injections as i was not very satisfied. Hence, i wanted to really avoid this. I have tried just about anything to avoid lip injections and bought expensive products and none seemed to do the trick for my wittle lips :(. Until now...I can honestly say this product does work.  I was pretty impressed by it, though i would have to play with it more and get use to it to get the desire lip shape  and structure  as my mouth and lips are pretty small -sadly.  The product arrived in a small  red bag with small oval shaped enhancer and as bonus it included a medium oval enhancer,a small lip exfoliating  red brush with their trade mark name printed on it and of course the instructions for the use of your lip enhancers. I recommend this to people who are in need of lip help and want inexpensive and temporary results.</li>
            <li> This product does MOST of what it says. It can make your lips more plump. BUT, for me at least ,no matter how long or many times I did it, it only lasted about 4 minutes, then it completely went away. This did not last at all! For the price I bought it for and it not lasting at all I really would not recommend this. When you see it its pretty much just a little plastic thing. It is fun for the first few days, but I don&#x27;t recommend wasting money on this especially if want more lasting results at least like 30 min. would&#x27;ve been good. The package it came in was very nice! And they sent another enhancer for free. I ordered the small oval and got the medium oval, for freebut none gave me lasting results though:/</li>
            <li> I ordered the small oval and they sent me a medium oval as a gift!  Came with a carrying bag for each one and an exfoliation brush.  Personally thought it was pretty simple to figure out and my lips seem to stay plump for a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed! I was hesitate to order this but I don&#x27;t know why! Buy this one and she sends you a FREE medium one! Thank you so very much! I just had a baby and was feeling so down on myself ... And this makes me feel pretty!!! Sounds silly... But I have always wanted my lips done!</li>
            <li> I really tried a half a dozen times and aside from giving me a big red ring around my mouth my small lips look the same, just too much effort for me to even try again. I got no suction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This is soooo weird.  We got it as a joke but can&#x27;t hate on it because it does what it says...if even for just a few moments.  Be careful, if you don&#x27;t do it correctly or get overzealous, you will have some purple to explain!</li>
            <li> These work great but the plumpness doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour but maybe my lips need to get use to it. Other than that...works great!</li>
            <li> I feel this product needs clearer instructions and warnings against misuse/possible harm that may occur when trying to figure out how to use it. The instructions basically tell you that you&#x27;ll find your own way of figuring it out. I found when I used this it was easier to have it suck in 1 lip rather than both, since the crack between wouldn&#x27;t allow the suction to hold for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to my top lip only, and when inhaling it had a very strong grip. Assuming this was the correct way to use it, I was horrified to see just a few seconds with this thing had created hundreds of tiny broken blood cells above my lip. I had to cover it with makeup and was self conscious about it all night. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the small round and medium ovals for the past week and don&#x27;t notice any difference at all. Just another overpriced piece of plastic people buy into because they want to believe it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned my enhancers for a few hours now, but this is the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent on a beauty product! This is one serious confidence booster! I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious about my thin upper lip, especially when I smile, but thanks to this thing I&#x27;ve got a much more noticeable lip line. Using it looks pretty silly and it is a bit awkward to use at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to figure out what method you&#x27;re comfortable with. Do yourself a favor and watch the how-to video! It&#x27;s easy to find on their website. If used incorrectly, you will probably break some blood vessels and end up with a red ring around your mouth, so I highly recommend you watch it before trying to use your enhancer. I received both a small and medium oval (thank you very much for the complimentary gift by the way!) so I used the medium for overall fullness on my upper lip and then used the small vertically to plump both. Did I get a Jolie pout? No; it does have its limits, so don&#x27;t buy this expecting it to work miracles! However, I can personally vouch for fuller, plumper, and in my case pinker, NATURAL-LOOKING lips without the long-term commitment, risk, and price-tag of injections. (Reposted on 2/14/15 to add photos. Unfortunately I forgot to take before and after photos when I first used it; I planned on taking them today, but to my surprise my lips were still a bit plump when I woke up, so I included an older photo to show how my lips looked before.)</li>
            <li> I actually liked the big oval and recommend it for everyone even if you have small lips. I love how it came packaged very nice!</li>
            <li> This really works. I have the thinnest lips that needed a miracle short of painful expensive filler.  I was skeptical but now I am a believer. My lips are actually plumped after use. Lips look naturally fuller. My lips stay plumper for about 30 minutes to an hour. The longer you use it the fuller and longer the plumping lasts. It does not hurt to use. You may get a tingling sensation. I am 45 years old and I can tell you the plumper minimizes tiny lips creases.  I prefer the round one to the oval. The company is awesome. They sent it packaged very nicely with a thank you card.</li>
            <li> Not Permanent but works perfectly, it doesn&#x27;t last hours though, but maybe it&#x27;s bc I don&#x27;t do it enough. I never have gotten bruised lips or any red ring marks around my lips what so ever!! And I used a lot throughout the day trust me...haha but yeah it&#x27;s great for a selfie, I would say it lasts for an hour it decreases but it does last for just about an hour.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!!!! I&#x27;m still fine tuning the size and buying more but the instant results are so satisfying, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It works, does cause a crease on my upper lip... But goes away.  The plump only last a few minutes so far... and I am trying to figure out why I want to suck on something to make my lips bigger? it surprises me how affected I can get by our insane culture. hahaha!</li>
            <li> They sent me two! Nice surprise. It really works. But doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wished.</li>
            <li> Loved it and the customer service was incredible. I recommended to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> ONE IS VERY SMALL THE OTHER VERY BIG. TIME CONSUMING.</li>
            <li> Did not enhance my lips.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today and I only have good things to say about it! As someone who uses a ton of different lip products, I am really impressed with what this little piece of plastic can do! Here are the pros of this device/company: (1) Speedy delivery- I received it about a week earlier than estimated (2) Very cute packaging- it comes in a cute bag with a handwritten note and very straightforward directions (3) I received a second, medium sized lip enhancer for free! (4) The results are amazing! I have a naturally fuller bottom lip but fairly thin upper lip- I was playing around with it and ended up making my upper lip larger than my bottom lip! It looked like I was stung by a bee or something haha (4) Unlike gloss lip plumpers, I am never going to &amp;#34;run out&amp;#34; of this device and need to buy more. (5) Although the effects are temporary (about 2 hours), it is very easy to carry around and reapply [there are reviews and how-to videos on youtube you should check out if you are hesitant to buy it]. Plus, it is way cheaper than lip injections. Overall, I love this product and only wish I had known about it earlier! I will definitely be recommending this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using the large round full lip enhancer for about 2 weeks &amp; seen a huge difference in my lips. I thought it was silly at first but you see results instantly then over time!I already have full lips my bottom more than the top, and now both lips look more full and pouty. comes wih cute thank you note and instructions. My husband also has noticed the change along woh other family members. Thanks Full lips!</li>
            <li> It really work for 20- 30min it plumpes your lips you just have to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say yes it was in the mail today!!! Thnx linda so much for emailing me so quick but it was I&#x27;m my mail today!!! &amp; I&#x27;m happy thmx so much!! &amp; thmx for the extra cup!!!!! I&#x27;m so excited :)</li>
