            <li>A lot better than those ban cooling cloths - this actually works.</li>
            <li>It really gives that fresh feeling after the shower.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that you got more for your money.</li>
            <li>Feels like you put your junk in the freezer for about 2 minutes haha !</li>
            <li>Dial body wash is what I like because it foams well and is pretty slippery.</li>
            <li>This is my change of pace soap from Jack Black&#x27;s Turbo Wash.  Love the smell and the clean tingle</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely LOVES this soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like the pine scented body wash and shampoo from Bigelow.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have sent this to my father.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil really makes you feel a chill after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Very invigorating.  </li>
            <li>in a hot shower, the whole bathroon will have the aroma in the air, and you breath so clear</li>
            <li>I typically buy whatever soaps/shampoos/bodywashes that are on sale, however, I love the feel of mentholated products on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a decent wash</li>
            <li>I would love to get a refund, but I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s possible with health and personal care items.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Chills you down, keeps you cool for a long time - and the scent is pretty light so it doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>I normally like classic apothecary products like this one, but this is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other products aren&#x27;t as strong smelling as this one.  </li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, so I can&#x27;t really rate it as far as it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>It also helps him cool off after a long workout.</li>
            <li>I decided to try out CO Bigelow&#x27;s mentha wash and WOW!</li>
            <li>The slight bit of peppermint oil gives just a light “tingle”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for this Amazon-purchased product, I don&#x27;t know whether it sat upon a shelf in direct sunlight,</li>
            <li>remained in storage far too long, or is just plain counterfeit, but it isn&#x27;t half as good as the same-named item I bought at the mall.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it have a fabulous mint scent that is not \\&quot;herby\\&quot; or mixed with other things like rosemary (as so many other minty body washes are), but you also get a little cooling sensation from it.  </li>
            <li>Also, think twice before scrubbing that area down there with this gel, because you&#x27;ll feel a cold fire burning and It feels good ;).</li>

            <li> Granted, you might want to stay away from your “naughty bits” if they are extra sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looking for minty shower gel for a long time and finally found what i want.</li>
            <li> I use this body wash in the morning as a face wash and it definitely pops my eyes open due to the mintyness (like a slap in the face</li>
            <li> , it cools you down instantly</li>
            <li> This soap looked green which instantly appealed to the \\&quot;minty\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would be extremely minty.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product because I have trouble waking up in the morning and wanted a body wash with a little \\&quot;zing\\&quot; for the senses to wake me up in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The Bigelow product foam isn&#x27;t very slick, so you can only wash one body part</li>
            <li> For less than half the price Dial lasts me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also dried my skin out which was something I thought the vitamins would prevent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that little pick-me-up in the shower, try this stuff!</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to.</li>
            <li> and I bought this soap because it&#x27;s hard to find on with peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already a little chilly in the house.</li>
            <li> It has a weak peppermint smell, almost a stale fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This body wash is not for the faint of heart in the menthol department.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel cold after the shower</li>
            <li> so i do not recommend using it during cold weather.</li>
            <li> lather was horrible and the mint smell to strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really like the pine scented body wash and shampoo from Bigelow. They get me moving every morning in the shower. They have a clean, fresh scent which seems  very natural. I think I purchased the end of the supply from Amazon. I hope the products come back.</li>
            <li> This body wash made my body tingle. I love the fresh minty smell. Would buy again. My boyfriend also liked it.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use it, well him only sometimes...but we both like it.  It&#x27;s a nice way to wake up and it feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my change of pace soap from Jack Black&#x27;s Turbo Wash.  Love the smell and the clean tingle it leaves you.  Would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law, so I can&#x27;t really rate it as far as it&#x27;s use. He does use this on a regular basis, so I expect that he is happy with the product.  I was just happy that it was in stock and arrived before Christmas.</li>
            <li> SO nice for the Florida heat! The only thing I wish is that you got more for your money.</li>
            <li> birthday gift - great fragrance and loves it...uses it everyday! Good product - would recommended it to whom ever...needs it</li>
            <li> This body wash is not for the faint of heart in the menthol department. It makes you feel extremely cool and tingly (which I prefer and enjoy), plus it leaves your skin feeling extremely fresh and clean (and not overly dry). I use this body wash in the morning as a face wash and it definitely pops my eyes open due to the mintyness (like a slap in the face lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you truly enjoy minty freshness in your stuff, you&#x27;ll love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product :)</li>
            <li> This makes my skin tingle and the scent also makes my lungs open up like a sanua bath. I like it so much that I have sent this to my father.</li>
            <li> Gives me tingly feeling all over !</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash. I&#x27;d suggest you use it in the summer time. The peppermint oil really makes you feel a chill after you get out of the shower. I think it&#x27;s great in the morning to help wake you up. What I don&#x27;t like is when I use it in the winter and it&#x27;s already a little chilly in the house. Feels like you put your junk in the freezer for about 2 minutes haha ! Try it and you&#x27;ll know I&#x27;m not making this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would get almost 5 stars, but I have to use ALOT because it doesn&#x27;t foam up well. It would be better if I used a Poof but I&#x27;m a man and I use a wash cloth. Dial body wash is what I like because it foams well and is pretty slippery. I can was my body with a lesser amount and cost. The Bigelow product foam isn&#x27;t very slick, so you can only wash one body part and then you have to add more gel to continue washing. I only get about a months use out of one bottle. For less than half the price Dial lasts me about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they would improve the foaming I could give it 4.5 stars. -.5stars for overpriced.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the strength of the aroma of this product.  Very invigorating.  Other products aren&#x27;t as strong smelling as this one.  If you want a strong menthol/peppermint aroma while you bathe, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> I normally like classic apothecary products like this one, but this is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather was horrible and the mint smell to strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow is still my number one for shaving products though...just not soap and body wash.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product because I have trouble waking up in the morning and wanted a body wash with a little \\&quot;zing\\&quot; for the senses to wake me up in the shower.  This totally does the trick.  Not only does it have a fabulous mint scent that is not \\&quot;herby\\&quot; or mixed with other things like rosemary (as so many other minty body washes are), but you also get a little cooling sensation from it.  If you&#x27;re looking for that little pick-me-up in the shower, try this stuff!</li>
            <li> Strong scent not weak like so many others&lt;br /&gt;The soap makes your body tingle when you use it&lt;br /&gt;You realy feel clean afterward</li>
            <li> My husband loves feeling minty fresh and clean after using it.  It also helps him cool off after a long workout.</li>
            <li> Great for post-workout shower.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this then you&#x27;re already set on buying this product. My job is to give you my opinion on my experience with this product. I&#x27;ll give my honest feedback below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap was pricey but I thought it would be extremely minty. As a guy, I really love the smell and tingle of mint on my body. This soap looked green which instantly appealed to the \\&quot;minty\\&quot; feel. When you smell it through the bottle, it smells a very strong aroma of peppermint. This is where the excitement stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t tingle past the first wash and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smelling like peppermint. It also dried my skin out which was something I thought the vitamins would prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a decent wash but Dove is much cheaper and provides better results. The price of this product is triple the price it should be for the quality. Save your money and buy another product.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a mall health &amp; beauty chain store; and I totally loved the effect.  That product had a wonderful peppermint fragrance and gently, but noticeably, exfoliated during use, resulting in a tingly, fragrant clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this Amazon-purchased product, I don&#x27;t know whether it sat upon a shelf in direct sunlight, remained in storage far too long, or is just plain counterfeit, but it isn&#x27;t half as good as the same-named item I bought at the mall.  It has a weak peppermint smell, almost a stale fragrance.  It somewhat irritates my skin, by drying it out.  And, it doesn&#x27;t really clean as well as the first product I bought.  I would love to get a refund, but I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s possible with health and personal care items.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to. They need to make more manly items that are refreshing and tingly</li>
            <li> I love showering with mint body washes, just like the smell &amp; the cleanliness I feel.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that actually gives you the nice minty tingly cool feeling UNTIL I found this.  It is awesome!!  I live in a hot climate &amp; this is wonderful to use after a hot day, it cools you down instantly &amp;  just makes you feel super fresh.  worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and LOVE it.  The smell is amazing.  The feel is wonderful.  Granted, you might want to stay away from your “naughty bits” if they are extra sensitive.  The slight bit of peppermint oil gives just a light “tingle”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From C.O. Bigelow. . . . .&lt;br /&gt;Our mint-infused body wash provides an invigorating sensation while cleansing and refreshing skin. Our wake-you-up formula deeply nourishes with Vitamins A, C &amp; E to keep skin extra-healthy and looking its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Infused with cooling peppermint for an invigorating experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Made in USA</li>
            <li> Love it. the Aroma in the shower, the feel on your body, the cool/ warmth tingle.. so relaxing and breathless feel.. in a hot shower, the whole bathroon will have the aroma in the air, and you breath so clear and it just feels good..</li>
            <li> The order arrived early and in the expected condition. I was given this as a gift and really enjoy it and it&#x27;s nice to not need to drive quite some distance for a particular interest.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of peppermint and I bought this soap because it&#x27;s hard to find on with peppermint scent. It not only leaves you smelling fresh and clean, but the cool and relaxing sensation is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Really nice, refreshing feeling. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! The best mental body wash I&#x27;ve tried to date. Feels so refreshing!</li>
