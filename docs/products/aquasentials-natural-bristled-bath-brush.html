    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These things are great, just don&#x27;t try to use them forever.</li>
            <li>These were a great price for a tool to be used for a while and then pitched.</li>
            <li>Works great...  </li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>The Aquasential brush looks good and feels nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it alot.</li>
            <li>Oh well, the handle has a nice curve,</li>
            <li>I have ordered others and really liked them.</li>
            <li>Excellent brush with soft bristles.</li>
            <li>and I have NOT gotten a full 30days use from it!!</li>
            <li>brush works well, pleased with how you can remove from the handle to use as a hand brush</li>
            <li>and I can no longer reach my back, and this brush has been perfect.    </li>
            <li>But since you&#x27;re reading reviews and people have mentioned this, you will know better, yes?</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, I just kind of push the head of the brush into the handle to make sure it&#x27;s still secure.</li>
            <li>There are more bristles falling out as I run my hand across the bristles, and the handle is shorter by an inch and thinner.  </li>
            <li>This two part brush solves  the problem of too many implements in the shower or in a tub.</li>
            <li>OK for the price.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job and feels good on the back!</li>
            <li>needed a longer handle, &amp; this one fit the bill!</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and great</li>
            <li>the brush bristles are just right softness, length of handle good, light weight, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The handle comes off too easy when you don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li>I question the advisability of a strap, since the brush head slips off the handle so easily even when you don&#x27;t want it to.  </li>
            <li>Handle is both secure on the brush and easily removed.  </li>
            <li>This is a great back brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for a few months and it is still perfect.</li>
            <li>Stay clean....  </li>
            <li>This greatly shortened life to less than one year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now back for replacement, so glad to see it is still available.</li>
            <li>Still worth getting in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Soaps well and easy to use and clean, but the 1\\&quot; natural bristles crush after a month or so.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush with natural bristles, works very well, but the brush and wood handle are designed to seperate, which means head</li>
            <li>great stiff body brush.  </li>
            <li>Nicely finished, not bare wood.</li>
            <li>The brush part is nice enough, but the head does fall off the handle pretty often.</li>
            <li>Pros: very nice length, comfortable handle, stiff natural bristles  </li>
            <li>Great little scrub brush, particularly for the price.  </li>
            <li>We love these back brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it anyway for almost a year, but am looking for better back brush.    </li>
            <li>and the handle doesn&#x27;t even fit right into the slot on back!</li>
            <li>This brush was fine for the first 3 weeks, but after only 3 weeks of being in our shower, it grew mold.</li>
            <li>The head is not too large to be cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li>Back to square one to finding the perfect shower brush ... not too hard .. not too soft ??</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really use the handle.</li>
            <li>She really loves the brush.</li>
            <li>My wife is now very pleased with her long handled \\&quot;back only\\&quot; brush.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are still straight and full after 6 months of use unlike my last brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, bristles are excellent, none have broken, curled or bent in daily use, and don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>Good brush, but removable handle is poorly designed.</li>
            <li>and so when I got these new ones I decided to fix that problem.  </li>
            <li>I bought water proof wood glue at Home Depot and as soon and the new brushes arrived</li>
            <li>Just got a new one and thought I&#x27;d post a review.    </li>
            <li>Got the new ones and the quality seems to be lower.  </li>
            <li>I have not had the problem of the brush coming out of the handle yet, but I suspect that if one is careful and scrubbing gently, there&#x27;s no reason for the brush to just pop right out.</li>
            <li>Over the years I tried several more expensive brushes and like this one as well or better.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I saw when unwrapping this brush was big printed label attached to the brush warning me the brush head needed replacement every 1-3 months.    </li>
            <li>TO SOFT FOR ME!</li>
            <li>My wife uses this brush and likes its long handle and finds the bristles to be comfortable when washing her back.  </li>
            <li>Prior to this purchase, I exclusively purchased my shower essentials at WHOLE FOODS.</li>
            <li>Haha, the head fell off yesterday, only took 4 days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely surprised to see AMAZON selling junk.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush mainly for scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li>I found this product very helpful since I have back problems and unable to reach; this brush worked the best to reach those hard to get areas;</li>
            <li>Due to expansion and shrinkage in the wood (wet to dry), the plastic broke releasing many bristles.</li>
            <li>The brush barely lasted 20 days.  </li>
            <li>I used to have this problem with my old back brush</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness and not too harsh.</li>
            <li>Did lose three bristle groups during the first few uses, but</li>
            <li>Every few brushes I have a problem with the head coming off but quickly learned that when the brush is wet you can tamp head down on the floor by the handle and it wedges securely (or super glue it when dry).  </li>
            <li>This brush was a gift the person I gave it to really likes it, The only thing he wish&#x27;s is that the handle be a little longer.</li>

            <li> Next question, how long will the bristles last?  </li>
            <li> Long story short ...</li>
            <li> The handle is just long enough.</li>
            <li> It gives off a very strong and unpleasant chemical odor, I&#x27;m assuming from the glue they use to stick the plastic piece that holds the bristles onto the wood brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; long.  </li>
            <li> Of note the detachable end does occasionally fall off so be careful of your toes when showering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of this model brush over the years and mine last perhaps six months before the bristles wear down.  </li>
            <li> We only have 1 tub, the other shower is a stand alone..  </li>
            <li> Regarding some of the other reviews:  Comparable brushes usually cost up to 3x as much  If you hang your brush up after use, it will be less likely to come apart when you don&#x27;t want it to  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a half dozen bath brushes in the last two years trying to find one that wasn&#x27;t too stiff or too soft, and that also wouldn&#x27;t crack and start losing bristles after a month.  </li>
            <li> Not worth sending back, going into the trash.</li>
            <li> This item was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> She complained that the brush head frequently slips off the handle and falls to the shower floor.  </li>
            <li> this is a total waste of $.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to do it last few brushes.  </li>
            <li> Not a very encouraging start.    </li>
            <li> I should have spent my $$$$ at THE DOLLAR STORE.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are also softer than any other bath brush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> At least for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and haven&#x27;t had this problem so far.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money paid.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the head is not permanently attached and can slide off the end.</li>
            <li> so I tamp it down.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes wore down to less than 1/8 inch after using in the shower less than 10 times.</li>
            <li> A little glue can fix this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The brittles are no longer firm ,.. they have compounded themselves into the wooded section of the brush.  </li>
            <li> I had to put a small screw in it to hold it on.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m cleaner - at least for a month or two before the brush head wears out.  </li>
            <li> Item pictured is wood, natural bristled- item I received is a nasty translucent green plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s not enough, it smells horrible!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> ON BATH BRUSHES HARD!!!</li>
            <li> They get dirty and just need to be thrown out.</li>
            <li> I had to modify the brush by cutting away the strap and attaching the brush</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great stiff body brush.  I liked it alot.</li>
            <li> These things are great, just don&#x27;t try to use them forever. They get dirty and just need to be thrown out. These were a great price for a tool to be used for a while and then pitched.</li>
            <li> This brush was fine for the first 3 weeks, but after only 3 weeks of being in our shower, it grew mold. We threw it away. I didn&#x27;t expect it to last forever, since it&#x27;s wood, but 3 weeks?! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and great but I don&#x27;t really use the handle. I have not had the problem of the brush coming out of the handle yet, but I suspect that if one is careful and scrubbing gently, there&#x27;s no reason for the brush to just pop right out. At least for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and haven&#x27;t had this problem so far.</li>
            <li> Good brush, but removable handle is poorly designed. The handle comes off too easy when you don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li> I regularly used these &#x27;type&#x27; brushed to wash &amp; exfoliate in the shower.  Prior to this purchase, I exclusively purchased my shower essentials at WHOLE FOODS. However, they have discontinued selling these type items ( in my store) . So, after a bit of research I found this one by Aquasentials.    Long story short ... this is a total waste of $.  I use it for showers once/day .. and I have NOT gotten a full 30days use from it!! Its already falling apart.  The brittles are no longer firm ,.. they have compounded themselves into the wooded section of the brush.  I WOULD NOT REPURCHASE THE AQUASENTIALS BRUSH nor would I recommend.  The brush barely lasted 20 days.  Back to square one to finding the perfect shower brush ... not too hard .. not too soft ?? Help, anyone ? PLS ...</li>
            <li> I like the lenght and price. The head is always coming off. I think it is designed too but I wish it stay on when you wanted it to.</li>
            <li> solution to the complaints about the brush coming off the handle.  I used to have this problem with my old back brush and so when I got these new ones I decided to fix that problem.  I bought water proof wood glue at Home Depot and as soon and the new brushes arrived I glued the brush to the handle on 2 of them, took the brush off the 3rd and tossed the handle.  Works great...  the brush bristles are just right softness, length of handle good, light weight, easy to use.  I have a command plastic hook in each shower with the back brush hanging there...  and the spare brush rests in the tub edge.  We only have 1 tub, the other shower is a stand alone..  I could put a brush on a command hook in there if I end up needing one.  We love these back brushes.</li>
            <li> I found this product very helpful since I have back problems and unable to reach; this brush worked the best to reach those hard to get areas; A+++++  Thank You!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this brush and likes its long handle and finds the bristles to be comfortable when washing her back.  She complained that the brush head frequently slips off the handle and falls to the shower floor.  She also had no use for the strap over the back of the brush since she only wanted it for washing her back.  I question the advisability of a strap, since the brush head slips off the handle so easily even when you don&#x27;t want it to.  I had to modify the brush by cutting away the strap and attaching the brush head permanently to its handle using a brass #4 flathead screw 3/4\\&quot; long.  My wife is now very pleased with her long handled \\&quot;back only\\&quot; brush.  I think the manufacturer should consider affixing the head permanently to its handle and losing the strap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of this model brush over the years and mine last perhaps six months before the bristles wear down.  Over the years I tried several more expensive brushes and like this one as well or better.  Some may want a stiffer brush however for me this brush does the job.    Every few brushes I have a problem with the head coming off but quickly learned that when the brush is wet you can tamp head down on the floor by the handle and it wedges securely (or super glue it when dry).  I don&#x27;t use the detachable head feature so I tamp it down.  Haven&#x27;t had to do it last few brushes.  Just got a new one and thought I&#x27;d post a review.    They arrive by US mail, not UPS.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush mainly for scrubbing my back. The brush part is nice enough, but the head does fall off the handle pretty often.</li>
            <li> This item was a huge disappointment. Very poor quality. Bristles are not cut evenly and are starting to come out after one use. Bristles are also softer than any other bath brush I&#x27;ve ever had. If that&#x27;s not enough, it smells horrible! It gives off a very strong and unpleasant chemical odor, I&#x27;m assuming from the glue they use to stick the plastic piece that holds the bristles onto the wood brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the handle doesn&#x27;t even fit right into the slot on back! Not worth sending back, going into the trash.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for about 1.5 weeks and it is already coming apart. It is not worth the money paid. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you plan to only use it once a month.</li>
            <li> Item pictured is wood, natural bristled- item I received is a nasty translucent green plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Item pictured has a removable head, item I received is one piece molded plastic, like you might buy at a 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> brush works well, pleased with how you can remove from the handle to use as a hand brush</li>
            <li> Excellent brush with soft bristles. I recently had surgery and I can no longer reach my back, and this brush has been perfect.    My only complaint is that the head is not permanently attached and can slide off the end. A little glue can fix this.</li>
            <li> The first thing I saw when unwrapping this brush was big printed label attached to the brush warning me the brush head needed replacement every 1-3 months.    Not a very encouraging start.    On second look the bristles seem very short, measured at 5/8\\&quot; - they are short.  Oh well, the handle has a nice curve, the total tip to tip length of the entire brush assembly is 17-1/2\\&quot;.  Anyway, I&#x27;m using it and it seems to do the job, I&#x27;m cleaner - at least for a month or two before the brush head wears out.  Brush head hasn&#x27;t disconnected yet and I&#x27;ll probably put a screw in it and stop worrying when it&#x27;ll fall off.  Maybe it falls off when it needs replacement, ya think?  For the low Amazon delivered price I paid, I don&#x27;t feel like picking on it anymore.  I&#x27;ll stop back sometime and let you know when/if the brush head wears out or falls off.  Stay clean....  Edit:  10/15/11   Haha, the head fell off yesterday, only took 4 days.  I had to put a small screw in it to hold it on.  Next question, how long will the bristles last?  The saga of the $6 brush....</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times now, and have stayed with it. Yes, the head will OCCASIONALLY fall off. But since you&#x27;re reading reviews and people have mentioned this, you will know better, yes? Every once in a while, I just kind of push the head of the brush into the handle to make sure it&#x27;s still secure. No problems.</li>
            <li> Head came of a couple times.  Just pushed it back on and went on.  Purchased in June &#x27;09.  I&#x27;m now back for replacement, so glad to see it is still available.</li>
            <li> This is a great back brush. My only criticism is that I wish the handle was permanently attached to the brush head. It would make it stronger for using on your back...and that&#x27;s the only thing I use it for!</li>
            <li> The Aquasential brush looks good and feels nice. Of note the detachable end does occasionally fall off so be careful of your toes when showering. Still worth getting in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Pros: very nice length, comfortable handle, stiff natural bristles  Cons: none  Regarding some of the other reviews:  Comparable brushes usually cost up to 3x as much  If you hang your brush up after use, it will be less likely to come apart when you don&#x27;t want it to  If it does come apart, you could glue it with waterproof glue  If you don&#x27;t take it apart, it may never come apart</li>
            <li> This brush was a gift the person I gave it to really likes it, The only thing he wish&#x27;s is that the handle be a little longer. Also it has a \\&quot;strap\\&quot; on the brush indicating that you could remove the brush from the handle but we can&#x27;t figure out how to do this.</li>
            <li> Great little scrub brush, particularly for the price.  Handle detaches from brush for versatility.  Coarse bristles.</li>
            <li> Bristles are still straight and full after 6 months of use unlike my last brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bath brush for my mother who is in a nursing home.  She has difficulty reaching her back area, and needed something that would be soft enough for her sensitive skin, but would be firm enough to do the job.  She really loves the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush comes off the handle every 5 seconds. No idea why this thing even has a handle cause it doesn&#x27;t even serve its purpose. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> The handle is about 13\\&quot;.  Where it separates, I used superglue to keep them together, no problem.  Soaps well and easy to use and clean, but the 1\\&quot; natural bristles crush after a month or so.  I can feel the wooden head on my back.  I&#x27;ve used it anyway for almost a year, but am looking for better back brush.    edit:  Got the new ones and the quality seems to be lower.  There are more bristles falling out as I run my hand across the bristles, and the handle is shorter by an inch and thinner.  The bristle length is also about 3/4\\&quot;.  This is the last time I&#x27;ll be buying this product.</li>
            <li> Nice brush with natural bristles, works very well, but the brush and wood handle are designed to seperate, which means head occasionally comes off when using, not a big deal, but would have preferred it just as a back brush with head permanently attached.  I would actually rate the brush and how it works/feels on the back as 4 stars</li>
            <li> I have ordered others and really liked them. this one gets the job done, but i didn&#x27;t care for the unfinished handle as they leave splinters.</li>
            <li> This two part brush solves  the problem of too many implements in the shower or in a tub. The bristles are just the right stiffness and not too harsh.</li>
            <li> OK for the price.  The head is not too large to be cumbersome to use.  The handle is just long enough.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a bath brush.  Well, I put soap on it and scrub my back and legs and it does a great job and feels good on the back!</li>
            <li> GUESS WHO GOT IT INSTEAD OF ME??? MY HUBBY! LOL  TO SOFT FOR ME! I LIKE MY BRISTLES ON BATH BRUSHES HARD!!!</li>
            <li> I kept buying plastic brushes and they kept breaking.  This one stands up to being dropped in the shower over and over</li>
            <li> Broke within a week, id look elsewhere</li>
            <li> I have used body and bath \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; for years. The bristles on these brushes wore down to less than 1/8 inch after using in the shower less than 10 times. I should have spent my $$$$ at THE DOLLAR STORE.  I&#x27;m extremely surprised to see AMAZON selling junk. This product is JUNK!</li>
            <li> Nicely finished, not bare wood. Handle is both secure on the brush and easily removed.  Overall, bristles are excellent, none have broken, curled or bent in daily use, and don&#x27;t shed.  Did lose three bristle groups during the first few uses, but none since.  Has already exceeded the life of my last bath brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a half dozen bath brushes in the last two years trying to find one that wasn&#x27;t too stiff or too soft, and that also wouldn&#x27;t crack and start losing bristles after a month.  I&#x27;ve had this one for a few months and it is still perfect.</li>
            <li> Due to expansion and shrinkage in the wood (wet to dry), the plastic broke releasing many bristles. This greatly shortened life to less than one year.</li>
            <li> needed a longer handle, &amp; this one fit the bill!</li>
