            <li>This is great and you must use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great seller, Great product.</li>
            <li>I use it once every week and have seen great results.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with with Vacubrasion, and the two work great.</li>
            <li>This does work wonders though and is a great product.</li>
            <li>, my skin is great quality for my age (I am 57</li>
            <li>i am completely satisfied!!</li>
            <li>I liked it!</li>
            <li>The packing is very beautiful and secure.</li>
            <li>Good luck....</li>
            <li>apply them in advance of the roll (research is saying vitamin a, vitamin c (NOT ascorbic acid form though) and peptides aid in collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;-After roll spray some sterile water on your skin (Evian is good, sold here too), or stand under shower and rinse off well</li>
            <li>this product is very good, reliable and fast seller always use and has given me good result ...... ........</li>
            <li>Then I rinsed my face with warm water &amp; reapplied the hyraluronic acid to help it heal.  </li>
            <li>I liked the price.</li>
            <li>i liked the case too.</li>
            <li>Keep a sterile swab or tissue handy to wipe off any bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It evens gets rid of fine wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I tried to use even pressure, but I did go over my problem areas with more vigor.  </li>
            <li>I tolerated the sensation a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I must have used more pressure this time, because it&#x27;s the night after</li>
            <li>I will add more to my review after more weeks pass.</li>
            <li>shipping will cost more.</li>
            <li>Hope some one else has better luck then myself.</li>
            <li>I cleaned off the numbing cream with more alcohol, then started the roller across my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have had many pricey procedures and nothing removed the scars.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>i want to buy more.  </li>
            <li>They might use it more often than needed and wind up doing damage.  </li>
            <li>(you want to make sure you don&#x27;t scab..</li>
            <li>i wanted to look better.  </li>
            <li>This one has way more needles</li>
            <li>so I assumed it would do more of the desired damage needed for the stimulation of skin repair.</li>
            <li>and am anticipating much better results from it.</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference when it comes to my scars.</li>
            <li>They should be careful with their claims-too many unfounded great results.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin lightly for just a day-</li>
            <li>great product, already noticing vast improvements with my skin.</li>
            <li>] - see my review for detailed instructions on how to use these devices -</li>
            <li>It was really easy to do and quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Use immaculate hygiene - sterility - clean hands, clean space, clean roller</li>
            <li>Apply numbing cream generously on face then saran wrap over it, leave it on for 30-45 minutes, remove wrap, then remove vestiges of numbing agent with clean cotton ball and sterile water or witch hazel, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and \\&quot;Youtube vacubrasion\\&quot; for some quick how to videos.</li>
            <li>I used a Vitamin-C rich cream that claims to aide in cell renewal, and added my own prescription retinol gel to my target areas (acne scarring and deep wrinkle lines).</li>
            <li>a positive, it feels unbelievably good when rolled on your back.</li>
            <li>but well worth it..</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you do it properly, it will increase collagen, reduce excess pigment and scarring, make skin more smooth.</li>
            <li>Beware: these do hurt no matter what, but it&#x27;s worth the pain ;</li>
            <li>but it does a far better roll for me.</li>
            <li>I would not be able to go out in public for weeks.  </li>
            <li>I was able to wear sunscreen and makeup the next day.</li>
            <li>I first washed my face with a salicylic face wash (neutrogena)</li>
            <li>My face looks so much smoother now!  </li>
            <li>I already have knowledge with how these work, but my concern is for people who are using this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>(sorry forget the name) but it works great!</li>
            <li>I got my roller out and examined it under magnification and sure enough, skin slicing razors, not collagen producing needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>almost 58 - the pic on my profile is an accurate recent one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like thanks a lot ..........</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t really need it - just helps if your goal is anti aging, rejuvenation</li>
            <li>in the case of skin and collagen the build up is very slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would use a really gentle mineral type makeup for cover up, something that has as benevolent ingredients as you can find.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really hurt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it is because the needles are too close together on the 2.0mm roller to really go in to the skin very well.</li>
            <li>It feels as if they are very blunt and don&#x27;t want to penetrate.</li>
            <li>Subtle changes but good results.</li>
            <li>It was like tiny pinches on my face, but not painful this time, and no tearing.  </li>
            <li>I have NO stake or interest in that particular product</li>
            <li>Feels good without being painful, unless that is what you want then you can get decent pain from it without needing to much pressure, lightweight and durable, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Though I do get red for a day or two, but otherwise it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>then back to healthy pink skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have scarring, i have fine wrinkles and slightly lax skin</li>
            <li>I actually found the opposite to be true.</li>
            <li>The pain during it was minimal, (no worse than the 1.5mm which doesnt really bother me)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any benefits yet, but it is still early.  </li>
            <li>I have become a huge fan of rolling, even though in full disclosure I have used botox, fillers, and peels in the past too, and had some minimal cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li>B004ATTGSY Microneedle Skin Care System 1.5 mm Derma Roller with Medical Grade Stainless Steel]]</li>
            <li>this depth of roller, (vs the smaller ones which are more for product penetration), wait at least six weeks before another roll.</li>
            <li>The next day wow!  </li>
            <li>but now they are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>This roller  has a lot more and denser number of fine needles than some of the other less expensive rollers.</li>
            <li>youtube for specific tips on how to roll - generally you go in each direction</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - You CAN re-use the roller a few times -- soak in Efferdent for dentures (thanks to another reviewer for this tip!), to get the microscopic bits of tissue removed,rinse, then soak in alcohol or hydrogen peroxide after that, for an hour or so.</li>

            <li>For the product itself it is big as my toothbrush,Needles are very sharp,so be very careful.</li>
            <li>start, I thoroughly cleaned my skin with alcohol and Betadine first, then did a couple of rounds with Vacubrasion (new home microderm under $30), and then applied a thick layer of numbing cream for 1 hour BEFORE starting rollering.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the roller it was slightly painful (mostly around mouth and on forehead).  </li>
            <li>B004FT0ZJ8 Microneedle Skin Care System 1.0 mm Derma Roller with Medical Grade Stainless Steel]] has less needles and they are shorter needles as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will be very red the first day, look sunburned the next day but nothing crazy, and pretty normal after that.</li>

            <li> /&gt;You will be very red the first day, look sunburned the next day but nothing crazy, and pretty normal after that.</li>
            <li> By the next morning my face was almost back to normal - just a little flushed, and by evening there was no signs of redness.  </li>
            <li> people will need a numbing cream applied first - rx or OTC tattoo number - but caution on that too - you can roll REALLY hard and not feel it if the numbing is total!</li>
            <li> Well, the whole point of pricking the skin with the tiny sized needles that are supposed to be used in the making of these rollers is to penetrate the skin and stimulate collagen without causing damage or stimulating excessive scar tissue.</li>
            <li> The collagen synthesis process takes several weeks to months - if you roll too soon you are defeating the purpose - it is very much like working out with heavy weights - there is a tear down , then a build up process -but</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I was not able to get a decent roll out of the thing and only attempted to use it one time.</li>
            <li> It has clear handles and a green head..</li>
            <li> have never waited so long for an Amazon Purchase to arrive.</li>
            <li> Personally, I would not use on my face due to the marks it leaves</li>
            <li> Use only with extreme caution around the face.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> This roller will actually cause little slices in your skin that are too big and will end up causing skin damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Through recent research on these little gadgets I learned that this particular model uses little razors instead of needles!</li>
            <li> I rinse my dermaroller with rubbing alcohol 70% and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> just rolled with this device 10 days ago, I previously rolled with much smaller depth needles (they start at .25 depth).</li>
            <li> One evening last week I washed my face, and used the 2.0mm roller as instructed by a few you tube videos and articles I researched.  </li>
            <li> (where I had minimal breakouts), and my face (no breakouts, just to keep my face dewy) and boy does this stuff work..</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders with my deep acne scars helping them to be less noticeable and allowing me to be less self concious about them</li>
            <li> I use it for other parts of my body other than my face.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I thought let me just try it.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable at first</li>
            <li> process takes patience and educating yourself on first - it&#x27;s nothing to casually do just willy nilly.</li>
            <li> , I was a little intimidated, I expected to bleed, and I expected pain (I don&#x27;t use a numbing cream.)  </li>
            <li> I did pay very little for the product which is not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> Seems very sharp.</li>
            <li> had previously used the 1.5mm  and decided to try the 2.0.&lt;br /&gt;Due to reviews and videos I had watched</li>
            <li> It even made my eyes tear a little.  </li>
            <li> and my face still feels a little sunburned.  </li>
            <li> and it takes a few months</li>
            <li> not sure what to make of that, as even the esthetician on youtube who had been doing this for 20+ years had bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it will do anything it claims.  </li>
            <li> (you can use them a few times before discarding but rinse in tepid water and soak in alcohol or hydrogen peroxide for a few hours post roll, then put away to dry)&lt;br /&gt;-Never use if your skin is broken out, ulcerated or overly irritated</li>
            <li> I replace it whenever the needles get dull.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how the scars are less noticeable!!!  </li>
            <li> (My review and usage advice is the purpose for Collagen Induction Therapy (CIT), to &#x27;plump up&#x27; the skin, as well as reduce pigmentation and broken vessels, this is not a &#x27;&#x27;starter&#x27;&#x27;</li>

            <li> This is great and you must use this.You need two sizes of needles also.. it make a big differen and it takes a few months befor you can see the differents..I use 3 time a week..</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously used the 1.5mm  and decided to try the 2.0.&lt;br /&gt;Due to reviews and videos I had watched, I was a little intimidated, I expected to bleed, and I expected pain (I don&#x27;t use a numbing cream.)  The pain during it was minimal, (no worse than the 1.5mm which doesnt really bother me)  After the fact, there is that &amp;#34;sunburned tingle&amp;#34;  I had NO BLEEDING.  not sure what to make of that, as even the esthetician on youtube who had been doing this for 20+ years had bleeding.  But Im not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, Great product.</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders with my deep acne scars helping them to be less noticeable and allowing me to be less self concious about them</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it will take some time to see results.  I use it for other parts of my body other than my face.  Personally, I would not use on my face due to the marks it leaves I would not be able to go out in public for weeks.  This is an experiment for me.</li>
            <li> I use it once every week and have seen great results. There is a huge difference when it comes to my scars. Though I do get red for a day or two, but otherwise it&#x27;s totally worth it. Bottom line it works!</li>
            <li> this product is very good, reliable and fast seller always use and has given me good result ...... ........ recommend you can use it without problems ........ i like thanks a lot ..........</li>
            <li> The 2.0mm Needles Derma Micro Needle Skin Roller Dermatology Therapy System was ordered on August 7, 2012 and it arrived on Friday September 7, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered the product the delivery estimate was Friday August 31, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I was actually going to cancel the order on September 7, 2012, the day it arrived. When I went back to the Amazon website the deliver estimate had been updated to Friday August 31, 2012 - Wednesday September 19, 2012. I suspect this was done in order to cover the question &#x60;Was the product delivered by the estimated time.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging has Asian type on it. The packing is very beautiful and secure. The wand is goregeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never waited so long for an Amazon Purchase to arrive. The size is incorrect and I need to exchange it for the 3mm. I will not bother. The exchange will probably take 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will go to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site and order it from there. Christmas is around the corner and I am giving these as gifts.</li>
            <li> Recently received derma roller.  One evening last week I washed my face, and used the 2.0mm roller as instructed by a few you tube videos and articles I researched.  I used a Vitamin-C rich cream that claims to aide in cell renewal, and added my own prescription retinol gel to my target areas (acne scarring and deep wrinkle lines). The first time I used the roller it was slightly painful (mostly around mouth and on forehead).  It even made my eyes tear a little.  I tried to use even pressure, but I did go over my problem areas with more vigor.  I did see redness that looked just like a sunburn - felt like one too.  Some tiny specks of blood came to the surface, but once wiped away with water, did not re-appear.  No scabbing occurred.  By the next morning my face was almost back to normal - just a little flushed, and by evening there was no signs of redness.  A week went by and I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.  I just used the roller again last night for the second time.  I tolerated the sensation a lot better.  It was like tiny pinches on my face, but not painful this time, and no tearing.  I must have used more pressure this time, because it&#x27;s the night after and my face still feels a little sunburned.  I don&#x27;t see any benefits yet, but it is still early.  I will add more to my review after more weeks pass.</li>
            <li> It took forever to receive product.For the product itself it is big as my toothbrush,Needles are very sharp,so be very careful. For helping with cellulite I have to say it I have seen no results at all.I did pay very little for the product which is not worth sending back. shipping will cost more. Now I just have to figure out what I can use it for, maybe I will use on my pizza dough to proof if.Hope some one else has better luck then myself.Good luck....</li>
            <li> I bought this along with with Vacubrasion, and the two work great. My skin has never looked fresher or smoother. You definitely need numbing cream before rolling this one on your face and neck. I used a prescription from my doc for \\&quot;BLT\\&quot; but some of the non prescription numbing creams on Amazon may work too and be cheaper. This roller  has a lot more and denser number of fine needles than some of the other less expensive rollers. (I bought both kinds to try).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, I thoroughly cleaned my skin with alcohol and Betadine first, then did a couple of rounds with Vacubrasion (new home microderm under $30), and then applied a thick layer of numbing cream for 1 hour BEFORE starting rollering. I cleaned off the numbing cream with more alcohol, then started the roller across my face and neck. You can google \\&quot;Youtube Dermaroller\\&quot; and \\&quot;Youtube vacubrasion\\&quot; for some quick how to videos. It was really easy to do and quick. A tiny bit of bleeding stopped within a minute .DermaRollering leaves my skin lightly for just a day- then back to healthy pink skin. I was able to wear sunscreen and makeup the next day.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect from product as I recently came across it to begin with, but have been using it as instructed, on my back (where I had minimal breakouts), and my face (no breakouts, just to keep my face dewy) and boy does this stuff work..It&#x27;s uncomfortable to use but well worth it..My back is smoother and my face just softer and brighter..Recommend..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I thought let me just try it.  I have suffered with acne since I was in 4th. grade.  I have had many pricey procedures and nothing removed the scars.  Till this product!  I first washed my face with a salicylic face wash (neutrogena), then I put hyraluronic acid on my face, then I used my dermaroller without any anesthetic, it felt like mosquito bites but less painful.  If you have had severe acne this is nothing compared to the pain of acne. Then I rinsed my face with warm water &amp; reapplied the hyraluronic acid to help it heal.  The next day wow!  My scars were shrinking!!!  I could not believe the results of this simple product!!!  I rinse my dermaroller with rubbing alcohol 70% and let it air dry.  I use the roller about every 3 weeks.  I cannot believe how the scars are less noticeable!!!  It evens gets rid of fine wrinkles! I replace it whenever the needles get dull.  My face looks so much smoother now!  I will continue to buy till all the scars are gone.</li>
            <li> Feels good without being painful, unless that is what you want then you can get decent pain from it without needing to much pressure, lightweight and durable, easy to use. I have two sizes of this and I love it.</li>
            <li> I liked it! It worked great! I liked the price. i want to buy more.  i liked the case too.</li>
            <li> great product, already noticing vast improvements with my skin. i am completely satisfied!! i will recommend this product over and over again!!</li>
            <li> This works, but did not come with instructions.  I already have knowledge with how these work, but my concern is for people who are using this for the first time.  They might use it more often than needed and wind up doing damage.  This does work wonders though and is a great product.</li>
            <li> Subtle changes but good results. I had purple stretch marks but now they are barely noticeable. Uncomfortable at first but I think you get use to it. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> (My review and usage advice is the purpose for Collagen Induction Therapy (CIT), to &#x27;plump up&#x27; the skin, as well as reduce pigmentation and broken vessels, this is not a &#x27;&#x27;starter&#x27;&#x27; roller-- you must do some homework on this before trying it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just rolled with this device 10 days ago, I previously rolled with much smaller depth needles (they start at .25 depth). I have become a huge fan of rolling, even though in full disclosure I have used botox, fillers, and peels in the past too, and had some minimal cosmetic surgery, my skin is great quality for my age (I am 57 almost 58 - the pic on my profile is an accurate recent one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these rollers together with 20% Vitamin C+E ferulic acid (you can see my [[ASIN:B0036BI56G 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum 1 oz.]] - see my review for detailed instructions on how to use these devices - I have NO stake or interest in that particular product, you don&#x27;t really need it - just helps if your goal is anti aging, rejuvenation and it&#x27;s inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to summarize how to use these for the purpose of anti aging, skin rejuvenation- especially with a roller this deep (and this IS a deep roller and not to be used carelessely!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Use immaculate hygiene - sterility - clean hands, clean space, clean roller (you can use them a few times before discarding but rinse in tepid water and soak in alcohol or hydrogen peroxide for a few hours post roll, then put away to dry)&lt;br /&gt;-Never use if your skin is broken out, ulcerated or overly irritated&lt;br /&gt;-Most people will need a numbing cream applied first - rx or OTC tattoo number - but caution on that too - you can roll REALLY hard and not feel it if the numbing is total! Apply numbing cream generously on face then saran wrap over it, leave it on for 30-45 minutes, remove wrap, then remove vestiges of numbing agent with clean cotton ball and sterile water or witch hazel, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-See youtube for specific tips on how to roll - generally you go in each direction several times (horizontal, vertical, diagonally each way)&lt;br /&gt;-You will bleed at this needle depth. Keep a sterile swab or tissue handy to wipe off any bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;-If you are going to use any serums (to aid in collagen synthesis) apply them in advance of the roll (research is saying vitamin a, vitamin c (NOT ascorbic acid form though) and peptides aid in collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;-After roll spray some sterile water on your skin (Evian is good, sold here too), or stand under shower and rinse off well (you want to make sure you don&#x27;t scab..leaving blood etc behind can lead to clogged pores or worse), and the leave your skin alone! I would not apply anything at that point, except maybe an antibiotic or silver ointment to prevent infection)&lt;br /&gt;-avoid makeup for a day or two, just rinse or spray with sterile water&lt;br /&gt;-Using this depth of roller, (vs the smaller ones which are more for product penetration), wait at least six weeks before another roll. The collagen synthesis process takes several weeks to months - if you roll too soon you are defeating the purpose - it is very much like working out with heavy weights - there is a tear down , then a build up process -but in the case of skin and collagen the build up is very slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be very red the first day, look sunburned the next day but nothing crazy, and pretty normal after that. I would use a really gentle mineral type makeup for cover up, something that has as benevolent ingredients as you can find. But the point is you won&#x27;t look like a nightmare for a week to 10 days like you can with acid peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process takes patience and educating yourself on first - it&#x27;s nothing to casually do just willy nilly. You could end up scarring yourself, worsening a skin condition, or getting an infection if you don&#x27;t take the time to do this right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you do it properly, it will increase collagen, reduce excess pigment and scarring, make skin more smooth. I will post an update here in a month or two when I start to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - You CAN re-use the roller a few times -- soak in Efferdent for dentures (thanks to another reviewer for this tip!), to get the microscopic bits of tissue removed,rinse, then soak in alcohol or hydrogen peroxide after that, for an hour or so. I use disposable dixie type cups for that.ll post an update here in a month or two when I start to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - You CAN re-use the roller a few times -- soak in Efferdent for dentures (thanks to another reviewer for this tip!), to get the microscopic bits of tissue removed,rinse, then soak in alcohol or hydrogen peroxide after that, for an hour or so.

            <li> Seems very sharp. Use only with extreme caution around the face.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive, it feels unbelievably good when rolled on your back.</li>
            <li> These needles work, just not this brand! This one leaves track rolling marks and scratches. There is another brand on here (sorry forget the name) but it works great! It has clear handles and a green head.. I reccomend that one instead. Beware: these do hurt no matter what, but it&#x27;s worth the pain ;p</li>
            <li> I keep waiting and waiting.  I Used as directed-it didn&#x27;t really hurt.  Not sure it will do anything it claims.  I looked over dermatology articles and it may work for scarring.  I don&#x27;t have scarring, i have fine wrinkles and slightly lax skin i wanted to look better.  Don&#x27;t think i will get what i want out of this tool.  They should be careful with their claims-too many unfounded great results.</li>
            <li> works fab.  got one as a gift for the womenfolk of the family.  everyone loves the results, even if the roller looks intimidating.</li>
            <li> I have a 1mm roller and wanted to take it to the next level so I ordered this one. This one has way more needles so I assumed it would do more of the desired damage needed for the stimulation of skin repair. I actually found the opposite to be true. My 1.0 mm roller [[ASIN:B004FT0ZJ8 Microneedle Skin Care System 1.0 mm Derma Roller with Medical Grade Stainless Steel]] has less needles and they are shorter needles as well but it does a far better roll for me. I&#x27;m thinking it is because the needles are too close together on the 2.0mm roller to really go in to the skin very well. It feels as if they are very blunt and don&#x27;t want to penetrate. If I ever do get another 2.0mm roller it will be one that has the same amount of needles that my 1.0mm roller has. I have since ordered the 1.5mm version [[ASIN:B004ATTGSY Microneedle Skin Care System 1.5 mm Derma Roller with Medical Grade Stainless Steel]] and am anticipating much better results from it. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through recent research on these little gadgets I learned that this particular model uses little razors instead of needles! I got my roller out and examined it under magnification and sure enough, skin slicing razors, not collagen producing needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this bad? Well, the whole point of pricking the skin with the tiny sized needles that are supposed to be used in the making of these rollers is to penetrate the skin and stimulate collagen without causing damage or stimulating excessive scar tissue. This roller will actually cause little slices in your skin that are too big and will end up causing skin damage. Thank goodness I was not able to get a decent roll out of the thing and only attempted to use it one time. It&#x27;s now in the trash.</li>
