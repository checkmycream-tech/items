    <ol>
            <li> I used to wear this when I was a teenager. It&#x27;s hard to find anywhere. It&#x27;s a summer fragrance light and flowery. Thank you for having it in stock.</li>
            <li> Smells different that the Lily of the Valley I already have in a different bottle.  The box says Lily of the Valley, but the bottle does not.</li>
            <li> Lily of the Valley is my favorite flower, so I&#x27;m thrilled that I finally found this fragrance to wear. When I was a girl, it was available in just about any drug store or 5 and dime. Then it just disappeared. It&#x27;s taken me a few years to find it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance for the price. It&#x27;s pure lily of the valley, so if you don&#x27;t like the sweet fragrance of lily of the valley, you won&#x27;t like this perfume. It&#x27;s not very strong, but it is a nice. Very soft. It might even be suitable for young girls wanting to try perfume for the first time.</li>
            <li> Bough this for myself and continue using it. It has the sweet smell to it that lasts for few hours. I absolutely LOVE this product and will recommend for all the ladies who like to stay \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; to buy this. I only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I WANT SAY BUT ONE THING don&#x27;t buy this perfume</li>
            <li> The perfume was much stronger than their talc scent. Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> A lovely, light and spicy floral scent this has long been my mother&#x27;s favorite for every day use.  Now that she is 87, gifting options are reduced but she is always thrilled to receive Woods of Windsor Lily of the Valley.  A beautiful and accurate rendition of the actual flower, this eau de toilette is long lasting and needs only a short spray to last all day.  I often use it myself and enjoy the light aroma.</li>
            <li> When you order something that is from Woods of Windsor, you can rely on it being authentic, fresh and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is saturated so one needs just a bit to enjoy the essence of the flower.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I purchased this Lilly of the Valley, but I was extremely disappointed because it smelled mostly like alcohol.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ,HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO FIND IT ANYWHERE BUT I DID AND ITS SMELLS JUST LIKE I REMEMBER FROM 20 YEARS AGO</li>
            <li> not true lily of the valley, but a conglomerate of florals, not bad but not what it is supposed to be true scent.</li>
            <li> very nice product to own</li>
            <li> My mother always wore Muguet Lily of the Valley fragrance. This smells more like the actual flower than that did. It lingers well.</li>
            <li> I realize that there&#x27;s a lot of variation in the way odorants are perceived by individuals.  I could smell only musk, which I dislike.</li>
            <li> It smells somewhat nice, but does not smell like Jovan&#x27;s Lily of the Valley. Maybe it is old or maybe it is counterfeit, but is not what I or the person I gave it to expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pass in the future</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 5 years ago at Marshalls and it smelled so good. It didn&#x27;t smell anything like it did or like Lilly of the Valley. I was very disappointed and gave it away immediately.</li>
            <li> It is floral, but what flower exactly - no idea, definitely not lilies of the valley. It is really intrusive at first, sharp, but it disappears completely within half an hour.</li>
            <li> Just got and it does NOT smell like Lily of the Valley real scent!  Do not waste your money - you get what you pay for and in this case, that&#x27;s not much!  A shame as I have always loved the fragrance of Lilly of the Valley lovely flowers but - there you have it.  I was going to try some more of their scents but after sniffing this and trying on, no way.</li>
            <li> I like the perfume a lot. I&#x27;ve been missing the smell of Lilly of the valley since the flowers are rare in the US. The only thing I don&#x27;t like - the perfume is not strong enough to last even half a day so you have to reapply it to stay fresh.</li>
            <li> Hard to find perfume! My mom&#x27;s old time favorite!&lt;br /&gt;She was pleased to get it for her birthday! Thanks for&lt;br /&gt;carrying it!</li>
            <li> I got the spray, and it smells JUST LIKE Lily of the Valley. It&#x27;s amazing. It is now my favorite scent. In case you&#x27;re looking for room spray also, their Room Spray (Woods of Windsor) is awesome! Smells just like having a bouquet in the house!</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful! The big drawback is there really is no longevity in the scent. After about an hour it is gone. Very disappointing in that respect. I do love the scent though. Smells like Lily of the Valley without the nasty perfumy smell.</li>
