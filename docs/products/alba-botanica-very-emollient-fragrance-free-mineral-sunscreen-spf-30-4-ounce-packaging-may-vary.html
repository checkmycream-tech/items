            <li>Great seller!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best one i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s the best one of the less-expensive mineral brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Of those without this ingredient, Consumer Reports rated this the best.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is the best protection against skin cancer, wrinkles and brown spots.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Downgrading from 5 stars to 4&lt;br /&gt;This is still the best sunscreen I know of.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy using Alba.</li>
            <li>and she says this one is excellent sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The best tube zinc sunscreen we have found (and we have tried a LOT).  </li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful mineral option.</li>
            <li>as many others I have tried!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Didn&#x27;t get burnt, at all (I am very fair skinned)&lt;br /&gt;-Sunscreen</li>
            <li>It has very good environmental ratings, and it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>My very fair skin did not burn once with this product.</li>
            <li>have very fair skin</li>
            <li>Best of all, this rubs in very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Good job Alba Botanica!</li>
            <li>And I feel great using it on my babies.</li>
            <li>this one is great - no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Great protection that holds up even through water and sweat,</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen and great EWG rating.</li>
            <li>, the pros greatly outweigh the cons (for me)</li>
            <li>A great thing like this would cost 30 usd in Japan.</li>
            <li>it works great, just not if you&#x27;re in the water.</li>
            <li>Great suntan cream.  </li>
            <li>Great protection - we did not burn once using this product, even when we waited longer than 2 hrs to reapply.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>This has been a great sunscreen for us.</li>
            <li>Really great product.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this sunscreen is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>But this is great</li>
            <li>Feels great once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>As a mineral based sunscreen, this is very nice.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is very effective.</li>
            <li>I could see this working great as a sunscreen alternative for your face because it has a good deal of SPF</li>
            <li>/&gt;As stated it has no added fragrance, but does have a pleasant smell from the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No reaction, goes on easily without feeling oily, no perfume smells, and worked great at the pool on a sunny afternoon for 3 hours!  </li>
            <li>good product, thank you</li>
            <li>When using on the face or anywhere on body you have to rub it in really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for outings in Northern California, and it went on well, was not sticky, and provided good protection.</li>
            <li>The price is unbelievably good.  </li>
            <li>all good</li>
            <li>one good thing about the product.</li>
            <li>We have extremely fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>the price has jumped from $1.40 per oz to $2.00 per oz since the good press.  </li>
            <li>What this means is that this gives optimum protection for sunburn and skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No fragrances, no irritants and a fair price.  </li>
            <li>However, it stays on and provides good protection for hours.  </li>
            <li>Loved it on our Jamaica trip.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t come off very easily, which is great for sports like cycling.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Their formula is excellent, I was really happy to find a sunscreen that blended into my skin so nicely without having to put much effort into rubbing it</li>
            <li>Great safe sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Healthy and works great...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s effective, feels good on the skin and it works well...</li>
            <li>a good sunblock that was not greasy and did the job, have worn it all day and it blends nicely...</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;m glad we have a safe, inexpensive sunscreen for our kids!</li>
            <li>Great price, smells great, right level of thickness.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve tried, but pretty good, safe mineral block.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an amazing sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Nice price too.  </li>
            <li>We have found it provides nice</li>
            <li>I have used most of the sunscreens in their line and have loved them all.  </li>
            <li>Rubbed nicely into my face and makeup went on</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is totally effective.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin nicely and isn&#x27;t pasty.</li>
            <li>Worked well and it was nice to know that the sun screen I was using didn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I would prefer to use Thinkbaby/Thinksport because their ingredients yield the best possible safety rating on the EWG website, this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent sunscreen for rosacea since it has no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>Best natural sunscreen for the price.</li>
            <li>(nearly everything causes me to break out or get a rash, so this is wonderful).</li>
            <li>We were on a beach vacation and it was our first time out in the sun for the summer, and this sunscreen worked GREAT.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty great for a mineral sunblock.</li>
            <li>I was happy that this sunscreen repelled water so well &amp; was made up of mineral ingredients, however, it did not hold up for this hot California valley sun.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no longer the great deal it was when it was first announced.</li>
            <li>It works amazing, I havent burned once and my skin is pretty fair.  </li>
            <li>The price was good, it was shipped quickly and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>You can buy coppertone babies nice and easy</li>
            <li>No burns when using this even on very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Currently, my favorite sunblock.  </li>
            <li>so that I am able to put on my sunscreen soon afterword.</li>
            <li>Read more about sunscreens here:</li>
            <li>Better ingredients than a lot of the lotions out there.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re in the middle of a week at the beach and this has provided wonderful protection.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love the fact that it has non-nano zinc and titanium.</li>
            <li>Love all the alba sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time, I don&#x27;t use sunblock, because I don&#x27;t like the oily feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>I believe I prefer these ingredients over the ones in the more advertised brands anyhow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this sunscreen and its effectiveness, texture, and the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great sun protection and that&#x27;s the whole purpose.</li>
            <li>I love Alba products.  </li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>With all the options out there today the tons upon tons of choices I won&#x27;t contribute to the loss of precious economy systems and species to save a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li>Its 1.40$ an ounce, when the others are more like 5$-10$ or more an ounce.  </li>
            <li>35 spf on my face (which I LOVE except for its price - 9.30$ an ounce).  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face shiny if I apply more than a 1/4 teaspoon to my face</li>
            <li>And I could tell that it was still on my skin doing its magic after getting into the pool because the water was beading on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27; lists out ALL the safe and carcinogenic ingredients in sunscreens.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get more freckles.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for in a sunscreen?</li>
            <li>and we ended up using more than planned.</li>
            <li>I am so glad i brought a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t expire until 2015.</li>
            <li>If they can do that in a book box even better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a great product and much cheaper online than in stores.</li>
            <li>more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>I love all alba sunscreen and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>I love all Alba products, and this one doesn&#x27;t dissapoint.</li>
            <li>I would argue it&#x27;s better than the scented ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alba products are top notch.</li>
            <li>I have 3 children and we mostly use this on our faces/necks during sports seasons and during the winter.  </li>
            <li>my face does ok but neck can&#x27;t handle  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to make sure it didn&#x27;t cause a reaction.</li>
            <li>Application feels greasy :) I will not buy the Very Emollient again, but I will stick with the Alba Botania because of a great formulation.  </li>
            <li>I tend to wear those that are fragrance free, so I liked that about this product.</li>
            <li>but you can spread it around and that takes more effort than a lighter weight sunscreen or a spray sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li>Most were spf 15 and availability was sporadic.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I had been trying out the sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of best rated sunscreens and this one is hands down my favorite!</li>
            <li>So far so good - very pleased with the product and just ordered two more bottles through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am sure high percentage of zinc oxide provides great protection from burning and photo aging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am happy with the way it goes on, not as oily and sticky as some of the others, so I highly recommend that you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this in 70-80+ degree weather with bright sun</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but does take a bit of time to rub in.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s worth it for me to have the advantage of the excellent protection this product offers.</li>
            <li>This was a super effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell was pleasant and very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very effective natural sunscreen, but you do still have to reapply every two hours or so to make sure you are fully protected.</li>
            <li>, sunscreen didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly and was a bit more sticky, thus attracting sand.</li>
            <li>When used in combo with my foundation it gave me a nice healthy glow, but when I would use it without foundation it made me look pretty shiny</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s frangance free</li>
            <li>I love knowing that i am using chemical free sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a great experience so far using the Alba Botanica mineral sunblock SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>Effective, economical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It absorbed well, felt nice, and did what it was supposed to do - protected my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE plus, as most sunscreens with this rating are easily $50 (*cough*Shiseido)&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent for body coverage, although it will make your skin a tad</li>
            <li>No scent, spreads easy, moist, no ghost look.  </li>
            <li>says so that it spreads on easily.</li>
            <li>This is an easy one for me to get in to the habit of using so</li>
            <li>As I do not step out so often, I do not mind the patches as they go easily in two days.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, is moisturizing, and easy to know where you applied it.  </li>
            <li>Good natural product but thicker than I expected so not the best for your face.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, feels light and fades easily like body butter.</li>
            <li>It spreads on easily and is quite smooth.  </li>
            <li>EWG gave it a good rating, and I liked that it was full spectrum via physical blockers (zinc and titanium).</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, smells good, easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I normally wear a high SPF, since I am very fair.</li>
            <li>Love the products, &amp; fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li>Fairly light consistentcy and no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is fragrance free</li>
            <li>IS fragrance free though....</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on my 14 mo on toddler effectively for whole summer.</li>
            <li>I took this sunscreen with me to Italy (cities and beaches) and it was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Extra great on roof of head--balding here, nose  and shoulders.</li>
            <li>This product is fragrance free as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I have actually received complements about how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, no chalky white streaks, it feels nice throughout the day, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Good for skin sensitive to chemical sunscreen agents  because it is</li>
            <li>After my 20 year old son had a reaction to &amp;#34;Chemical laden sunscreens&amp;#34;, we looked for a product that was safe and still effective.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the odor of the product stayed with me pretty strongly for a couple of days even after a couple more showers.</li>
            <li>Good news, it pretty much acted as a sweater.</li>
            <li>This product meets my needs of being effective and receiving a high rating from EWG.org.</li>
            <li>Thick but easy to apply and provides excellent sun protection.  </li>
            <li>My friend who easily gets irritated from most sunscreens said this one really worked well for her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this today ... was so excited</li>
            <li>After watching a video review on this product, I was already pretty confident in the product.</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s very smooth and has no smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li>texture was nice, not hard to rub in.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>NICE AND EASY - this part is important, the regular baby one has carcinogenic</li>
            <li>Overall a great product and one of the most affordable natural sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li>it is emollient, so that part is true.</li>
            <li>It also protects the skin from the full UVA/UVB range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that it is a much healthier choice.</li>
            <li>Only a 1 on the skindeep app, which is really good.</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>Unlike some mineral sunscreens, it is not impossible to rub in.</li>
            <li>This is super emollient so keep it in mind.  </li>
            <li>Every major brand of sunscreen causes rashes for me, so I have been thrilled with Alba sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li>This product ranks high on the environmental scale with no nasty chemicals and it works well.</li>
            <li>This one is probably good for sun exposure where you&#x27;re not bathing in water for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is our new favorite (and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The formulation has changed so that this sunscreen is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>A problem with the newer thinner formulation is that they did not change the container and the hole at the top is too large for this thinner formulation, and the sunscreen comes out in large quantity if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It goes on very creamy and smooth and soaks into the skin well.</li>
            <li>Like the more natural option.</li>
            <li>It can also be difficulty completely remove, but I&#x27;m happy to use it when I&#x27;ll be in the water for several hours.</li>
            <li>However, this is kind of a plus when you are outside because it won&#x27;t turn into watery goo when you go to reapply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with a pink tone and don&#x27;t get color when I use this.  </li>
            <li>about 5 days worth of sunblock was stuck inside the lid and inside the bag.</li>
            <li>In the case of this product you throw away maybe a dollar&#x27;s worth of sunscreen.n&#x27;t</li>
            <li>In the case of this product you throw away maybe a dollar&#x27;s worth of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet found a &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreen that I totally love, so the hunt continues...</li>
            <li>the price is so much better than many of the other mineral options).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately there is a smell but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and it&#x27;s mostly pretty mild.</li>
            <li>It lightened my skin considerably at first, but quickly settled in.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t forget the nice and easy part) for half the price.</li>
            <li>This rich cream keeps my skin very hydrated in the sun.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>As it is now, it provides a muscle-building exercise for my right hand.</li>
            <li>In fact, it rubs in quite easily, and when you&#x27;re sunscreening an entire family, that is important.  </li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen except don&#x27;t use it on your face/head if you&#x27;re in the water or excessively</li>
            <li>so it has the general problems that most mineral sunblocks have  .its</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my DeVita Solar Protective Moisturizer, which is just as effective but much smoother and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t see the white, its much better then every other product I tried that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve found for an affordable physical sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel particularly heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I could never be sure I&#x27;d really gotten complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I applied this once before spending the day (very hot, very sun) at a theme park.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use on places where you may have dry skin (I use it on my legs only) and for that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>And today the 2nd day of a really bright hot day I&#x27;m even more darker, really dark, just like I didnt use any sunblock again.</li>
            <li>There is no smell which is a huge plus and very easy on the skin for little ones.</li>
            <li>It kept us from getting sunburned when we spent a month in Istanbul during the summer, and it also made our skin look more clean and youthful.  </li>
            <li>At first, you look like you just put on clown makeup, but with a bit of effort, it rubs in and is invisible.  </li>
            <li>We used this all last summer and bought more for this summer.  </li>
            <li>And it is actually fragrance free!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;-Is ranked higher on EWG sunscreen reviews, so felt at ease as I applied it all over, day after day ([...]</li>
            <li>So I bought this one, since it was cheap and claimed to be natural.</li>
            <li>, when you first put it on it makes you look like a ghost.</li>
            <li>For my daily routine  I put this lotion on and then put my foundation over top</li>
            <li>I bought this because most have an ingredient called avobenzone which will stain clothes when mixed with iron and this one does not.</li>
            <li>I am able to rub the white into my skin so that there is none of the dreaded &amp;#34;white cast.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;+Not exactly matte.</li>
            <li>Have used this for the last couple years and many times at the beach since my review</li>
            <li>No such thing happened, even after taking a dip in the water :)</li>
            <li>I applied it twice a day for the first three days.</li>
            <li>I wore pants and a tank top, so I only needed it for my neck, arms, hands, and shoulders.</li>
            <li>No weird reaction - check.</li>
            <li>Time for the real test!</li>
            <li>and I was concerned at first that it would feel greasy</li>
            <li>Since it didnt work the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s just from riding inside a car with tinted back windows most of the day.</li>
            <li>👎🏻 Back to searching for a better alternative.</li>
            <li>It takes a few good rubs to rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li>I chose this one from the ewg website because of its relatively low rating, plus its SUPER CHEAP compared to the others.  </li>
            <li>After years of trying various mineral sunscreens, so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin, and it prevented sunburn and didn&#x27;t react negatively to my skin.</li>
            <li>Very thick but nice and rated as one of the safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li>dont think killing orangutans by burning them alive in order to get palm oil seeds is a very sustainable and \\&quot;cruelty free \\</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural, effective, and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>E.g. Coppertone water babies is carcinogenic, where as coppertone babies nice and easy is EXACTLY the same active ingredients as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I hope this will remain on EWG&#x27;s approved list for a long time.</li>
            <li>Wish I had found this years ago when my son first starting having mild reactions!</li>
            <li>It was easy to rub in and did not leave the white coating that some of the zinc oxide sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li>It is WHITE creme like lifeguards wear that does NOT blend in easily.</li>
            <li>It is nearly completely unscented - immediately after applying it you can barely smell something (not chemically and not obnoxious - but just a light non-perfumy smell) but then the smell dissipates very quickly (we are very scent sensitive).</li>
            <li>The sunscreen actually rubs in VERY easy (easier than most zinc oxide sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, definitely easier than Episencial and Kiss My Face) and I was NOT left looking like a ghost!</li>
            <li>Compared to previous all-mineral sunblocks I&#x27;ve used, this went on smooth &amp; light.</li>
            <li>It is also very moisturizing for me, but I have oily/normal combo skin, if you have dry skin you might need more than this.</li>
            <li>This is fine but be prepared to work on smoothing it into the skin because it leaves a white film.  </li>
            <li>Nice creamy sunscreen but a little sticky.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave white marks, no annoying odor, and protects very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen based on EWG&#x27;s review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very emollient as promised, but it&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li>Havent used this product yet, but I really like ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have to have sunscreen that is all mineral so that it both really blocks out the sun and never stings my eyes.</li>
            <li>This formulation really fits the bill.</li>
            <li>It is very emollient like the title of it</li>
            <li>so there are no irritating scent triggers.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very runny - and</li>
            <li>It is very water and sweat resistant (it says 80 or 90 minutes</li>
            <li>*Follow up post: I really don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining about the texture and thickness of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than whole foods has it.</li>
            <li>and I really re-apply it on as often as I would have thought I should</li>
            <li>This has no artificial or natural added scents, and doesn&#x27;t smell like plastic or sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my body - arms, shoulders, back, legs, feet, etc.  </li>
            <li>for having difficulties rubbing it in, you&#x27;re putting way too much on.</li>
            <li>It does feel very water resistant.</li>
            <li>It was the best option that wasn&#x27;t crazy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Ok....I have been looking for a non-chemical sunscreen for awhile because my neck gets very irritated....</li>
            <li>It is very resistant to the water, too.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is unscented, reasonably priced and will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels so much smoother</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but thick.  </li>
            <li>I admit it is very thick, but it is also very effective at keeping you from getting burned by the sun.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is a tad thicker than some other sunscreens out there, which I don&#x27;t really mind because I feel like most liquid sunscreens get too runny and you have to catch the liquid before it drips all over your shirt or something.</li>
            <li>applied before hitting the beach, sunscreen went on easily, and absorbed quickly, w/o sticky residue&lt;br /&gt;-Cost was competitive, especially when compared to other mineral based sunscreens (i.e. as compared to Badger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other two I tried this summer were better.  </li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that other products have.</li>
            <li>Probably due to the fantastic organic ingredients!</li>
            <li>Since I am trying to find everything as natural and healthy as possible out there, I decided to spend a little more to get a much safer sunscreen to use.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I felt that it was pretty much just as easy as rubbing in your typical chemical-based sunscreen.</li>
            <li>When I remember to use it consistently, my skin stays clear of acne</li>
            <li>m 35 years old and have normal-combo skin with rosacea in first stage.</li>
            <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent coverage, seems to stay effective well past the recommended 2-4 hour time limit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>now looking for non natural sunscreen or atleast a stronger higher SPF.</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals that break down into heaven-knows-what.  </li>
            <li>We needed a new batch of sunscreen for our RV travels, and this brand is one of the safest!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the healthy alternative to typical suntan lotion</li>
            <li>the ingredients are less chemical-y than most is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>I shop out however, and Amazon can typically get a better price, even with shipping.</li>
            <li>I have to double check in the mirror to make sure I don&#x27;t have white smears all over my face.</li>
            <li>I love it but only wish my local stores would stocked it!</li>
            <li>While the jury is still out, I figure better safe than sorry.  </li>
            <li>Seems OK, but when living in a high sun, high altitude area where you need this every day several times daily, the price is way too high.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s in the Seattle area, not in a high heat/sun area.</li>
            <li>originally found this sunscreen from another review as this is a cheaper (cost per oince) natural sunscreen and receives a low EWG</li>
            <li>I love this brand but not a huge fan of this particular sunscreen</li>
            <li>Still wish they made a much larger size - would be willing to pay for a large pump size.</li>
            <li>Still wish they made a much larger size - would be willing to pay for a large pump size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in case anyone was wondering, I have normal to oily skin, and this product,</li>
            <li>This is nice, but still really thick.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s thick at first, but you&#x27;ll be happy for the thickness after trying something thin and liquidy like the Alba SPF 40 Sport (blue bottle).</li>
            <li>so I started researching for a new sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and use sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs quickly (less than 5 minutes)</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable, as well, especially compared to comparably rated products.</li>
            <li>A little Thick for my liking, but better than most out there.</li>
            <li>But for someone who would want to use it daily might want to check the compatibility with skin first.</li>
            <li>it looks pretty wait on my middle tone skin, I feel it greasy too.</li>
            <li>As with many other reviewers, I bought this sunblock based on the rating of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s (EWG) Skin Deep reviews.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s non-toxic and environmentally friendly, but so are lots of other brands.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price and availability for this sunscreen by far - difficult to find in stores and when you do it&#x27;s much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price and availability for this sunscreen by far - difficult to find in stores and when you do it&#x27;s much more expensive.</li>
            <li>However, I need one in case I have to expose to sun light for a long time, such as on beach.</li>
            <li>kind of like Desitin, so it&#x27;s not really pleasant to put on.</li>
            <li>Granted I am pregnant and need a little more protection, I was adamant about reapply every 80 mins after swimming, however, I still got slightly burnt</li>
            <li>Look at the active ingredients and as long as they are maked safe by EWG go and buy it.</li>
            <li>This one is nice though very thick.</li>
            <li>Although I have found they make this in a clear spray now - although have not yet checked the chemical safety on the web.</li>
            <li>means i can slather all over my face, and don&#x27;t have to be cautious around the sensitive eye area at all.</li>
            <li>stuff~ like that it is natural</li>
            <li>I lathered my 10 month old up in the sunscreen about 20 minutes before taking her out to her baby pool.  </li>
            <li>well, actually it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Nearly completely mineral based, for those who care&lt;br /&gt;+PA+++, as rated by MA working document.</li>
            <li>Its also very greasy, when I put this on my face it feels like and looks like i am wearing a white mask.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that this product is natural and I&#x27;m not introducing millions of toxins into my skin.</li>
            <li>I use Alba products frequently.</li>
            <li>again because of natural ingredients that wont harm my health and environment.</li>
            <li>Our whole family is now using this and won&#x27;t go back to the store bought sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Personally I like the green tea formula more, but that is rated 6/8.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ok although it is hard to tell as I was only out in the late part of the day and the sun wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers note, this product is harder to apply than more convenient formulations.  </li>
            <li>I find that using a couple of drops of facial oil first about ten minutes or so before applying this really helps with the white cast.</li>
            <li>, is extremely moisturizing, performs well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t make my tattoo appear faded or bluish like many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I spent hours looking on EWG&#x27;s approved sunscreen list and decided on Alba&#x27;s Very Emollient Sunscreen because of the price and high rating.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say what it looks like on your face, as I used Blue Lizard Face for that, but Blue Lizard seemed to leave my face even more oddly tinted than the Alba did on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A small dab is enough to do most of the face.</li>
            <li>Long history of too much sun exposure.</li>
            <li>than that ,its not hard to apply and It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film looking after rubs in .</li>
            <li>and if you just massage the tube a little bit it mixes quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I love the product, the only problem is that it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Very greasy and heavy on the skin, hence the very emollient I guess.</li>
            <li>With very sun-sensitive skin, I need a sunscreen that works --- to have one that not only protects but also doesn&#x27;t leave me pasty or require skin-sinking chemicals is such a delight.</li>
            <li>As with all titanium/zinc oxide sunscreens, it goes on white and can give you a white cast if you apply too much.  </li>
            <li>It is thick but spreads easily and absorbs rapidly.</li>
            <li>Its nice to see Amazon using smaller packages, but for an item like this the book box doesn&#x27;t work because its to thin.</li>
            <li>I reapplied at the beach, perhaps due to higher humidity?</li>
            <li>It may be slightly thicker than normal sunscreens but not by much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has proven effective under tough circumstance (long, sweaty runs and swimming in the pool).  </li>
            <li>I have been using physical sunblocks for over 15 years, and in the class reunions, I look 15 years younger than my peers in grade school, high school, university, and grad</li>
            <li>I immediately took her inside and was horrified to see that she was completely burned on her back and arms!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been making an effort to get rid of all the parabens and find natural products.  </li>
            <li>i recommend this to anyone wanting only natural things on their body to help with burning with the sun.</li>
            <li>on the weekends during summer and barely need to reapply even after getting in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li>It works well but be aware you will need to really rub it in because it is a thick mineral sunblock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, I just got tired of it and wanted it to go away faster.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, I was very weary of it because it looked so thick.</li>
            <li>We both only burned once - due to only putting it on once in the morning while we were out swimming our first day (our fault!).</li>
            <li>Goes on super white, heavy, and greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s exactly the same ingredients as man other cheaper sunscreens, like Coppertone Baby (</li>
            <li>have very dry, very sensitive skin, and it is SO hard to find a product that is 1) moisturizing 2) protecting and 3) fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>but it really feels like it gets into my skin and does not leave a film or sticky residue like other products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some mineral sunscreens will cause a whitish cast to the skin, but this absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause a noticeable cast--at least on my skin, but I am very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not particular to this product (Abla Botanica) but to almost all sunblocks that use titanium/zinc oxides, so its nothing new...</li>
            <li>Greasy enough to stay all day and by some accounts much safer than other brands and formulations.</li>
            <li>We were in Mexico and it really didn&#x27;t hold up well for the sun down there in April.  </li>
            <li>but this one is the first one I have tried in years that is non-chemical and doesn&#x27;t make you pale as a ghost.</li>
            <li>While it goes on easier, it doesn&#x27;t protect as long or as much as the one I just mentioned, probably because the Mineral sunscreen is harder to apply, and therefore stays on longer, especially in the water, in contrast to this one.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is very thick, but goes on smoothly for even coverage.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Of those without this ingredient, Consumer Reports rated this the best.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is the best protection against skin cancer, wrinkles and brown spots.</li>

            <li> A great thing like this would cost 30 usd in Japan.</li>
            <li> it works great, just not if you&#x27;re in the water.</li>
            <li> Great suntan cream.  </li>
            <li> Great protection - we did not burn once using this product, even when we waited longer than 2 hrs to reapply.</li>

            <li> Feels great once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> As a mineral based sunscreen, this is very nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is very effective.</li>
            <li> I could see this working great as a sunscreen alternative for your face because it has a good deal of SPF</li>
            <li> /&gt;As stated it has no added fragrance, but does have a pleasant smell from the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No reaction, goes on easily without feeling oily, no perfume smells, and worked great at the pool on a sunny afternoon for 3 hours!  </li>
            <li> good product, thank you</li>
            <li> When using on the face or anywhere on body you have to rub it in really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for outings in Northern California, and it went on well, was not sticky, and provided good protection.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievably good.  </li>
            <li> all good</li>
            <li> one good thing about the product.</li>
            <li> We have extremely fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> the price has jumped from $1.40 per oz to $2.00 per oz since the good press.  </li>
            <li> What this means is that this gives optimum protection for sunburn and skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No fragrances, no irritants and a fair price.  </li>
            <li> However, it stays on and provides good protection for hours.  </li>
            <li> Loved it on our Jamaica trip.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t come off very easily, which is great for sports like cycling.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Their formula is excellent, I was really happy to find a sunscreen that blended into my skin so nicely without having to put much effort into rubbing it</li>
            <li> Great safe sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Healthy and works great...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s effective, feels good on the skin and it works well...</li>
            <li> a good sunblock that was not greasy and did the job, have worn it all day and it blends nicely...</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;m glad we have a safe, inexpensive sunscreen for our kids!</li>
            <li> Great price, smells great, right level of thickness.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve tried, but pretty good, safe mineral block.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an amazing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Nice price too.  </li>
            <li> We have found it provides nice</li>
            <li> I have used most of the sunscreens in their line and have loved them all.  </li>
            <li> Rubbed nicely into my face and makeup went on</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is totally effective.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin nicely and isn&#x27;t pasty.</li>
            <li> Worked well and it was nice to know that the sun screen I was using didn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I would prefer to use Thinkbaby/Thinksport because their ingredients yield the best possible safety rating on the EWG website, this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent sunscreen for rosacea since it has no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> Best natural sunscreen for the price.</li>
            <li> (nearly everything causes me to break out or get a rash, so this is wonderful).</li>
            <li> We were on a beach vacation and it was our first time out in the sun for the summer, and this sunscreen worked GREAT.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty great for a mineral sunblock.</li>
            <li> I was happy that this sunscreen repelled water so well &amp; was made up of mineral ingredients, however, it did not hold up for this hot California valley sun.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no longer the great deal it was when it was first announced.</li>
            <li> It works amazing, I havent burned once and my skin is pretty fair.  </li>
            <li> The price was good, it was shipped quickly and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> You can buy coppertone babies nice and easy</li>
            <li> No burns when using this even on very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Currently, my favorite sunblock.  </li>
            <li> so that I am able to put on my sunscreen soon afterword.</li>
            <li> Read more about sunscreens here:</li>
            <li> Better ingredients than a lot of the lotions out there.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in the middle of a week at the beach and this has provided wonderful protection.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love the fact that it has non-nano zinc and titanium.</li>
            <li> Love all the alba sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time, I don&#x27;t use sunblock, because I don&#x27;t like the oily feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I believe I prefer these ingredients over the ones in the more advertised brands anyhow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this sunscreen and its effectiveness, texture, and the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great sun protection and that&#x27;s the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> I love Alba products.  </li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> With all the options out there today the tons upon tons of choices I won&#x27;t contribute to the loss of precious economy systems and species to save a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> Its 1.40$ an ounce, when the others are more like 5$-10$ or more an ounce.  </li>
            <li> 35 spf on my face (which I LOVE except for its price - 9.30$ an ounce).  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face shiny if I apply more than a 1/4 teaspoon to my face</li>
            <li> And I could tell that it was still on my skin doing its magic after getting into the pool because the water was beading on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27; lists out ALL the safe and carcinogenic ingredients in sunscreens.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get more freckles.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for in a sunscreen?</li>
            <li> and we ended up using more than planned.</li>
            <li> I am so glad i brought a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t expire until 2015.</li>
            <li> If they can do that in a book box even better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a great product and much cheaper online than in stores.</li>
            <li> more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I love all alba sunscreen and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I love all Alba products, and this one doesn&#x27;t dissapoint.</li>
            <li> I would argue it&#x27;s better than the scented ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alba products are top notch.</li>
            <li> I have 3 children and we mostly use this on our faces/necks during sports seasons and during the winter.  </li>
            <li> my face does ok but neck can&#x27;t handle  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to make sure it didn&#x27;t cause a reaction.</li>
            <li> Application feels greasy :) I will not buy the Very Emollient again, but I will stick with the Alba Botania because of a great formulation.  </li>
            <li> I tend to wear those that are fragrance free, so I liked that about this product.</li>
            <li> but you can spread it around and that takes more effort than a lighter weight sunscreen or a spray sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> Most were spf 15 and availability was sporadic.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I had been trying out the sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of best rated sunscreens and this one is hands down my favorite!</li>
            <li> So far so good - very pleased with the product and just ordered two more bottles through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am sure high percentage of zinc oxide provides great protection from burning and photo aging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am happy with the way it goes on, not as oily and sticky as some of the others, so I highly recommend that you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this in 70-80+ degree weather with bright sun</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but does take a bit of time to rub in.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s worth it for me to have the advantage of the excellent protection this product offers.</li>
            <li> This was a super effective sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell was pleasant and very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very effective natural sunscreen, but you do still have to reapply every two hours or so to make sure you are fully protected.</li>
            <li> , sunscreen didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly and was a bit more sticky, thus attracting sand.</li>
            <li> When used in combo with my foundation it gave me a nice healthy glow, but when I would use it without foundation it made me look pretty shiny</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s frangance free</li>
            <li> I love knowing that i am using chemical free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a great experience so far using the Alba Botanica mineral sunblock SPF 30.  </li>
            <li> Effective, economical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It absorbed well, felt nice, and did what it was supposed to do - protected my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE plus, as most sunscreens with this rating are easily $50 (*cough*Shiseido)&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent for body coverage, although it will make your skin a tad</li>
            <li> No scent, spreads easy, moist, no ghost look.  </li>
            <li> says so that it spreads on easily.</li>
            <li> This is an easy one for me to get in to the habit of using so</li>
            <li> As I do not step out so often, I do not mind the patches as they go easily in two days.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, is moisturizing, and easy to know where you applied it.  </li>
            <li> Good natural product but thicker than I expected so not the best for your face.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, feels light and fades easily like body butter.</li>
            <li> It spreads on easily and is quite smooth.  </li>
            <li> EWG gave it a good rating, and I liked that it was full spectrum via physical blockers (zinc and titanium).</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, smells good, easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I normally wear a high SPF, since I am very fair.</li>
            <li> Love the products, &amp; fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li> Fairly light consistentcy and no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is fragrance free</li>
            <li> IS fragrance free though....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my 14 mo on toddler effectively for whole summer.</li>
            <li> I took this sunscreen with me to Italy (cities and beaches) and it was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Extra great on roof of head--balding here, nose  and shoulders.</li>
            <li> This product is fragrance free as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I have actually received complements about how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> It goes on well, no chalky white streaks, it feels nice throughout the day, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Good for skin sensitive to chemical sunscreen agents  because it is</li>
            <li> After my 20 year old son had a reaction to &amp;#34;Chemical laden sunscreens&amp;#34;, we looked for a product that was safe and still effective.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the odor of the product stayed with me pretty strongly for a couple of days even after a couple more showers.</li>
            <li> Good news, it pretty much acted as a sweater.</li>
            <li> This product meets my needs of being effective and receiving a high rating from EWG.org.</li>
            <li> Thick but easy to apply and provides excellent sun protection.  </li>
            <li> My friend who easily gets irritated from most sunscreens said this one really worked well for her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this today ... was so excited</li>
            <li> After watching a video review on this product, I was already pretty confident in the product.</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s very smooth and has no smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li> texture was nice, not hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> NICE AND EASY - this part is important, the regular baby one has carcinogenic</li>
            <li> Overall a great product and one of the most affordable natural sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li> it is emollient, so that part is true.</li>
            <li> It also protects the skin from the full UVA/UVB range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that it is a much healthier choice.</li>
            <li> Only a 1 on the skindeep app, which is really good.</li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> Unlike some mineral sunscreens, it is not impossible to rub in.</li>
            <li> This is super emollient so keep it in mind.  </li>
            <li> Every major brand of sunscreen causes rashes for me, so I have been thrilled with Alba sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li> This product ranks high on the environmental scale with no nasty chemicals and it works well.</li>
            <li> This one is probably good for sun exposure where you&#x27;re not bathing in water for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is our new favorite (and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The formulation has changed so that this sunscreen is very creamy and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> A problem with the newer thinner formulation is that they did not change the container and the hole at the top is too large for this thinner formulation, and the sunscreen comes out in large quantity if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It goes on very creamy and smooth and soaks into the skin well.</li>
            <li> Like the more natural option.</li>
            <li> It can also be difficulty completely remove, but I&#x27;m happy to use it when I&#x27;ll be in the water for several hours.</li>
            <li> However, this is kind of a plus when you are outside because it won&#x27;t turn into watery goo when you go to reapply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned with a pink tone and don&#x27;t get color when I use this.  </li>
            <li> about 5 days worth of sunblock was stuck inside the lid and inside the bag.</li>
            <li> In the case of this product you throw away maybe a dollar&#x27;s worth of sunscreen.n&#x27;t</li>
            <li> In the case of this product you throw away maybe a dollar&#x27;s worth of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet found a &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreen that I totally love, so the hunt continues...</li>
            <li> the price is so much better than many of the other mineral options).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately there is a smell but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and it&#x27;s mostly pretty mild.</li>
            <li> It lightened my skin considerably at first, but quickly settled in.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t forget the nice and easy part) for half the price.</li>
            <li> This rich cream keeps my skin very hydrated in the sun.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> As it is now, it provides a muscle-building exercise for my right hand.</li>
            <li> In fact, it rubs in quite easily, and when you&#x27;re sunscreening an entire family, that is important.  </li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen except don&#x27;t use it on your face/head if you&#x27;re in the water or excessively</li>
            <li> so it has the general problems that most mineral sunblocks have  .its</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my DeVita Solar Protective Moisturizer, which is just as effective but much smoother and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t see the white, its much better then every other product I tried that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found for an affordable physical sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel particularly heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I could never be sure I&#x27;d really gotten complete coverage.</li>
            <li> I applied this once before spending the day (very hot, very sun) at a theme park.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use on places where you may have dry skin (I use it on my legs only) and for that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> And today the 2nd day of a really bright hot day I&#x27;m even more darker, really dark, just like I didnt use any sunblock again.</li>
            <li> There is no smell which is a huge plus and very easy on the skin for little ones.</li>
            <li> It kept us from getting sunburned when we spent a month in Istanbul during the summer, and it also made our skin look more clean and youthful.  </li>
            <li> At first, you look like you just put on clown makeup, but with a bit of effort, it rubs in and is invisible.  </li>
            <li> We used this all last summer and bought more for this summer.  </li>
            <li> And it is actually fragrance free!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Is ranked higher on EWG sunscreen reviews, so felt at ease as I applied it all over, day after day ([...]</li>
            <li> So I bought this one, since it was cheap and claimed to be natural.</li>
            <li> , when you first put it on it makes you look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> For my daily routine  I put this lotion on and then put my foundation over top</li>
            <li> I bought this because most have an ingredient called avobenzone which will stain clothes when mixed with iron and this one does not.</li>
            <li> I am able to rub the white into my skin so that there is none of the dreaded &amp;#34;white cast.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;+Not exactly matte.</li>
            <li> Have used this for the last couple years and many times at the beach since my review</li>
            <li> No such thing happened, even after taking a dip in the water :)</li>
            <li> I applied it twice a day for the first three days.</li>
            <li> I wore pants and a tank top, so I only needed it for my neck, arms, hands, and shoulders.</li>
            <li> No weird reaction - check.</li>
            <li> Time for the real test!</li>
            <li> and I was concerned at first that it would feel greasy</li>
            <li> Since it didnt work the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s just from riding inside a car with tinted back windows most of the day.</li>
            <li> 👎🏻 Back to searching for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> It takes a few good rubs to rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> I chose this one from the ewg website because of its relatively low rating, plus its SUPER CHEAP compared to the others.  </li>
            <li> After years of trying various mineral sunscreens, so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin, and it prevented sunburn and didn&#x27;t react negatively to my skin.</li>
            <li> Very thick but nice and rated as one of the safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li> dont think killing orangutans by burning them alive in order to get palm oil seeds is a very sustainable and \\&quot;cruelty free \\</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, effective, and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> E.g. Coppertone water babies is carcinogenic, where as coppertone babies nice and easy is EXACTLY the same active ingredients as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I hope this will remain on EWG&#x27;s approved list for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this years ago when my son first starting having mild reactions!</li>
            <li> It was easy to rub in and did not leave the white coating that some of the zinc oxide sunscreens do.  </li>
            <li> It is WHITE creme like lifeguards wear that does NOT blend in easily.</li>
            <li> It is nearly completely unscented - immediately after applying it you can barely smell something (not chemically and not obnoxious - but just a light non-perfumy smell) but then the smell dissipates very quickly (we are very scent sensitive).</li>
            <li> The sunscreen actually rubs in VERY easy (easier than most zinc oxide sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, definitely easier than Episencial and Kiss My Face) and I was NOT left looking like a ghost!</li>
            <li> Compared to previous all-mineral sunblocks I&#x27;ve used, this went on smooth &amp; light.</li>
            <li> It is also very moisturizing for me, but I have oily/normal combo skin, if you have dry skin you might need more than this.</li>
            <li> This is fine but be prepared to work on smoothing it into the skin because it leaves a white film.  </li>
            <li> Nice creamy sunscreen but a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave white marks, no annoying odor, and protects very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen based on EWG&#x27;s review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very emollient as promised, but it&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li> Havent used this product yet, but I really like ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have to have sunscreen that is all mineral so that it both really blocks out the sun and never stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> This formulation really fits the bill.</li>
            <li> It is very emollient like the title of it</li>
            <li> so there are no irritating scent triggers.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is very runny - and</li>
            <li> It is very water and sweat resistant (it says 80 or 90 minutes</li>
            <li> *Follow up post: I really don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining about the texture and thickness of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than whole foods has it.</li>
            <li> and I really re-apply it on as often as I would have thought I should</li>
            <li> This has no artificial or natural added scents, and doesn&#x27;t smell like plastic or sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my body - arms, shoulders, back, legs, feet, etc.  </li>
            <li> for having difficulties rubbing it in, you&#x27;re putting way too much on.</li>
            <li> It does feel very water resistant.</li>
            <li> It was the best option that wasn&#x27;t crazy</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Ok....I have been looking for a non-chemical sunscreen for awhile because my neck gets very irritated....</li>
            <li> It is very resistant to the water, too.</li>
            <li> I really like that it is unscented, reasonably priced and will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels so much smoother</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but thick.  </li>
            <li> I admit it is very thick, but it is also very effective at keeping you from getting burned by the sun.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is a tad thicker than some other sunscreens out there, which I don&#x27;t really mind because I feel like most liquid sunscreens get too runny and you have to catch the liquid before it drips all over your shirt or something.</li>
            <li> applied before hitting the beach, sunscreen went on easily, and absorbed quickly, w/o sticky residue&lt;br /&gt;-Cost was competitive, especially when compared to other mineral based sunscreens (i.e. as compared to Badger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other two I tried this summer were better.  </li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that other products have.</li>
            <li> Probably due to the fantastic organic ingredients!</li>
            <li> Since I am trying to find everything as natural and healthy as possible out there, I decided to spend a little more to get a much safer sunscreen to use.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I felt that it was pretty much just as easy as rubbing in your typical chemical-based sunscreen.</li>
            <li> When I remember to use it consistently, my skin stays clear of acne</li>
            <li> m 35 years old and have normal-combo skin with rosacea in first stage.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent coverage, seems to stay effective well past the recommended 2-4 hour time limit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> now looking for non natural sunscreen or atleast a stronger higher SPF.</li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals that break down into heaven-knows-what.  </li>
            <li> We needed a new batch of sunscreen for our RV travels, and this brand is one of the safest!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the healthy alternative to typical suntan lotion</li>
            <li> the ingredients are less chemical-y than most is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I shop out however, and Amazon can typically get a better price, even with shipping.</li>
            <li> I have to double check in the mirror to make sure I don&#x27;t have white smears all over my face.</li>
            <li> I love it but only wish my local stores would stocked it!</li>
            <li> While the jury is still out, I figure better safe than sorry.  </li>
            <li> Seems OK, but when living in a high sun, high altitude area where you need this every day several times daily, the price is way too high.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s in the Seattle area, not in a high heat/sun area.</li>
            <li> originally found this sunscreen from another review as this is a cheaper (cost per oince) natural sunscreen and receives a low EWG</li>
            <li> I love this brand but not a huge fan of this particular sunscreen</li>
            <li> Still wish they made a much larger size - would be willing to pay for a large pump size.</li>
            <li> Still wish they made a much larger size - would be willing to pay for a large pump size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in case anyone was wondering, I have normal to oily skin, and this product,</li>
            <li> This is nice, but still really thick.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s thick at first, but you&#x27;ll be happy for the thickness after trying something thin and liquidy like the Alba SPF 40 Sport (blue bottle).</li>
            <li> so I started researching for a new sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and use sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and absorbs quickly (less than 5 minutes)</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable, as well, especially compared to comparably rated products.</li>
            <li> A little Thick for my liking, but better than most out there.</li>
            <li> But for someone who would want to use it daily might want to check the compatibility with skin first.</li>
            <li> it looks pretty wait on my middle tone skin, I feel it greasy too.</li>
            <li> As with many other reviewers, I bought this sunblock based on the rating of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s (EWG) Skin Deep reviews.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s non-toxic and environmentally friendly, but so are lots of other brands.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price and availability for this sunscreen by far - difficult to find in stores and when you do it&#x27;s much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price and availability for this sunscreen by far - difficult to find in stores and when you do it&#x27;s much more expensive.</li>
            <li> However, I need one in case I have to expose to sun light for a long time, such as on beach.</li>
            <li> kind of like Desitin, so it&#x27;s not really pleasant to put on.</li>
            <li> Granted I am pregnant and need a little more protection, I was adamant about reapply every 80 mins after swimming, however, I still got slightly burnt</li>
            <li> Look at the active ingredients and as long as they are maked safe by EWG go and buy it.</li>
            <li> This one is nice though very thick.</li>
            <li> Although I have found they make this in a clear spray now - although have not yet checked the chemical safety on the web.</li>
            <li> means i can slather all over my face, and don&#x27;t have to be cautious around the sensitive eye area at all.</li>
            <li> stuff~ like that it is natural</li>
            <li> I lathered my 10 month old up in the sunscreen about 20 minutes before taking her out to her baby pool.  </li>
            <li> well, actually it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Nearly completely mineral based, for those who care&lt;br /&gt;+PA+++, as rated by MA working document.</li>
            <li> Its also very greasy, when I put this on my face it feels like and looks like i am wearing a white mask.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this product is natural and I&#x27;m not introducing millions of toxins into my skin.</li>
            <li> I use Alba products frequently.</li>
            <li> again because of natural ingredients that wont harm my health and environment.</li>
            <li> Our whole family is now using this and won&#x27;t go back to the store bought sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Personally I like the green tea formula more, but that is rated 6/8.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ok although it is hard to tell as I was only out in the late part of the day and the sun wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers note, this product is harder to apply than more convenient formulations.  </li>
            <li> I find that using a couple of drops of facial oil first about ten minutes or so before applying this really helps with the white cast.</li>
            <li> , is extremely moisturizing, performs well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t make my tattoo appear faded or bluish like many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I spent hours looking on EWG&#x27;s approved sunscreen list and decided on Alba&#x27;s Very Emollient Sunscreen because of the price and high rating.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say what it looks like on your face, as I used Blue Lizard Face for that, but Blue Lizard seemed to leave my face even more oddly tinted than the Alba did on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A small dab is enough to do most of the face.</li>
            <li> Long history of too much sun exposure.</li>
            <li> than that ,its not hard to apply and It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film looking after rubs in .</li>
            <li> and if you just massage the tube a little bit it mixes quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love the product, the only problem is that it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and heavy on the skin, hence the very emollient I guess.</li>
            <li> With very sun-sensitive skin, I need a sunscreen that works --- to have one that not only protects but also doesn&#x27;t leave me pasty or require skin-sinking chemicals is such a delight.</li>
            <li> As with all titanium/zinc oxide sunscreens, it goes on white and can give you a white cast if you apply too much.  </li>
            <li> It is thick but spreads easily and absorbs rapidly.</li>
            <li> Its nice to see Amazon using smaller packages, but for an item like this the book box doesn&#x27;t work because its to thin.</li>
            <li> I reapplied at the beach, perhaps due to higher humidity?</li>
            <li> It may be slightly thicker than normal sunscreens but not by much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has proven effective under tough circumstance (long, sweaty runs and swimming in the pool).  </li>
            <li> I have been using physical sunblocks for over 15 years, and in the class reunions, I look 15 years younger than my peers in grade school, high school, university, and grad</li>
            <li> I immediately took her inside and was horrified to see that she was completely burned on her back and arms!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been making an effort to get rid of all the parabens and find natural products.  </li>
            <li> i recommend this to anyone wanting only natural things on their body to help with burning with the sun.</li>
            <li> on the weekends during summer and barely need to reapply even after getting in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li> It works well but be aware you will need to really rub it in because it is a thick mineral sunblock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, I just got tired of it and wanted it to go away faster.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, I was very weary of it because it looked so thick.</li>
            <li> We both only burned once - due to only putting it on once in the morning while we were out swimming our first day (our fault!).</li>
            <li> Goes on super white, heavy, and greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly the same ingredients as man other cheaper sunscreens, like Coppertone Baby (</li>
            <li> have very dry, very sensitive skin, and it is SO hard to find a product that is 1) moisturizing 2) protecting and 3) fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> but it really feels like it gets into my skin and does not leave a film or sticky residue like other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some mineral sunscreens will cause a whitish cast to the skin, but this absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause a noticeable cast--at least on my skin, but I am very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not particular to this product (Abla Botanica) but to almost all sunblocks that use titanium/zinc oxides, so its nothing new...</li>
            <li> Greasy enough to stay all day and by some accounts much safer than other brands and formulations.</li>
            <li> We were in Mexico and it really didn&#x27;t hold up well for the sun down there in April.  </li>
            <li> but this one is the first one I have tried in years that is non-chemical and doesn&#x27;t make you pale as a ghost.</li>
            <li> While it goes on easier, it doesn&#x27;t protect as long or as much as the one I just mentioned, probably because the Mineral sunscreen is harder to apply, and therefore stays on longer, especially in the water, in contrast to this one.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very thick, but goes on smoothly for even coverage.</li>
            <li> All natural sunscreen without the chemicals that are found in other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs really well - different from zinc products I bought in the past</li>
            <li> I asked my husband to put some on my back, and he complained the whole time!</li>
            <li> I would have used it on my whole body, but it&#x27;s such a small tube..</li>
            <li> Plus it goes on so thick and pastey white that I have to wipe my arms off some first and then try and get it off my palms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only it doesn&#x27;t take long to rub it, it doesn&#x27;t make you look pasty</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick and does not glide nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was very thick and took a little effort to spread, but it went on ok.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and hard to apply, but it&#x27;s Ok for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to stay dry, or it&#x27;s a daily sunscreen before going out, go for it.</li>
            <li> Only con is it starts to feel dry after awhile.</li>
            <li> black pavement, beaming direct sun, etc.</li>
            <li> immediately used 3 oil blotting sheet and 2 hours later used another 3... dry skin, maybe;</li>
            <li> /&gt;The latest formulation as of Sept 2016 is much less thick than previously.</li>
            <li> I have only two colors: white and pink.</li>
            <li> others have mentioned about this and other mineral sunscreens, I was expecting this sunscreen to possibly leave a white cast on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you put a little at a time, it goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Wet skin worsens the problem big time.  </li>
            <li> About 15 minutes after being outside, I noticed her skin looked really pink.  </li>
            <li> It is quite white but sinks in when spread on evenly</li>
            <li> This likely results in a thicker layer of sunscreen on skin, which starts to come off when wet.</li>
            <li> so I wouldnt recommend putting it on your face unless you don&#x27;t mind the strange smell.</li>
            <li> No burn, not even a hint of pink skin after spending several hours in the sun without reapplying.</li>
            <li> and it does the job all day long as I go about my outdoor activities.  </li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to absorb into skin.</li>
            <li> it to say, it goes on THICK and WHITE but it stays on much longer than other sunscreens without need for a re-apply, even at the beach.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and used it at the beach in New Jersey one afternoon this past week.</li>
            <li> fact that it has both Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide means that it has a wider protective spectrum than sunscreens that only use one or the other.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it due to white cast and my tan skin.</li>
            <li> I only used this sunscreen on my face and neck, because the other one that I brought irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days of use it got rid of all of my dry patches without making my greasy spots even greasier.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re trying to show themselves as an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; compound by listing only the inactive ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients are Zinc Oxide (14.5 %), Titanium Dioxide (2.0 %).</li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve used Coppertone Sport and if I wasn&#x27;t consistent with reapplying I could always count on getting a sunburn.</li>
            <li> First of all, the lotion goes on very thick.</li>
            <li> hard to wash off by the normal cleanser.you</li>
            <li> Goes on thick, not thin and drippy, for coverage that should last a few hours.</li>
            <li> side-note, Amazon did refund me in full for the wrong product without me returning it.</li>
            <li> Some combination of the tan I got and the dust I was covered in seemed to protect me after that, so I only applied it in the morning after I wiped down with camp wipes.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, hard to rub in, but no sunburns!</li>
            <li> It may look a little white on your skin, but it goes away.  </li>
            <li> This gets 4 stars because it takes a little rubbing to get all the white to go away.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has the natural ingredients and physical sunblock I was looking for, but is very thick to apply.  </li>
            <li> I sincerely hope that this was a bad bottle or else there are going to be a lot of sunburned people around.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear (so far at least) to stain clothing.</li>
            <li> Our well water has iron and the water softener cannot be expected to get 100% of it out.</li>
            <li> This product was not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not as messy as California Baby or Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is very similar to the Alba green tea spf.</li>
            <li> You can wet your arms to make this easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent a day in Florida&#x27;s summer heat looking for a car...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does make my skin feel oily when used alone - it never really completely sank into my skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the thick film left on my hands after application, but I simply wiped it off on a towel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically after spending a week looking through ingredients and doing research I&#x27;ve found there is VERY LITTLE difference between different brands, it&#x27;s ALL about</li>
            <li> This item arrived in the thin box normally reserved for Amazon books.</li>
            <li> They need to use a small traditional box, place a sticker on the cap and wrap the tube in a layer of bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> There is some debate about whether oxybenzone and other synthetic ingredients can absorb into the bloodstream and mimic estrogen, causing all sorts of health issues in women.</li>
            <li> but so are all the other brands that don&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is VERY heavy and goes on white.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate it&#x27;s natural ingredient list, but this Alba sunblock was very hard to spread, making it not very useful as a sunblock.</li>
            <li> But I have felt that every time after using it, it leaves a few dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was fairly thick and did give me a slightly purplish look for 10-20 minutes because of the white paste contrasted to my tan skin, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter when you&#x27;re in a desert under the blaring sun and getting dusty anyway.</li>
            <li> otherwise there is a white residue left, which is very annoying; especially since I am only outside for 15 minutes then the next 6 hrs I am inside.</li>
            <li> While it may seem like you&#x27;re paying a lot for a little, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its thicker than Im used to.  </li>
            <li> Thick, so harder to rub in, but it lasted all day long.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is smell and some greasiness</li>
            <li> The only however is that it is thick.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;+As thick as Greek yogurt. . .</li>
            <li> However, unlike another alba sunscreen I tried, this one goes on a bit thick and white.</li>
            <li> It does, however, go on white and is fairly thick.  </li>
            <li> One slight negative: the opening in the tube needs to be made bigger so it takes less pressure to squeeze out the cream.</li>
            <li> Although I have not yet tested it at the beach it is very difficult to wash from my hands after putting it on little people - so I can only assume it will stay on very well for water play.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my face seems to get more damaged with bigger broken capillaries as time goes on and the sun makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> I actually gave it to my husband to try as it seemed a little thick for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I typically use a lighter moisturizer but it wasn&#x27;t doing the trick</li>
            <li> paid less than seven bucks for this</li>
            <li> When I saw dab, put a dot about half the size of a penny and rub it into your forehead.</li>
            <li> The lotion was really thick and a little difficult to rub in (which could be due to sitting in a hot warehouse before I purchased it, who knows).</li>
            <li> Cons: makes your face a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> Even though I have dry skin, Im prone to breaking out from thick products</li>
            <li> A little greasy for my face.  </li>
            <li> but I let it go a little longer with no issues).  </li>
            <li> I have always used 50 for fear of little people getting burned so was a little hesitant about it &amp;#34;only&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> you just need a little so bottle lasts</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with really bad dry spots on my cheeks and forhead with a really greasy nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I like that its &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; as in it doesn&#x27;t have toxic or harmful ingredients but its not very safe from the sun, because my ass got burnt.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hands after applying it because it makes them feel weird, it doesn&#x27;t have the texture of a normal lotion.</li>
            <li> Therefore it reflects the uv rays, rather than absorbs them and without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> But my search for an everyday, just out of the shower moisturizer with sunscreen continues.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times.</li>
            <li> It saves my skin from the harsh sun.</li>
            <li> Money wasted....</li>
            <li> Also I feel like it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> He had it in his eyes a few times, but he didn&#x27;t show any discomfort.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the green bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money these fancy brands.</li>
            <li> have ordered the sunscreen a few times since and haven&#x27;t had any issues with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I keep this one in my purse with me for everyday use</li>
            <li> According to Environmental Working Group, this is one of the few sun screens that doesn&#x27;t contribute to harming our coastal reef life.</li>
            <li> This is an effective sunscreen, but the consistency is terrible.</li>
            <li> With this new style plastic squeeze tube the final portion of stuff is very difficult to coax from the tube, It takes squeezing really hard ans/or prying off the lid with a screwdriver.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens that contain harsh chemicals that I&#x27;m skeptical of, this contains only zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it on thick like other sun screen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very thick, it is hard to rub in and stays white on your skin when you get in the water.</li>
            <li> I like to use Alba sunscreen because it&#x27;s the least expensive natural sunblock out there.</li>
            <li> A little on the thick side but natural/mineral and does its job.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would purchase again.  </li>
            <li> But it WONT leave you white, so Ive heard of worse out there!  </li>
            <li> Because of its thick, heavy consistency, I don&#x27;t recommend using this sunblock on your face.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason it comes in a small bottle.</li>
            <li> After have put it on my face, oil is all over my hand, and my face is like an oil slick...</li>
            <li> On the plus side it doesn&#x27;t have the usual sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> So far hasn&#x27;t left that nasty residue layer on my skin that other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past leave.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too thick or too thin and stayed on for longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, but seems to protect well!</li>
            <li> the spf - tho it says 30 - is NOT very effective!</li>
            <li> That should counter the complaints about this being hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> It was thick and hard to apply and I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is not effective as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So to say the least, this sunblock did not do the job.</li>
            <li> ~ does go on thick but isn&#x27;t sticky or goopey...</li>
            <li> I hoped it would fade (it did) but leave my skin feeling like it has a thick film on it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> This one is too thick.  </li>
            <li> but is it just me or this stuff is soo thick</li>
            <li> It is thick and requires quite of bit of rubbing in</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> Not greasy, ever, but thick.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, not too thick or oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s insanely thick and just refuses to absorb into my skin, leaving me with a ghostly appearance for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It was that thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly thick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean, &amp;</li>
            <li> so It didn&#x27;t leave a white cast on me,and its not greasy or sticky feeling doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.overall for the price and</li>
            <li> It is not easy to apply because of the weird consistency.  </li>
            <li> some of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands i&#x27;ve used leave a white paste and are terrible in the water.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit thick, but it works well against sunburn!</li>
            <li> very hard to rub in...</li>
            <li> Very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> very hard to rub in and water come out from it or some kinda liquid.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time, as it&#x27;s thick and difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted some sunscreen that didn&#x27;t have unhealthy ingredients, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> The formula is really thick, and somewhat difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t go to some annoying means to eke out the last portion then you end up throwing away some product.  </li>
            <li> go to some annoying means to eke out the last portion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn when I use it, though, and that&#x27;s the name of the game.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out this sunscreen now that I&#x27;ve learned my old sunscreens have terrible ratings according to the EWG.</li>
            <li> It was real thick and it took alot of effort to sooth it into your skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product...its very white!</li>
            <li> very thick and sticky!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on a bit thick and sticky but not as bad as some others and the fact</li>
            <li> Sorry, no go.</li>
            <li> I used it as well and did not find it to difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to rub in and to reapply if you&#x27;ve gotten sandy at the beach.</li>
            <li> This Alba Sunblock isn&#x27;t awful but it&#x27;s too white when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> the cream is too difficult to spread</li>
            <li> I try not to use sunscreen all the time though as I&#x27;m a bit deficient on vitamin D!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering stuff online for years and have never seen such awful packaging or had product arrive leaking.</li>
            <li> Also, be wary -</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I got this so that I wasnt using my other sunscreen with tons of nasty chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for this - it is aweful to apply and smells really badly.</li>
            <li> So bad on that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointing Alba.</li>
            <li> I hate when products say they are</li>
            <li> I will be very sad if this product is ever discontinued!</li>
            <li> I used this product once and hated it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Non-greasy. Absorbs well. Like the more natural option.</li>
            <li> A little greasy for my face.  Must rub a lot to get the white color to go away.</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s effective, feels good on the skin and it works well... I just don&#x27;t like being white. I take it back, after awhile, you stop being white, though I wasn&#x27;t paying attention so I don&#x27;t know when that happens.</li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve tried, but pretty good, safe mineral block.  I actually gave it to my husband to try as it seemed a little thick for my taste.  He seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Currently, my favorite sunblock.  No nasty chemicals that break down into heaven-knows-what.  Lots of Zinc (18%) and a bit of Titanium (2%).  Best of all, this rubs in very nicely.  At first, you look like you just put on clown makeup, but with a bit of effort, it rubs in and is invisible.  It also doesn&#x27;t come off very easily, which is great for sports like cycling.</li>
            <li> good product, thank you</li>
            <li> like the mineral nature of this product. means i can slather all over my face, and don&#x27;t have to be cautious around the sensitive eye area at all. it is emollient, so that part is true. just doesn&#x27;t absorb in so well, and leaves a white cast to my face, and quite shiny.</li>
            <li> I like that its &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; as in it doesn&#x27;t have toxic or harmful ingredients but its not very safe from the sun, because my ass got burnt. It is not effective as a sunscreen. Sorry, no go. My boyfriend and I both used it, and are sunscreen aficionados and this one is booted off our list.</li>
            <li> We used this all last summer and bought more for this summer.  It went on our kids&#x27; skin smoothly and did not leave behind white streaks. I used it as well and did not find it to difficult to spread. We used it at the beach for two weeks and our kids never got burned.  It is also on the EWG list of recommended sunscreens and one of the cheaper ones at that.  Great product, I&#x27;m glad we have a safe, inexpensive sunscreen for our kids!</li>
            <li> I brought this thinking I could use it  on my face. Big Mistake. I immediately broke out. Alba does make a mineral sunblock for the face with a lower spf 20. I will use this on my body.</li>
            <li> Great seller! We needed a new batch of sunscreen for our RV travels, and this brand is one of the safest! Love the products, &amp; fast shipping!!  Thanx!</li>
            <li> super stuff~ like that it is natural ~ does go on thick but isn&#x27;t sticky or goopey...would buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen based on EWG&#x27;s review.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very emollient as promised, but it&#x27;s very greasy. Leaves your face shiny. I have to blot my face with a tissue before applying makeup, which might reduce it&#x27;s sunblock effectiveness (not sure).&lt;br /&gt;But overall it&#x27;s very smooth and has no smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Good natural product but thicker than I expected so not the best for your face.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and absorbs quickly (less than 5 minutes) so that I am able to put on my sunscreen soon afterword.</li>
            <li> Works great! And it is actually fragrance free! I hate when products say they are but they still have a smell to them. This doesn&#x27;t! And I feel great using it on my babies.</li>
            <li> a good sunblock that was not greasy and did the job, have worn it all day and it blends nicely... recommend this product</li>
            <li> it takes a while to rub this into the skin, but once you do, the white color disappears and it works well. some of the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands i&#x27;ve used leave a white paste and are terrible in the water. this one is great - no problems at all. it&#x27;s the best one i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found for an affordable physical sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel particularly heavy on the skin. I don&#x27;t have the urge to go wash it off, and I can put it on in the morning and get dressed a minute or two later without getting white greasy stuff on my clothes. It&#x27;s my go-to neck, arms, and hands sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Seems OK, but when living in a high sun, high altitude area where you need this every day several times daily, the price is way too high. They should make a larger tube/dispenser/whatever with a somewhat lower unit cost.</li>
            <li> Great protection that holds up even through water and sweat, but it&#x27;s difficult to rub in and to reapply if you&#x27;ve gotten sandy at the beach. It can also be difficulty completely remove, but I&#x27;m happy to use it when I&#x27;ll be in the water for several hours.</li>
            <li> It works well but be aware you will need to really rub it in because it is a thick mineral sunblock.</li>
            <li> This Alba Sunblock isn&#x27;t awful but it&#x27;s too white when I put it on.  Wet skin worsens the problem big time.  The other two I tried this summer were better.  I&#x27;ve reviewed them both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, which is why I reordered it. It can be a bit thick, but it works well against sunburn!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion specifically to use on my face. When using on the face or anywhere on body you have to rub it in really good otherwise there is a white residue left, which is very annoying; especially since I am only outside for 15 minutes then the next 6 hrs I am inside. I might as well put no sunblock on at all. Unfortunately my face seems to get more damaged with bigger broken capillaries as time goes on and the sun makes it worse.  I do like and use Alba sunblocks but I think in the future I will stick specifically to the facial sunblock.</li>
            <li> This was a super effective sunscreen.  We were on a beach vacation and it was our first time out in the sun for the summer, and this sunscreen worked GREAT.  The only however is that it is thick.....kind of like Desitin, so it&#x27;s not really pleasant to put on.</li>
            <li> Scores a 2 on SkinDeep! Goes on well. Not oily, Doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen and great EWG rating.</li>
            <li> We used this sunscreen at Cape Cod and it exceeded my expectations.  It was easy to rub in and did not leave the white coating that some of the zinc oxide sunscreens do.  We used it on both our face and body and no one got burned.  Fairly light consistentcy and no fragrance.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for outings in Northern California, and it went on well, was not sticky, and provided good protection. When I used it in North Carolina at the beach, I had a slightly different experience:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t get burnt, at all (I am very fair skinned)&lt;br /&gt;-Sunscreen stayed on while in the water&lt;br /&gt;-Is ranked higher on EWG sunscreen reviews, so felt at ease as I applied it all over, day after day ([...]&lt;br /&gt;-When applied before hitting the beach, sunscreen went on easily, and absorbed quickly, w/o sticky residue&lt;br /&gt;-Cost was competitive, especially when compared to other mineral based sunscreens (i.e. as compared to Badger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-When I reapplied at the beach, perhaps due to higher humidity?, sunscreen didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly and was a bit more sticky, thus attracting sand. It eventually would absorb.&lt;br /&gt;-Really had to scrub at the end of the day to get off the sunscreen (could be a pro?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, the pros greatly outweigh the cons (for me)</li>
            <li> Nice creamy sunscreen but a little sticky.  It does the job</li>
            <li> Unlike other sunscreens that contain harsh chemicals that I&#x27;m skeptical of, this contains only zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Read more about sunscreens here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say, it goes on THICK and WHITE but it stays on much longer than other sunscreens without need for a re-apply, even at the beach. I didn&#x27;t burn when everyone else did!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has the natural ingredients and physical sunblock I was looking for, but is very thick to apply.  Not sure I would purchase again.  Seems like you need a lot of product to cover the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the healthy alternative to typical suntan lotion but, it&#x27;s still not the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> Better ingredients than a lot of the lotions out there.  Stays put and lasts!  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a convert.  I like this as a healthier version sunscreen.  Absorbs well.  The price is right.  I wish the bottle were bigger.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. It has no smell, is extremely moisturizing, performs well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t make my tattoo appear faded or bluish like many other sunscreens. I will be very sad if this product is ever discontinued!</li>
            <li> No scent, spreads easy, moist, no ghost look.  Works under makeup as well as body.  Nice price too.  A keeper!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, smells good, easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Havent used this product yet, but I really like ingredients. I got this so that I wasnt using my other sunscreen with tons of nasty chemicals in it. Hopefully, it will do the job when summer comes!</li>
            <li> This is a physical sunscreen, not a chemical one.  Therefore it reflects the uv rays, rather than absorbs them and without the harsh chemicals. I have been using physical sunblocks for over 15 years, and in the class reunions, I look 15 years younger than my peers in grade school, high school, university, and grad schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brand of sunblocks, the physical ones, not chemical ones.  The price is unbelievably good.  A great thing like this would cost 30 usd in Japan.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen except don&#x27;t use it on your face/head if you&#x27;re in the water or excessively sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is the only one we&#x27;ve ever had an eye reaction to when it gets in our eyes. I don&#x27;t mean, &amp;#34;Oops! I accidentally got sunscreen in my eye!&amp;#34; Because no kidding, that would hurt.  But if we were in the ocean &amp; water was on our face/heads, the sunscreen got in our eyes, and it HURT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it works great, just not if you&#x27;re in the water. If you&#x27;re going to stay dry, or it&#x27;s a daily sunscreen before going out, go for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out this sunscreen now that I&#x27;ve learned my old sunscreens have terrible ratings according to the EWG. The lotion is a tad thicker than some other sunscreens out there, which I don&#x27;t really mind because I feel like most liquid sunscreens get too runny and you have to catch the liquid before it drips all over your shirt or something. Once you rub it in, the whiteness goes away. So far hasn&#x27;t left that nasty residue layer on my skin that other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past leave.</li>
            <li> Goes on super white, heavy, and greasy.</li>
            <li> I lathered my 10 month old up in the sunscreen about 20 minutes before taking her out to her baby pool.  About 15 minutes after being outside, I noticed her skin looked really pink.  I immediately took her inside and was horrified to see that she was completely burned on her back and arms!  I have never written a review before but I am just so upset!  I sincerely hope that this was a bad bottle or else there are going to be a lot of sunburned people around.</li>
            <li> Absorbs really well - different from zinc products I bought in the past</li>
            <li> Great suntan cream.  Thick but easy to apply and provides excellent sun protection.  We&#x27;re in the middle of a week at the beach and this has provided wonderful protection.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that other products have.</li>
            <li> If you put a little at a time, it goes on clear. Great protection - we did not burn once using this product, even when we waited longer than 2 hrs to reapply. Once applied, it does not leave you greasy at all. I love the product, the only problem is that it is hard to find in stores. Also, I love the fact that it has non-nano zinc and titanium. After years of trying various mineral sunscreens, so far this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought this product this year along with the Mineral sunscreen Kids SPF30 (blue bottle) to see if it was a similar in efficacy but easier to apply. While it goes on easier, it doesn&#x27;t protect as long or as much as the one I just mentioned, probably because the Mineral sunscreen is harder to apply, and therefore stays on longer, especially in the water, in contrast to this one. This one is probably good for sun exposure where you&#x27;re not bathing in water for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is pretty great for a mineral sunblock. I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time, as it&#x27;s thick and difficult to rub in. However, it&#x27;s the best one of the less-expensive mineral brands that I&#x27;ve tried. You definitely need mineral sunblock for snorkeling in reefs, swimming with dolphins, etc. I have very fair and sensitive skin, and it prevented sunburn and didn&#x27;t react negatively to my skin.</li>
            <li> Love all the alba sunscreens.  Been using them for several years now.  They are my go to sunscreens for adults and babies</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy, and every time I try to squirt some out, even if I shake the tube vigorously beforehand, all this watery stuff pours out, before the actual sunscreen comes out. Ugh. I bought this because I wanted some sunscreen that didn&#x27;t have unhealthy ingredients, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen.  It has very good environmental ratings, and it lasts forever.  Unlike some mineral sunscreens, it is not impossible to rub in. In fact, it rubs in quite easily, and when you&#x27;re sunscreening an entire family, that is important.  The price is very reasonable, as well, especially compared to comparably rated products.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I don&#x27;t use sunblock, because I don&#x27;t like the oily feeling on my skin. However, I need one in case I have to expose to sun light for a long time, such as on beach. So I bought this one, since it was cheap and claimed to be natural. It is thick and hard to apply, but it&#x27;s Ok for me.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with really bad dry spots on my cheeks and forhead with a really greasy nose and chin. I typically use a lighter moisturizer but it wasn&#x27;t doing the trick so I ordered this. It takes a bit of time and rubbing to make it blend into the skin, when you first put it on it makes you look like a ghost. For my daily routine  I put this lotion on and then put my foundation over top and it works great. Within 3 days of use it got rid of all of my dry patches without making my greasy spots even greasier. My only complaint is that it does make my skin feel oily when used alone - it never really completely sank into my skin. When used in combo with my foundation it gave me a nice healthy glow, but when I would use it without foundation it made me look pretty shiny, however I should note that it did not cause my skin to break out at all. I usually wash my hands after applying it because it makes them feel weird, it doesn&#x27;t have the texture of a normal lotion. I could see this working great as a sunscreen alternative for your face because it has a good deal of SPF but it has no smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin on your face.</li>
            <li> A little on the thick side but natural/mineral and does its job.</li>
            <li> I bought this because most have an ingredient called avobenzone which will stain clothes when mixed with iron and this one does not. Our well water has iron and the water softener cannot be expected to get 100% of it out. Of those without this ingredient, Consumer Reports rated this the best. I believe I prefer these ingredients over the ones in the more advertised brands anyhow.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and used it at the beach in New Jersey one afternoon this past week. It was very thick and took a little effort to spread, but it went on ok.  After having it on about 4 hours, I took a shower and I didn&#x27;t feel like I got the residue off. In fact, the odor of the product stayed with me pretty strongly for a couple of days even after a couple more showers. (I regularly use unscented soap which wouldn&#x27;t mask it. If you use scented soap, it might go away faster.) It&#x27;s now 2 1/2 days later,  and I still smell a trace of it. It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, I just got tired of it and wanted it to go away faster. The lingering odor makes me wonder if it washed off or it if stays bound to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for sun protection, it seemed to work ok although it is hard to tell as I was only out in the late part of the day and the sun wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> I use this as an on-the-go hand/forearm sunscreen and I like it for this.  It is not too big to store in my purse.  I am able to rub the white into my skin so that there is none of the dreaded &amp;#34;white cast.&amp;#34;  I do not use this on my face because it is too emollient, but I sometimes use this on my toddler&#x27;s face with no dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a daily body moisturizer with sunscreen. Being a redhead, I NEED to wear sunscreen all the time.  I&#x27;ve recently been making an effort to get rid of all the parabens and find natural products.  This sunscreen is VERY heavy and goes on white.  I hoped it would fade (it did) but leave my skin feeling like it has a thick film on it.  I will keep this and use it when we are out walking or qworking int he yard.  But my search for an everyday, just out of the shower moisturizer with sunscreen continues.</li>
            <li> I have to have sunscreen that is all mineral so that it both really blocks out the sun and never stings my eyes. This formulation really fits the bill. It is very emollient like the title of it says so that it spreads on easily. It is quite white but sinks in when spread on evenly and I wait a couple of minutes. It can be used on the face but I tend to only use it n my body because it is so white and use a cosmetic sunblock on my face. Sunscreen is the best protection against skin cancer, wrinkles and brown spots. This is an easy one for me to get in to the habit of using so I keep it ordered!</li>
            <li> knew the product. all good</li>
            <li> I could not find this mineral sunscreen in Maui. It is an excellent sunscreen for rosacea since it has no harsh chemicals It is fragrance free so there are no irritating scent triggers. The price was good, it was shipped quickly and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This product was not at all what I expected. With the words emollient and mineral I thought it would be find to use on face. It is WHITE creme like lifeguards wear that does NOT blend in easily. The cream itself is very runny - and the spf - tho it says 30 - is NOT very effective!</li>
            <li> Used it a few times. It saves my skin from the harsh sun. But I have felt that every time after using it, it leaves a few dry patches on my skin. As I do not step out so often, I do not mind the patches as they go easily in two days. But for someone who would want to use it daily might want to check the compatibility with skin first.</li>
            <li> This product meets my needs of being effective and receiving a high rating from EWG.org. Since it&#x27;s mineral-based (instead of chemical) it&#x27;s thick but I dot it on and then rub it in.</li>
            <li> the cream is too difficult to spread</li>
            <li> I spent hours looking on EWG&#x27;s approved sunscreen list and decided on Alba&#x27;s Very Emollient Sunscreen because of the price and high rating. I used to use Episencial but it has fallen off EWG&#x27;s recommended list so I started researching for a new sunscreen. I&#x27;ve also used Kiss My Face SPF 30 sunscreen for the face and neck but I wanted a sunscreen I could use on my entire body without the pricetag of Kiss My Face. I&#x27;m really pleased with this sunscreen and its effectiveness, texture, and the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance-free. When I first received it, I was very weary of it because it looked so thick. The sunscreen actually rubs in VERY easy (easier than most zinc oxide sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, definitely easier than Episencial and Kiss My Face) and I was NOT left looking like a ghost! Their formula is excellent, I was really happy to find a sunscreen that blended into my skin so nicely without having to put much effort into rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took Alba on a trip to Hawaii and my husband and I used 90% of the 4 oz. bottle over 10 days - this was putting it on our entire bodies 2-3x/day! We both only burned once - due to only putting it on once in the morning while we were out swimming our first day (our fault!). I love this stuff, I hope this will remain on EWG&#x27;s approved list for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried several varieties of Alba and haven&#x27;t found one yet that I like.  This one is too thick.  It does not spread.  I am about to give up on them.</li>
            <li> First of all, the lotion goes on very thick. It takes a few good rubs to rub it into your skin. However, this is kind of a plus when you are outside because it won&#x27;t turn into watery goo when you go to reapply. I was happy that this sunscreen repelled water so well &amp; was made up of mineral ingredients, however, it did not hold up for this hot California valley sun. Granted I am pregnant and need a little more protection, I was adamant about reapply every 80 mins after swimming, however, I still got slightly burnt and I broke out in a heat rash. So to say the least, this sunblock did not do the job.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and heavy on the skin, hence the very emollient I guess. Definitely can&#x27;t put on the face way too oily. Just to greasy feeling don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product...its very white! very thick and sticky! very hard to rub in...well, actually it doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;rub in&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It IS fragrance free though....one good thing about the product. My purchase will probably sit on the shelf unused...then expire..then get tossed. Money wasted....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, but seems to protect well!</li>
            <li> This is nice, but still really thick. I have to double check in the mirror to make sure I don&#x27;t have white smears all over my face. Wish I could find something that was thinner. Also I feel like it&#x27;s really heavy. When I am out in the sun, it literally feels like this is melting off my body. I feel sticky and gross by the time I get home. Guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain though, it&#x27;s great sun protection and that&#x27;s the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my 14 mo on toddler effectively for whole summer. Very easy to apply. Does not leave white marks, no annoying odor, and protects very well. He had it in his eyes a few times, but he didn&#x27;t show any discomfort.</li>
            <li> it looks pretty wait on my middle tone skin, I feel it greasy too. It is pretty thick and does not glide nice.&lt;br /&gt;I m 35 years old and have normal-combo skin with rosacea in first stage. This cream does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I adore this all-natural sunblock because it uses sunBLOCKERs (like zinc oxide), instead of sunSCREENS (like oxybenzone). I also LOOOOOVE the lack of fragrance. It is indeed super-emoillent, which also makes it semi-waterproof. I have never been burnt once wearing this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in case anyone was wondering, I have normal to oily skin, and this product, while quite oily, has NEVER made me break out. Quite the opposite in fact. Probably due to the fantastic organic ingredients!</li>
            <li> It is not easy to apply because of the weird consistency.  It did work though in the Hawaiian sun.  Not as messy as California Baby or Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> As a mineral based sunscreen, this is very nice. It spreads well and is not too greasy. We have found it provides nice protection.&lt;br /&gt;I originally found this sunscreen from another review as this is a cheaper (cost per oince) natural sunscreen and receives a low EWG rating.&lt;br /&gt;we will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The formula is really thick, and somewhat difficult to spread. This likely results in a thicker layer of sunscreen on skin, which starts to come off when wet.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s frangance free but is it just me or this stuff is soo thick you can&#x27;t even rub it on. I love this brand but not a huge fan of this particular sunscreen</li>
            <li> I love it but only wish my local stores would stocked it!</li>
            <li> This rich cream keeps my skin very hydrated in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love Alba products.  I use their body lotion and this for when I need some sunscreen.  It works just fine.  I&#x27;m fair skinned with a pink tone and don&#x27;t get color when I use this.  I try not to use sunscreen all the time though as I&#x27;m a bit deficient on vitamin D!</li>
            <li> i recommend this to anyone wanting only natural things on their body to help with burning with the sun. i love this</li>
            <li> I bought this today ... was so excited but it&#x27;s going back as one reviewer pointed out it contains palm oil. With all the options out there today the tons upon tons of choices I won&#x27;t contribute to the loss of precious economy systems and species to save a couple of bucks. It&#x27;s going back. Very disappointing Alba.</li>
            <li> Every major brand of sunscreen causes rashes for me, so I have been thrilled with Alba sunscreen products.  I have used most of the sunscreens in their line and have loved them all.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I took this sunscreen with me to Italy (cities and beaches) and it was fabulous.  My very fair skin did not burn once with this product. It is thick and requires quite of bit of rubbing in but it really feels like it gets into my skin and does not leave a film or sticky residue like other products. It is very water and sweat resistant (it says 80 or 90 minutes but I let it go a little longer with no issues).  My only complaint is the thick film left on my hands after application, but I simply wiped it off on a towel.  Overall a great product and one of the most affordable natural sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, hard to rub in, but no sunburns!</li>
            <li> I couldnt stand the smell of this- I bought it for my face and just couldnt stand the odor.  Maybe from the zinc in it?  It says unscented but there IS a scent so I wouldnt recommend putting it on your face unless you don&#x27;t mind the strange smell.</li>
            <li> I chose this one from the ewg website because of its relatively low rating, plus its SUPER CHEAP compared to the others.  Its 1.40$ an ounce, when the others are more like 5$-10$ or more an ounce.  It works amazing, I havent burned once and my skin is pretty fair.  Im in the sun every afternoon and allday on the weekends during summer and barely need to reapply even after getting in and out of the water.  My only complaint is that its thicker than Im used to.  But it WONT leave you white, so Ive heard of worse out there!  I only use this on my body and I use supergoop! AM moisturizer 35 spf on my face (which I LOVE except for its price - 9.30$ an ounce).  Even though I have dry skin, Im prone to breaking out from thick products and Im not going to risk it!  This product is the best for the price and effectiveness!!!</li>
            <li> Aweful texture and odor. Don&#x27;t fall for this - it is aweful to apply and smells really badly. Don&#x27;t know if it works because I can&#x27;t stand to wear it.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent coverage, seems to stay effective well past the recommended 2-4 hour time limit.&lt;br /&gt;+Nearly completely mineral based, for those who care&lt;br /&gt;+PA+++, as rated by MA working document. This is a HUGE plus, as most sunscreens with this rating are easily $50 (*cough*Shiseido)&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent for body coverage, although it will make your skin a tad shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;+Not exactly matte. Leaves my face shiny if I apply more than a 1/4 teaspoon to my face&lt;br /&gt;+White cast effect until absorption. Some don&#x27;t mind though&lt;br /&gt;+Definitely will turn your facial hair (guys) grey/white if you get it on it. Getting it out can be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNDECIDED:&lt;br /&gt;+As thick as Greek yogurt. . .</li>
            <li> We have extremely fair skin. This has been a great sunscreen for us. I have always used 50 for fear of little people getting burned so was a little hesitant about it &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; being 30 spf.  After a lot of research on another website for chemical safety with beauty products I came across this. It appears to be one of the safest sunscreens chemical-wise. Although I have not yet tested it at the beach it is very difficult to wash from my hands after putting it on little people - so I can only assume it will stay on very well for water play. It is nearly completely unscented - immediately after applying it you can barely smell something (not chemically and not obnoxious - but just a light non-perfumy smell) but then the smell dissipates very quickly (we are very scent sensitive). After it being on for maybe 10 minutes you can&#x27;t smell it anymore. It doesn&#x27;t appear (so far at least) to stain clothing. It goes on very creamy and smooth and soaks into the skin well. So far so good - very pleased with the product and just ordered two more bottles through Amazon. I wish they did have a giant pump size - maybe they do and I just haven&#x27;t found it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Updated 6/7/15: ****Follow up post: I really don&#x27;t understand why people are complaining about the texture and thickness of the sunscreen. It may be slightly thicker than normal sunscreens but not by much. We&#x27;ve been using this for two years now and have gone through maybe 15-20 bottles and that&#x27;s in the Seattle area, not in a high heat/sun area. Regarding size - I have contacted the company and they do NOT offer a larger size. Although I have found they make this in a clear spray now - although have not yet checked the chemical safety on the web. Have used this for the last couple years and many times at the beach since my review and it&#x27;s an amazing sunscreen. Our &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; sunscreen now - and we go through a ton of it. No burns when using this even on very fair and sensitive skin. Really great product. Still wish they made a much larger size - would be willing to pay for a large pump size. Amazon has the best price and availability for this sunscreen by far - difficult to find in stores and when you do it&#x27;s much more expensive.Still wish they made a much larger size - would be willing to pay for a large pump size.

            <li> Purchased this as a second choice because Thinkbaby/Thinksport sunscreen went out of stock and I needed sunscreen for a vacation asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned about this and other mineral sunscreens, I was expecting this sunscreen to possibly leave a white cast on my skin. No such thing happened, even after taking a dip in the water :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture was nice, not hard to rub in. In fact, I felt that it was pretty much just as easy as rubbing in your typical chemical-based sunscreen. Rubbed nicely into my face and makeup went on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell was pleasant and very faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked! And I could tell that it was still on my skin doing its magic after getting into the pool because the water was beading on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I would prefer to use Thinkbaby/Thinksport because their ingredients yield the best possible safety rating on the EWG website, this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Since I am trying to find everything as natural and healthy as possible out there, I decided to spend a little more to get a much safer sunscreen to use.  This is a very effective natural sunscreen, but you do still have to reapply every two hours or so to make sure you are fully protected. I am happy with the way it goes on, not as oily and sticky as some of the others, so I highly recommend that you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Best natural sunscreen for the price. Much cheaper than whole foods has it.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff on a trip up into the mountains on a sunny California day when it was 100 degrees and I was up there from morning til dusk, often in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kept me from getting burned and I really re-apply it on as often as I would have thought I should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a bit thick and sticky but not as bad as some others and the fact the ingredients are less chemical-y than most is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Stuff never blends in making you look like a zombie</li>
            <li> This is a review for the green bottle. The yellow bottle has VERY different ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this sunscreen. I find that using a couple of drops of facial oil first about ten minutes or so before applying this really helps with the white cast. (I use a homemade mixture of jojoba, macadamia nut oil, and evening primrose in equal portions). I have never burned using this, and it does not cause me to break out (nearly everything causes me to break out or get a rash, so this is wonderful). I recently found this at a supermarket for six bucks, so I recently stocked up there. (K r o g e r). This has no artificial or natural added scents, and doesn&#x27;t smell like plastic or sunscreen. It is also very moisturizing for me, but I have oily/normal combo skin, if you have dry skin you might need more than this. I do not wear make up, so I don&#x27;t know how this performs under foundation, etc.</li>
            <li> Great price, smells great, right level of thickness.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick, not thin and drippy, for coverage that should last a few hours. One slight negative: the opening in the tube needs to be made bigger so it takes less pressure to squeeze out the cream. As it is now, it provides a muscle-building exercise for my right hand.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because of &amp;#34;misleading&amp;#34; advertising. They&#x27;re trying to show themselves as an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; compound by listing only the inactive ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients are Zinc Oxide (14.5 %), Titanium Dioxide (2.0 %). So bad on that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly the same ingredients as man other cheaper sunscreens, like Coppertone Baby (NICE AND EASY - this part is important, the regular baby one has carcinogenic ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically after spending a week looking through ingredients and doing research I&#x27;ve found there is VERY LITTLE difference between different brands, it&#x27;s ALL about the ingredients and brand go OUT of their way to CONFUSE people. E.g. Coppertone water babies is carcinogenic, where as coppertone babies nice and easy is EXACTLY the same active ingredients as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just look at this website http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27; lists out ALL the safe and carcinogenic ingredients in sunscreens. The just go and check the ingredients on the bottle at your local store or online. Look at the active ingredients and as long as they are maked safe by EWG go and buy it. Don&#x27;t waste money these fancy brands. There is no added value.&lt;br /&gt;I paid less than seven bucks for this and now I see within a week they&#x27;re charging almost 10. You can buy coppertone babies nice and easy (don&#x27;t forget the nice and easy part) for half the price.</li>
            <li> I use this as my facial lotion in southern California where I need sunscreen every day. When I remember to use it consistently, my skin stays clear of acne and I don&#x27;t get more freckles. What more could I ask for in a sunscreen?</li>
            <li> This product ranks high on the environmental scale with no nasty chemicals and it works well. It is thick but spreads easily and absorbs rapidly.</li>
            <li> I love knowing that i am using chemical free sunscreen. This one is nice though very thick. We brought 4 of these tubes for a 9 day beach vacation for a family of three and used them ALL. Since it&#x27;s so thick it doesn&#x27;t smear well and we ended up using more than planned. I am so glad i brought a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The environmental working group gave this product a rating of 2/8 with 0 being the best and 8 being the worst. For the price it is the healthiest option. This sunblock is very similar to the Alba green tea spf. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, feels light and fades easily like body butter. Only con is it starts to feel dry after awhile. I love that this doesn&#x27;t expire until 2015. Personally I like the green tea formula more, but that is rated 6/8.&lt;br /&gt;I do have a problem with the shipment container though, but didn&#x27;t rate the product based on that. This item arrived in the thin box normally reserved for Amazon books. Its nice to see Amazon using smaller packages, but for an item like this the book box doesn&#x27;t work because its to thin. They need to use a small traditional box, place a sticker on the cap and wrap the tube in a layer of bubble wrap.If they can do that in a book box even better. I&#x27;ve been ordering stuff online for years and have never seen such awful packaging or had product arrive leaking. The sunscreen was in a plastic bag which offered NO protection. The product had been squeezed and the cap was open about 5 days worth of sunblock was stuck inside the lid and inside the bag. There goes the extra pennies I saved doing subscribe and save. If my next shipment arrives like this I&#x27;m going to just buy this product from another site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered the sunscreen a few times since and haven&#x27;t had any issues with the packaging. It&#x27;s still a great product and much cheaper online than in stores.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;Chemical free&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;Protects&lt;br /&gt;what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I love all alba sunscreen and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Greasy enough to stay all day and by some accounts much safer than other brands and formulations. Effective, economical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is fine but be prepared to work on smoothing it into the skin because it leaves a white film.  I don&#x27;t mind it but others might.  However meanwhile Trader Joe&#x27;s sells a similar one so I will buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I applied this once before spending the day (very hot, very sun) at a theme park. No burns, no tan. Good job Alba Botanica!</li>
            <li> Very hard to apply. It was real thick and it took alot of effort to sooth it into your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Although it does take a bit of rubbing in so you don&#x27;t see the white, its much better then every other product I tried that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Great safe sunscreen. Very happy with it. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky when it&#x27;s on. I recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> The consistency of this sunscreen is great. It wasn&#x27;t too thick or too thin and stayed on for longer than I expected. My friend who easily gets irritated from most sunscreens said this one really worked well for her.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get any sunburns in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist reccomended a mineral sunblock, and the Environmental Working Group reccomended this sunblock as one of the safest. I love all Alba products, and this one doesn&#x27;t dissapoint. It goes on well, not too sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave you white and chalky like some others do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a great experience so far using the Alba Botanica mineral sunblock SPF 30.  I admit it is very thick, but it is also very effective at keeping you from getting burned by the sun.  I use it primarily on my body - arms, shoulders, back, legs, feet, etc.  Because of its thick, heavy consistency, I don&#x27;t recommend using this sunblock on your face.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again - it&#x27;s natural, effective, and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. To the people who are complaining about the smell or difficulty rubbing it in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there is a smell but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and it&#x27;s mostly pretty mild. I guess for some it could pose a problem. I would argue it&#x27;s better than the scented ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for having difficulties rubbing it in, you&#x27;re putting way too much on. A small dab is enough to do most of the face. Don&#x27;t put it on thick like other sun screen. There is a reason it comes in a small bottle. It&#x27;s not meant to be used in gigantic quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in the wind industry outside in the sun for 12 hours a day and one application keeps me from burning my face. It can be rubbed in if you don&#x27;t put a ton on. When I saw dab, put a dot about half the size of a penny and rub it into your forehead. The take another dab and do each cheek.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail sunscreen, and I use it for the face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry, very sensitive skin, and it is SO hard to find a product that is 1) moisturizing 2) protecting and 3) fragrance free.  This is a top-rated product by skincare experts, and contains no ingredients that will harm or irritate the skin.  It also protects the skin from the full UVA/UVB range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also only contains mineral sunscreen ingredients (zinc and titanium dioxide)--no synthetic sunscreens.  There is some debate about whether oxybenzone and other synthetic ingredients can absorb into the bloodstream and mimic estrogen, causing all sorts of health issues in women. While the jury is still out, I figure better safe than sorry.  Since I&#x27;ve had a history of hormonal imbalances, I&#x27;ve been avoiding synthetic sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some mineral sunscreens will cause a whitish cast to the skin, but this absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause a noticeable cast--at least on my skin, but I am very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is both affordable, and meets all of my criteria above.  I hope they never stop making this product, because it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> very hard to rub in and water come out from it or some kinda liquid. Its also very greasy, when I put this on my face it feels like and looks like i am wearing a white mask.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for Burning Man and it was great! EWG gave it a good rating, and I liked that it was full spectrum via physical blockers (zinc and titanium). It was fairly thick and did give me a slightly purplish look for 10-20 minutes because of the white paste contrasted to my tan skin, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter when you&#x27;re in a desert under the blaring sun and getting dusty anyway. I applied it twice a day for the first three days. Some combination of the tan I got and the dust I was covered in seemed to protect me after that, so I only applied it in the morning after I wiped down with camp wipes. I can&#x27;t say what it looks like on your face, as I used Blue Lizard Face for that, but Blue Lizard seemed to leave my face even more oddly tinted than the Alba did on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased 3 tubes for the week, but ended up only using up one. I wore pants and a tank top, so I only needed it for my neck, arms, hands, and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Thick, so harder to rub in, but it lasted all day long. Did not sweat off.</li>
            <li> Leaves you white when you apply it</li>
            <li> I got this sunscreen based on price for ounce and ingredients,but actually I like the product its self I&#x27;m fair skinned so It didn&#x27;t leave a white cast on me,and its not greasy or sticky feeling doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.overall for the price and how well it works I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Kept us from getting burned in the sun in Florida. Love that it is a much healthier choice. Only a 1 on the skindeep app, which is really good.</li>
            <li> Alba products are top notch. However, unlike another alba sunscreen I tried, this one goes on a bit thick and white. Not greasy, ever, but thick.</li>
            <li> I started using this product today. Compared to previous all-mineral sunblocks I&#x27;ve used, this went on smooth &amp; light. It does feel very water resistant. It lightened my skin considerably at first, but quickly settled in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but thick.  I have 3 children and we mostly use this on our faces/necks during sports seasons and during the winter.  It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Works good. It may look a little white on your skin, but it goes away.  I like the non-toxic rating ewg.org.</li>
            <li> This is super emollient so keep it in mind.  I can&#x27;t use it on my face or hands, it&#x27;s just too greasy.  It&#x27;s good to use on places where you may have dry skin (I use it on my legs only) and for that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> As with many other reviewers, I bought this sunblock based on the rating of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s (EWG) Skin Deep reviews.  It was the best option that wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has proven effective under tough circumstance (long, sweaty runs and swimming in the pool).  It does, however, go on white and is fairly thick.  Also, be wary - the price has jumped from $1.40 per oz to $2.00 per oz since the good press.  I don&#x27;t fault them, just thought I&#x27;d mention it - it&#x27;s no longer the great deal it was when it was first announced.</li>
            <li> I had been trying out the sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of best rated sunscreens and this one is hands down my favorite! It goes on nicely, not too thick or oily or sticky. It goes on well, no chalky white streaks, it feels nice throughout the day, and it smells nice. It does separate in the heat, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a natural sunscreen and if you just massage the tube a little bit it mixes quickly and thoroughly. I keep this one in my purse with me for everyday use and I&#x27;ve also used it for days out in the yard or at the park or the beach. I highly recommend this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I like to use Alba sunscreen because it&#x27;s the least expensive natural sunblock out there. While it may seem like you&#x27;re paying a lot for a little, a little goes a long way! It is difficult to find in stores I shop out however, and Amazon can typically get a better price, even with shipping.</li>
            <li> I use this on bike rides that sometimes will last through all the daylight hours.  This type of mineral sunblock does not degrade after 4 hours like non-mineral sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it has both Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide means that it has a wider protective spectrum than sunscreens that only use one or the other. What this means is that this gives optimum protection for sunburn and skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated it has no added fragrance, but does have a pleasant smell from the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest formulation as of Sept 2016 is much less thick than previously. Still, it can make you look white if you don&#x27;t spread it enough.  I rub it in till the white just disappears.  This is more difficult on hairy arms, and requires some patience.  As other reviewers note, this product is harder to apply than more convenient formulations.  However it&#x27;s worth it for me to have the advantage of the excellent protection this product offers. You can wet your arms to make this easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the extent that sunburn and melanoma are optional, I choose to opt out.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit May 2016.&lt;br /&gt;The formulation has changed so that this sunscreen is very creamy and easy to apply.  That should counter the complaints about this being hard to apply.  Still seems to work just as well.  A problem with the newer thinner formulation is that they did not change the container and the hole at the top is too large for this thinner formulation, and the sunscreen comes out in large quantity if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit May 2017&lt;br /&gt;Downgrading from 5 stars to 4&lt;br /&gt;This is still the best sunscreen I know of.  The problem is the packaging.  With this new style plastic squeeze tube the final portion of stuff is very difficult to coax from the tube, It takes squeezing really hard ans/or prying off the lid with a screwdriver.  If you don&#x27;t go to some annoying means to eke out the last portion then you end up throwing away some product.  In the case of this product you throw away maybe a dollar&#x27;s worth of sunscreen.n&#x27;t go to some annoying means to eke out the last portion then you end up throwing away some product.

            <li> its a mineral sunblock so it has the general problems that most mineral sunblocks have  .its hard to wash off by the normal cleanser.you have to get a makeup removal .other than that ,its not hard to apply and It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film looking after rubs in .</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this product is natural and I&#x27;m not introducing millions of toxins into my skin. However, it&#x27;s insanely thick and just refuses to absorb into my skin, leaving me with a ghostly appearance for the rest of the day. The smell is pretty nondescript; I think it&#x27;s meant to be fragrance-free, which usually just means that it smells like whatever goes into it. It also takes a bit of effort to remove it when showering. I don&#x27;t burn when I use it, though, and that&#x27;s the name of the game. I haven&#x27;t yet found a &#x27;natural&#x27; sunscreen that I totally love, so the hunt continues...</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is totally effective.  It kept us from getting sunburned when we spent a month in Istanbul during the summer, and it also made our skin look more clean and youthful.  Sure, it&#x27;s thick at first, but you&#x27;ll be happy for the thickness after trying something thin and liquidy like the Alba SPF 40 Sport (blue bottle).</li>
            <li> I was considering purchasing this product but it containts palm oil.&lt;br /&gt;I dont think killing orangutans by burning them alive in order to get palm oil seeds is a very sustainable and \\&quot;cruelty free \\&quot; choice.</li>
            <li> A little Thick for my liking, but better than most out there.</li>
            <li> I have only two colors: white and pink. With very sun-sensitive skin, I need a sunscreen that works --- to have one that not only protects but also doesn&#x27;t leave me pasty or require skin-sinking chemicals is such a delight. I&#x27;ve been very happy using Alba.</li>
            <li> Ok....I have been looking for a non-chemical sunscreen for awhile because my neck gets very irritated....my face does ok but neck can&#x27;t handle  what goes on my face. So, I surfed Paula Begoun&#x27;s reviewes and she says this one is excellent sunscreen. So I figured I would try it.  I love it. Not only it doesn&#x27;t take long to rub it, it doesn&#x27;t make you look pasty as many others I have tried!!!! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck at all! I live in Florida and use sunscreen every day. I love this sunscreen.  It may not work for everyone but this one is the first one I have tried in years that is non-chemical and doesn&#x27;t make you pale as a ghost.</li>
            <li> After watching a video review on this product, I was already pretty confident in the product. For the past few years I&#x27;ve used Coppertone Sport and if I wasn&#x27;t consistent with reapplying I could always count on getting a sunburn. Once I received the sunblock I blotted some on the back of my hand. I have eczema so I wanted to make sure it didn&#x27;t cause a reaction. No fragrance - check. No weird reaction - check. Time for the real test! I spent a day in Florida&#x27;s summer heat looking for a car... black pavement, beaming direct sun, etc. The lotion was really thick and a little difficult to rub in (which could be due to sitting in a hot warehouse before I purchased it, who knows). Once I applied to all exposed areas I felt like I was wearing a sweater. It was that thick. Good news, it pretty much acted as a sweater. No burn, not even a hint of pink skin after spending several hours in the sun without reapplying. The one area I did not apply, the back of my neck, however, was burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Application feels greasy :) I will not buy the Very Emollient again, but I will stick with the Alba Botania because of a great formulation.  Good for skin sensitive to chemical sunscreen agents  because it is titanium/zinc oxide based.  As with all titanium/zinc oxide sunscreens, it goes on white and can give you a white cast if you apply too much.  This is not particular to this product (Abla Botanica) but to almost all sunblocks that use titanium/zinc oxides, so its nothing new...anyway, I like this formula.  No fragrances, no irritants and a fair price.  Its a winner in the sunblock department.</li>
            <li> Long history of too much sun exposure. Summers I swim laps and bike a lot outdoors.  This stuff works, is moisturizing, and easy to know where you applied it.  Extra great on roof of head--balding here, nose  and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews trying to find a sunblock that was \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;. I normally wear a high SPF, since I am very fair. I tend to wear those that are fragrance free, so I liked that about this product. However, you can not rub this in! I thought I was going to rub off my skin! I asked my husband to put some on my back, and he complained the whole time! Do not get this product - you will regret it, as do I.</li>
            <li> According to Environmental Working Group, this is one of the few sun screens that doesn&#x27;t contribute to harming our coastal reef life. It&#x27;s expensive but so are all the other brands that don&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients. It absorbs into your skin nicely and isn&#x27;t pasty.</li>
            <li> We were in Mexico and it really didn&#x27;t hold up well for the sun down there in April.  We all still got sun-burnt.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is very effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen.  It&#x27;s rather thick but you can spread it around and that takes more effort than a lighter weight sunscreen or a spray sunscreen.  However, it stays on and provides good protection for hours.  I put it on in the morning and it does the job all day long as I go about my outdoor activities.  It is very resistant to the water, too. I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very thick, but goes on smoothly for even coverage. I really like that it is unscented, reasonably priced and will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I appreciate it&#x27;s natural ingredient list, but this Alba sunblock was very hard to spread, making it not very useful as a sunblock. I could never be sure I&#x27;d really gotten complete coverage.</li>
            <li> I use Alba products frequently. This product is fragrance free as advertised. THe sunblock worked for me when I used it, and keeps my skin moist and from drying out.</li>
            <li> This gets 4 stars because it takes a little rubbing to get all the white to go away. But this is great and I really like it. There is no smell which is a huge plus and very easy on the skin for little ones.</li>
            <li> Very thick but nice and rated as one of the safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Worked well and it was nice to know that the sun screen I was using didn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but does take a bit of time to rub in.</li>
            <li> All natural sunscreen without the chemicals that are found in other sunscreens.  Love it!  Our whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I have used sunscreen on my face for over 20 years. Most were spf 15 and availability was sporadic. While looking for a body lotion with an sunscreen I came across this sunscreen. Although it does not say it is specifically for the face, I purchased it for that use. It is a very thick cream and I was concerned at first that it would feel greasy but that was not the case. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. In addition it has improved my skin. It looks and feels so much smoother and I have actually received complements about how great my skin looks. I have added this sunscreen to my subscribe and save deliveries.</li>
            <li> I prefer the spray on sunblocks. Pros: Mineral, and fits government recommendations.  Cons: makes your face a greasy mess. No thank you</li>
            <li> Ordered the &amp;#34;mineral&amp;#34; version and they shipped me the &amp;#34;natural chemical&amp;#34; version; Tried the chemical one, and it is like smeaing oil on my face! After have put it on my face, oil is all over my hand, and my face is like an oil slick... immediately used 3 oil blotting sheet and 2 hours later used another 3... dry skin, maybe; oily skin, don&#x27;t even bother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side-note, Amazon did refund me in full for the wrong product without me returning it. Way to go!</li>
            <li> The first day I used this in 70-80+ degree weather with bright sun I came back browner just like I used no sunblock at all. And today the 2nd day of a really bright hot day I&#x27;m even more darker, really dark, just like I didnt use any sunblock again. And I put on A LOT. Since it didnt work the first time I used it. And that&#x27;s just from riding inside a car with tinted back windows most of the day. It&#x27;s not working at all. Plus it goes on so thick and pastey white that I have to wipe my arms off some first and then try and get it off my palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im now looking for non natural sunscreen or atleast a stronger higher SPF. 50-80+ SPF</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. I am sure high percentage of zinc oxide provides great protection from burning and photo aging.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin so I have no problems with white cast. Only complaint is smell and some greasiness but I still will purchase&lt;br /&gt;this again because of natural ingredients that wont harm my health and environment.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to rub it in so you&#x27;re not completely white, but will rub in! Feels great once it&#x27;s on. Not sticky.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very thick, it is hard to rub in and stays white on your skin when you get in the water. On the plus side it doesn&#x27;t have the usual sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white film on your face making you look like a vampire 👎🏻 Back to searching for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  After my 20 year old son had a reaction to &amp;#34;Chemical laden sunscreens&amp;#34;, we looked for a product that was safe and still effective.  THIS IS IT!  No reaction, goes on easily without feeling oily, no perfume smells, and worked great at the pool on a sunny afternoon for 3 hours!  Our whole family is now using this and won&#x27;t go back to the store bought sunscreens.  Wish I had found this years ago when my son first starting having mild reactions!</li>
            <li> The best tube zinc sunscreen we have found (and we have tried a LOT).  It spreads on easily and is quite smooth.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on the skin like some zinc sunscreens.  This is our new favorite (and the price is so much better than many of the other mineral options).</li>
            <li> Healthy and works great... you just need a little so bottle lasts</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it due to white cast and my tan skin. Gave it to a friend, works for her lighter complexion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful mineral option. Loved it on our Jamaica trip.</li>
            <li> This is an effective sunscreen, but the consistency is terrible. It&#x27;s incredibly thick so you have to use quite a bit to get coverage and it takes a long time to absorb into skin. I appreciate that it&#x27;s non-toxic and environmentally friendly, but so are lots of other brands. I&#x27;m going back to my DeVita Solar Protective Moisturizer, which is just as effective but much smoother and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and hated it. I prefer terrasport over this product. It was thick and hard to apply and I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I only used this sunscreen on my face and neck, because the other one that I brought irritated my skin. It absorbed well, felt nice, and did what it was supposed to do - protected my skin. It also didn&#x27;t irritate or itch. I would have used it on my whole body, but it&#x27;s such a small tube..</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, it&#x27;s like trying to apply spackle. It&#x27;s the thickest sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
