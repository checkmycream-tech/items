            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>I heard that this was a great dupe for MAC&#x27;S Gold Deposit.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t go to Mac and spend $32</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This gives a very nice glow.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I thought it would be,  </li>
            <li>Just as good as Mac Gold Deposit.</li>
            <li>When I swatched it on my hand, it appeared lighter than I had hoped (Bronze Glow shade), and did not show good staying power at all.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>amazing it gives me a nice summer time glow</li>
            <li>I love this so much this was the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>Thats even when applied with a very light hand.</li>
            <li>Good price :) very pigmented like the color pay off really nice bronzy warm color</li>
            <li>The color was perfect, shipping was quick easy, and came exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Love the way it gives ski an afterglow.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order a Mac duo fiber fan brush, and try for better results.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for anyone looking for a like sun kissed look:)</li>
            <li>they love it</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I am sure it will show up better when I have more tanned skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so beautiful on my brownskin and super fast shipping</li>
            <li>I got this bronzer for my Mom, but had a chance to try it before giving to her to compare to the bronzer she liked in a first place, which was Laura Mercier.</li>
            <li>It has a nice finish, but I didn&#x27;t really care for the consistency.</li>
            <li>However, when I applied it on my full face makeup, it clinged well onto my foundation and looked pretty nice for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product and my Mom was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This is great to add to your makeup collection and gives the skin a nice Glow and a little shimmer too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman with a light brown skin tone and for me this bronzer is beautiful...</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>In any case it&#x27;s pretty and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am well pleased with the product for the price.</li>
            <li>An exact dupe for Mac&#x27;s gold deposit</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t apply too much or else you&#x27;ll look like a clown.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I would like it that much, but I wore it to a Halloween party and it just set in and really made me glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, but very pigmented with lots of glitter specs (only downfall), so only a little is needed.</li>
            <li>Was surprised at the vivid color.</li>
            <li>LM bronzer is pretty expensive, so I decided to look for a more affordable substitute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a NC50, and the gold reflex is great in pics, but terrible when you&#x27;re face to face in natural light.</li>

            <li> Picture showed the same exact colors that Laura Mercier had in their baked bronzer, with lots of streaks through the base color, and in person it did not look quite the same, it was more solid color.</li>
            <li> I would only wear this on those days when I wanted to add the WOW factor, not for subtle looks.</li>
            <li> Other brands I&#x27;ve used would have crumbled and become unusable.</li>
            <li> Maybe its me, but this product was NOT worth the raves that it received on YT.</li>

            <li> I love this product! Great color. I even accidentally dropped it on the floor and it did not break apart. Other brands I&#x27;ve used would have crumbled and become unusable. Was surprised at the vivid color. I use this product every day and have not experienced any irritation. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a NC44 in MAC and ordered the Bronze Glow color. It&#x27;s beautiful, but very pigmented with lots of glitter specs (only downfall), so only a little is needed. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it this summer!</li>
            <li> Love the way it gives ski an afterglow.</li>
            <li> I heard that this was a great dupe for MAC&#x27;S Gold Deposit. It has a nice finish, but I didn&#x27;t really care for the consistency. In any case it&#x27;s pretty and it gets the job done.</li>

            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be,  but can gwan still.</li>
            <li> Maybe its me, but this product was NOT worth the raves that it received on YT. It&#x27;s just... okay. I&#x27;m a NC50, and the gold reflex is great in pics, but terrible when you&#x27;re face to face in natural light. Thats even when applied with a very light hand. Be prepared for glitter galore! I&#x27;m going to order a Mac duo fiber fan brush, and try for better results. If not, I&#x27;ll either be giving this away or trashing it.</li>
            <li> amazing it gives me a nice summer time glow</li>
            <li> The color was perfect, shipping was quick easy, and came exactly as described! Would recommend for anyone looking for a like sun kissed look:)</li>
            <li> Good price :) very pigmented like the color pay off really nice bronzy warm color</li>
            <li> Very good product.  My sister&#x27;s came to my house and applied it on,  they love it and I ordered it for both of them.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my chocolate hunnies</li>
            <li> This is great to add to your makeup collection and gives the skin a nice Glow and a little shimmer too! If you want to make your highlighting stand out, add this to your make up kit now!</li>
            <li> Expressing in words what this product means to my life does it no good..! THIS IS A MUST HAVE! If you&#x27;re looking for a MAC GOLD DEPOSIT dupe....this is it!! This gives my face eternal life !</li>
            <li> Love this it&#x27;s so beautiful on my brownskin and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am a lighter skinned African American.  The bronzer was not all that noticeable now, so I think I may need a deeper color for winter time.  I am sure it will show up better when I have more tanned skin.  But overall, I am well pleased with the product for the price.</li>
            <li> Just as good as Mac Gold Deposit. A definite Dupe especially for chocolate complexioned women</li>
            <li> I love this so much this was the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever bought I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t go to Mac and spend $32</li>

            <li> Great product. Very pigmented. Shipping was very fast. Would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. An exact dupe for Mac&#x27;s gold deposit</li>
            <li> This bronzer is like a God send. I didn&#x27;t know if I would like it that much, but I wore it to a Halloween party and it just set in and really made me glow.</li>
