            <li>Love all the colors - varied and I will use most of the colors as they go with everything you wear.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like most of the colors I got.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like a gloss to put on top of another lipstick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was okay</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Although this product is fairly cheap, the quality is better than you might expect.</li>
            <li>They need warmed up a litte to go on easily</li>
            <li>A couple were really good vibrant colors that went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The silver tubes are kind of dry and don&#x27;t feel good on your lips.</li>
            <li>two or so smell terribly cheap and I couldnt wear them with out making discusted faces.</li>
            <li>cheap quality lipstick and listing lied when it said assorted colors.</li>
            <li>The brands are really cheap</li>
            <li>but there cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>It was lumpy, but the others went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>which are so light</li>
            <li>It is smooth and doesn&#x27;t look like funky like Nyx&#x27;s lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how good this lipstick is.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to use them--I ordered a bunch of things from amazon together</li>
            <li>I was mostly satisfied with this purchase; however, I would have liked to have all ten lipsticks usable.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the lipstick had a very off putting smell.</li>
            <li>Very nice, I take them everywhere, and I highly recommend such an inexpensive buy with great, pigmented results that will last me for a while.</li>
            <li>They arived neatly packaged and quickly too.</li>
            <li>They came quickly and there were no duplicates.</li>
            <li>Very pretty  colors.</li>
            <li>But I love them (especially the bright, intense reds and love, love that dark brown and the nude).</li>
            <li>Thanks for quick delivery!</li>
            <li>To be honest, for about a dollar each I didn&#x27;t expect much-I actually bought it for my niece to play with-</li>
            <li>, you can mix them and just have fun.....</li>
            <li>I also have lots of fun experimenting with the pinks too.</li>
            <li>There were three types of packaging, the blue kind you can see in the photo of the product in the description, the white kind in the photo</li>
            <li>and there was all different kind</li>
            <li>Over all I say the deal is for 6 not really 10, so its about 2$ a piece, would rather recommend getting 2 good ones.</li>
            <li>The colors were really nice, especially the reds and pinks.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very long-lasting and includes some very interesting and different colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like 6, there are 2 that are too dark and then 2 more</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth it and the few good sticks I got out of it are used often.</li>
            <li>It was as expected, thanks and keep up the good word...</li>
            <li>There were a lot of colors, which I liked, even though rarely us any but peache and pink shades.</li>
            <li>She said they go on more as a &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; than as a solid color.</li>
            <li>Some have a crayon smell (Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s ok since I&#x27;m a male).</li>
            <li>Pretty colors also, haven&#x27;t tried raven yet, I don&#x27;t have the lady balls yet,</li>
            <li>Generally, when i buy a product, I go for both value and quality so this works best for me because there are several other colors you can choose from</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the positive reviews</li>
            <li>And these are super soft and rub off so well.</li>
            <li>Pinks, nude, gold, reds, very pigmented.</li>
            <li>and I had just received a brush package as well, so I was ready to use my products.    </li>
            <li>but then they brighten your mouth and are very pigmented and stay on well.</li>
            <li>and one was in a very fancy case.</li>
            <li>They match my outfits and what colors look better then pink to the brown ranges??</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and high quality.</li>
            <li>The picture of the product leads the buyer to believe that red is much better represented than it actually is.</li>
            <li>Its ok but the flavour is a little waxie.</li>
            <li>he best smell but not too bad</li>
            <li>I guess I should of expected it for being relatively cheap</li>
            <li>The nice thing though was that I sent a complaint and a return request and they refunded my money and said i didn&#x27;t have to return the items.</li>
            <li>It looks better when applied with a brush, and will last long with a lipstick sealer.</li>
            <li>The other ones were just fine.</li>
            <li>The one star is for shipping the only positive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who would be able to wear black and deep purple lipstick.  </li>
            <li>They were my two least favorite colors anyways.</li>
            <li>You  don&#x27;t really need 5 different glossy reds.</li>
            <li>First of all 5 of the colors are so similar that they might as well be the same.</li>
            <li>There are a couple shades of red, a pink, a neutral red/pink, a couple pale icy colors, a gold, and a black.    :D</li>
            <li>And the colors I got were all dark plums and really light golds and one super bright orange color.. awful.</li>
            <li>It is fun to change color by adding a little brown or a shiny tint.</li>
            <li>They are also of really great quality, aside from the brown which was terrible, but I didn&#x27;t really care about that one as much</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are old and one was actually open.</li>
            <li>I received most of the lipsticks broken.</li>
            <li>but it is black with mirrored lining near the top and a small cap.    </li>
            <li>At least half or more of the tubes are very old.</li>

            <li> At least half or more of the tubes are very old.</li>
            <li> Generally happy with this product lipsticks last about 5 hours long if you apply lip pencil as a base</li>
            <li> MAYBE ONLY 4 WHERE GOOD THE OTHER ONE WHERE BAD AND SMELLED</li>
            <li> I was anxious when I first ordered this things because of other reviews.</li>
            <li> some of them were dry</li>
            <li> The other ones have to be warmed up a little by rubbing on your lip (which is natural)</li>
            <li> they are very poor quality, if you&#x27;re a goth you&#x27;ll love 2 of them, they are black!</li>
            <li> The black lipstick did was the only one that did not meet expectations.</li>
            <li> It is very dry</li>
            <li> Overall it was disappointing because none of the colors were opaque enough to give real color.</li>
            <li> Overall it was just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> When I first received them, I started to feel skeptical because the packaging was simple, and they were slightly dusted in, well, dust.</li>
            <li> You cant go completely wrong here even if your a fussy customer ;)...</li>
            <li> However, if your into labels and pretty packaging go ahead and buy your expensive makeup</li>
            <li> one was a silvery purple and the other was a gold</li>
            <li> well, not only did half of my order melt on arrival but the ones that survived are not very good.</li>
            <li> 2 of the colors are really odd for lips</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are a bit dry and fairly hard to apply.</li>
            <li> They were a gift to my little sister who always takes my lipsticks</li>
            <li> maybe a few hours</li>
            <li> I open it up to find broken, melted with sticks.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to buy her own set, but there so terrible I didn&#x27;t give them to her.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it came out in blobs and not smooth</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for tinting as opposed to coloring, then these little guys are for you!</li>
            <li> very bad quality they all smudged and broke and even made my face breakout quickly</li>
            <li> About half taste like total crap, but</li>
            <li> These compare well with the expensive lipsticks found at cosmetic counters..</li>
            <li> They all smell awful and don&#x27;t even work properly.</li>
            <li> I was ill at the time and didn&#x27;t return .  </li>
            <li> I do not know if they are lipsticks or highlighters, but they cake up the lips, and are uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Very annoyed.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE NOT VERY PLEASED</li>
            <li> It is so ugly and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Dried up ...smells terrible...</li>
            <li> They had a bad smell and taste to them.</li>
            <li> but then some parts of it melts and it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> it was just bad lipstick period</li>
            <li> I will never buy this crazy product again!</li>
            <li> crap ,i brought these and was seriously disappointed</li>
            <li> VERY ugly colors.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t disappointed me yet!</li>
            <li> I bought these and they were awful, four of them were duplicate colors.</li>
            <li> These lips are just terrible!</li>

            <li> I bought these as a gift. At least half or more of the tubes are very old. They had a bad smell and taste to them. The other ones were just fine.</li>
            <li> some were great soem were meh...&lt;br /&gt;not he best smell but not too bad either.&lt;br /&gt;10 for 12 dollars is what you pay and what you get :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how good this lipstick is. To be honest, for about a dollar each I didn&#x27;t expect much-I actually bought it for my niece to play with-but it&#x27;s very long-lasting and includes some very interesting and different colors. I may get it again for myself.</li>
            <li> A couple were really good vibrant colors that went on smoothly. The silver tubes are kind of dry and don&#x27;t feel good on your lips. For the price, it was worth it and the few good sticks I got out of it are used often.</li>
            <li> Good value for its price. Most of these are great. two or so smell terribly cheap and I couldnt wear them with out making discusted faces. They were my two least favorite colors anyways. This product is great if you love reds!! They arived neatly packaged and quickly too.</li>
            <li> Generally happy with this product lipsticks last about 5 hours long if you apply lip pencil as a base maybe a few hours longer,....Generally, when i buy a product, I go for both value and quality so this works best for me because there are several other colors you can choose from, you can mix them and just have fun.....You cant go completely wrong here even if your a fussy customer ;)...However, if your into labels and pretty packaging go ahead and buy your expensive makeup but the quality is here if you want to save the money honey!!!</li>
            <li> Lots of great colors to use. Pinks, nude, gold, reds, very pigmented. They need warmed up a litte to go on easily but once they do excellent. Cant beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I was anxious when I first ordered this things because of other reviews. But I love them (especially the bright, intense reds and love, love that dark brown and the nude). I also have lots of fun experimenting with the pinks too. The colors are rich, smooth, and beautiful. I also like to blend them (when i do my lips in two  different tones). Happy with this product. Will be ordering more soon :)</li>
            <li> I bought these and they were awful, four of them were duplicate colors. They didn&#x27;t go on pigmented and they smelled like play makeup. And the colors I got were all dark plums and really light golds and one super bright orange color.. awful. The nice thing though was that I sent a complaint and a return request and they refunded my money and said i didn&#x27;t have to return the items. Overall it was just a waste of time. I can maybe use ONE of the lightest gold colors as on overlay for another lipstick and the rest will probably just sit in my drawer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the way they smell!</li>
            <li> Though they aren&#x27;t brand names, these lipsticks are amazing. When I first received them, I started to feel skeptical because the packaging was simple, and they were slightly dusted in, well, dust. Then I opened them up and tried them on and I was excited to use them--I ordered a bunch of things from amazon together and I had just received a brush package as well, so I was ready to use my products.    As I have now been using them for a couple weeks, I can safely say that these are amazing. They are very pigmented and high quality. Some of them were shaped like the one in the following picture:  [...]    And these are super soft and rub off so well. The other ones have to be warmed up a little by rubbing on your lip (which is natural) but then they brighten your mouth and are very pigmented and stay on well. There were three types of packaging, the blue kind you can see in the photo of the product in the description, the white kind in the photo and one was in a very fancy case. I can&#x27;t find a photo online and don&#x27;t have it with me but it is black with mirrored lining near the top and a small cap.    Very nice, I take them everywhere, and I highly recommend such an inexpensive buy with great, pigmented results that will last me for a while. There are a couple shades of red, a pink, a neutral red/pink, a couple pale icy colors, a gold, and a black.    :D</li>
            <li> Love the color and looks glamorous, so those people who are looking a good lipstick I will recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It is the wrost product ever! It is very dry but then some parts of it melts and it smells really bad. It is so ugly and difficult to apply. I will never buy this crazy product again! I THREW THEM AWAY THE SAME DAY I BOUGHT THEM. SPEND YOUR MONEY IN SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> cheap quality lipstick and listing lied when it said assorted colors. I got 6 berries and 6 nudes. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I could only use the one truly red color they had.  The picture of the product leads the buyer to believe that red is much better represented than it actually is.</li>
            <li> A GREAT VALUE! I HOPE THAT MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER LOVES IT ON CHRISTMAS MORNING. THE COLORS ARE DELICIOUS!&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY</li>
            <li> very bad quality they all smudged and broke and even made my face breakout quickly, i do not recommend it</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are old and one was actually open. When I put one on the back of my hand to test it.... it was clumpy and oily. Very annoyed. I will not be using any of these...They will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Ick!! SAVE YOUR MONEY !! The one star is for shipping the only positive. I recieved the lipstick promptly,  it arrived in bubble insulated envelope ...so far so good. I open it up to find broken, melted with sticks. They are smelly, sticky and unusable clay like ick...dissapointed</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. These lipsticks are a bit dry and fairly hard to apply. I do not believe they were misrepresented. I do like the color assortment. The seller did a good job.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors - varied and I will use most of the colors as they go with everything you wear.  Thanks for quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I use these lipsticks every day. They match my outfits and what colors look better then pink to the brown ranges??</li>
            <li> some of the lip sticks work but some of them were dry some of the color you see here weren&#x27;t there and couple of hem broke trying to out them on</li>
            <li> nice assortment of lip sticks, nice colors too.  Would order again when I use them all.  Can not beat the price.</li>
            <li> well, not only did half of my order melt on arrival but the ones that survived are not very good. I guess I should of expected it for being relatively cheap but oh well, I just know what not to order next time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like most of the colors I got. I bought this because of the positive reviews but I was misled. The brands are really cheap and I ended up trashing it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got these for my sister for Christmas, and she loved them. She said they go on more as a &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; than as a solid color. So if you&#x27;re looking for tinting as opposed to coloring, then these little guys are for you! They came quickly and there were no duplicates.</li>
            <li> It was as expected, thanks and keep up the good word...</li>
            <li> Out of all these lipstick colors, only one was usable.  VERY ugly colors.  I don&#x27;t know who would be able to wear black and deep purple lipstick.  On top of that, the lipstick had a very off putting smell.</li>
            <li> crap ,i brought these and was seriously disappointed but there cheap so you cant expect to find good quality moisturizing lipstick for this cheap it was just bad lipstick period</li>
            <li> Cheap. Once you apply it and take if off it leaves your lip stained.</li>
            <li> The black lipstick did was the only one that did not meet expectations. It was lumpy, but the others went on smoothly. There were a lot of colors, which I liked, even though rarely us any but peache and pink shades. It is fun to change color by adding a little brown or a shiny tint. These compare well with the expensive lipsticks found at cosmetic counters..</li>
            <li> Lipstick is stick and doesn&#x27;t go on well and there was all different kind would prefer mac lipstick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like 6, there are 2 that are too dark and then 2 more which are so light, it&#x27;s like a gloss to put on top of another lipstick. Some have a crayon smell (Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s ok since I&#x27;m a male). Over all I say the deal is for 6 not really 10, so its about 2$ a piece, would rather recommend getting 2 good ones.</li>
            <li> 3 out of 10 of these lipsticks are useable. they are very poor quality, if you&#x27;re a goth you&#x27;ll love 2 of them, they are black!</li>
            <li> The colors were really nice, especially the reds and pinks.  They are also of really great quality, aside from the brown which was terrible, but I didn&#x27;t really care about that one as much anyways so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> These lips are just terrible! They all smell awful and don&#x27;t even work properly. I received most of the lipsticks broken. They were a gift to my little sister who always takes my lipsticks so I wanted to buy her own set, but there so terrible I didn&#x27;t give them to her. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> About half taste like total crap, but hey, what do you want for that price.  The colors are good.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty  colors. I wear thm all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was okay but it came out in blobs and not smooth so if I were to use this I would have to use my finger.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick. Iv&#x27;e been told It&#x27;s not the best, but hey I&#x27;m not hard to please at all, it does it&#x27;s job.....color my lips. Pretty colors also, haven&#x27;t tried raven yet, I don&#x27;t have the lady balls yet, lol. I recommend thse lipsticks. Luv luv Amazon.com, my online WalleyWorld.  They haven&#x27;t disappointed me yet!</li>
            <li> Dried up ...smells terrible...just threw it away.  I was ill at the time and didn&#x27;t return .  I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I ordered these last week and they got here yesterday. I tried them out as swatches on my arm. First of all 5 of the colors are so similar that they might as well be the same. You  don&#x27;t really need 5 different glossy reds. 2 of the colors are really odd for lips one was a silvery purple and the other was a gold--I would never wear either color in public. Overall it was disappointing because none of the colors were opaque enough to give real color.</li>
            <li> Expedient shipping and I received the product within the same week. However, there are two lipsticks which cannot be used. I do not know if they are lipsticks or highlighters, but they cake up the lips, and are uncomfortable to wear. I was mostly satisfied with this purchase; however, I would have liked to have all ten lipsticks usable. I hope the next time I order a product; I can use the entire product.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PACK BECAUSE IT SAID THAT ALOT OF LIPSTICKS CAME AND OF THE 10 THATS CAME MAYBE ONLY 4 WHERE GOOD THE OTHER ONE WHERE BAD AND SMELLED HORRIBLE NOT VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Although this product is fairly cheap, the quality is better than you might expect. It is smooth and doesn&#x27;t look like funky like Nyx&#x27;s lipsticks. It looks better when applied with a brush, and will last long with a lipstick sealer. (I use artiba lip seal) I am giving it 5 stars because it exceeds my expectations and price. They&#x27;re awesome.</li>
            <li> Its ok but the flavour is a little waxie.</li>
