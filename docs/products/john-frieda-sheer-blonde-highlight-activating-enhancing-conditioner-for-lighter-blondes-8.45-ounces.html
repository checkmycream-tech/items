    <ol>
            <li>I found that it&#x27;s best if you don&#x27;t blow-dry your hair with this conditioner; my guess is that it has a low-evaporation point.  </li>
            <li>Great value, great product, great price!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>When I use this highlight activating conditioner with the highlight activating shampoo, my hair has amazing highlights and body.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I have always liked this product.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice - just smells clean and not too strong.</li>
            <li>my hair is asian black/brown/red, and it&#x27;s incredible color-treated.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who is  fragrance sensitive this is a really great product.</li>
            <li>My hair grows very quickly (between 3/4 and 1 1/4 inches a month, depending on the season).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you have strong hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works just fine on my darker blond hair that is curly and fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner for my dyed blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see that this does anything for my highlights, and I don&#x27;t feel like it is a super conditioner.</li>
            <li>Even when I waited 6 months in-between salon visits, my hair&#x27;s color looked just as fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The effects of the brightening did last over the following week and didn&#x27;t fade again which is ideal since I shouldn&#x27;t have to use this every day for weeks in order to get</li>

            <li>went back to my Pantene Restore Beautiful lengths conditioner &amp; only use the John Frieda shampoo once a week.</li>
            <li>Sure you could get some heat-activated conditioner, but it won&#x27;t give your hair the same highlights and tones.</li>
            <li>love the blonde shampoos&#x27;</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t work for the brand ;) )</li>
            <li>The conditioner was not overly heavy - I think that it did a good job of preventing tangles but could not compensate for how drying the shampoo was to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brand leaves my color treated hair nice and shinny with no dullness like some other products do.</li>
            <li>Most self-appointed beauty experts claim you need a sulfate free shampoo and heavy waxy conditioner all-over if you dye your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using John Frieda conditioner and shampoo for a very long time and love it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, the texture of  your dry or/and died hair just changes in contact with this conditioner, untangling long hair like mine went from unbearable and 10 minutes long, to be almost a pleasure of 1,5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>This product, according to the label, has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it, which is apparently really damaging to your hair.</li>

            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>out\\&quot; as I am getting closer to the next color session - my highlights seem to get a bit dim, for lack of a better term.</li>
            <li>When I go by their advice, my hair has zero body on top because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean, and the rest of my hair looks dull and waxy.  </li>
            <li>I am not too sure if it actually lightens my hair, but it does leave it feeling clean and not weighed down.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Come spring, my natural highlights take over so I really don&#x27;t like to use anything permanent on my hair.</li>
            <li>i have a blondish ombre going on, and it&#x27;s super dry from years of coloring/bleaching.  </li>
            <li>Even though my darkest color would be considered dark blonde, since my lighest highlights are very light blonde, I opted for the product designed for lighter highlights thinking that for me, it&#x27;s ok if my darker highlights became lighter, but not the other way</li>
            <li>The two-pack I received contained one light blonde conditioner and one dark blonde shampoo -- not two light blonde conditioners as advertised.</li>
            <li>the shampoo and the conditioner are light yellow in color, with a bit of pearly white mixed in.</li>
            <li>this shampoo completely stripped my hair.</li>
            <li>used the same amount of shampoo and conditioner that I normally do.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old female who has brown hair that is colored blonde with different color highlights, cut in a bob to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Lather was normal - as expected.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> John Frieda is always my go-to for hair products and this is no different. Great product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I only use this conditioner. My hair is shinier and fuller. I am totally white now and my hair does not look yellowish.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you have strong hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for about a week and began noticing the ends looking fried.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my Pantene Restore Beautiful lengths conditioner &amp; only use the John Frieda shampoo once a week.</li>
            <li> my hair is asian black/brown/red, and it&#x27;s incredible color-treated.  i have a blondish ombre going on, and it&#x27;s super dry from years of coloring/bleaching.  i subscribe and save to this conditioner as well as the color-correcting blonde conditioner from john freida.  it&#x27;s the blue one.  using these two in tandem has kept my hair silvery platinum instead of terrible and brassy.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a while.  I am not too sure if it actually lightens my hair, but it does leave it feeling clean and not weighed down.</li>

            <li> This is by far the best conditioner for my dyed blonde hair.  Without this conditioner, my hair tends to look yellow-bronze if I don&#x27;t constantly fry it at the salon.  Most self-appointed beauty experts claim you need a sulfate free shampoo and heavy waxy conditioner all-over if you dye your hair.  When I go by their advice, my hair has zero body on top because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean, and the rest of my hair looks dull and waxy.  When I use this highlight activating conditioner with the highlight activating shampoo, my hair has amazing highlights and body.  Even when I waited 6 months in-between salon visits, my hair&#x27;s color looked just as fresh.

            <li> I don&#x27;t see that this does anything for my highlights, and I don&#x27;t feel like it is a super conditioner. It does a basic job.</li>
            <li> Works just fine on my darker blond hair that is curly and fine.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female who has brown hair that is colored blonde with different color highlights, cut in a bob to my shoulders. My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it. My hair grows very quickly (between 3/4 and 1 1/4 inches a month, depending on the season). Thus, I need to get my hair colored every 5 weeks in order to manage the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair also starts to \\&quot;fade out\\&quot; as I am getting closer to the next color session - my highlights seem to get a bit dim, for lack of a better term. I read about this product and decided to try it - bought it at my local drug store (Rite Aid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use Matrix Biolage Strengthening shampoo and conditioner every day as part of my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both the Highlight activating shampoo and conditioner and used them together. This comes in two different types - one for lighter blond highlights and the other for darker blonde highlights. Even though my darkest color would be considered dark blonde, since my lighest highlights are very light blonde, I opted for the product designed for lighter highlights thinking that for me, it&#x27;s ok if my darker highlights became lighter, but not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the shampoo and the conditioner are light yellow in color, with a bit of pearly white mixed in. The smell is nice - just smells clean and not too strong. No scent remained on my hair after it was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the same amount of shampoo and conditioner that I normally do. Lather was normal - as expected. My issue is this...this shampoo completely stripped my hair. My hair was so dry and brittle after using this, I was afraid to even comb through it. The conditioner was not overly heavy - I think that it did a good job of preventing tangles but could not compensate for how drying the shampoo was to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was definitely brighter - I could even tell when it was wet after one use! But, even after returning to my regular shampoo, it took a few days for the texture of my hair to return to normal. This product, according to the label, has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it, which is apparently really damaging to your hair. This may explain it? Not sure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects of the brightening did last over the following week and didn&#x27;t fade again which is ideal since I shouldn&#x27;t have to use this every day for weeks in order to get/keep the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I will use this only once a week during the week or two prior to getting my hair colored to help get through that difficult period, but would never consider using this on a more frequent basis due to the excessive stripping that occured.ays for the texture of my hair to return to normal.

            <li> Great value, great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I have naturally sandy blonde hair that gets very dark and dull during the winter. Come spring, my natural highlights take over so I really don&#x27;t like to use anything permanent on my hair. I use this stuff once a day and I have had people ask if I got highlights. It really does work. It&#x27;s enough to get me through the winter and doesn&#x27;t appear to need to grow out.</li>
            <li> love the blonde shampoos&#x27;</li>
            <li> Excellent, the texture of  your dry or/and died hair just changes in contact with this conditioner, untangling long hair like mine went from unbearable and 10 minutes long, to be almost a pleasure of 1,5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#x27;t for John Frieda products I would have cut my long hair long ago, and I&#x27;ve tested hundreds!

            <li> f e e l s f a n t a s t I c a n d s m e l l s g r e a t</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I haven&#x27;t had any highlights at a salon in over 2 years and this conditioner brought out all my &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; highlights... Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using John Frieda conditioner and shampoo for a very long time and love it.  Highly Recommended. Great product.  I have a lot of allergies and the Shampoo and Conditioner doesn&#x27;t affect them the way the other products do.  For anyone who is  fragrance sensitive this is a really great product.</li>
