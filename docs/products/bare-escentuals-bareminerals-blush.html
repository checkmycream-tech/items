            <li>/&gt;highly recommend, nice warm color.</li>
            <li>The ounces stated help but when shopping on the fly it would be nice to have a picture gauge so one could quickly pick out the size we want, as if we are standing in the store and can \\&quot;see\\&quot; the size of the jar.</li>

            <li>Bare Minerals is the best makeup foundation I know</li>

            <li>I feel like I look healthier with it on :)</li>

            <li>Have used many products,  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better bronzer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many bronzes</li>
            <li>so I just put tape over all but 1 hole) and you can choose how many holes you want to access ( 1 -3).</li>
            <li>I love the all over face color in warmth.  </li>
            <li>Great product shipped fast</li>
            <li>from...very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>love this makeup.  </li>

            <li>I use it as a blush and love it</li>
            <li>I love the way this gives our face that sun kissed look.</li>
            <li>I love Warmth; it gives you a healthy glow</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, but this powder is my absolute&lt;br /&gt;favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It gives your skin that healthy sunkissed glow without the sun damage.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>This is one product that I can say you get MORE than you pay for.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>I love the warmth.</li>
            <li>I also love their foundation.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love that it adds color when I need it, and enhances when I&#x27;m tan.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels like you are not wearing any makeup at all.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Warmth is the best overall color.</li>
            <li>and I found the best way to unlock that was to just twist it strongly to the left...</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this adds a nice natural glow to my face.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and bareMinerals works great for me.</li>
            <li>This has a great travel locking cap to prevent it from spilling out (my old one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Fast service, good product</li>
            <li>This powder-based foundation is worth every penny: light, perfect match, and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have bought bare minerals on Amazon before and been perfectly happy with it.</li>
            <li>Bare minerals warmth, does what everyone says it does and is a great bronzer.</li>
            <li>my new container is what I had loved before.</li>
            <li>Fine for at home but can&#x27;t travel with it.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your face radiant, smooth and makes it easy to put your face on.  </li>
            <li>Its perfect for a bronzer or just to add a little color and can also be used as an eye shadow.</li>
            <li>This is a light bronzer that gives you a sun tanned glow, but does not cake on while applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never try to go cheap again.</li>
            <li>I think the one I got online wasn&#x27;t genuine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and liked it so much that I ordered it again.  </li>
            <li>The Warmth gives your face a nice sun-kissed glow, and during the summer when I am tanner it helps to give my face the same nice even tan look.</li>
            <li>Love Bare Minerals and love this powder!</li>
            <li>I use this product for an all over warmth on my face, gives a very warm glow even after coming in from outside</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use sparingly, because it is really easy to get way too much color on your face if you don&#x27;t tap the brush out.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and it gives you a great glow as well.</li>
            <li>While I love the produce the makeup came in the old style containers which do not have the closing top</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li>Not much product is needed, so you get a great value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to put on a full face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used BareMinerals for several years now and always find it easy to apply and kind to my skin.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>It is better than any blush I&#x27;ve every used to make my skin look vibrant.</li>
            <li>Super quick shipment too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loyal to this brand.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals are great products that do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product never fails to impress!  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  </li>
            <li>light and gentle on your skin,.</li>
            <li>I love the Warmth all over face color because its universal for all skin tones and it gives me that light touch of sun-kissed glow</li>
            <li>I love the natural color this gives.</li>
            <li>This gives you that fresh wake up complexion.  </li>
            <li>and I love the natural color.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup because it prevents acne issues, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Looks a lot better than my old stuff.</li>
            <li>this came quickly and is exactly what i ordered.  </li>
            <li>The package looked right but the powder did not.  </li>
            <li>Have worn Bare Minerals for years and the Warmth is great for extra color anytime or when you have a tan.</li>
            <li>The texture of the product is nice, it is just to dark for my fairly light skin.</li>
            <li>Love my Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>Love bare minerals!  </li>
            <li>I love all the products that Bare Mineral sells!</li>
            <li>I LOVE Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals face products.</li>
            <li>I usually use it to contour and highlight my cheekbones and chest and it works great.</li>
            <li>Love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I do however love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for years and love that I can purchase on line now.</li>
            <li>Love this bare minerals bronzing powder.  </li>
            <li>Love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I love bare minerals make</li>
            <li>This particular jar is about 1/2 the depth of the one I originally purchased, so from a price comparison point that is something to keep in mind.  </li>
            <li>i love bare minerals and the warmth does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to any one that is looking for a healthy natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>Larger than most sold here, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s named, gives your face warmth.  </li>
            <li>I PAID MORE FOR A SMALLER SIZE AND WAITED A WEEK TO GET IT.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more from here in the future.</li>
            <li>Love the color and its small compact dispenser :)</li>
            <li>The consistency of the powder is different as well, almost as if it has static electricty or something.</li>
            <li>how smooth it applies to her lovely little face.  </li>
            <li>I am 46 and the power sits on the face nice and doesn&#x27;t get in the creases and show like I have seen other foundations do.</li>
            <li>It can become grey in tone when you overdo it, but otherwise there is nothing better than this for creating that sunkissed skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too dark, gives a nice sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li>I use this product for my daily &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34;  I have it used for years and feel it&#x27;s better than any &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; I have bought before from many other companies, it lasts pretty much all day and you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a large angled contour brush.</li>
            <li>The product is light and was shipped through regular mail so to be quite frank, I think they are making a profit on the shipping.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive-acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Be conservative with how much use until you&#x27;ve got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Received the product fast.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and probably need the next shade up.</li>
            <li>eventually the connection points on this tab will break and then it&#x27;s ready to use.  </li>
            <li>I ready review that mentioned this &amp; tried it anyways.</li>
            <li>As described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I would suggest the &amp;#34;True&amp;#34; color or something more in the pink department.  </li>
            <li>The color seems darker than the real warmth.</li>
            <li>very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;no breakout, and</li>
            <li>Love this product and will not use any other</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for about ten years and still love it.</li>
            <li>It looks more like the Bare Minerals Deep color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just easy, feels natural, and is the only foundation I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I love bareMinerals products, however this bronzer is just average for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like the newly styled container as well.</li>
            <li>But as with all BareMinerals, LESS is MORE.</li>
            <li>I use more or less, depending on the occasion.</li>
            <li>The less you use the better because it is so pigmented it</li>
            <li>and I have always used this particular color as a blush.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it either was another powder put on into a Bare minerals case or it was just super old.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i get little more warmth to color on my face or i can use it as a blush</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not nearly the waste of a lot of it coming out all at once and surprising you.</li>
            <li>The seller is in England so normal shipping takes longer - not a problem if you&#x27;re not in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>i adquire this product but the consistency, shine, fresh look and covering its not the same as is you buying it direcly at the store, i would not buy it again by this method</li>
            <li>It gives such a beautiful glow and a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li>The product seems new, the way it&#x27;s packaged with the container and lid.</li>
            <li>All you need is this one product to look alive and natural and you are ready to walk out the door.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell this is the same bare minerals as I originally purchased 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>very natural looking..  </li>
            <li>Ive been using bare minerals since I&#x27;ve started wearing makeup and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It blends with your skin and makes you glow naturally!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color, but too much of the color combined with the above looks silly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals products and Warmth particularly since 1994.  </li>
            <li>For me personally since I use so little I was glad to be able to purchase a smaller size for less money.  </li>
            <li>- I use it year round and always get genuine compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li>but, it seems old like it&#x27;s been sitting in a cupboard til it expired.</li>
            <li>naturally tan</li>
            <li>Warmth puts a natural glow on your face.</li>
            <li>All shades are equally as natural as this.</li>
            <li>but it really does the job and provides enough coverage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use as much as the average woman probably does, which is why the original jar I purchase has lasted so long.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty much everyday over the top of my forehead, cheeks, and a little over my nose.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; is different from an older container of &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; that I had.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I personally like to brush a little around my eyes if I&#x27;m not doing any eye make up, and I go light around my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>The difference is in the shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, for all you ladies looking for some actual REAL tan look, I&#x27;ve been using this bronzer exclusively for the last 8 years.</li>
            <li>Although bare minerals is pricey</li>
            <li>The warmth color is a litttle dark for my skin and made me look funny, too tan.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only make up I use for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>compares to the quality and look of the Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>Have been using Bare Minerals for years and can&#x27;t find anything to complain about.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have glitter or &amp;#34;reflecting&amp;#34; minerals in it like other bronzers, so it actually looks real.</li>
            <li>You can mix and match bare minerals products with all kinds of different makeups.</li>
            <li>and once I switched to Bare Escentual products there was no looking back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare minerals, and I finally decided to do so.  </li>
            <li>I use a large brush and just use a little.</li>

            <li> It adds and nice warm colour to my skin tone with a bit of a glow.  </li>
            <li> Kind of clumpy.</li>

            <li> /&gt;highly recommend, nice warm color.</li>
            <li> The ounces stated help but when shopping on the fly it would be nice to have a picture gauge so one could quickly pick out the size we want, as if we are standing in the store and can \\&quot;see\\&quot; the size of the jar.</li>
            <li> Best face color ever, gives a natural glow!</li>
            <li> Very light on the skin but covers nicely.</li>

            <li> I love this product I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I feel like I look healthier with it on :)</li>
            <li> Again the top didn&#x27;t close with the online order.  </li>

            <li> i look MUCH better</li>
            <li> Have used many products,  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better bronzer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many bronzes</li>
            <li> so I just put tape over all but 1 hole) and you can choose how many holes you want to access ( 1 -3).</li>
            <li> I love the all over face color in warmth.  </li>
            <li> Great product shipped fast</li>
            <li> from...very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> love this makeup.  </li>
            <li> Adds color, warmth to my face!&lt;br /&gt;Combined with a lighter one of course.&lt;br /&gt;Gives me the healthy tanned appearance.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it as a blush and love it</li>
            <li> I love the way this gives our face that sun kissed look.</li>
            <li> I love Warmth; it gives you a healthy glow</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, but this powder is my absolute&lt;br /&gt;favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It gives your skin that healthy sunkissed glow without the sun damage.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> This is one product that I can say you get MORE than you pay for.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> I love the warmth.</li>
            <li> I also love their foundation.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love that it adds color when I need it, and enhances when I&#x27;m tan.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels like you are not wearing any makeup at all.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Warmth is the best overall color.</li>
            <li> and I found the best way to unlock that was to just twist it strongly to the left...</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this adds a nice natural glow to my face.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and bareMinerals works great for me.</li>
            <li> This has a great travel locking cap to prevent it from spilling out (my old one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Fast service, good product</li>
            <li> This powder-based foundation is worth every penny: light, perfect match, and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have bought bare minerals on Amazon before and been perfectly happy with it.</li>
            <li> Bare minerals warmth, does what everyone says it does and is a great bronzer.</li>
            <li> my new container is what I had loved before.</li>
            <li> Fine for at home but can&#x27;t travel with it.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your face radiant, smooth and makes it easy to put your face on.  </li>
            <li> Its perfect for a bronzer or just to add a little color and can also be used as an eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This is a light bronzer that gives you a sun tanned glow, but does not cake on while applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never try to go cheap again.</li>
            <li> I think the one I got online wasn&#x27;t genuine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and liked it so much that I ordered it again.  </li>
            <li> The Warmth gives your face a nice sun-kissed glow, and during the summer when I am tanner it helps to give my face the same nice even tan look.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals and love this powder!</li>
            <li> I use this product for an all over warmth on my face, gives a very warm glow even after coming in from outside</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use sparingly, because it is really easy to get way too much color on your face if you don&#x27;t tap the brush out.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and it gives you a great glow as well.</li>
            <li> While I love the produce the makeup came in the old style containers which do not have the closing top</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li> Not much product is needed, so you get a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to put on a full face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BareMinerals for several years now and always find it easy to apply and kind to my skin.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> It is better than any blush I&#x27;ve every used to make my skin look vibrant.</li>
            <li> Super quick shipment too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loyal to this brand.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals are great products that do not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product never fails to impress!  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  </li>
            <li> light and gentle on your skin,.</li>
            <li> I love the Warmth all over face color because its universal for all skin tones and it gives me that light touch of sun-kissed glow</li>
            <li> I love the natural color this gives.</li>
            <li> This gives you that fresh wake up complexion.  </li>
            <li> and I love the natural color.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup because it prevents acne issues, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Looks a lot better than my old stuff.</li>
            <li> this came quickly and is exactly what i ordered.  </li>
            <li> The package looked right but the powder did not.  </li>
            <li> Have worn Bare Minerals for years and the Warmth is great for extra color anytime or when you have a tan.</li>
            <li> The texture of the product is nice, it is just to dark for my fairly light skin.</li>
            <li> Love my Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li> Love bare minerals!  </li>
            <li> I love all the products that Bare Mineral sells!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals face products.</li>
            <li> I usually use it to contour and highlight my cheekbones and chest and it works great.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> I do however love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for years and love that I can purchase on line now.</li>
            <li> Love this bare minerals bronzing powder.  </li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> I love bare minerals make</li>
            <li> This particular jar is about 1/2 the depth of the one I originally purchased, so from a price comparison point that is something to keep in mind.  </li>
            <li> i love bare minerals and the warmth does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to any one that is looking for a healthy natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> Larger than most sold here, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s named, gives your face warmth.  </li>
            <li> I PAID MORE FOR A SMALLER SIZE AND WAITED A WEEK TO GET IT.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more from here in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the color and its small compact dispenser :)</li>
            <li> The consistency of the powder is different as well, almost as if it has static electricty or something.</li>
            <li> how smooth it applies to her lovely little face.  </li>
            <li> I am 46 and the power sits on the face nice and doesn&#x27;t get in the creases and show like I have seen other foundations do.</li>
            <li> It can become grey in tone when you overdo it, but otherwise there is nothing better than this for creating that sunkissed skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark, gives a nice sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my daily &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34;  I have it used for years and feel it&#x27;s better than any &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; I have bought before from many other companies, it lasts pretty much all day and you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a large angled contour brush.</li>
            <li> The product is light and was shipped through regular mail so to be quite frank, I think they are making a profit on the shipping.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive-acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Be conservative with how much use until you&#x27;ve got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Received the product fast.</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and probably need the next shade up.</li>
            <li> eventually the connection points on this tab will break and then it&#x27;s ready to use.  </li>
            <li> I ready review that mentioned this &amp; tried it anyways.</li>
            <li> As described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I would suggest the &amp;#34;True&amp;#34; color or something more in the pink department.  </li>
            <li> The color seems darker than the real warmth.</li>
            <li> very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;no breakout, and</li>
            <li> Love this product and will not use any other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for about ten years and still love it.</li>
            <li> It looks more like the Bare Minerals Deep color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just easy, feels natural, and is the only foundation I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals products, however this bronzer is just average for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like the newly styled container as well.</li>
            <li> But as with all BareMinerals, LESS is MORE.</li>
            <li> I use more or less, depending on the occasion.</li>
            <li> The less you use the better because it is so pigmented it</li>
            <li> and I have always used this particular color as a blush.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it either was another powder put on into a Bare minerals case or it was just super old.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i get little more warmth to color on my face or i can use it as a blush</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not nearly the waste of a lot of it coming out all at once and surprising you.</li>
            <li> The seller is in England so normal shipping takes longer - not a problem if you&#x27;re not in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> i adquire this product but the consistency, shine, fresh look and covering its not the same as is you buying it direcly at the store, i would not buy it again by this method</li>
            <li> It gives such a beautiful glow and a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> The product seems new, the way it&#x27;s packaged with the container and lid.</li>
            <li> All you need is this one product to look alive and natural and you are ready to walk out the door.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell this is the same bare minerals as I originally purchased 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> very natural looking..  </li>
            <li> Ive been using bare minerals since I&#x27;ve started wearing makeup and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It blends with your skin and makes you glow naturally!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great color, but too much of the color combined with the above looks silly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals products and Warmth particularly since 1994.  </li>
            <li> For me personally since I use so little I was glad to be able to purchase a smaller size for less money.  </li>
            <li> - I use it year round and always get genuine compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li> but, it seems old like it&#x27;s been sitting in a cupboard til it expired.</li>
            <li> naturally tan</li>
            <li> Warmth puts a natural glow on your face.</li>
            <li> All shades are equally as natural as this.</li>
            <li> but it really does the job and provides enough coverage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use as much as the average woman probably does, which is why the original jar I purchase has lasted so long.  </li>
            <li> I use it pretty much everyday over the top of my forehead, cheeks, and a little over my nose.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; is different from an older container of &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; that I had.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I personally like to brush a little around my eyes if I&#x27;m not doing any eye make up, and I go light around my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> The difference is in the shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, for all you ladies looking for some actual REAL tan look, I&#x27;ve been using this bronzer exclusively for the last 8 years.</li>
            <li> Although bare minerals is pricey</li>
            <li> The warmth color is a litttle dark for my skin and made me look funny, too tan.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only make up I use for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> compares to the quality and look of the Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Have been using Bare Minerals for years and can&#x27;t find anything to complain about.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have glitter or &amp;#34;reflecting&amp;#34; minerals in it like other bronzers, so it actually looks real.</li>
            <li> You can mix and match bare minerals products with all kinds of different makeups.</li>
            <li> and once I switched to Bare Escentual products there was no looking back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare minerals, and I finally decided to do so.  </li>
            <li> I use a large brush and just use a little.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of product goes a long way, so the product lasts and does not need to be replaced frequently.</li>
            <li> The color looks really dark, but you only need to use the tiniest amount, which also makes it last forever!  </li>
            <li> It took me a long time to figure it out, so here are the instructions...</li>
            <li> you a long time..</li>
            <li> is it a tiny one, a little one or the big jar.  </li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this tried and true product</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way... providing lots of color, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone who has not been properly informed how to put on bronzer...</li>
            <li> packaging looks the same, but has slight difference.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and the bronzer makes me look alive.</li>
            <li> have used this product for a long time and  will continue to byt from amazon due to  the  savings  on this product.  </li>
            <li> a little smaller than the size in the store but its cheaper too,  its plenty of makeup for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> I used to wear heavy liquid foundation back in the day.</li>
            <li> It takes a minimal amount and a lot of blending to achieve the not overdone look.  </li>
            <li> Seller shipped product as promised, on time and carefully wrapped.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale and/or have very pink or red cheeks</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and if you use in excess you will look orange.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Use small amount on my entire face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way too!</li>
            <li> Will never go with any other make up again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mineral makeup and nothing compares to bareMinerals.</li>
            <li> I have a load of freckles and dark auburn hair, so the pinks and the corals just don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other mineral make up before &amp; nothing compares to this!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes it looks a little orange.  </li>
            <li> , im too lazy and not high maintenance</li>
            <li> Had I received it expedited like 3 day shipping or been charged less</li>
            <li> so you get less product</li>
            <li> and they had it for a bit less.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this shade because it looked a little &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I mix this bronzer with the Mediun Beige powder foundation in the summer months when I am usually a little darker because of the sun.</li>
            <li> Adds a little color like U have been out in the sun during those winter months.</li>
            <li> If you have a pale complexion it gives you a little warmth and glow.</li>
            <li> It save me the drive to the mall and a few bucks.</li>
            <li> After a few ties of the online version-</li>
            <li> Compared over a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use this everyday as my bronzer.</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and stay out of the sun</li>
            <li> I ran out for awhile and my face looked so pale and drab.</li>
            <li> I brush it on in the winter to just punch up my pale face and in the summer to add to the tan I get.</li>
            <li> My review is less about the product and MORE about the outrageous shipping charge of $5.99???!!?!?</li>
            <li> No more heavy make-up face.</li>
            <li> No more pale face for me.</li>
            <li> You need very little, which means the product lasts longer as well</li>
            <li> Very little product is requires to achieve the look.</li>
            <li> You use very little and the pot will&lt;br /&gt;last</li>
            <li> small amount for the price</li>
            <li> so I just use a small amount of this to add some warmth to my face.</li>
            <li> I bought another container of &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; at my usual retail store</li>
            <li> Not much to say since I have been using Bare Minerals since 2007 and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I hardly ever get a pimple anymore.</li>
            <li> You can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> but it is always confusing.  </li>
            <li> i hate putting on make-up really</li>
            <li> This is a product that is hard to find and expensive at retail.</li>
            <li> The plastic seal inside the cap was also broken.</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed in this doesn&#x27;t go on like bare minerals,doesn&#x27;t smell like it and doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> Gives me a glow without the fake tan look.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just chose the wrong shade for my skin.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and this product doesn&#x27;t make you look fake</li>
            <li> and well it has a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> I used to have bad acne</li>
            <li> Crazy!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I use the warmth as a base color &amp; bronzer.</li>
            <li> but I hate every time I opened it, I smelled it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite foundation.  light and gentle on your skin,.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a year and its wonderful</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals and love this powder!</li>
            <li> My review is less about the product and MORE about the outrageous shipping charge of $5.99???!!?!? WTF? I am an Amazon Prime member and although I know this is not a prime eligible product, $5.00 seems A LOT steep for a product that arrived to me on 11/10 (6 days) after receiving a notice that said it was on its way on 11/4... I ordered it on 11/3. The product is light and was shipped through regular mail so to be quite frank, I think they are making a profit on the shipping. That&#x27;s my only concern. Had I received it expedited like 3 day shipping or been charged less (ie what the actual weight of it is) I&#x27;m not so sure I would buy from this vendor again.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder they can sell it for $12. The difference is in the shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, for all you ladies looking for some actual REAL tan look, I&#x27;ve been using this bronzer exclusively for the last 8 years. It is the BEST on the market. It doesn&#x27;t have glitter or &amp;#34;reflecting&amp;#34; minerals in it like other bronzers, so it actually looks real. A little goes a LONG way... providing lots of color, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone who has not been properly informed how to put on bronzer... but you can youtube that information and voila, the world&#x27;s best bronzer. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this tried and true product - I use it year round and always get genuine compliments on my tan. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Larger than most sold here, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li> It adds and nice warm colour to my skin tone with a bit of a glow.  I actually use it all over my face.  It&#x27;s a great way to get a nice, tanned look.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this adds a nice natural glow to my face.  The color looks really dark, but you only need to use the tiniest amount, which also makes it last forever!  All you need is a pinch.  Everyone that has lighter skin should have this.  I use it pretty much everyday over the top of my forehead, cheeks, and a little over my nose.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s named, gives your face warmth.  Perfect for the winter when I feel ghostly!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bareMinerals for about 4 years now. I use the warmth as a base color &amp; bronzer. I received it quickly and it was packaged well. It save me the drive to the mall and a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I got the entire BareMinerals starter kit, and have been replacing the components individually on Amazon. The warmth is great for giving your face a nice color, and it is perfect for highlighting cheekbones, forehead, nose and chin. It is better than any blush I&#x27;ve every used to make my skin look vibrant. Just be sure to use sparingly, because it is really easy to get way too much color on your face if you don&#x27;t tap the brush out.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A LESSON WELL LEARNED.  NEXT TIME I GO TO THE SEPHORA STORE AND BUY THE PRODUCT.  I PAID MORE FOR A SMALLER SIZE AND WAITED A WEEK TO GET IT.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Bare Minerals and I&#x27;m always looking for the best deal to buy it... this was the cheapest I could find around.  Super quick shipment too.  I&#x27;d buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> BareMinerals is a life saver to me. I have very sensitive-acne prone skin. This is the only makeup I can use. I love the Warmth all over face color because its universal for all skin tones and it gives me that light touch of sun-kissed glow I want on the apple of my cheeks and bridge of my nose. I also will sweep it in from my temples. But as with all BareMinerals, LESS is MORE. Be conservative with how much use until you&#x27;ve got the hang of it. A little goes a long way and if you use in excess you will look orange. Lol. But this is a must in my opinion. I never skip this step in my very easy makeup routine! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent. I am always unclear on what the \\&quot;sizes\\&quot; are . . . is it a tiny one, a little one or the big jar.  Don&#x27;t know how you could make this any clearer but it is always confusing.  The ounces stated help but when shopping on the fly it would be nice to have a picture gauge so one could quickly pick out the size we want, as if we are standing in the store and can \\&quot;see\\&quot; the size of the jar.</li>
            <li> Love my Bare Minerals! Very light on the skin but covers nicely. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great quality product at a good price. Excellent service. Received the product fast. This is a product that is hard to find and expensive at retail. Thanks!</li>
            <li> belongs in every woman&#x27;s make up bag!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without my Warmth!</li>
            <li> Fast service, good product</li>
            <li> small amount for the price, I mix it with the lighter powder to extend</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite products! It gives such a beautiful glow and a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> this makeup causes NO Breakouts, no oily buildup, and doesn&#x27;t look caked on. You need very little, which means the product lasts longer as well</li>
            <li> I like it but, it seems old like it&#x27;s been sitting in a cupboard til it expired. Kind of clumpy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for about ten years and still love it. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that it took an extra day with prime shipping.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and loves it.  She raves about the quality and how smooth it applies to her lovely little face.  If she is happy...well, y&#x27;all know the rest.</li>
            <li> While I love the produce the makeup came in the old style containers which do not have the closing top</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and stay out of the sun so I just use a small amount of this to add some warmth to my face. I use a large brush and just use a little. I feel like I look healthier with it on :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Again the top didn&#x27;t close with the online order.  Fine for at home but can&#x27;t travel with it.  I love Bare Minerals face products.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way! I think I&#x27;m on my second pot in something like 6 years!! Crazy! I use this daily too so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s never used. I usually use it to contour and highlight my cheekbones and chest and it works great. Gives me a glow without the fake tan look.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my daughter and myself. Use small amount on my entire face. Gives you a sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li> Great product, my face loves it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using bare minerals since I&#x27;ve started wearing makeup and this is the real deal. It&#x27;s a great bronzer without looking orange. I use it all over my face to contour or sometimes even just as blush. I love the natural color this gives. A little goes a LONG way too! So this product lasts forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before .... adds an all over blush...I like it.</li>
            <li> this is what i use to just look healthy and get my summer glow since im naturally tan but in winter i lose a lot of my bronze color...i have pimples and under- eye circles but w/ this on? i look MUCH better w/out putting on any concealer, powder etc....i hate putting on make-up really, im too lazy and not high maintenance so this is just perfect for me. i just look pretty for no reason at all w/ this on lol!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BareMinerals for several years now and always find it easy to apply and kind to my skin. I cannot imagine my make up kit without several of their products!</li>
            <li> If you are getting the foundation then this color warmth is a MUST to compliment it. Its perfect for a bronzer or just to add a little color and can also be used as an eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Love bare minerals!  It covers well and feels good to the skin.  Have used many products,  but this one is best!</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed in this doesn&#x27;t go on like bare minerals,doesn&#x27;t smell like it and doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Next time I will stick to Ulta. I don&#x27;t understand how some people can get away with selling junk!  Check the sellers&amp; reviews before buying. I have bought bare minerals on Amazon before and been perfectly happy with it.</li>
            <li> Used this for years! Always great for some color.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals are great products that do not irritate my sensitive skin. Just a little bit of product goes a long way, so the product lasts and does not need to be replaced frequently. Warmth is the best, most natural looking bronzer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals.  The only makeup I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this shade because it looked a little &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; on my skin.  I have light olive skin and probably need the next shade up. I do however love Bare Minerals.  Their products are of the highest quality.  I do like the way to use the product.  There&#x27;s not nearly the waste of a lot of it coming out all at once and surprising you.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a better bronzer. This is for your every day use. There is no illuminator in the powder so it goes on matte but looks great morning, noon and night.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot especially I have an acne prone skin. I don&#x27;t see any break out after using it. I usally break out after using after name brand powder. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. I wish they have a lighter color for contouring.</li>
            <li> Love it. Only foundation I ever use. It&#x27;s just easy, feels natural, and is the only foundation I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many bronzes and I always end up going back to this one. It goes on so nice without a caked on look. It&#x27;s not too dark, gives a nice sun kissed glow. Can be used as a contour, all over bronzer, or blush. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years now, probably will continue to do so.  My only complaint is that sometimes it looks a little orange.  Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> I mix this bronzer with the Mediun Beige powder foundation in the summer months when I am usually a little darker because of the sun. It lasts a long time and it gives you a great glow as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered a makeup product and received shoe polish. Enough said.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell this is the same bare minerals as I originally purchased 8 years ago.  Since I work from home I don&#x27;t use as much as the average woman probably does, which is why the original jar I purchase has lasted so long.  This particular jar is about 1/2 the depth of the one I originally purchased, so from a price comparison point that is something to keep in mind.  For me personally since I use so little I was glad to be able to purchase a smaller size for less money.  The seller is in England so normal shipping takes longer - not a problem if you&#x27;re not in a hurry.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there were no instructions on how to open it...This has a great travel locking cap to prevent it from spilling out (my old one didn&#x27;t so I just put tape over all but 1 hole) and you can choose how many holes you want to access ( 1 -3). It took me a long time to figure it out, so here are the instructions...There is a tab that stick up and I found the best way to unlock that was to just twist it strongly to the left...eventually the connection points on this tab will break and then it&#x27;s ready to use.  If you pull the tab up you risk it popping open and the powder going everywhere.</li>
            <li> They made the container smaller inside so you get less product but I still like the product but I&#x27;m looking for a replacement that&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li> I love the all over face color in warmth.  Have purchased before and will continue to purchase .  Great product!</li>
            <li> this came quickly and is exactly what i ordered.  i love bare minerals and the warmth does exactly what it says.  i get little more warmth to color on my face or i can use it as a blush</li>
            <li> Great product shipped fast</li>
            <li> i adquire this product but the consistency, shine, fresh look and covering its not the same as is you buying it direcly at the store, i would not buy it again by this method</li>
            <li> I like this to give my face the similar appearance I would have from the sun.  I really like the newly styled container as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, adds color and looks like you are sun kissed...arrived on time and very good price...good company to&lt;br /&gt;buy from...very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> love this makeup.  been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loyal to this brand. Don&#x27;t order online- it is NOT THE SAME. packaging looks the same, but has slight difference. And the powder settles and sticks differently. I ready review that mentioned this &amp; tried it anyways. After a few ties of the online version- I went to sephora and got the same product. Compared over a few weeks and there is no way it is the same.</li>
            <li> I used to wear heavy liquid foundation back in the day. Although bare minerals is pricey you get what you pay for!! This powder-based foundation is worth every penny: light, perfect match, and barely noticeable. No more heavy make-up face. Flawless. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Every one asks if I have been on vacation. The color gives my face the perfect amount of a sunkissed look. Very little product is requires to achieve the look.</li>
            <li> the product is a great product and is a nice size for the price, I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion and this face powder has been great for contouring. I use it with a large angled contour brush. I use more or less, depending on the occasion. It is great for highlighting cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Will never go with any other make up again. It looks effortless and feels very light. When I wear it people say I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it gives my face a warm glow.  I love all the products that Bare Mineral sells!</li>
            <li> Have worn Bare Minerals for years and the Warmth is great for extra color anytime or when you have a tan.</li>
            <li> Adds color, warmth to my face!&lt;br /&gt;Combined with a lighter one of course.&lt;br /&gt;Gives me the healthy tanned appearance. I feel good. Skin is good with it too.</li>
            <li> Love this, I use it for contouring!</li>
            <li> I had used this product before, so I knew what to expect from the bronzer.  The seller was speedy and everyhing arrived as it should.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have been using bareMinerals for atleast 10 years now.  It provides great coverage while looking like you do not have make up on.  It does not look caked on.  Love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years now and I love it. This is the first time I purchased it from Amazon and at a great price. I&#x27;ll be ordering more from here in the future.</li>
            <li> My favorite make up !!! Awesome</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about six years.Love it!</li>
            <li> Good quality. As described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This gives you that fresh wake up complexion.  Looks like you had a couple hours in the sun recently.  If you have a pale complexion it gives you a little warmth and glow.</li>
            <li> Warmth puts a natural glow on your face. I have tried other mineral make up before &amp; nothing compares to this! I love it!</li>
            <li> I use it as a blush and love it</li>
            <li> I love the way this gives our face that sun kissed look. No more pale face for me. Love this product and will not use any other</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way and I love the natural color.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your face radiant, smooth and makes it easy to put your face on.  I&#x27;m not one to put on a full face.  All you need is this one product to look alive and natural and you are ready to walk out the door.</li>
            <li> The warmth color is a litttle dark for my skin and made me look funny, too tan.  I would suggest the &amp;#34;True&amp;#34; color or something more in the pink department.  I think I will also try to lighten it with Mineral Veil and see if that helps.  The texture of the product is nice, it is just to dark for my fairly light skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful warm sun kissed glow is what I get when I apply this . I use it as a blush as well as to contour my face . Love the color and its small compact dispenser :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years</li>
            <li> This is perfect for shading, or a light dusting when winter comes. I&#x27;ve used it for years. All shades are equally as natural as this.</li>
            <li> have used this product for a long time and  will continue to byt from amazon due to  the  savings  on this product.  always  get a good deal on the  product .</li>
            <li> Love this makeup because it prevents acne issues, and it looks natural. I am very pale and the bronzer makes me look alive.</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals! I don&#x27;t like feeling like I have a ton of make up on and this is lightweight, yet offer superior coverage.</li>
            <li> I use bareMinerals and got it at a great price. Ordering online makes it easy and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a light bronzer that gives you a sun tanned glow, but does not cake on while applying. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using bareMinerals for close to 7 years. It provides excellent coverage and helps to keep my skin clear, I will NEVER go back to liquid foundation again. I&#x27;ve tried other mineral makeup and nothing compares to bareMinerals. The Warmth gives your face a nice sun-kissed glow, and during the summer when I am tanner it helps to give my face the same nice even tan look. Can&#x27;t say enough!!!</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals; it the best......I love Warmth; it gives you a healthy glow......It arrived as it was supposed to ....Thank you for sending promptly.......</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have been using Bare Minerals for years and love that I can purchase on line now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, but this powder is my absolute&lt;br /&gt;favorite. Keeps the skin even and matte...great look</li>
            <li> a little smaller than the size in the store but its cheaper too,  its plenty of makeup for the price.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend, nice warm color.</li>
            <li> The color seems darker than the real warmth. It looks more like the Bare Minerals Deep color. The consistency of the powder is different as well, almost as if it has static electricty or something. Don&#x27;t hink I would buy again. The plastic seal inside the cap was also broken.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of the cheaper &#x27;&#x27;minerals&#x27;&#x27; make up.  Nothing like bareMinerals.  I wear the medium beige and the warmth.  No one can tell I have makeup on and I constantly get compliments on my complexion.  I&#x27;ll never try to go cheap again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only make up I use for my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s very light and seems like you have no make up  at all but it really does the job and provides enough coverage.</li>
            <li> This is the best face powder.  I&#x27;ve tried others and nothing compares to the quality and look of the Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It gives your skin that healthy sunkissed glow without the sun damage.  Would highly recommend this product to any one that is looking for a healthy natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; is different from an older container of &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; that I had.  Disappointed.  When they change a product, they ought to change the name too! UPDATE: I bought another container of &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; at my usual retail store and it was like the one I&#x27;d had before.  I think the one I got online wasn&#x27;t genuine. The package looked right but the powder did not.  Glad my new container is what I had loved before.</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals products, however this bronzer is just average for me.  It takes a minimal amount and a lot of blending to achieve the not overdone look.  Perhaps I just chose the wrong shade for my skin.  It&#x27;s just a tad bit too warm for me, but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Not much to say since I have been using Bare Minerals since 2007 and have never been disappointed.  This is one product that I can say you get MORE than you pay for.</li>
            <li> Have been using Bare Minerals for years and can&#x27;t find anything to complain about.  Their entire product line is quality and I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> I use this product for an all over warmth on my face, gives a very warm glow even after coming in from outside</li>
            <li> I got it at 14 dollars each, Im very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;no breakout, and even if you don´t apply a lot or make up it just looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m olive skinned so, its perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love the warmth. I ran out for awhile and my face looked so pale and drab. It totally lights up the face...a must have!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used you can&#x27;t go wrong...great for my sensitive skin n best color match.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my daily &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34;  I have it used for years and feel it&#x27;s better than any &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; I have bought before from many other companies, it lasts pretty much all day and you don&#x27;t need to use much.  I also love their foundation.  I am 46 and the power sits on the face nice and doesn&#x27;t get in the creases and show like I have seen other foundations do.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and bareMinerals works great for me. Adds a little color like U have been out in the sun during those winter months.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday as my bronzer. It is the only bronzer I have used for years and I love it. I wear it over Revlon liquid foundation. You can mix and match bare minerals products with all kinds of different makeups.</li>
            <li> Love that it adds color when I need it, and enhances when I&#x27;m tan.</li>
            <li> Love this bare minerals bronzing powder.  very natural looking..  You use very little and the pot will&lt;br /&gt;last you a long time..</li>
            <li> Exceptional product, service, price, delivery...everything! I recommend this seller and this product! I&#x27;m 47 and this product doesn&#x27;t make you look fake and it makes you look years younger. Best invention since sliced bread!</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is the best makeup foundation I know and I have tried quite a few. I love how it feels like you are not wearing any makeup at all. It blends with your skin and makes you glow naturally! The color warmth I use as a blush and to make my face look a bit... warmer...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years now and I really love it. However, I stopped buying it at Sephora when I checked out Amazon and they had it for a bit less. I have noticed after that it doesn&#x27;t seem the same. After reading some of the reviews I now know why. The product seems new, the way it&#x27;s packaged with the container and lid. However, I noticed that it didn&#x27;t feel the same and felt like any regular powder. I have also bought the mineral veil and well it has a weird smell to it. I have used it but I hate every time I opened it, I smelled it. It seems like it either was another powder put on into a Bare minerals case or it was just super old. I started going back to Sephora. Recommended works great for me but better to buy it somewhere you know and trust.</li>
            <li> Bare minerals warmth, does what everyone says it does and is a great bronzer. The less you use the better because it is so pigmented it just coats all the places you touch the brush too. It can become grey in tone when you overdo it, but otherwise there is nothing better than this for creating that sunkissed skin.</li>
            <li> Love Bare Minerals.  This product never fails to impress!  I&#x27;ll order again...and again...and again!  Seller shipped product as promised, on time and carefully wrapped.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Best face color ever, gives a natural glow!</li>
            <li> What can I say? THIS STUFF IS THE BOMB! Love it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals products and Warmth particularly since 1994.  I used to have bad acne and once I switched to Bare Escentual products there was no looking back, my face cleared up and I hardly ever get a pimple anymore. Warmth is the best overall color. I brush it on in the winter to just punch up my pale face and in the summer to add to the tan I get. It&#x27;s fantastic and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Bare Mineral products are awesome! I have healthier skin because of it! I have been using this product for 10 years and love it!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Bare Minerals and I have always used this particular color as a blush.  I have a load of freckles and dark auburn hair, so the pinks and the corals just don&#x27;t work for me.  I went to a local store and had someone help me out and once he swept this across my cheeks I could see it was perfect for me!  The color lasts all day, so no need for constant touch-ups, which is not something you can often say in South Texas.  Not much product is needed, so you get a great value.</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals make up&amp;#62; I have used it for years &amp; plan to keep on using. &amp;#34;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and liked it so much that I ordered it again.  I use it as a blush, rather than an all-over face color.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great Service!  Was exactly what was advertised and product arrived when it was suppose to!  Will order again from this company!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for years and says she loves it.  Good color and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pale and/or have very pink or red cheeks I suggest you invest in a kabuki brush to spread this across your face. It&#x27;s a great color, but too much of the color combined with the above looks silly. I personally like to brush a little around my eyes if I&#x27;m not doing any eye make up, and I go light around my nose and cheeks. Great color, just gotta know how to use it the best for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bare minerals, and I finally decided to do so.  You can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  Looks a lot better than my old stuff.</li>
            <li> A product I&#x27;ve used for over a decade. Love, love, LOVE it!</li>
