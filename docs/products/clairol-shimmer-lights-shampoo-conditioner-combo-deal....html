            <li>Shimmer shampoo and conditioner are the greatest for gray hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner used to work perfectly for me, even when using it 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard from a lot of people and reviews that this is the best shampoo for graying hair that has some yellowing.  </li>

            <li>I hope the scent is still pleasant this summer.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it works as described.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff.</li>
            <li>Packaging was good and came on time.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good the color stays but the conditioner has alot of chemicals  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>everything else is good.</li>
            <li>Good seller.</li>

            <li>Smells good and works well.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sooooo good</li>
            <li>Must use a good conditioner after this conditioner though.</li>
            <li>Brightened my highlights like it should so I loved it.</li>
            <li>The packaging isnt so good.</li>
            <li>but hey, better smelly beautiful hair than bald head</li>
            <li>I recommend using a really good hydrating conditioner between washes with this stuff to keep your hair happy :)</li>
            <li>Perfect and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It is purple and doesn&#x27;t have the greatest odor, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love the way that looks, but it doesn&#x27;t fly at work.,</li>
            <li>this is very nice for colored blond hair and not too drying either :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Helps hair for sure!</li>
            <li>If you have lightened or bleached hair then this product is MAGIC!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Excellent product and does exactly what it states on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I had made my own toner, but this works faster and targets the hair color.</li>
            <li>Never used another kind</li>
            <li>a copper color - nice.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really liked this product.</li>
            <li>it got here it was packaged nicely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read here and after using this shampoo and conditioner follow up with your own conditioner.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s kind of what I was going</li>
            <li>The combination has left me with wonderful hair that holds great color yet is soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>smell like fruity or nice, but the smell doesnt bother me, it does wonders on toning my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice product and recommended</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself does NOT smell like a thrift store, however it does smell like a rose candle or something of that sort.</li>
            <li>Does the job, kind of dries my hair out</li>
            <li>Honestly speaking, I don&#x27;t feel this coordinating conditioner is beneficial or needed-</li>
            <li>Just make sure to leave it on the recommended times and it works good</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>my naturally, healthy beautiful gets super stringy/tangly...</li>
            <li>I say just buy the shampoo and use your own favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for keeping my naturally silver hair from yellowing.</li>
            <li>It has an awesome fragrance and makes your hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and pleased with the shipping and safe packaging.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to be able to buy the combo package at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Great , accurate, fast delivery !!</li>
            <li>Good product - did the trick to fix brassy hair best price together a little pricy $18</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic value!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would have prefered a more floral/fruit smell as opposed to a granny-aunty smell....</li>
            <li>Made my hair purple so be sure to rinse thoroughly...</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and I already see a difference.</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo but the Conditioner needs to be a bit better</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re trying to lighten your hair more that is).</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had to recondition with some better product.</li>
            <li>and it became more gray in sections.  </li>
            <li>I love the shine these products give my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for many years and always keep a backup set so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>The bottles arrived safely with no leaking.</li>
            <li>Still love the shampoo, but will not purchase the conditioner again.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>Love this product for silver hair.</li>
            <li>fast shipping which was great</li>
            <li>If the conditioner were more moisturizing, I may consider giving the product five stars.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner are magic.</li>
            <li>and i love the smell üòÑ</li>
            <li>Awesome shampoo love it for blonde hair in the summer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love this product and will continue to use it until it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner takes all brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will buy it again</li>
            <li>but ,all in all the shampoo worked ok.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>I would give this more stars if I could.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and one more thing, after using this product don&#x27;t use acidic product like lemon or fruit based shampoos ..</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>I rinsed my hair with no results and had to wash it many times to get the product out.  </li>
            <li>Thanx you very much I love it</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Me and my husband love the smell..</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product it keeps the brassiness out of my blonde hair--</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love this product and will continue using.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This Shampoo and conditioner is literaly just ok.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product no hassles thank you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love a refund.</li>
            <li>It does pick up the purple tone of the product if used any more than that.  </li>
            <li>I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, it helps clarify my hair.</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>Love the smell, works well.</li>
            <li>great price i would highly recommend buying this product</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting my hair very clean</li>
            <li>Hair looks as good as the first day it got colored.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my hairdresser and makes my grey hair look great!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you mix the conditioner with a strong think conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the Aveda shampoos and more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>probably best to just use one product instead of two on top of each other.</li>
            <li>The smell would probably be a turn off for most people, it has a floral grandmother scent- which I oddly enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is so much better to get yellow from beautiful gray hair.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this shampoo and conditioner available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The scent was so strong, I could not use it.  </li>
            <li>I tried it twice, but could taste the scent, it was so strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Honestly this product really does the trick on toning the brassiness out of bleached hair!</li>
            <li>In terms of toning, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used thus far and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It took the bright orange and bright yellow out of my hair and dulled them with is exactly what i needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great for toning down brassy blonde hair and smells great too!</li>
            <li>great product for using on light blonde highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>It keep my light blonde looking great...</li>
            <li>this is great for blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It was alright, didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell of the shampoo and it contained sulfates which is why I stopped using it for my bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo to keep the brassy and yellow tones out.</li>
            <li>worked great for maintaining white hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great to get rid of the brassy yellow tone .</li>
            <li>Works great, even on my blue hair!</li>
            <li>Works great to get the yellow tones out of my platinum bleached hair!  </li>
            <li>I have used this once since I received it last week and have ALREADY gotten great results.  </li>
            <li>packaging was great--both bottles filled and unopened.</li>
            <li>Im asian with bleached hair and this works great.</li>
            <li>Nice product but very damaging to the hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed the smell issues that some other reviewers complain about, but it leaves my hair incredibly tangled.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is ok, but I found using it that my hair was becoming very straw</li>
            <li>Buy it, it&#x27;s awesome, it definitely helped me brassy hair go normal.</li>
            <li>You really need to use a lot because it rubs out and suds very easily.</li>
            <li>Looks strange when it comes out because its purple lol</li>
            <li>Great product, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long unless you want purple hair</li>
            <li>Great for blondes and grey hair.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Great for grey hair-adds color and luster.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that you might need a very good leave in conditioner, because the hair gets very tangled.</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying (you are buying this product for what it does to clean and color-tone, not condition)</li>
            <li>Smells so clean too.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t seem to actually clean my hair, either.</li>
            <li>leaves hair very shinny and clean.. love it</li>
            <li>it is VERY purple which is a good thing if you have hard water like I do, I bought this product as a step up from my John Frieda color correcting shampoo (also a great purple shampoo not as purple but works)</li>
            <li>It turns bright red, and this saves the day every time!</li>
            <li>*  Good that she only need to use it about once a week or so</li>
            <li>And it feels nice and soft like after being at a salon.</li>
            <li>good news is the purple does seem to wash out after regular shampooing.</li>
            <li>if you go from black/dark brown to orange, you need to bleach again before this (or most toner, really)</li>
            <li>but I just use a deep conditioner after and it&#x27;s all good üòä</li>
            <li>My blonde still looks good.  </li>
            <li>It is a good shampoo and conditioner, BUT it leaves a lavender-ish tint to white hair.</li>
            <li>Good product to keep highlighted hair from looking yellow or too brassy.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price on here for it either.</li>
            <li>it gives my hair a great shine and luster, not that yellowing you get from other products.</li>
            <li>Just from the one use (of which, I didn&#x27;t leave the product on for more than a minute) my newly bleached and colored hair is lighter and brighter!</li>
            <li>Received the 2-pack quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it is the best for daily shampooing, so I use it only once a week.</li>
            <li>It is super drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, better than the last stuff I bought at the beauty shop</li>
            <li>perfect for highlighted or blonde hair that has yellowed, only use about once a week though</li>
            <li>My hair is totally white and the Shimmer Lights really keeps it looking great</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and only have to use once or maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>The best , I have dyed middle golden blonde hair , after shampoo 2 min and conditioner for 5 min</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it best to either only use it a few times per week of to mix it with a more nourishing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS GOOD 4 GREY HAIR, NOW &amp; THEN &amp;</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my hair is super blonde (not bleach orange any more!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never dealt with dry hair yet since I soak my hair in the Clairol conditioner for a good 10 mins (maybe that helps).</li>
            <li>This stuff really does brighten gray/silver hair!!</li>
            <li>my hair become light ash blonde , I tried other products without success , the hair are nice after the conditioner , so if you use your own shampoo the conditioner will be enough as the pigment is more strong than in the shampoo  </li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t really make my hair softer, but it does help with keeping my hair extra bright.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using it after freshly bleaching your hair or lightening it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been described as an &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34; and I laugh</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it tho</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it makes my hair so soft and shiny and does what it says it does and the packaging it comes incompletely protects the product</li>
            <li>Was worth a try</li>
            <li>This shampoo is really nice with my bleach blonde hair!</li>
            <li>Now quite what I had in mind, but mildly colorful.</li>
            <li>All in all, it isn&#x27;t worth it for me to purchase this.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;ve been mixing Wilton&#x27;s gel icing coloring with a nice moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioner, and that has been helping me to fight brassiness while moisturizing my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>so I think this product isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>really does a great job of toning, but the shampoo is extremely drying and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and quick delivery as promised.</li>
            <li>I use the set once a week and rinse pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Good for the price compared to other products.</li>
            <li>The color added by both of these is really great and keeps my blonde cool rather than yellow.</li>
            <li>so i used this product and it took the brassy look right out</li>
            <li>right ?</li>
            <li>Right after I toned it with ash toner t9 wellas.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you time yourself with this product; But other than that it&#x27;s a great alternative to the box toner that can leave your hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>more tip: the purple will stain your bathroom if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner combo really keeps my hair nice and blonde.</li>
            <li>You can leave it in for a few more minutes during each wash for a more icy-platinum/silver look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very floral and kind of smells like generic hand soap, but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle to use daily, yet effective.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get very very coppery</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t act as much of a cleaning shampoo, but it definitely brings out my highlights and makes my hair brighter, especially right after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Got here fast and does exactly what I want!</li>
            <li>n wash it out ;)</li>
            <li>Exactly like it said on a bottle .</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t use it too much!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>this is not the first time I bought from you and I will buy again sooon</li>
            <li>Just using the shampoo with any brand conditioner and any brand shampoo with the conditioner will work after you do the first step for lightening which requires both)</li>
            <li>Finally gave up and decided to have healthy glowing hair naturally with the gray to show my maturity and just enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the way my gray hair is so white and the shimmer is just all I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Love the actual product but when I received mine the shampoo had leaked all into the box.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had with it was that the longer you leave it on the more &amp;#34;grey/silver&amp;#34; my hair turned.</li>
            <li>There were times where I would leave it on for more then three minutes and parts of my hair were silver and parts were white.</li>
            <li>After first usage I got the results.</li>
            <li>I feel this helps get the most out of the product, and my hair has yet to turn a blue or purple tint.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I gather my hair into a ponytail and apply it at the tips of my hair and work my way up the hairs.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair snow white and is at a much more affordable price than if you were to get them from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>After just one wash with this I noticed a difference and after maybe 3 washes I got the exact tone I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My hair is a platinum blonde color but this seemed to turn my hair more of a purple/gray tint.</li>
            <li>my nail polish was gray from white so wear gloves .. the skin was ok .&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>The only fault is I wish there was an omega :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use a regular shampoo first, then I let this shampoo sit on my hair for five minutes then rinse it out and put more on for another five minutes.</li>
            <li>If you are going super light blonde from a darker hair tone, this is sort of a must have.</li>
            <li>and now I have a nice rich blonde especially on the ends where it was orangey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll use the conditioner, but overall it&#x27;s still the same great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You really know where your shampoo and conditioner is flying with this - I am now more aware with my normal shampoo and conditioner which is clear, however is ending up all over the shower walls and tub....</li>
            <li>In the end my highlights still appear yellow instead of bright white</li>
            <li>as a product used most often for blonde hair, which is usually bleached, this isn&#x27;t very good for preventing further damage.</li>
            <li>It does what it claims to do which is keeps blonde hair from becoming brassy and for that reason alone I would repurchase and recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I will see how long I can stand it, but I might have to switch to the Aveda purple shampoo (which costs WAY more) just because I can&#x27;t get over the smell of the Clairol.</li>
            <li>As a natural brunette (recently added blonde/highlights), this does a great job of taking out any brassiness and freshening up my blonde.</li>
            <li>(I assumed this probably only happened to people who didn&#x27;t use the product correctly or clean their showers, I was right again)</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner absolutely keeps blonde hair from becoming brassy.</li>
            <li>even though I&#x27;m kind of sensitive to fragrances, I love the subtle way these products smell.</li>
            <li>As much as I love this stuff, it can really dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>It was large clumps of it.</li>
            <li>And &amp;#34;too long&amp;#34; is something you&#x27;ll personally have to experiment with, but for me, it was either way too cool or too yellow, and it only had a couple of days where it was good in between those stages.</li>
            <li>if u just use ur regular conditioner afterwards its fine.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re looking to tint your hair purple, leave it in a little longer than it says and you&#x27;ll have a nice pastel lilac.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these items they really work!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>The conditioner...  not so much.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Works very well:  this product definitively helps prevent or get rid of brazziness, so it helps preserve my hair color.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really, this shampoo is supposed to make your hair purple.</li>
            <li>thanks alote</li>
            <li>light blonde</li>
            <li>Really PURPLE - stains everything.  </li>
            <li>I found that this turns my light strawberry blonde hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;The conditioner is drying, and doesn&#x27;t really work to get out</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t like that about it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo a lot but the conditioner is very runny</li>
            <li>both shampoo and conditioner are very purple</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>This works fabulous on my blonde hair!  </li>
            <li>but this really does work.</li>
            <li>It absolutely is.  </li>
            <li>Made hair very shinny and silver.</li>
            <li>no one wants.</li>
            <li>but a deeper consitioner is suggested and use gloves haha because my fingernails are purple now.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>It really worked to help keep the color and cut out the brassiness.</li>
            <li>yes it smells and is very drying but your not buying it to strengthen your hair, you buying it to take out brassyness</li>
            <li>And the whole gagging over the smell...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for the product too much.</li>
            <li>Product works really well with my hair.</li>
            <li>but instead of whitening it really makes it silvery/blue.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>and she really loves this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Problem is, it makes your hair really really damaged.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind the brassiness, but I&#x27;m trying to get my hair to a white/silver color</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to cut out a lot of brassiness in bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Both products deposit so much color</li>
            <li>Very purple formula, I don&#x27;t like this in my shower.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with it staining our white shower pan or light colored shower tiles as others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>It helps remove brassiness and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>If I use both the shampoo and conditioner straight and let it sit, though, I do end up with a lavender sheen.  </li>
            <li>I was dying my hair from reddish brown to light blonde.</li>
            <li>This shampoo blends the distinctive white and darker gray hairs to a lovely, soft color.</li>
            <li>took the yellow out of my hair... made it look more natural.</li>
            <li>do agree with some of the other reviewers, it does kind of have an old lady smell to it, but that doesnt bother me much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have natural light brown hair which I recently had highlighted for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It has worked better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;ve never gotten the results from any other products like this one.</li>
            <li>Was suppose to be shampoo and conditioner, but recieved two shampoos but other than that I love this product</li>
            <li>Finally beware this shampoo/conditioner will stain so if you spill a bit in your bathtub clean it up immediately.</li>
            <li>CHEAP PRICE-- more expensive elsewhere, love this product and I would personally recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>how long you leave it on your hair as it can turn light purple (which happened to me today).</li>
            <li>I had been using John Frieda Sheer Blonde Enhancing Shampoo and Conditioner (for Darker Blondes) with good results but figured I would alternate that with purple shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This product will help cool down your blonde but dries hair out so be sure to follow with a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>It tones down the brass colors a lot and turns it more of an ash color.</li>
            <li>It is a bit odd for hair products, but not disgusting.</li>
            <li>After using, I always have multiple people ask if I got more blonde put in my hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; by conditioning terms, but the color is vibrant and no brassy shades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the main flaw i found with it</li>
            <li>the top was a very yellow blonde and the ends were orange yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than a much more expensive product I purchased through a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s super duper necessary.</li>
            <li>Better than JF sheer blonde, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I found another hairstylist that came highly recommended but could not get in with her for another two weeks.</li>
            <li>This one worked really well, almost too well, because my hair is slightly purple/blue tinted now, but I honestly prefer that over the yellow I had before.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>Way less than Redken Blonde Idol and works better too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the rest of my hair goes (the parts that were just dyed, not highlighted), it has been toning out some of the brassiness, but not quite as much as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>Wow this shampoo really works.</li>
            <li>I just assumed that I had used so much bleach that it was naturally frosting --- like a glacier effect.  </li>
            <li>I normally like Clairol products, however, this one replaced one problem with another.</li>
            <li>It was not the normal amount of hair shedding that normally happens when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>Shimmer Lights is too harsh and drying to use more than once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth keeping my blonde from getting brassy.  </li>
            <li>actually looks pretty cool and thank goodness not did not turn my hair blue.</li>
            <li>Took off all the yellow-orange color from my patinum highlights  in only 3 uses but u can really see results from first use</li>
            <li>It might be ok for people who are naturally blonde or grey, but I need something to help moisturize my hair and defrizz because it is damaged from bleach.  </li>
            <li>So what I do is add it to normal shampoo now.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying, funny enough</li>
            <li>Normally shampoo smells don&#x27;t stick around</li>
            <li>It does brighten your blonde though, and it&#x27;s lots of fun getting purple all over the shower.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the shampoo and conditioner and leave the conditioner on a bit longer than you normally would.</li>
            <li>product is so much better than dye hair toner that damage bleached hair even more , my hair are long to my lower back bleached to dead, but soft , shiny and looks healthy and don&#x27;t break down ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but my hair is SUPER damaged by the bleachings I&#x27;ve been putting it through</li>
            <li>I have only used twice, but noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>and my hair went right back to being controllable again.  </li>
            <li>but idk if its even doing anything for my blonde peek-a-boos that aren&#x27;t the right shade..</li>
            <li>However, the side effect I am observing is that the shampoo is turning some of my hair a light purple after 45 days of use (using it every other day).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>(I live in Hawaii).  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but use a different better conditioner after because like the other reviewers have said it does dry out the hair.</li>
            <li>It has a very old lady smell to it</li>
            <li>But the smell is not unpleasant and does not linger in dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I can totally tell a difference after the first use when it comes to the the brass color.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for any blonde, real or enhanced!</li>
            <li>I like to use a deep condition afterwards, or hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>so when I get my blonde highlights this is the only shampoo that can take the brassy color out and give me back the white/silver color that I love.</li>
            <li>, however, I have to take care not to leave it on longer than it takes to shampoo and condition my hair as it will give me a &amp;#34;little old lady with purple hair&amp;#34; look!</li>
            <li>Right after the brassyness and orange is out, but not completely.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to brighten blond &amp; gray hair - it turned my white long hair a light gunmetal gray.</li>
            <li>I originally have dark brown hair</li>
            <li>The scent is unlike any other shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s not bad-</li>
            <li>my hair was in fantastic condition and then i used this product with  a deep conditioner after and my hair felt like dry string and started breaking off .</li>
            <li>Only drawback (why it&#x27;s not 5 stars) is that you have to be careful when your blonde is very light-</li>
            <li>Love that I can find this on Amazon, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner because they really works, i just hate the fragance is like an old ladys perfume and a very cheap one</li>
            <li>ive also noticed this product can leave hair feeling more dry than other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Smells like that cheap pink handsoap that is in public bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>I have highlighted (naturally an 8 lifted to a 10) blonde hair and this product really helps me keep my color from turning brassy.</li>
            <li>Too flowery and reminds me of an old lady.</li>
            <li>It has a floral-y old lady smell.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fix your hair completely, so don&#x27;t expect it to drastically change your color.</li>
            <li>It brightens the hair and the conditioner makes it soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>Smells like old lady</li>
            <li>Some reviewers complain of a old &amp;#34;lady smell,&amp;#34; I did not find that to be the case.</li>
            <li>Makes naturally gray hair shimmer</li>
            <li>The conditoner doesnt make my hair feel soft, it does the job</li>
            <li>The package came directly as stated.</li>
            <li>That way, the colour is not as intense and &#x27;blue rinse set&#x27; looking</li>
            <li>the shampoo does the job, and likely, the conditioner just adds to the risk of TOO MUCH purple..  </li>
            <li>However, I finally asked my stylist who said I was using the purple shampoo too much.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner doesn&#x27;t really condition, but I mix it with my regular and it&#x27;s gooood</li>
            <li>The only issue is that it does absolutely nothing for the texture or volume of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have red hair and use blonde highlights, but they turn brassy very fast</li>
            <li>My hair is a brassy blonde and after using this, it&#x27;s much more natural and less yellow</li>
            <li>The conditioner is not very strong, but I use it after a heavy duty one to get the good smell back.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my recently dyed blond blonde hair.</li>
            <li>main advice is to not use this and self tanner on the same day or you will look like a gray haired Oompa Loompa.</li>
            <li>it was light YELLOW blonde on roots and a darker yellow blonde on the ends.</li>
            <li>This staining may be related to the high concentration of iron in our tap water.....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this purple shampoo for removal of yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on freshly colored hair and it left me with a purple/silver tint on some of my highlights (washes away at next regular shampoo).</li>
            <li>My goal is to get white or ash blonde hair, and with this, i think i can after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>I visited a new hairstylist last year wanting caramel highlights and came out with brassy orange hair!!</li>
            <li>The purple leaked on my new blue blouse</li>
            <li>if you use to much it seems to dry the hair out.</li>
            <li>I switched back to a regular conditioner since I figured the real problem with brassiness was in the shampoo I was using</li>
            <li>I used this product per instructions only to blow dry my hair and see how much it fried my hair!</li>
            <li>mix half- half with your regular conditioner unless you hair turn golden blonde or have orange tone you can go for max power as well as it will tone them nice down to middle ash blond .&lt;br</li>
            <li>She had to deep condition her hair with another product to try to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is completely white and using Shimmer Lights is a pleasure because it cleans the hair and leaves it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two years now to help tone and maintain my natural medium-light ash blonde</li>
            <li>Makes your hair gray if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>use the product straight after bleaching to a pale yellow or white as you hair can turn purple-bluish , the hair after bleach are very absorbing ,</li>
            <li>bought this for my daughter who is a natural blonde</li>
            <li>I naturally have brown hair and have put blonde highlights throughout.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal color of pearl grey.  </li>
            <li>but it also changed the texture of my hair for the worse, making it more susceptible to tangles.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, does not make a mess in bathtub!!!</li>
            <li>About once a week is enough, and I do a quick shampoo with immediate rinse, followed by mixing the conditioner with a thicker, moisturizing conditioner and letting it sit for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I find that the conditioner by itself isn&#x27;t very moisturizing, so I mix it with other conditioners.</li>
            <li>Really high lights your blonde or grey hair.</li>
            <li>This freaked me out because it stained my light blonde hair a dull purplish and made it appear grayish until I vigorishly washed it for 2 days to get it out.</li>
            <li>have only one negative comments about what is the smell , it remind me of cheap Brazilian perfume , my hands smell 2 days after wash and wash not to mention the hair , too intensive</li>
            <li>(Try to do the first part correctly the first time because it&#x27;s really a waste of the shampoo if you mess up.)</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner works really well to tone down the brassiness in my highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li>FYI, distributor is slow, so if you want this quickly, get priority shipping.</li>
            <li>It really tones down the brassy tones!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have heard wonderful things about this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> yes it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Great product!!</li>
            <li> This is the best of the purple products!  </li>
            <li> Shimmer shampoo and conditioner are the greatest for gray hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner used to work perfectly for me, even when using it 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard from a lot of people and reviews that this is the best shampoo for graying hair that has some yellowing.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product.  </li>
            <li> The best for colored hair!</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I am very happy with this product and if you feel any hesitation with purchasing, don&#x27;t!</li>

            <li> Perfect for reducing brassyness out of brunette highlights.</li>
            <li> lol you can&#x27;t have everything !</li>
            <li> What a happy surprise!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I&#x27;ve lightened or highlighted my hair to help combat the brassiness, and it worked for that purpose, but the best thing about the shampoo and conditioner is the fact that it is purple.  </li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for my needs.</li>

            <li> Simply amazing!  </li>
            <li> I hope the scent is still pleasant this summer.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it works as described.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.</li>
            <li> Packaging was good and came on time.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good the color stays but the conditioner has alot of chemicals  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> everything else is good.</li>
            <li> Good seller.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS GOOD 2</li>
            <li> Good thing they packaged it in a bag</li>
            <li> Smells good and works well.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sooooo good</li>
            <li> Must use a good conditioner after this conditioner though.</li>
            <li> Brightened my highlights like it should so I loved it.</li>
            <li> The packaging isnt so good.</li>
            <li> but hey, better smelly beautiful hair than bald head</li>
            <li> I recommend using a really good hydrating conditioner between washes with this stuff to keep your hair happy :)</li>
            <li> Perfect and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It is purple and doesn&#x27;t have the greatest odor, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the way that looks, but it doesn&#x27;t fly at work.,</li>
            <li> this is very nice for colored blond hair and not too drying either :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Helps hair for sure!</li>
            <li> If you have lightened or bleached hair then this product is MAGIC!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and does exactly what it states on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> I had made my own toner, but this works faster and targets the hair color.</li>
            <li> Never used another kind</li>
            <li> a copper color - nice.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i really liked this product.</li>
            <li> it got here it was packaged nicely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read here and after using this shampoo and conditioner follow up with your own conditioner.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s kind of what I was going</li>
            <li> The combination has left me with wonderful hair that holds great color yet is soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> smell like fruity or nice, but the smell doesnt bother me, it does wonders on toning my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice product and recommended</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself does NOT smell like a thrift store, however it does smell like a rose candle or something of that sort.</li>
            <li> Does the job, kind of dries my hair out</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking, I don&#x27;t feel this coordinating conditioner is beneficial or needed-</li>
            <li> Just make sure to leave it on the recommended times and it works good</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> my naturally, healthy beautiful gets super stringy/tangly...</li>
            <li> I say just buy the shampoo and use your own favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for keeping my naturally silver hair from yellowing.</li>
            <li> It has an awesome fragrance and makes your hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and pleased with the shipping and safe packaging.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to be able to buy the combo package at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> Great , accurate, fast delivery !!</li>
            <li> Good product - did the trick to fix brassy hair best price together a little pricy $18</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic value!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would have prefered a more floral/fruit smell as opposed to a granny-aunty smell....</li>
            <li> Made my hair purple so be sure to rinse thoroughly...</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and I already see a difference.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo but the Conditioner needs to be a bit better</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re trying to lighten your hair more that is).</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had to recondition with some better product.</li>
            <li> and it became more gray in sections.  </li>
            <li> I love the shine these products give my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for many years and always keep a backup set so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> The bottles arrived safely with no leaking.</li>
            <li> Still love the shampoo, but will not purchase the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> Love this product for silver hair.</li>
            <li> fast shipping which was great</li>
            <li> If the conditioner were more moisturizing, I may consider giving the product five stars.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are magic.</li>
            <li> and i love the smell üòÑ</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo love it for blonde hair in the summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love this product and will continue to use it until it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner takes all brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will buy it again</li>
            <li> but ,all in all the shampoo worked ok.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li> I would give this more stars if I could.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and one more thing, after using this product don&#x27;t use acidic product like lemon or fruit based shampoos ..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair with no results and had to wash it many times to get the product out.  </li>
            <li> Thanx you very much I love it</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Me and my husband love the smell..</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product it keeps the brassiness out of my blonde hair--</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love this product and will continue using.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo and conditioner is literaly just ok.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product no hassles thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love a refund.</li>
            <li> It does pick up the purple tone of the product if used any more than that.  </li>
            <li> I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, it helps clarify my hair.</li>
            <li> It was ok</li>
            <li> Love the smell, works well.</li>
            <li> great price i would highly recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting my hair very clean</li>
            <li> Hair looks as good as the first day it got colored.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my hairdresser and makes my grey hair look great!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you mix the conditioner with a strong think conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Every bit as good as the Aveda shampoos and more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> probably best to just use one product instead of two on top of each other.</li>
            <li> The smell would probably be a turn off for most people, it has a floral grandmother scent- which I oddly enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is so much better to get yellow from beautiful gray hair.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this shampoo and conditioner available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The scent was so strong, I could not use it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it twice, but could taste the scent, it was so strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Honestly this product really does the trick on toning the brassiness out of bleached hair!</li>
            <li> In terms of toning, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used thus far and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It took the bright orange and bright yellow out of my hair and dulled them with is exactly what i needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great for toning down brassy blonde hair and smells great too!</li>
            <li> great product for using on light blonde highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> It keep my light blonde looking great...</li>
            <li> this is great for blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It was alright, didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell of the shampoo and it contained sulfates which is why I stopped using it for my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo to keep the brassy and yellow tones out.</li>
            <li> worked great for maintaining white hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great to get rid of the brassy yellow tone .</li>
            <li> Works great, even on my blue hair!</li>
            <li> Works great to get the yellow tones out of my platinum bleached hair!  </li>
            <li> I have used this once since I received it last week and have ALREADY gotten great results.  </li>
            <li> packaging was great--both bottles filled and unopened.</li>
            <li> Im asian with bleached hair and this works great.</li>
            <li> Nice product but very damaging to the hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the smell issues that some other reviewers complain about, but it leaves my hair incredibly tangled.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is ok, but I found using it that my hair was becoming very straw</li>
            <li> Buy it, it&#x27;s awesome, it definitely helped me brassy hair go normal.</li>
            <li> You really need to use a lot because it rubs out and suds very easily.</li>
            <li> Looks strange when it comes out because its purple lol</li>
            <li> Great product, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long unless you want purple hair</li>
            <li> Great for blondes and grey hair.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Great for grey hair-adds color and luster.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that you might need a very good leave in conditioner, because the hair gets very tangled.</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying (you are buying this product for what it does to clean and color-tone, not condition)</li>
            <li> Smells so clean too.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t seem to actually clean my hair, either.</li>
            <li> leaves hair very shinny and clean.. love it</li>
            <li> it is VERY purple which is a good thing if you have hard water like I do, I bought this product as a step up from my John Frieda color correcting shampoo (also a great purple shampoo not as purple but works)</li>
            <li> It turns bright red, and this saves the day every time!</li>
            <li> *  Good that she only need to use it about once a week or so</li>
            <li> And it feels nice and soft like after being at a salon.</li>
            <li> good news is the purple does seem to wash out after regular shampooing.</li>
            <li> if you go from black/dark brown to orange, you need to bleach again before this (or most toner, really)</li>
            <li> but I just use a deep conditioner after and it&#x27;s all good üòä</li>
            <li> My blonde still looks good.  </li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo and conditioner, BUT it leaves a lavender-ish tint to white hair.</li>
            <li> Good product to keep highlighted hair from looking yellow or too brassy.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price on here for it either.</li>
            <li> it gives my hair a great shine and luster, not that yellowing you get from other products.</li>
            <li> Just from the one use (of which, I didn&#x27;t leave the product on for more than a minute) my newly bleached and colored hair is lighter and brighter!</li>
            <li> Received the 2-pack quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it is the best for daily shampooing, so I use it only once a week.</li>
            <li> It is super drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, better than the last stuff I bought at the beauty shop</li>
            <li> perfect for highlighted or blonde hair that has yellowed, only use about once a week though</li>
            <li> My hair is totally white and the Shimmer Lights really keeps it looking great</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and only have to use once or maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> The best , I have dyed middle golden blonde hair , after shampoo 2 min and conditioner for 5 min</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it best to either only use it a few times per week of to mix it with a more nourishing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS GOOD 4 GREY HAIR, NOW &amp; THEN &amp;</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my hair is super blonde (not bleach orange any more!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never dealt with dry hair yet since I soak my hair in the Clairol conditioner for a good 10 mins (maybe that helps).</li>
            <li> This stuff really does brighten gray/silver hair!!</li>
            <li> my hair become light ash blonde , I tried other products without success , the hair are nice after the conditioner , so if you use your own shampoo the conditioner will be enough as the pigment is more strong than in the shampoo  </li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t really make my hair softer, but it does help with keeping my hair extra bright.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using it after freshly bleaching your hair or lightening it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been described as an &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34; and I laugh</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it tho</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it makes my hair so soft and shiny and does what it says it does and the packaging it comes incompletely protects the product</li>
            <li> Was worth a try</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really nice with my bleach blonde hair!</li>
            <li> Now quite what I had in mind, but mildly colorful.</li>
            <li> All in all, it isn&#x27;t worth it for me to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;ve been mixing Wilton&#x27;s gel icing coloring with a nice moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioner, and that has been helping me to fight brassiness while moisturizing my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> so I think this product isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> really does a great job of toning, but the shampoo is extremely drying and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and quick delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> I use the set once a week and rinse pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Good for the price compared to other products.</li>
            <li> The color added by both of these is really great and keeps my blonde cool rather than yellow.</li>
            <li> so i used this product and it took the brassy look right out</li>
            <li> right ?</li>
            <li> Right after I toned it with ash toner t9 wellas.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you time yourself with this product; But other than that it&#x27;s a great alternative to the box toner that can leave your hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> more tip: the purple will stain your bathroom if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner combo really keeps my hair nice and blonde.</li>
            <li> You can leave it in for a few more minutes during each wash for a more icy-platinum/silver look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very floral and kind of smells like generic hand soap, but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle to use daily, yet effective.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get very very coppery</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t act as much of a cleaning shampoo, but it definitely brings out my highlights and makes my hair brighter, especially right after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and does exactly what I want!</li>
            <li> n wash it out ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly like it said on a bottle .</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t use it too much!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> this is not the first time I bought from you and I will buy again sooon</li>
            <li> Just using the shampoo with any brand conditioner and any brand shampoo with the conditioner will work after you do the first step for lightening which requires both)</li>
            <li> Finally gave up and decided to have healthy glowing hair naturally with the gray to show my maturity and just enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the way my gray hair is so white and the shimmer is just all I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Love the actual product but when I received mine the shampoo had leaked all into the box.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had with it was that the longer you leave it on the more &amp;#34;grey/silver&amp;#34; my hair turned.</li>
            <li> There were times where I would leave it on for more then three minutes and parts of my hair were silver and parts were white.</li>
            <li> After first usage I got the results.</li>
            <li> I feel this helps get the most out of the product, and my hair has yet to turn a blue or purple tint.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I gather my hair into a ponytail and apply it at the tips of my hair and work my way up the hairs.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair snow white and is at a much more affordable price than if you were to get them from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> After just one wash with this I noticed a difference and after maybe 3 washes I got the exact tone I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My hair is a platinum blonde color but this seemed to turn my hair more of a purple/gray tint.</li>
            <li> my nail polish was gray from white so wear gloves .. the skin was ok .&lt;br</li>
            <li> First I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> The only fault is I wish there was an omega :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use a regular shampoo first, then I let this shampoo sit on my hair for five minutes then rinse it out and put more on for another five minutes.</li>
            <li> If you are going super light blonde from a darker hair tone, this is sort of a must have.</li>
            <li> and now I have a nice rich blonde especially on the ends where it was orangey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll use the conditioner, but overall it&#x27;s still the same great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You really know where your shampoo and conditioner is flying with this - I am now more aware with my normal shampoo and conditioner which is clear, however is ending up all over the shower walls and tub....</li>
            <li> In the end my highlights still appear yellow instead of bright white</li>
            <li> as a product used most often for blonde hair, which is usually bleached, this isn&#x27;t very good for preventing further damage.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do which is keeps blonde hair from becoming brassy and for that reason alone I would repurchase and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I will see how long I can stand it, but I might have to switch to the Aveda purple shampoo (which costs WAY more) just because I can&#x27;t get over the smell of the Clairol.</li>
            <li> As a natural brunette (recently added blonde/highlights), this does a great job of taking out any brassiness and freshening up my blonde.</li>
            <li> (I assumed this probably only happened to people who didn&#x27;t use the product correctly or clean their showers, I was right again)</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner absolutely keeps blonde hair from becoming brassy.</li>
            <li> even though I&#x27;m kind of sensitive to fragrances, I love the subtle way these products smell.</li>
            <li> As much as I love this stuff, it can really dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> It was large clumps of it.</li>
            <li> And &amp;#34;too long&amp;#34; is something you&#x27;ll personally have to experiment with, but for me, it was either way too cool or too yellow, and it only had a couple of days where it was good in between those stages.</li>
            <li> if u just use ur regular conditioner afterwards its fine.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re looking to tint your hair purple, leave it in a little longer than it says and you&#x27;ll have a nice pastel lilac.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these items they really work!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really works</li>
            <li> The conditioner...  not so much.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Works very well:  this product definitively helps prevent or get rid of brazziness, so it helps preserve my hair color.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Really, this shampoo is supposed to make your hair purple.</li>
            <li> thanks alote</li>
            <li> light blonde</li>
            <li> Really PURPLE - stains everything.  </li>
            <li> I found that this turns my light strawberry blonde hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;The conditioner is drying, and doesn&#x27;t really work to get out</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t like that about it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo a lot but the conditioner is very runny</li>
            <li> both shampoo and conditioner are very purple</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This works fabulous on my blonde hair!  </li>
            <li> but this really does work.</li>
            <li> It absolutely is.  </li>
            <li> Made hair very shinny and silver.</li>
            <li> no one wants.</li>
            <li> but a deeper consitioner is suggested and use gloves haha because my fingernails are purple now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> It really worked to help keep the color and cut out the brassiness.</li>
            <li> yes it smells and is very drying but your not buying it to strengthen your hair, you buying it to take out brassyness</li>
            <li> And the whole gagging over the smell...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the product too much.</li>
            <li> Product works really well with my hair.</li>
            <li> but instead of whitening it really makes it silvery/blue.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> and she really loves this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Problem is, it makes your hair really really damaged.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind the brassiness, but I&#x27;m trying to get my hair to a white/silver color</li>
            <li> This stuff really works to cut out a lot of brassiness in bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Both products deposit so much color</li>
            <li> Very purple formula, I don&#x27;t like this in my shower.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with it staining our white shower pan or light colored shower tiles as others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It helps remove brassiness and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> If I use both the shampoo and conditioner straight and let it sit, though, I do end up with a lavender sheen.  </li>
            <li> I was dying my hair from reddish brown to light blonde.</li>
            <li> This shampoo blends the distinctive white and darker gray hairs to a lovely, soft color.</li>
            <li> took the yellow out of my hair... made it look more natural.</li>
            <li> do agree with some of the other reviewers, it does kind of have an old lady smell to it, but that doesnt bother me much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have natural light brown hair which I recently had highlighted for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It has worked better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;ve never gotten the results from any other products like this one.</li>
            <li> Was suppose to be shampoo and conditioner, but recieved two shampoos but other than that I love this product</li>
            <li> Finally beware this shampoo/conditioner will stain so if you spill a bit in your bathtub clean it up immediately.</li>
            <li> CHEAP PRICE-- more expensive elsewhere, love this product and I would personally recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> how long you leave it on your hair as it can turn light purple (which happened to me today).</li>
            <li> I had been using John Frieda Sheer Blonde Enhancing Shampoo and Conditioner (for Darker Blondes) with good results but figured I would alternate that with purple shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This product will help cool down your blonde but dries hair out so be sure to follow with a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> It tones down the brass colors a lot and turns it more of an ash color.</li>
            <li> It is a bit odd for hair products, but not disgusting.</li>
            <li> After using, I always have multiple people ask if I got more blonde put in my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; by conditioning terms, but the color is vibrant and no brassy shades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the main flaw i found with it</li>
            <li> the top was a very yellow blonde and the ends were orange yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than a much more expensive product I purchased through a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s super duper necessary.</li>
            <li> Better than JF sheer blonde, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I found another hairstylist that came highly recommended but could not get in with her for another two weeks.</li>
            <li> This one worked really well, almost too well, because my hair is slightly purple/blue tinted now, but I honestly prefer that over the yellow I had before.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> Way less than Redken Blonde Idol and works better too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the rest of my hair goes (the parts that were just dyed, not highlighted), it has been toning out some of the brassiness, but not quite as much as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Wow this shampoo really works.</li>
            <li> I just assumed that I had used so much bleach that it was naturally frosting --- like a glacier effect.  </li>
            <li> I normally like Clairol products, however, this one replaced one problem with another.</li>
            <li> It was not the normal amount of hair shedding that normally happens when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Shimmer Lights is too harsh and drying to use more than once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth keeping my blonde from getting brassy.  </li>
            <li> actually looks pretty cool and thank goodness not did not turn my hair blue.</li>
            <li> Took off all the yellow-orange color from my patinum highlights  in only 3 uses but u can really see results from first use</li>
            <li> It might be ok for people who are naturally blonde or grey, but I need something to help moisturize my hair and defrizz because it is damaged from bleach.  </li>
            <li> So what I do is add it to normal shampoo now.  </li>
            <li> It is very drying, funny enough</li>
            <li> Normally shampoo smells don&#x27;t stick around</li>
            <li> It does brighten your blonde though, and it&#x27;s lots of fun getting purple all over the shower.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the shampoo and conditioner and leave the conditioner on a bit longer than you normally would.</li>
            <li> product is so much better than dye hair toner that damage bleached hair even more , my hair are long to my lower back bleached to dead, but soft , shiny and looks healthy and don&#x27;t break down ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but my hair is SUPER damaged by the bleachings I&#x27;ve been putting it through</li>
            <li> I have only used twice, but noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> and my hair went right back to being controllable again.  </li>
            <li> but idk if its even doing anything for my blonde peek-a-boos that aren&#x27;t the right shade..</li>
            <li> However, the side effect I am observing is that the shampoo is turning some of my hair a light purple after 45 days of use (using it every other day).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> (I live in Hawaii).  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but use a different better conditioner after because like the other reviewers have said it does dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> It has a very old lady smell to it</li>
            <li> But the smell is not unpleasant and does not linger in dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I can totally tell a difference after the first use when it comes to the the brass color.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for any blonde, real or enhanced!</li>
            <li> I like to use a deep condition afterwards, or hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> so when I get my blonde highlights this is the only shampoo that can take the brassy color out and give me back the white/silver color that I love.</li>
            <li> , however, I have to take care not to leave it on longer than it takes to shampoo and condition my hair as it will give me a &amp;#34;little old lady with purple hair&amp;#34; look!</li>
            <li> Right after the brassyness and orange is out, but not completely.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to brighten blond &amp; gray hair - it turned my white long hair a light gunmetal gray.</li>
            <li> I originally have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> The scent is unlike any other shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s not bad-</li>
            <li> my hair was in fantastic condition and then i used this product with  a deep conditioner after and my hair felt like dry string and started breaking off .</li>
            <li> Only drawback (why it&#x27;s not 5 stars) is that you have to be careful when your blonde is very light-</li>
            <li> Love that I can find this on Amazon, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner because they really works, i just hate the fragance is like an old ladys perfume and a very cheap one</li>
            <li> ive also noticed this product can leave hair feeling more dry than other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Smells like that cheap pink handsoap that is in public bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted (naturally an 8 lifted to a 10) blonde hair and this product really helps me keep my color from turning brassy.</li>
            <li> Too flowery and reminds me of an old lady.</li>
            <li> It has a floral-y old lady smell.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fix your hair completely, so don&#x27;t expect it to drastically change your color.</li>
            <li> It brightens the hair and the conditioner makes it soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> Smells like old lady</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complain of a old &amp;#34;lady smell,&amp;#34; I did not find that to be the case.</li>
            <li> Makes naturally gray hair shimmer</li>
            <li> The conditoner doesnt make my hair feel soft, it does the job</li>
            <li> The package came directly as stated.</li>
            <li> That way, the colour is not as intense and &#x27;blue rinse set&#x27; looking</li>
            <li> the shampoo does the job, and likely, the conditioner just adds to the risk of TOO MUCH purple..  </li>
            <li> However, I finally asked my stylist who said I was using the purple shampoo too much.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner doesn&#x27;t really condition, but I mix it with my regular and it&#x27;s gooood</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it does absolutely nothing for the texture or volume of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have red hair and use blonde highlights, but they turn brassy very fast</li>
            <li> My hair is a brassy blonde and after using this, it&#x27;s much more natural and less yellow</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not very strong, but I use it after a heavy duty one to get the good smell back.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my recently dyed blond blonde hair.</li>
            <li> main advice is to not use this and self tanner on the same day or you will look like a gray haired Oompa Loompa.</li>
            <li> it was light YELLOW blonde on roots and a darker yellow blonde on the ends.</li>
            <li> This staining may be related to the high concentration of iron in our tap water.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this purple shampoo for removal of yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on freshly colored hair and it left me with a purple/silver tint on some of my highlights (washes away at next regular shampoo).</li>
            <li> My goal is to get white or ash blonde hair, and with this, i think i can after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I visited a new hairstylist last year wanting caramel highlights and came out with brassy orange hair!!</li>
            <li> The purple leaked on my new blue blouse</li>
            <li> if you use to much it seems to dry the hair out.</li>
            <li> I switched back to a regular conditioner since I figured the real problem with brassiness was in the shampoo I was using</li>
            <li> I used this product per instructions only to blow dry my hair and see how much it fried my hair!</li>
            <li> mix half- half with your regular conditioner unless you hair turn golden blonde or have orange tone you can go for max power as well as it will tone them nice down to middle ash blond .&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had to deep condition her hair with another product to try to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is completely white and using Shimmer Lights is a pleasure because it cleans the hair and leaves it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years now to help tone and maintain my natural medium-light ash blonde</li>
            <li> Makes your hair gray if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> use the product straight after bleaching to a pale yellow or white as you hair can turn purple-bluish , the hair after bleach are very absorbing ,</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who is a natural blonde</li>
            <li> I naturally have brown hair and have put blonde highlights throughout.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal color of pearl grey.  </li>
            <li> but it also changed the texture of my hair for the worse, making it more susceptible to tangles.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does not make a mess in bathtub!!!</li>
            <li> About once a week is enough, and I do a quick shampoo with immediate rinse, followed by mixing the conditioner with a thicker, moisturizing conditioner and letting it sit for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I find that the conditioner by itself isn&#x27;t very moisturizing, so I mix it with other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Really high lights your blonde or grey hair.</li>
            <li> This freaked me out because it stained my light blonde hair a dull purplish and made it appear grayish until I vigorishly washed it for 2 days to get it out.</li>
            <li> have only one negative comments about what is the smell , it remind me of cheap Brazilian perfume , my hands smell 2 days after wash and wash not to mention the hair , too intensive</li>
            <li> (Try to do the first part correctly the first time because it&#x27;s really a waste of the shampoo if you mess up.)</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner works really well to tone down the brassiness in my highlighted hair.  </li>
            <li> FYI, distributor is slow, so if you want this quickly, get priority shipping.</li>
            <li> It really tones down the brassy tones!</li>
            <li> I find this does remove yellow and tone blonde hair, but it does so very unevenly - leaving streaks of a darker gray and streaks of untouched yellow in your hair, even if you follow the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell by any means, maybe a little musky and heavy.. but not necessarily unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of natural red in my dark blonde hair and dye it</li>
            <li> I was hoping to take a bit of the yellow out of the bottom of my long hair - trying to find a compromise to NOT turning my white hair gray and yet taking some of the yellow out - haven&#x27;t figured it out yet.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to be careful with hair that&#x27;s been lifted to near white, as it does produce a grey or bluish tone to the hair if left on too long, or used too often.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does dry out my hair a lot more than other products that I&#x27;ve used, so I rotate using this with L&#x27;oreal total repair extreme repair mask and conditioner.</li>
            <li> only downfall is if you leave in for too long and don&#x27;t rinse out well enough, you will end up with a blueish tint to your hair.</li>
            <li> The yellow in my salt and pepper is definitely lighter but not completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is it will turn your hair purple gray if left on too long.</li>
            <li> Using this helped the color tone down to a pretty color that looked natural rather than a faded dull red.</li>
            <li> to &amp;#34;you look so honey colored!&amp;#34; My natural hair color is one shade above black and it was lightened quite a bit, so I avoided any chemical toners.</li>
            <li> not sure if I really like it or not yet.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not nearly moisturizing enough for color treated hair though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave the bleach on my hair quite long enough when I was lightening it and ended up looking yellowish.  </li>
            <li> it turned my blonde hair grey and the people I went</li>
            <li> Warning, if you leave it on for too long your hair will start to look greyish white.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that long after my last highlight</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle but pretty old lady like.</li>
            <li> Since the conditoner is pretty lightweight, I also apply just the Shimmer Lights conditioner to my roots, I don&#x27;t mix it with other conditioners because it will drag the roots down and cause my hair to be flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does the job of making my girlfriends hair less brassy, but the smell is nearly intolerable.  </li>
            <li> I end up putting on a second conditioner every time I shower, because if I just use the shimmer lights conditioner, my hair is dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It left my hair really dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> BUT... I feel like it really left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to perfume and my nose is not overly sensitive, but wow... THIS stuff really, really smells strong and very bad!  </li>
            <li> The caps were not secure, but the spill was minimal, and contained in the bubble wrap they packaged it in, so all i really needed to do was rinse the bottles off and toss the packaging.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars-I gave it 4-is due to a personal opinion: to me, it smells like my grandmother!</li>
            <li> However, it is very drying and smells like my grandmas potpourri which for me is negative.</li>
            <li> Do not use Conditioner and let it sit on your hair too long</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it in too long or you&#x27;ll have purple hair</li>
            <li> I started highlighting my hair once a month for 4 months but it was taking to long</li>
            <li> it will turn it old-lady purple if you leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> My hair has stayed blonder longer and the grey has blended in.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as I am bleaching.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and open over a sink or something when the package arrives.</li>
            <li> I dyed the bottom of my hair grey, and this product does help preserve the color a little bit, however I know that to keep this hair color I need to go back to the salon regularly.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and my regular shampoo and conditioner on the other days.</li>
            <li> Makes the grey darker and the silver brighter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around for a long time and it seems there is a reason for that!</li>
            <li> The shampoo actually lathers, unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave on too long, as hair may take on a purple hue!</li>
            <li> The other the cap was open, and stating to ooze out.</li>
            <li> I alternate this with my other shampoo set, and probably use this one 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you don&#x27;t leave it on very long.</li>
            <li> I have highlights and it leaves my hair dry and tangled</li>
            <li> YES it can make bleached/damaged hair feel dry on the ends even with matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my hair feel so dry, and when I get out- my hair is all tangled.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t let it dry on anything, but the staining of the shower has not been a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown asian hair so this keeps the brass out of my highlights</li>
            <li> helps tone down the brassiness but will not actually tone the hair or change the color.</li>
            <li> I am a natural brunette and my hair picks up reds/yellows like crazy, no matter how ashy blonde my stylist tries to go with my hair, or how much toner she puts on it.</li>
            <li> I have very pale grey hair with lots of white also, and this shampoo and conditioner have cured me of the oxidized, brassy yellow color my hair was taking on.</li>
            <li> the shampoo feels less dyring than the conditioner, so I try not to use them both at the same time</li>
            <li> I personally just think the shampoo leaves my hair a little too dry.</li>
            <li> But I do think my hair is a little less soft after using.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to these products is that they dry out your hair, so if you notice your hair dried out or breaking, I recommend using a hydrating shampoo to go along with this.</li>
            <li> I find that combing/brushing my hair prior to washing helps a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and have silver Hair with little or no yellowing</li>
            <li> Trying less time, only using one or the other.</li>
            <li> But with healthy hair it wouldnt hurt it at all, just the bad over processed ends it might.</li>
            <li> be careful how often you use it and</li>
            <li> Have to be careful to rinse the shower well, as it will stain.</li>
            <li> and my hair wasn&#x27;t silky afterwards when attempting to comb it out wet.  </li>
            <li> and I got my package sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does not really help to soften it either.</li>
            <li> It arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job like I expected .</li>
            <li> Be careful though...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m brushing a wet dog when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The scent is not very pleasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> like, but if it&#x27;s not used daily it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I stopped dying my hair for 9+ months since my roots weren&#x27;t too terrible they kind of blended since my natural hair is now a dark dark ash blonde.</li>
            <li> As far as conditioning goes, I find my hair to be extremely knotted and hard to get a wide tooth comb through after using these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than cheap perfume, and it lingers for a long time, which makes the stink even worse.  </li>
            <li> Smells kinda bad, and doesn&#x27;t lather at all, but if being a true blonde is your biggest worry</li>
            <li> The other \\&quot;blue\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried do not work at all as well as this does, and</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t find that it helps much, it barely took out the brassiness and that&#x27;s after leaving it on for at least 5 minutes and doing it again.</li>
            <li> so I use this twice a week, and on other days use the Matrix Biolage Colorlast Shampoo/Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also, the conditioner is not moisturizing at all, as noted in some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one works the quickest.  </li>
            <li> I use this as my shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Other people complain of it drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind, but other people might.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was a treatment you should use between other shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I chose this after reading reviews on Amazon and other site.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner on the other hand does not add moisture to your hair.</li>
            <li> So the these dry out my hair pretty bad and it has yet to get rid of any of the bronzieness blonde</li>
            <li> This dries out my hair and smells really strong and bad, but it helps with the color.</li>
            <li> it will make the hair less pretty and hard to manage , I read that the pigment can react with high acidic chemicals in bad way</li>
            <li> instructions say to only keep on hair for 3-5 minutes, but I usually leave the shampoo on for 15-20 minutes and the conditioner on anywhere between 30 minutes and a few hours.</li>
            <li> : I have been dying my hair dark brown for years.</li>
            <li> and it was still really dark and verrrry orange and brassy on the ends.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair</li>
            <li> When I got them, one bottle was broken completely, and leaked all over the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go blonde but do it slowly so my hair wouldn&#x27;t be damaged.</li>
            <li> While it did not take away all of the orange it did take away the brassiness and toned down the orange a bit</li>
            <li> however, it does tone down brass/yellow/orange in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> And forget ten dollars s&amp;h for two small shampoo bottles!</li>
            <li> Every product I have ordered was a waste of money until I went to Amazon site and read all the reviews of this and other products.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t use this stuff everyday due to the smell.</li>
            <li> and once the color started fading it was an odd color</li>
            <li> It does have a chemical salon smell, not a flowery smell like typical retail shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in a less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> My highlights are less brassy.</li>
            <li> but it does have a slight smell that I do not like.</li>
            <li> (As in, putting it on myhair and sleeping with it on) I have noticed that is has toned down the brassiness a little.</li>
            <li> In fact, it was a mess.  </li>
            <li> It was a mess</li>
            <li> My daughter washed her hair with these product and the result was dry, damaged, and dull.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The color is a little intimidating for those who have not used purple shampoos before, but it worked well.</li>
            <li> My hair has some lighter blonde highlights in it from previous attempts to go ashy blonde, and those have picked up the silver/ashy tones like CRAZY after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> A little messy to use.</li>
            <li> After I used the products color became cold and really blond.</li>
            <li> it dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I threw it out after a few washes.  </li>
            <li> about 45% of the bottle is missing .</li>
            <li> I decided to give this silver shampoo/conditioner a try upon her recommendation, and several frustrating visits to the salon and not getting the tone I was wanting.</li>
            <li> Leave on a few minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li> I still ahve some product in both bottles after 2 months of washing my waste length hair with this every 3 days</li>
            <li> It is money I cannot afford to waste.  </li>
            <li> It is very silly to require a certain number of words</li>
            <li> This has really helped tone down all the brassiness my hair encountered after a bad trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> seriously , if Clairol changed the smell it would be number one stuff, but due to the smell of the pigment it is hard to mask with other perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it STINKS to high heaven.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my thin gray hair for a long time and Clairol Shimmer Lights met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> But now after a few washes my hair is the color I want, no more orange or brassiness.</li>
            <li> have blonde hair and left the shampoo in for less than 5 minutes and had grey/silver streaks after the shower :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel so bad about the at home bleaching incident anymore,  thanks to Shimmer Lights.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the crazy itchy scalp it left me with!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Joico in the past and it worked well, however this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t like shampoo smells.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula or if my hair is changing over the years.</li>
            <li> It almost looks gray, which sounds not appealing (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> only 2 shampoos double packaged ,disappointed about that</li>
            <li> No more brass.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere here in this small town for this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it would change to a yellow tone over time.  </li>
            <li> Still though, i was not pleased that it leaked at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I have natural black hair and got an ash blonde balayage, and desperately needed some purple shampoo to keep this expensive work in!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they both smell like hotel soap and leave my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> like and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> However, the conditioner leaves my hair tangled and hard to comb through, so use a leave-in  conditioner</li>
            <li> It is watery and hardly conditions at all.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and saw that some people complained about the smell.  </li>
            <li> It just appeared thick.</li>
            <li> She suggested this product in the mean time.</li>
            <li> No more brassiness!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other purple products including a very expensive conditioner and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> When i got it i was expecting it to be very thick and hard to work through hair, but it wasn&#x27;t that thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair from redhead to platinum, and it would be impossible to get the yellow tone out without this!</li>
            <li> turned my brassy blond into subtle highlights.</li>
            <li> ridiculous.</li>
            <li> seriously Clairol, please change the scent.</li>
            <li> In addition, it smells awful and took 3 days of a deep conditioner, me not using any product or tools just to get it back to manageble.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a little expensive for me, I&#x27;m trying to save money.</li>
            <li> i find not good at all again to me.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair myself after a disastrous trip to a salon left me with fried hair that started falling out and a blustery burn on my head.</li>
            <li> but the price is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not revolting but not really pleasant either.  </li>
            <li> But it also dulls the shine and smells unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is not very impressive, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to condition at all.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> Not happy with the shipping on these.</li>
            <li> it didnt appear to be broken (it wasnt broken)</li>
            <li> My shampoo came with a broken bottle cap.</li>
            <li> Yes it does what it says but hair gets so tangled, it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Seriously, the smell lingers!</li>
            <li> Since I wasn&#x27;t looking for nor was going to get a dramatic effect</li>
            <li> (I assumed people were being dramatic, and</li>
            <li> It makes a dramatic difference in the brightness and whiteness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product has been a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> If you ladies are tired of spending money at the salon, just get one of those!</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this one does.  </li>
            <li> , feels very tough.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34; because neither my late mom or late grandmothers ever smelled this awful.  </li>
            <li> this STINKS like all day I smelled like a thrift store or something.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say it just does its job!</li>
            <li> Weird smell and made my hair feel like straw!  </li>
            <li> but it does have an unpleasant odor that lingers in your hair.</li>
            <li> Since turning gray I have battled with myself on coloring which of course is almost impossible with gray hair.  </li>
            <li> It dries out my hair so bad.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it made my hair shed really bad.</li>
            <li> And the smell is not that bad like others are saying.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Despite the reviews on here, the shampoo and conditioner do not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> When I was reading the reviews I was kinda of scared to get it because they said it smelled bad..</li>
            <li> The bad part is the shampoo, it doesnt foam up with soap suds</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> However, I HATE the smell.  </li>
            <li> After a while the smell is a bit annoying and also the lack of softness in the shampoo and conditioner is also not satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It does help brassines, however, it dries the crap out of your hair..</li>
            <li> But I hated this product...</li>
            <li> my hair has a tendency to turn horribly brassy.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo/condition is truly awful.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, I threw it away after 1 use</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair color did not changeüòç works perfectly</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner absolutely keeps blonde hair from becoming brassy. be careful how often you use it and how long you leave it on your hair as it can turn light purple (which happened to me today). As far as conditioning goes, I find my hair to be extremely knotted and hard to get a wide tooth comb through after using these products. I find that combing/brushing my hair prior to washing helps a little. It does what it claims to do which is keeps blonde hair from becoming brassy and for that reason alone I would repurchase and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have only used twice, but noticed the difference right away.  turned my brassy,yellow,gray hair a lighter silvery-Blondie.  I am liking this a lot.  Have to be careful to rinse the shower well, as it will stain. Very satisfied and only have to use once or maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping. Really works</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo.  I have red hair and use blonde highlights, but they turn brassy very fast and then I think I look like Ronald McDonald.  The shampoo seems to keep the blonde highlights from turning.  The conditioner is ok, but I found using it that my hair was becoming very straw like and hard to manage.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like regular conditioner when using it and my hair wasn&#x27;t silky afterwards when attempting to comb it out wet.  In fact, it was a mess.  I switched back to a regular conditioner since I figured the real problem with brassiness was in the shampoo I was using and my hair went right back to being controllable again.  The shampoo I would recommend.  The conditioner...  not so much.</li>
            <li> this is great for blonde hair. It got rid of all the brassy color. The service was great and I got my package sooner than expected. Great service.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo. But the conditioner doesn&#x27;t detangle hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for Blondes and Grays.</li>
            <li> does tone out brassiness and help tone blonde. smells like granny though.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clairol Shimmer Lights for over 2 months. I bought this product to remove the yellow tint from my gray hair. However, the side effect I am observing is that the shampoo is turning some of my hair a light purple after 45 days of use (using it every other day). As a result I have stopped using the product and am trying to find another shampoo that will get the yellow (and purple tint) out of gray hair. I normally like Clairol products, however, this one replaced one problem with another.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and my regular shampoo and conditioner on the other days. Otherwise it is too drying.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever. I even used it as a toner out a ton in leave it sit a couple hours watch a movie n wash it out ;)</li>
            <li> Works great for toning down brassy blonde hair and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is now blonde again not orange from my water. Really works.</li>
            <li> It was alright, didn&#x27;t enjoy the smell of the shampoo and it contained sulfates which is why I stopped using it for my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. Works perfect. Exactly like it said on a bottle . Packaging was good and came on time. If you ladies are tired of spending money at the salon, just get one of those!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to be able to buy the combo package at such a great price.  This is a fantastic value!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve dyed my hair from redhead to platinum, and it would be impossible to get the yellow tone out without this!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good the color stays but the conditioner has alot of chemicals  i find not good at all again to me.</li>
            <li> Does change the shimmer of your hair. I had my hair died red (im blond) and once the color started fading it was an odd color but i wanted to go back to blond without bleach. Using this helped the color tone down to a pretty color that looked natural rather than a faded dull red. Good product. Looks strange when it comes out because its purple lol but it basically takes the brassiness out of the hair color. Works great.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived cracked and leaking.  My daughter washed her hair with these product and the result was dry, damaged, and dull. She had to deep condition her hair with another product to try to get it fixed.  I do not recommend anyone wasting their money or sacrificing their hair on this product.</li>
            <li> I have very pale grey hair with lots of white also, and this shampoo and conditioner have cured me of the oxidized, brassy yellow color my hair was taking on. My hair stylist suggested that between sun exposure and heat styling products, the yellow would persist, and it did, until I started using Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights. The other \\&quot;blue\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried do not work at all as well as this does, and even though I&#x27;m kind of sensitive to fragrances, I love the subtle way these products smell.</li>
            <li> Makes the grey darker and the silver brighter! I had made my own toner, but this works faster and targets the hair color.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It has a slightly different smell, but I even like that.</li>
            <li> Works very well:  this product definitively helps prevent or get rid of brazziness, so it helps preserve my hair color. This is a good one!  It&#x27;s been around for a long time and it seems there is a reason for that! I use it every 3 shampoo and I also use Purify by l&#x27;oreal every 4 shampoo. The rest of the time, I use Biolage for colored hair.The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars-I gave it 4-is due to a personal opinion: to me, it smells like my grandmother! I would have prefered a more floral/fruit smell as opposed to a granny-aunty smell....but the price is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> This does the job of making my girlfriends hair less brassy, but the smell is nearly intolerable.  Smells like that cheap pink handsoap that is in public bathrooms.  *shudder*  Good that she only need to use it about once a week or so (otherwise the super-light parts of her hair turn purplish/bluish).  Never used another kind so don&#x27;t know if all purple shampoo/conditioners smell that way, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo to keep the brassy and yellow tones out. I have natural black hair and got an ash blonde balayage, and desperately needed some purple shampoo to keep this expensive work in! Needless to say it just does its job! Hair looks as good as the first day it got colored.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo but don&#x27;t use it too much!</li>
            <li> Made my hair purple so be sure to rinse thoroughly... probably best to just use one product instead of two on top of each other.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner because they really works, i just hate the fragance is like an old ladys perfume and a very cheap one lol everything else is good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t really make my hair softer, but it does help with keeping my hair extra bright. I have the conditioner now but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again though. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. Love that I can find this on Amazon, hard to find in stores. FYI, distributor is slow, so if you want this quickly, get priority shipping.</li>
            <li> This has really helped tone down all the brassiness my hair encountered after a bad trip to the salon. The smell is lovely and I already see a difference.</li>
            <li> Oh my god...this stuff is amazing!! As a bottled platinum, this is a must to maintain your hair. Also, if you&#x27;re looking to tint your hair purple, leave it in a little longer than it says and you&#x27;ll have a nice pastel lilac.</li>
            <li> Good seller.But I hated this product...it dried my hair out.I threw it out after a few washes.  Bummed.</li>
            <li> Brassy hair be gone! This shampoo and conditioner combo really keeps my hair nice and blonde. The shampoo actually lathers, unlike other brands. It doesn&#x27;t seem too great though... Too flowery and reminds me of an old lady. Does the job though!</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner works really well to tone down the brassiness in my highlighted hair.  However, I HATE the smell.  It has a floral-y old lady smell.  Some people might not mind it, but I think it smells gross.  I will see how long I can stand it, but I might have to switch to the Aveda purple shampoo (which costs WAY more) just because I can&#x27;t get over the smell of the Clairol.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS GOOD 4 GREY HAIR, NOW &amp; THEN &amp; THE PRICE IS GOOD 2</li>
            <li> I personally just think the shampoo leaves my hair a little too dry. The conditioner does not really help to soften it either.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo but the Conditioner needs to be a bit better</li>
            <li> leaves hair very shinny and clean.. love it</li>
            <li> i have only used the shampoo. i don&#x27;t find that it helps much, it barely took out the brassiness and that&#x27;s after leaving it on for at least 5 minutes and doing it again. It dries out my hair so bad. my hair was in fantastic condition and then i used this product with  a deep conditioner after and my hair felt like dry string and started breaking off . i have used it on several occasions , but not anymore. i will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> ARGH! My hair is purple! No no, just kidding. It&#x27;s supposed to do that. Really, this shampoo is supposed to make your hair purple.</li>
            <li> Save money and forget spending $$$ at the salon to get your hair toned! I have dark brown asian hair so this keeps the brass out of my highlights and I can maintain a great, ashy-blonde look. You can leave it in for a few more minutes during each wash for a more icy-platinum/silver look. It is a bit drying (you are buying this product for what it does to clean and color-tone, not condition) so I use this twice a week, and on other days use the Matrix Biolage Colorlast Shampoo/Conditioner. Sometimes I pair this conditioner with the Macadamia hair mask for extra moisture!</li>
            <li> thanks alote this is not the first time I bought from you and I will buy again sooon</li>
            <li> I have heard wonderful things about this shampoo and conditioner. I personally did not like it at all yes it smells wonderful and it did lighten up my highlights. The problem is that it made my hair shed really bad. It was not the normal amount of hair shedding that normally happens when you wash your hair. It was large clumps of it. My mother used it and it worked for her so I guess its just one of those things that just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great , accurate, fast delivery !!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this. I dye my hair myself after a disastrous trip to a salon left me with fried hair that started falling out and a blustery burn on my head. I have a lot of natural red in my dark blonde hair and dye it light blonde every 4-6 weeks. It turns bright red, and this saves the day every time! I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Really PURPLE - stains everything.  You really know where your shampoo and conditioner is flying with this - I am now more aware with my normal shampoo and conditioner which is clear, however is ending up all over the shower walls and tub.... somewhat drying as well.  I found that this turns my light strawberry blonde hair a copper color - nice.</li>
            <li> When i got it i was expecting it to be very thick and hard to work through hair, but it wasn&#x27;t that thick. It just appeared thick. If you&#x27;re using it after freshly bleaching your hair or lightening it id recommend applying globs of it to your hair before you get in the shower while looking into a mirror(If you&#x27;re trying to lighten your hair more that is). You really need to use a lot because it rubs out and suds very easily. Leave it in your hair for 10-12 minutes then wash it out. Use once a week as if its regular shampoo after that. (Try to do the first part correctly the first time because it&#x27;s really a waste of the shampoo if you mess up.) (ALSO NOTE: You do not need to use both at the same time. Just using the shampoo with any brand conditioner and any brand shampoo with the conditioner will work after you do the first step for lightening which requires both)</li>
            <li> I like that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t turn my hair yellow, but it&#x27;s not as glossy looking as I&#x27;d like. I was expecting it to feel smoother than it does. Sorry.</li>
            <li> It did help keep my hair blonder but it&#x27;s not worth the crazy itchy scalp it left me with! Its totally drying to my skin so I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s actually doing to my hair</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo. It got a ton of my yellow out (I&#x27;m bleach blond) after only one shampoo. The conditioner helped with that too, but it was not moisturizing at all. I had to recondition with some better product. I say just buy the shampoo and use your own favorite conditioner. And the smell is not that bad like others are saying. It is a bit odd for hair products, but not disgusting.</li>
            <li> worked great for maintaining white hair. it felt like the shampoo was all you needed</li>
            <li> Tried for years to highlight....lowlight...color my hair as I age and it became more gray in sections.  Finally gave up and decided to have healthy glowing hair naturally with the gray to show my maturity and just enjoy it.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I visited a new hairstylist last year wanting caramel highlights and came out with brassy orange hair!! I did not know what to do. I found another hairstylist that came highly recommended but could not get in with her for another two weeks. She suggested this product in the mean time. While it did not take away all of the orange it did take away the brassiness and toned down the orange a bit so I could manage for the next two weeks. This product was a life saver from embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> this is very nice for colored blond hair and not too drying either :) great price i would highly recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> I love the shine these products give my hair.  I&#x27;ve used them for many years and always keep a backup set so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> It definitely works to tone out the brass in your hair. It won&#x27;t fix your hair completely, so don&#x27;t expect it to drastically change your color. however, it does tone down brass/yellow/orange in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only problem is that it leaves a noticeable smell in your hair that lingers for days. It&#x27;s not a bad smell by any means, maybe a little musky and heavy.. but not necessarily unbearable. It&#x27;s been described as an &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34; and I laugh but it&#x27;s kind of true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is drying, and doesn&#x27;t really work to get out tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using the shampoo and conditioner, and then conditioning your hair AGAIN with a separate brand conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly! After using, I always have multiple people ask if I got more blonde put in my hair. As a natural brunette (recently added blonde/highlights), this does a great job of taking out any brassiness and freshening up my blonde.</li>
            <li> Great product, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long unless you want purple hair</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the way my gray hair is so white and the shimmer is just all I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Great product!! It arrived before expected. I can totally tell a difference after the first use when it comes to the the brass color. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. And it feels nice and soft like after being at a salon.</li>
            <li> I have well water at my house. Even with a water softener my silver gray hair was picking up a yellowish color.  This shampoo works great to get rid of the brassy yellow tone . Shimmer Lights is too harsh and drying to use more than once or twice a week.  I rotate with my regular shampoo about every third time I wash my hair.  It does have a chemical salon smell, not a flowery smell like typical retail shampoos.  But the smell is not unpleasant and does not linger in dry hair.  I am very pleased with this product and pleased with the shipping and safe packaging.  The bottles arrived safely with no leaking.</li>
            <li> i really liked this product. read alot of reviews about it and thought i would try it out. my hair was box dyed and then i got highlights and they weren&#x27;t the color i wanted because of the box dye. so i used this product and it took the brassy look right out</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo and conditioner set for my blonde hair and well it did it&#x27;s job like I expected . It has a very old lady smell to it so I really don&#x27;t like that about it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it got here it was packaged nicely but it was leaking , so about 45% of the bottle is missing . Good thing they packaged it in a bag so it didn&#x27;t ruin anything in the box .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Joico in the past and it worked well, however this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair feel like straw. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo forever, this time I tried the conditioner also. The conditioner is not very impressive, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to condition at all. Still love the shampoo, but will not purchase the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> helps tone down the brassiness but will not actually tone the hair or change the color. Not bad, but use a different better conditioner after because like the other reviewers have said it does dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo a lot but the conditioner is very runny so it splatters purple all over the shower walls and curtain.  This duo does what it says by removing the brassy tones from blonde hair.  Be careful though...I&#x27;ve used it on freshly colored hair and it left me with a purple/silver tint on some of my highlights (washes away at next regular shampoo).</li>
            <li> great product for using on light blonde highlighted hair. it has stripped out any brassy colors. only downfall is if you leave in for too long and don&#x27;t rinse out well enough, you will end up with a blueish tint to your hair. ive also noticed this product can leave hair feeling more dry than other shampoos and conditioners. a deep conditioning treatment once or twice a week would benefit</li>
            <li> This is the best of the purple products!  Smells good and works well.</li>
            <li> Love the actual product but when I received mine the shampoo had leaked all into the box. It was a mess</li>
            <li> Arrive on time. Big savings</li>
            <li> Shampoo is good.  Do not use Conditioner and let it sit on your hair too long it turns to a bluish color.</li>
            <li> Great for blondes and grey hair.  Love the smell and I usually don&#x27;t like shampoo smells.  The conditioner is not very strong, but I use it after a heavy duty one to get the good smell back.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and saw that some people complained about the smell.  I am not allergic to perfume and my nose is not overly sensitive, but wow... THIS stuff really, really smells strong and very bad!  It&#x27;s worse than cheap perfume, and it lingers for a long time, which makes the stink even worse.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell -- it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34; because neither my late mom or late grandmothers ever smelled this awful.  Trust me, I would have remembered the stink forever!  Having said this... both shampoo and conditioner are very purple but yes, they do what they are supposed to do.  I have natural light brown hair which I recently had highlighted for the first time.  I was warned that I needed purple shampoo, etc. to keep the highlights from going brassy/yellow, etc.  I had been using John Frieda Sheer Blonde Enhancing Shampoo and Conditioner (for Darker Blondes) with good results but figured I would alternate that with purple shampoo.  So, there you have it -- this stuff does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it STINKS to high heaven.  :(</li>
            <li> Shimmer shampoo and conditioner are the greatest for gray hair.  My hair is completely white and using Shimmer Lights is a pleasure because it cleans the hair and leaves it soft and shiny.  There is no yellow and even though the shampoo and conditioner are purple, there is no purple residue.  It is recommended that the products be used only once a month.</li>
            <li> The scent was so strong, I could not use it.  I tried it twice, but could taste the scent, it was so strong.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Shimmer Lights shampoo for years when I highlight my hair. I am not a fan of the smell but it&#x27;s worth keeping my blonde from getting brassy.  The conditioner is not nearly moisturizing enough for color treated hair though.</li>
            <li> Love this product for silver hair. It brightens the hair and the conditioner makes it soft &amp; silky. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, helps the brassiness go away but i don&#x27;t really like the smell. Smells like old lady but if you use it with another product then it helps. I have highlights and it leaves my hair dry and tangled so i use a moisturizing conditioner or leave in conditioner after i use this.</li>
            <li> This works fabulous on my blonde hair!  Smells so clean too.  The conditioner isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; by conditioning terms, but the color is vibrant and no brassy shades.</li>
            <li> fast shipping which was great&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair and left the shampoo in for less than 5 minutes and had grey/silver streaks after the shower :(</li>
            <li> The smell is not so great it&#x27;s very floral and kind of smells like generic hand soap, but if u just use ur regular conditioner afterwards its fine. My hair tends to get very very coppery but this really does work. It tones down the brass colors a lot and turns it more of an ash color. I use it every time I wash my hair. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the smell. Definitely worth it tho</li>
            <li> Honestly this product really does the trick on toning the brassiness out of bleached hair! The only issue I had with it was that the longer you leave it on the more &amp;#34;grey/silver&amp;#34; my hair turned. There were times where I would leave it on for more then three minutes and parts of my hair were silver and parts were white. Just make sure you time yourself with this product; But other than that it&#x27;s a great alternative to the box toner that can leave your hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and have silver Hair with little or no yellowing but I thought I would give it a try on a whim. Since I wasn&#x27;t looking for nor was going to get a dramatic effect I&#x27;m please with the result. Hair is brighter actually looks pretty cool and thank goodness not did not turn my hair blue. Some reviewers complain of a old &amp;#34;lady smell,&amp;#34; I did not find that to be the case. But I do think my hair is a little less soft after using. I would take another&#x27;s advise I&#x27;ve read here and after using this shampoo and conditioner follow up with your own conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula or if my hair is changing over the years. This shampoo and conditioner used to work perfectly for me, even when using it 3 times a week. Now, after one use, it turns the lightest blonde parts of my hair purple. Once I run out of these I&#x27;ll be looking for something that won&#x27;t stain my hair after one washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is the purple does seem to wash out after regular shampooing.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of any ashy look from hair dye</li>
            <li> I am a natural brunette and my hair picks up reds/yellows like crazy, no matter how ashy blonde my stylist tries to go with my hair, or how much toner she puts on it. I decided to give this silver shampoo/conditioner a try upon her recommendation, and several frustrating visits to the salon and not getting the tone I was wanting. My hair has some lighter blonde highlights in it from previous attempts to go ashy blonde, and those have picked up the silver/ashy tones like CRAZY after using this shampoo and conditioner. It almost looks gray, which sounds not appealing (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s) but that&#x27;s kind of what I was going for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the rest of my hair goes (the parts that were just dyed, not highlighted), it has been toning out some of the brassiness, but not quite as much as I had hoped for. I use both the shampoo and conditioner every day for the last 3 weeks, and am hoping it continues to tone out my yellows and reds. Also, the conditioner is not moisturizing at all, as noted in some other reviews. I end up putting on a second conditioner every time I shower, because if I just use the shimmer lights conditioner, my hair is dry and frizzy. If the conditioner were more moisturizing, I may consider giving the product five stars.</li>
            <li> This dries out my hair and smells really strong and bad, but it helps with the color. Just don&#x27;t leave it in too long or you&#x27;ll have purple hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard from a lot of people and reviews that this is the best shampoo for graying hair that has some yellowing.  It absolutely is.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one works the quickest.  You don&#x27;t have to use it every day-once the yellowing has turned to silver or white, you can use it once a week.  Also conditions your hair so it has body and shine.  Excellent product.  It is purple and doesn&#x27;t have the greatest odor, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works great. Removed the brass color in my gray hair. Made hair very shinny and silver. Conditioner works just as well. Made my gray hair fuller looking and softer.</li>
            <li> Works great, even on my blue hair!</li>
            <li> Makes naturally gray hair shimmer</li>
            <li> The hubs has been using this for a couple of months, not every day, probably a couple of times a week. Can&#x27;t see any improvement. Will go ahead and use the entire bottle but if we don&#x27;t see any improvement after that, likely not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are magic. After first usage I got the results. My hair looked yellowish after dying. After I used the products color became cold and really blond. Highly recommend these items they really work!</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair very dry and frizzy. I have used it twice and that&#x27;s it! Out it goes. It also did nothing for the yellow in my gray hair. Oh well, on to something else...</li>
            <li> The best for colored hair!</li>
            <li> turned my brassy blond into subtle highlights. definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing!  Took off all the yellow-orange color from my patinum highlights  in only 3 uses but u can really see results from first use and i love the smell üòÑ</li>
            <li> So the these dry out my hair pretty bad and it has yet to get rid of any of the bronzieness blonde no one wants. it smells alright but idk if its even doing anything for my blonde peek-a-boos that aren&#x27;t the right shade..</li>
            <li> Do i bleach again if my hair is orange yellow and then put the shimmer purple shampoo or can i use the purple shampoo now i bleached my hair 2 weeks ago?</li>
            <li> Have had my hair highlighted and low-lighted for years and these products stop my hair color from looking brassy, reddish or too yellow. Every bit as good as the Aveda shampoos and more reasonably priced. I use this as my shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> if you have gray or blond hair this is a great product. it&#x27;s gentle to use daily, yet effective. it gives my hair a great shine and luster, not that yellowing you get from other products.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product from sally&#x27;s and used it once. Just from the one use (of which, I didn&#x27;t leave the product on for more than a minute) my newly bleached and colored hair is lighter and brighter! Despite the reviews on here, the shampoo and conditioner do not smell bad at all. (I assumed people were being dramatic, and I was right)In fact, my husband loves the smell of it, so that&#x27;s a big bonus! Also despite the reviews here, the product doesn&#x27;t stain the shower or your hair. (I assumed this probably only happened to people who didn&#x27;t use the product correctly or clean their showers, I was right again) All-in-all, I am very happy with this product and if you feel any hesitation with purchasing, don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It left my hair really dry and tangled. However, it did brighten my hair a bit. Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my recently dyed blond blonde hair. Takes the brassiness out! Arrived in a less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> Keeps gray hair from looking yellow.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo love it for blonde hair in the summer.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed and I like it but my hair is lavender now where it was the lightest shade of blonde. I like the lavender its quirky like me and it tones out the yellowish in my hair but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t soften my hair like the shampoo does. I would recomend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t damaged and to only use on the yellowish parts only but a deeper consitioner is suggested and use gloves haha because my fingernails are purple now.</li>
            <li> I have used both products together for a couple of weeks.  They seem to work. The yellow in my salt and pepper is definitely lighter but not completely gone.  It has worked better than other products I have tried. There is a smell and my husband notices it on my hair. It&#x27;s not revolting but not really pleasant either.  The trade off is that it works.  However, the conditioner leaves my hair tangled and hard to comb through, so use a leave-in  conditioner (It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave In Product works for me). It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the excellent customer service and love the product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years now to help tone and maintain my natural medium-light ash blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to only keep on hair for 3-5 minutes, but I usually leave the shampoo on for 15-20 minutes and the conditioner on anywhere between 30 minutes and a few hours. I feel this helps get the most out of the product, and my hair has yet to turn a blue or purple tint. I use this product almost every time I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does its job, it cleans your hair while tones. The smell would probably be a turn off for most people, it has a floral grandmother scent- which I oddly enjoy. The trick to the shampoo is the lather it until the foam turns white, which is when all the color has been deposited to the hair. Apply only to the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has the same floral grandmother scent. I find that the conditioner by itself isn&#x27;t very moisturizing, so I mix it with other conditioners. Firstly, I gather my hair into a ponytail and apply it at the tips of my hair and work my way up the hairs. Since the conditoner is pretty lightweight, I also apply just the Shimmer Lights conditioner to my roots, I don&#x27;t mix it with other conditioners because it will drag the roots down and cause my hair to be flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product and will continue to use it until it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and quick delivery as promised. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it makes my hair so soft and shiny and does what it says it does and the packaging it comes incompletely protects the product</li>
            <li> Turned my hair blue. Non returnable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and conditioner set as I have been dyeing my hair platinum blonde for some time now.I needed something to keep the brassines away without using a toner everytime I showered.This keeps my hair snow white and is at a much more affordable price than if you were to get them from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> This freaked me out because it stained my light blonde hair a dull purplish and made it appear grayish until I vigorishly washed it for 2 days to get it out. Ugh  It does makes the hair silky and conditioned though.</li>
            <li> my hair has a tendency to turn horribly brassy.  my colorist suggested i try this and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.  i use it once a week and it keeps the brassiness away, which also extends the time between color appointments.</li>
            <li> Was sent two shampoos instead of the kit listed.</li>
            <li> I received two shampoos, not one of each</li>
            <li> Really high lights your blonde or grey hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave the bleach on my hair quite long enough when I was lightening it and ended up looking yellowish.  After just one wash with this I noticed a difference and after maybe 3 washes I got the exact tone I was looking for.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner takes all brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Helps hair for sure! Smells kinda bad, and doesn&#x27;t lather at all, but if being a true blonde is your biggest worry, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Received my package tonight and my bottles were open and leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product. Also when I use the shampoo it stains my cuticles and shower curtain purple. I will go back to what I was using before. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my thin gray hair for a long time and Clairol Shimmer Lights met my expectations.  I love this product and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Received the 2-pack quickly. Makes my hair brighter and takes out all of the brassiness. Would recommend for any blonde, real or enhanced!</li>
            <li> It works well. Takes away the yellow. Don&#x27;t leave on too long, as hair may take on a purple hue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will continue to do so. There may be something out there that is comparable, but why take a chance? If it isn&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I did not receive a shampoo and conditioner. only 2 shampoos double packaged ,disappointed about that but ,all in all the shampoo worked ok.</li>
            <li> If you have lightened or bleached hair then this product is MAGIC! No more brassiness! I use either the shampoo or conditioner (interchanging the two) about once a week and my stylist is always VERY impressed with the color and health of my hair.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting both shampoo and conditioner, I received TWO shampoo bottles and NO conditioner. Not happy at all</li>
            <li> Great for brassy hair. Leave on a few minutes and rinse. Trust me, our well water wreaks havoc on my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;ve never gotten the results from any other products like this one. It keeps my white hair shiny and helps my hair hold the color longer. My only complaint is that it does dry out my hair a lot more than other products that I&#x27;ve used, so I rotate using this with L&#x27;oreal total repair extreme repair mask and conditioner. The combination has left me with wonderful hair that holds great color yet is soft.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and seller as I received the products in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Works great to get the yellow tones out of my platinum bleached hair!  It&#x27;s also helping to reverse the damage from the bleaching process, because of the protein in it. Only thing is it will turn your hair purple gray if left on too long.</li>
            <li> Good product - did the trick to fix brassy hair best price together a little pricy $18</li>
            <li> It really worked to help keep the color and cut out the brassiness. BUT... I feel like it really left my hair dry. Good for the price compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Perfect for reducing brassyness out of brunette highlights.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair gray if you&#x27;re not careful. I find this does remove yellow and tone blonde hair, but it does so very unevenly - leaving streaks of a darker gray and streaks of untouched yellow in your hair, even if you follow the directions exactly. Was worth a try but I probably wouldn&#x27;t but it again.</li>
            <li> Received a shampoo and conditioner. You definitely need to be careful with hair that&#x27;s been lifted to near white, as it does produce a grey or bluish tone to the hair if left on too long, or used too often. I use the set once a week and rinse pretty quickly. The smell is a little &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; like, but if it&#x27;s not used daily it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the shipping on these. When I got them, one bottle was broken completely, and leaked all over the inside of the box. The other the cap was open, and stating to ooze out.</li>
            <li> does kill the yellow hue and makes hair brighter</li>
            <li> I find it a bit drying on my gray hair. Don&#x27;t think it is the best for daily shampooing, so I use it only once a week.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really nice with my bleach blonde hair! it&#x27;s kept it from turning that yellow that every blonde despises.&lt;br /&gt;the main flaw i found with it is that the shampoo leaked everywhere! it didnt appear to be broken (it wasnt broken) but it was everywhere in the bag they both came in.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t smell like fruity or nice, but the smell doesnt bother me, it does wonders on toning my hair!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll definitely be buying again, though!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Super cheap and works like a charm. Cant&#x27; recommend highly enough for getting rid of all the brassiness in blonde hair!</li>
            <li> I would give this more stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;RECAP: I bleached my hair an it was light YELLOW blonde on roots and a darker yellow blonde on the ends. I used the shampoo for 10 mins then the conditioner for 20. It took away ALL the brassy/orange/yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: I have been dying my hair dark brown for years. I wanted to go blonde but do it slowly so my hair wouldn&#x27;t be damaged. I stopped dying my hair for 9+ months since my roots weren&#x27;t too terrible they kind of blended since my natural hair is now a dark dark ash blonde. I started highlighting my hair once a month for 4 months but it was taking to long and it was still really dark and verrrry orange and brassy on the ends. I finally got the courage to bleach it and it took 3 bleaches since the bleach I was using SUCKED wich I only realized when I did the 3rd bleach :/&lt;br /&gt;So the top was a very yellow blonde and the ends were orange yellow.&lt;br /&gt;After I used the shimmer lights it took away literally all of the brassy colors and now I have a nice rich blonde especially on the ends where it was orangey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes it smells and is very drying but your not buying it to strengthen your hair, you buying it to take out brassyness and it works so stop complaining sheesh. And the whole gagging over the smell...ridiculous. It&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the product too much. My hair is a platinum blonde color but this seemed to turn my hair more of a purple/gray tint. I even waited plenty of time ( up to a week) after my coloring to try it and it still did the same thing. May work for others but not for me. Packaging was good and product came perfectly.</li>
            <li> The product is just as described. Very good quality</li>
            <li> I have well water so my hair (highlites)&lt;br /&gt;Turn brassy orange.this shampoo/cond&lt;br /&gt;Is fabulous.my highlites stay blonde and&lt;br /&gt;No orange brassy hair. And it smells&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo good</li>
            <li> The best , I have dyed middle golden blonde hair , after shampoo 2 min and conditioner for 5 min my hair become light ash blonde , I tried other products without success , the hair are nice after the conditioner , so if you use your own shampoo the conditioner will be enough as the pigment is more strong than in the shampoo  my nail polish was gray from white so wear gloves .. the skin was ok .&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo did nothing to my hair as there was not change in color at all .&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use the product straight after bleaching to a pale yellow or white as you hair can turn purple-bluish , the hair after bleach are very absorbing , mix half- half with your regular conditioner unless you hair turn golden blonde or have orange tone you can go for max power as well as it will tone them nice down to middle ash blond .&lt;br /&gt;This product is so much better than dye hair toner that damage bleached hair even more , my hair are long to my lower back bleached to dead, but soft , shiny and looks healthy and don&#x27;t break down .. nice product and recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one negative comments about what is the smell , it remind me of cheap Brazilian perfume , my hands smell 2 days after wash and wash not to mention the hair , too intensive and my boyfriend don&#x27;t like it , but hey, better smelly beautiful hair than bald head lol you can&#x27;t have everything ! always paying for something back  right ?&lt;br /&gt;but seriously , if Clairol changed the smell it would be number one stuff, but due to the smell of the pigment it is hard to mask with other perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ah and one more thing, after using this product don&#x27;t use acidic product like lemon or fruit based shampoos .. it will make the hair less pretty and hard to manage , I read that the pigment can react with high acidic chemicals in bad way</li>
            <li> The shipping and packaging for these products was great - I&#x27;d order from this seller again in a heartbeat. The color added by both of these is really great and keeps my blonde cool rather than yellow. Unfortunately, they both smell like hotel soap and leave my hair feeling dry. I recommend using a really good hydrating conditioner between washes with this stuff to keep your hair happy :)</li>
            <li> it turned my blonde hair grey and the people I went to didn&#x27;t wanna fix it so I has to dye it back to blacküíî I would like my money back and pay for my hair to go back to blonde and compensation for my hurt feelings</li>
            <li> Was suppose to be shampoo and conditioner, but recieved two shampoos but other than that I love this product</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My silver and grays never look yellow or dingy.</li>
            <li> This is for blonde/silver hair, but as a brunette, I used it to take away some brassiness from my ombre dye job. It took about 1 month for my compliments to go from &amp;#34;you went strawberry blonde!&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;you look so honey colored!&amp;#34; My natural hair color is one shade above black and it was lightened quite a bit, so I avoided any chemical toners. I still ahve some product in both bottles after 2 months of washing my waste length hair with this every 3 days and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. Product works really well with my hair. Not a bad price on here for it either. Completely satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Product turned my hair and everything in my shower purple.  I rinsed my hair with no results and had to wash it many times to get the product out.  The shower washed easily enough.</li>
            <li> Very good for yellowing gray hair. Helps it turn white.It is very silly to require a certain number of words</li>
            <li> If you want platinum blond color, those shampoo+conditioner will help you achieve the results! Easy to use, does not make a mess in bathtub!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> What a happy surprise!!! Have been living with white/yellow hair for over two years now.  (I live in Hawaii).  Every product I have ordered was a waste of money until I went to Amazon site and read all the reviews of this and other products.  I have used this once since I received it last week and have ALREADY gotten great results.  Hair color is almost back to it&#x27;s normal color of pearl grey.  Thank you, thank you Clairol.</li>
            <li> Thanx you very much I love it</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Wow this shampoo really works. When I was reading the reviews I was kinda of scared to get it because they said it smelled bad.. I have no idea what they talking about.. Me and my husband love the smell.. Love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> great product my daughter In VEGAS who is a stylist and nail tech recomanded this product</li>
            <li> It really tones down the brassy tones! I don&#x27;t feel so bad about the at home bleaching incident anymore,  thanks to Shimmer Lights.</li>
            <li> Definetly removes the brassiness. Must use a good conditioner after this conditioner though. It is super drying. I use Moroccan oil conditioner, especially on the ends. All in all, I&#x27;ll def keep using it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/condition is truly awful. I haven&#x27;t noticed the smell issues that some other reviewers complain about, but it leaves my hair incredibly tangled. The shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t seem to actually clean my hair, either. Overall, this product has been a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for keeping my naturally silver hair from yellowing. Better than a much more expensive product I purchased through a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Helps with the brassiness. However, it is very drying and smells like my grandmas potpourri which for me is negative. The &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; is a joke. It is watery and hardly conditions at all. This product will help cool down your blonde but dries hair out so be sure to follow with a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, better than the last stuff I bought at the beauty shop but instead of whitening it really makes it silvery/blue. Now quite what I had in mind, but mildly colorful.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for the rad reviews. First I don&#x27;t like the smell, my nose is extra sensitive(I get A LOT of allergies), so the smell bothers me and tickles my nose. But it does what it says, I dyed my hair to an ash blonde. Right after I toned it with ash toner t9 wellas. Then I shampoo and conditioned with shimmer lights. Right after the brassyness and orange is out, but not completely. But now after a few washes my hair is the color I want, no more orange or brassiness. The bad part is the shampoo, it doesnt foam up with soap suds and I have to use a lot of it. The conditoner doesnt make my hair feel soft, it does the job but I dont like the feeling, feels very tough. You have to leave both on for 3-5 minutes. So i just stick to tresseme and use this once a week to give it a pop. After im done with the bottles, im looking into redken. If you reccomend anything please comment.</li>
            <li> packaging was great--both bottles filled and unopened. The shampoo itself does NOT smell like a thrift store, however it does smell like a rose candle or something of that sort. it is VERY purple which is a good thing if you have hard water like I do, I bought this product as a step up from my John Frieda color correcting shampoo (also a great purple shampoo not as purple but works) I am very impressed with this product it keeps the brassiness out of my blonde hair-- CHEAP PRICE-- more expensive elsewhere, love this product and I would personally recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> it actually works. does not darken hair.</li>
            <li> Buy it, it&#x27;s awesome, it definitely helped me brassy hair go normal.</li>
            <li> WOW!! This stuff really does brighten gray/silver hair!! I bought this for my mother who is a smoker, this shampoo and conditioner has made an amazing difference!! I wish I could give this more stars!!</li>
            <li> Boo!!! Was Supposed to be a Combo Shampoo and Conditioner But I received TWO Shampoos!!!  üëé üò¢</li>
            <li> works to keep my hair gray.</li>
            <li> Perfect and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The package came directly as stated. I dyed the bottom of my hair grey, and this product does help preserve the color a little bit, however I know that to keep this hair color I need to go back to the salon regularly. Other people complain of it drying out your hair. I&#x27;ve never dealt with dry hair yet since I soak my hair in the Clairol conditioner for a good 10 mins (maybe that helps). The smell is a bit strong. I don&#x27;t mind, but other people might. Finally beware this shampoo/conditioner will stain so if you spill a bit in your bathtub clean it up immediately. Otherwise I love this product and will continue using. The only fault is I wish there was an omega :)</li>
            <li> It definitely lightened up hair and washed away my orange that was fading. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I&#x27;ve lightened or highlighted my hair to help combat the brassiness, and it worked for that purpose, but the best thing about the shampoo and conditioner is the fact that it is purple.  For my hair, it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough, since I lighten my hair.  It might be ok for people who are naturally blonde or grey, but I need something to help moisturize my hair and defrizz because it is damaged from bleach.  Also, it&#x27;s a little expensive for me, I&#x27;m trying to save money. All in all, it isn&#x27;t worth it for me to purchase this.  Instead, I&#x27;ve been mixing Wilton&#x27;s gel icing coloring with a nice moisturizing shampoo and deep conditioner, and that has been helping me to fight brassiness while moisturizing my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo and conditioner is literaly just ok.  Not moisturizing at all! gets rid of some of the brassiness for a day or 2 only.</li>
            <li> really does a great job of toning, but the shampoo is extremely drying and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve either used the shampoo alone and followed it up with a deep conditioner, or used the shampoo and conditioned once with the shimmer lights and a second time with a regular conditioner for dry/damaged hair. only removes yellow tones, doesn&#x27;t help with orange. if you go from black/dark brown to orange, you need to bleach again before this (or most toner, really) will help. as a product used most often for blonde hair, which is usually bleached, this isn&#x27;t very good for preventing further damage. health vs color on this one.</li>
            <li> Does the job, kind of dries my hair out but I just use a deep conditioner after and it&#x27;s all good üòä</li>
            <li> No more brass. Love it.</li>
            <li> Weird smell and made my hair feel like straw!  Would have returned but Amazon said -&amp;#34;Not eligible for return&amp;#34;.  Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Yes it does what it says but hair gets so tangled, it&#x27;s ridiculous! I feel like I&#x27;m brushing a wet dog when I get out of the shower. The smell is very subtle but pretty old lady like. I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product no hassles thank you</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for my needs. Good value!</li>
            <li> After a while the smell is a bit annoying and also the lack of softness in the shampoo and conditioner is also not satisfactory.  So what I do is add it to normal shampoo now.  That way, the colour is not as intense and &#x27;blue rinse set&#x27; looking and I imagine the product will last for months.  Reasonably priced.  Definitely removes the brassiness from dyed blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This is so much better to get yellow from beautiful gray hair.  I have tried stuff from the Wal Mart salon, it is about 1/2 the power of Clairol.  I personally like the scent it gives, but have been using it this winter.  I hope the scent is still pleasant this summer.  I do not need the conditioner each time I shampoo, but it is truly a great product.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who is a natural blonde and she really loves this shampoo and conditioner, the price was really great and we will order here again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Makes the greys in my hair POP silver for lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. My hair turned grayish blue from 2 washes. I&#x27;d love a refund. Would NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I used to use this in 97 for my white platinum hair.  I use the shampoo maybe once every 3 washes.  It does pick up the purple tone of the product if used any more than that.  I hadn&#x27;t tried the conditioner til now.  Honestly speaking, I don&#x27;t feel this coordinating conditioner is beneficial or needed- the shampoo does the job, and likely, the conditioner just adds to the risk of TOO MUCH purple..  I doubt I&#x27;ll use the conditioner, but overall it&#x27;s still the same great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere here in this small town for this. I had to order some online instead. As a beautician remember this as a great whitener and it is. YES it can make bleached/damaged hair feel dry on the ends even with matching conditioner. I like to use a deep condition afterwards, or hot oil treatment. That will help with any dryness. But with healthy hair it wouldnt hurt it at all, just the bad over processed ends it might.</li>
            <li> The products work great, but the STENCH of the product..... seriously Clairol, please change the scent. Tyvm..</li>
            <li> Only drawback (why it&#x27;s not 5 stars) is that you have to be careful when your blonde is very light- it will turn it old-lady purple if you leave it on too long. And &amp;#34;too long&amp;#34; is something you&#x27;ll personally have to experiment with, but for me, it was either way too cool or too yellow, and it only had a couple of days where it was good in between those stages.</li>
            <li> Im asian with bleached hair and this works great. Problem is, it makes your hair really really damaged.&lt;br /&gt;To fix this problem: after washing out the conditioner i use biolage&#x27;s hydrating conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Only use once a week! The rest of the week use some hydrating shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner. After two weeks, my hair is super blonde (not bleach orange any more!). My goal is to get white or ash blonde hair, and with this, i think i can after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was a treatment you should use between other shampooing.  People started telling me that my hair looked blue.  I just assumed that I had used so much bleach that it was naturally frosting --- like a glacier effect.  However, I finally asked my stylist who said I was using the purple shampoo too much.  I miss the blue.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well.  I naturally have brown hair and have put blonde highlights throughout. My blonde still looks good.  The conditioner makes my hair feel so dry, and when I get out- my hair is all tangled.  Get the shampoo, forget the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but my hair is SUPER damaged by the bleachings I&#x27;ve been putting it through and I&#x27;ve been leaving the conditioner on and it&#x27;s been helping a lot. (As in, putting it on myhair and sleeping with it on) I have noticed that is has toned down the brassiness a little. If you are going super light blonde from a darker hair tone, this is sort of a must have. I don&#x27;t really mind the brassiness, but I&#x27;m trying to get my hair to a white/silver color so it&#x27;s super duper necessary. It shipped quickly and I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to use the shampoo and conditioner because when it arrived it wasn&#x27;t properly packaged and both bottles had leaked through the flimsy plastic and they were soaked in purple.  The purple leaked on my new blue blouse I had just put on, onto the floor, all over my nails and arms, etc.  I think you get the picture.  There was no way I could send it back so I just wrapped it in a garbage bag and discarded it.  It is money I cannot afford to waste.  I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo and conditioner, BUT it leaves a lavender-ish tint to white hair. If you don&#x27;t want this tint, don&#x27;t use the products. It did not take the yellow out of my white hair--only covered them up. It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Good product to keep highlighted hair from looking yellow or too brassy.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommend the shampoo and conditioner. My hair has stayed blonder longer and the grey has blended in. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a drabber look and this works. Just make sure to leave it on the recommended times and it works good I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I have naturally dark brown hair and I have been highlighting it (with bleach, done professionally) to blonde for about a year now. It doesn&#x27;t act as much of a cleaning shampoo, but it definitely brings out my highlights and makes my hair brighter, especially right after I wash it. My friends notice the difference and it is obvious in pictures. I use a regular shampoo first, then I let this shampoo sit on my hair for five minutes then rinse it out and put more on for another five minutes. For the conditioner, I mix it in with a regular conditioner and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. The only drawback to these products is that they dry out your hair, so if you notice your hair dried out or breaking, I recommend using a hydrating shampoo to go along with this.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments all the time on what great hair color I have.  Since turning gray I have battled with myself on coloring which of course is almost impossible with gray hair.  This shampoo blends the distinctive white and darker gray hairs to a lovely, soft color.</li>
            <li> A little messy to use. After using both products repeated times, I see no residual blue tone to my yellowed white hair.  This staining may be related to the high concentration of iron in our tap water.....no proof, but just a theory.  I was hoping that this product would help, but in my case it didn&#x27;t.  Could be different for you.</li>
            <li> Brightened my highlights like it should so I loved it.</li>
            <li> took the yellow out of my hair... made it look more natural. Im very happy with this.... The only thing is that you might need a very good leave in conditioner, because the hair gets very tangled.</li>
            <li> Bought this to tone of my hair. Bleached my and got the brassy yellow color, this product started to remove those tones with just one wash. It just feel a bit drying but that is resolved with some moisturizing conditioner. I highly recommend this purple shampoo for removal of yellow undertones. Will continue to buy as long as I am bleaching.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It keep my light blonde looking great...no gold here!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works to cut out a lot of brassiness in bleached hair. It is very drying, funny enough the shampoo feels less dyring than the conditioner, so I try not to use them both at the same time and I give my hair a break from it from time to time. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but it works as described.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted (naturally an 8 lifted to a 10) blonde hair and this product really helps me keep my color from turning brassy. Both products deposit so much color that I do not often use the shampoo and the conditioner together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some shampoo on my shower curtain and it stained, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main advice is to not use this and self tanner on the same day or you will look like a gray haired Oompa Loompa.</li>
            <li> I have white and silver hair and was wanting to remove the yellow residue and enhance the white and silver. It did help remove the yellow, but turned my white and silver to a steel gray. Not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> perfect for highlighted or blonde hair that has yellowed, only use about once a week though, it&#x27;ll turn it almost white!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this shampoo and conditioner available on Amazon. It was recommended by my hairdresser and makes my grey hair look great!</li>
            <li> I love, love, it helps clarify my hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered the two pack shampoo and conditioner. Received two shampoos instead.</li>
            <li> My highlights are less brassy. The scent is unlike any other shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s not bad- just smells dated.The conditioner is not moisturizing enough for my hair. So I have to use an additional one. Very purple formula, I don&#x27;t like this in my shower. Would I repurchase this product? No. But my order arrived on time and was In perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Does a great job to lighten where needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and does exactly what it states on the bottle.  It has an awesome fragrance and makes your hair feel so soft.  You can also use this product on brown hair to brighten the color.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have a dyed white &amp;#34;patch&amp;#34; in my greying hair.  Unfortunately, it would change to a yellow tone over time.  My hair stylist recommended a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoo and I started looking online for reviews/recommendations.  I chose this after reading reviews on Amazon and other site.  This is a great product.  I use it just once a week unless I spend lots of time out in the sun -- then I may use it twice in a week.  I will definitely keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have had no problems with it staining our white shower pan or light colored shower tiles as others have mentioned.  I haven&#x27;t let it dry on anything, but the staining of the shower has not been a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It helps remove brassiness and is very pigmented. Warning, if you leave it on for too long your hair will start to look greyish white.</li>
            <li> Way less than Redken Blonde Idol and works better too! Just make sure you mix the conditioner with a strong think conditioner.  As much as I love this stuff, it can really dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> Great for grey hair-adds color and luster.  Like it.  Some complain of smell but I found that a non point.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to brighten blond &amp; gray hair - it turned my white long hair a light gunmetal gray. I was hoping to take a bit of the yellow out of the bottom of my long hair - trying to find a compromise to NOT turning my white hair gray and yet taking some of the yellow out - haven&#x27;t figured it out yet. Trying less time, only using one or the other. Maybe I&#x27;ll figure it out before I use it up. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice product but very damaging to the hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo definitely decreases bassinets and adds shimmer to your har. The conditioner on the other hand does not add moisture to your hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did neutralize the yellow in my white hair.  But it also dulls the shine and smells unpleasant.  The odor lasts all day.  I am still looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do but it does have an unpleasant odor that lingers in your hair.</li>
            <li> So, I have to use this sparingly on my dyed platinum hair.  About once a week is enough, and I do a quick shampoo with immediate rinse, followed by mixing the conditioner with a thicker, moisturizing conditioner and letting it sit for a few minutes.  After I use it, I always get asked if I &amp;#34;re-blonded&amp;#34; my hair.  It makes a dramatic difference in the brightness and whiteness of my hair.  If I use both the shampoo and conditioner straight and let it sit, though, I do end up with a lavender sheen.  Love the way that looks, but it doesn&#x27;t fly at work.,</li>
            <li> I used this product per instructions only to blow dry my hair and see how much it fried my hair! In addition, it smells awful and took 3 days of a deep conditioner, me not using any product or tools just to get it back to manageble. I have to get a trim now. Do not use this product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me I didn&#x27;t see any changes in my hair</li>
            <li> These were shipped in a plastic bag with just the tops covered in plastic wrap so they aren&#x27;t sealed, appears as though they were opened by someone.  Having highlights in my hair I&#x27;m used to purple shampoo but this didn&#x27;t help at all!  Maybe it&#x27;s just for white hair or I got a defective product.  I have to say though as another posted stated, (my fault for reading reviews AFTER I order stuff lol) this STINKS like all day I smelled like a thrift store or something.  Normally shampoo smells don&#x27;t stick around but unfortunately this one does.  In the end my highlights still appear yellow instead of bright white and it&#x27;s not that long after my last highlight so I think this product isn&#x27;t worth it.  And forget ten dollars s&amp;h for two small shampoo bottles!</li>
            <li> The scent is not very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep up my lavender hair. I added some dye to the conditioner. It kept the hair toned but it also changed the texture of my hair for the worse, making it more susceptible to tangles.</li>
            <li> It does help brassines, however, it dries the crap out of your hair.. I can only use it once a week or else my naturally, healthy beautiful gets super stringy/tangly... not sure if I really like it or not yet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews from everyone saying how well it worked. Well, it does! I have tried a few other purple products including a very expensive conditioner and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. This one worked really well, almost too well, because my hair is slightly purple/blue tinted now, but I honestly prefer that over the yellow I had before. I would suggest you don&#x27;t leave it on very long. Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting my hair very clean so I use it in combination with a regular clarifying shampoo and when I condition, it&#x27;s not that moisturizing so I pair it with a deep moisturizing conditioner. In terms of toning, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used thus far and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The color is a little intimidating for those who have not used purple shampoos before, but it worked well. It took the bright orange and bright yellow out of my hair and dulled them with is exactly what i needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with some of the other reviewers, it does kind of have an old lady smell to it, but that doesnt bother me much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when i received the package, the bottles were leaking. The caps were not secure, but the spill was minimal, and contained in the bubble wrap they packaged it in, so all i really needed to do was rinse the bottles off and toss the packaging. Still though, i was not pleased that it leaked at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the product does the job, and is a great price. Just be careful and open over a sink or something when the package arrives.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The smell is a lot like formaldehyde. (sp?) Seriously, the smell lingers! It does brighten your blonde though, and it&#x27;s lots of fun getting purple all over the shower.</li>
            <li> It was ok but I ordered the Shampoo and Conditioner and I got 2 shampoos.  I like the product though--- if you use to much it seems to dry the hair out.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, works well. Mom was a red head (I&#x27;m a blonde) darn those orange hues. I liiiike. Better than JF sheer blonde, if you ask me. Conditioner doesn&#x27;t really condition, but I mix it with my regular and it&#x27;s gooood</li>
            <li> it comes with two shampoos not the shampoo + conditioner combo</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time and it keeps my blonde hair from getting greenish/ chlorine brassiness. It&#x27;s not very moisturizing and I use an additional conditioner. I alternate this with my other shampoo set, and probably use this one 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Best silver shampoo I have tried. I originally have dark brown hair so when I get my blonde highlights this is the only shampoo that can take the brassy color out and give me back the white/silver color that I love. I would recommend buying the shampoo and conditioner and leave the conditioner on a bit longer than you normally would.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and does exactly what I want! I was dying my hair from reddish brown to light blonde. I had an orange color in it and I&#x27;ve used my shampoo once and it already has lightened and taken orange out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work well. My hair is a brassy blonde and after using this, it&#x27;s much more natural and less yellow looking.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the perfumey scent of this stuff stays with you all day. I could smell it before even opening the bottles, so I knew what I was in for... but I couldn&#x27;t use this stuff everyday due to the smell. I&#x27;ll use it weekly maybe.</li>
            <li> My shampoo came with a broken bottle cap. The packaging isnt so good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work well but it does have a slight smell that I do not like. The shampoo and conditioner actually come out purple.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, I threw it away after 1 use</li>
            <li> My hair is totally white and the Shimmer Lights really keeps it looking great, however, I have to take care not to leave it on longer than it takes to shampoo and condition my hair as it will give me a &amp;#34;little old lady with purple hair&amp;#34; look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a platinum blonde. (I like manic panic flash lightning bleaching kits and their virgin snow toner.) The only way I&#x27;ve found to counteract the brassiness my hair takes on is to slather on the purple. This shampoo is a godsend for that purpose. The only issue is that it does absolutely nothing for the texture or volume of my hair. Dyed hair needs maintenance and this doesn&#x27;t do the trick. I&#x27;ve found it best to either only use it a few times per week of to mix it with a more nourishing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip: the purple will stain your bathroom if you&#x27;re not careful. Neatness is key here, folks.</li>
