            <li>I have gone through so many makeup brushes that scratch my face or don’t provide even coverage of my makeup but these brushes do not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this brush.  </li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that it is very durable.  </li>
            <li>The diameter of the brush is the perfect size I have a lot of brushes that are to big and more makeup</li>

            <li>Worth the purchase! :)</li>
            <li>In my opinion this product was made well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>how easy it spreads my liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li>This brush can be used with liquid foundations for a better application and clean up is easy.</li>

            <li>The brush is sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>I was able to oder this during a special promotion for testing purposes and review.</li>
            <li>The bare minerals brush was great however, it was always shedding</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and feel nice against my face!</li>
            <li>and I am left with a beautiful airbrush - like look.</li>
            <li>This is truly a beautiful quality brush at a surprisingly low price point.  </li>
            <li>and I have a good amount to cover (old acne scars/discoloration)!</li>
            <li>It works great with my mineral makeup and is super soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li>In my experience it distributes the makeup powder as I had hoped for, which is evenly and precise.</li>
            <li>SO easy to clean, and none of the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li>This brush is sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Have used several others but this is great.  </li>
            <li>It feels smooth going on, there&#x27;s no cloud of make-up while I apply, and I have yet to find a bristle on my face.</li>
            <li>WORKS WELL, MINERAL MAKEUP GOES ON SMOOTH AND IT DOESN&#x27;T SHED.</li>
            <li>Applys my foundation smoothly and evenly..</li>
            <li>I contacted Jessica at Castle Rock Essentials to let her know how happy I was with this product and her response was personal and prompt.</li>

            <li>I use bare minerals and I am impressed so far.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say its way better than my bare minerals kabuki.</li>
            <li>My new favorite brush!</li>

            <li>I have used other brushes but this one works really good!</li>
            <li>I own several high end brushes and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The brush cleanly and evenly applies the makeup with the look of perfection each and every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very even foundation application, great blending tool, and so incredibly soft on my face.</li>
            <li>Its great because the bristles are dense and really secured so they don&#x27;t fall out when I am applying makeup to my face but the bristles are so soft as well.</li>
            <li>When I finished I had a nice, streak free finish that looked polished--yet also natural and not too caked on either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is so incredibly soft, yet holds the powder and distributes it evenly- could not ask for more!  </li>
            <li>Love love this bare minerals brush.</li>
            <li>This thing is remarkably soft, it is so amazing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and that&#x27;s a true sign of a quality brush.</li>
            <li>Loving this brush so far.</li>
            <li>You are definitely getting a good value for your money here and there is no risk at all.</li>
            <li>I brought the angled brush and the full kabuki brush together.  </li>
            <li>I use it with just about everything, from foundation to full coverage face powder as well as blush.</li>
            <li>It provides full coverage with any application of make-up.</li>
            <li>Nice soft brush, but it was not cut (shaped) well.</li>
            <li>The brush is very dense, the dome top does not yield severely when pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>it is not bad..</li>
            <li>I am used to a slightly wider brush, I would have preferred if this brush was wider but like many things in life, you adjust when you find a good tool.</li>
            <li>Due to this brush not having a &amp;#34;flair&amp;#34; to it, this makes a great foundation brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely dense, very soft, and the perfect length.  </li>
            <li>The foundation evenly holds onto the brush, and I am able to smoothly glide it on; there is no uneven coverage.</li>
            <li>Only a dab or two is necessary when using the brush &amp; you get perfect even coverage.</li>
            <li>I received this brush quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li>I definitely grab this brush much more than many others I have.</li>
            <li>skin looks amazing, my bare minerals has never gone on more seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more of this brand to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite makeup brushes by far!</li>
            <li>Love it, and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I can go over any &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; area and add a bit more and it blends seamlessly!</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve gotten, and I love this one too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and top quality.</li>
            <li>The handle is very sturdy and comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I prefer using a brush to apply foundation because I feel it gives the most natural result</li>
            <li>but it is a bit firmer for a more direct application approach.  </li>
            <li>This brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and dense but I was hoping that it it would have a bigger head of bristles if that makes sense....</li>
            <li>Although I love makeup, I am far from an expert at applying it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s soft, the bristles are dense and I love that the bristles are short.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>This brush is worth</li>
            <li>The brush hairs are super soft and picked up powder easily and provided an even application.</li>
            <li>The handle is just the right size too.</li>
            <li>The handle is just the right length</li>
            <li>Distributes the /mineral makeup easily and evenly and is very soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft and sturdy and makes my getting ready time easy and efficient!</li>
            <li>and I really love that it&#x27;s rounded slightly at the top.</li>
            <li>I kept this at 3 stars because the bristles are still firmly secure in the ferule, and it is still a super soft brush.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my Bare Essentials make up, and it makes my make up look just that much better.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>It feels really soft and lovely on my skin but doesn&#x27;t hold the mineral makeup very well.</li>
            <li>I loved my previous Kabuki brush</li>
            <li>The Kabuki round brush by Simply Essentials is one of the best makeup brushes I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles, however, still trying to figure if I&#x27;m using more powder than normal.</li>
            <li>It is seriously the most amazing makeup brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for any make-up artist from beginners to full on fab advance.</li>
            <li>I will totally buy more of these brushes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how soft and comfortable</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more brushes from Castle Rock.</li>
            <li>I never thought a brush would affect the way my makeup went on so much!</li>
            <li>This was the first ever kabuki brush I have used</li>
            <li>I have used various Kabuki brushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s even better, as you don&#x27;t need to keep using your product for &amp;#34;more coverage&amp;#34;, your makeup will also last longer.</li>
            <li>This first time I used this brush, I thought I was rubbing my face with velvet.</li>
            <li>This is the only brush I&#x27;ve let replace my most favorite and cherished foundation brush in the last decade.</li>
            <li>Now, I really like that mineral powder!</li>
            <li>but I actually like this one even more, because I find it softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exceptional brush for bare minerals and other light powdered makeup.</li>
            <li>I prefer a flat top brush.</li>
            <li>It really has become my favorite go-to overall brush.</li>
            <li>You have no idea the positive effects it has had in our home.</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest trying this brush if you are shopping for such a product.</li>
            <li>Very soft and useful brush.  </li>
            <li>With this brush, it encompasses a large surface of my face and does so evenly, with out making my skin look caked on.</li>
            <li>I was originally looking for the Bare Minerals kabuki brush</li>
            <li>My favorite use for this brush is for applying loose powder.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li>I very seldom write reviews</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and use, and I incorporate into my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I had just purchased a brush from a department store that cost twice as much that I no longer need.</li>
            <li>The brush is also very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean between uses of different products because of the extra density.</li>
            <li>it really feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does give you an airbrushed finish.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find any of the bristles left on my face like I do after using some cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it uses my powder.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely CAN tell the difference (as opposed to using a puff or sponge)!!&lt;br /&gt;Still getting the feel of it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It seems to be very well made and should hold up well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this makeup brush!</li>
            <li>As a licensed esthetician I can be very picky about my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It holds and blends the mineral foundation very well.  </li>
            <li>This brush was reasonably priced and I decided to take a chance...</li>
            <li>goes on than brush than what I really need.</li>
            <li>It helps me to see how much makeup I am putting on.  </li>
            <li>However, when I applied the mineral powder, I wasn&#x27;t left with a glob of powder in one spot with a light layer in another.</li>
            <li>This brush is very well made.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this with liquid foundation and found that either stippling or buffing motions work very well with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have preferred a better case / mode of transport, but the clear plastic sleeve works well enough for now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT IS SO SOFT!!!  </li>
            <li>Maximum coverage, long handle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is so much softer and works so much better than any other kabuki brush I have owned.</li>
            <li>I have tried many expensive, high end brushes before and can honestly say this can match up to any one of those.  </li>
            <li>I even cleaned it, and while many other brushes lose a ton of brissles when they are cleaned, this didn&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised, as I had expected the more expensive, popular brand name to come out on top.</li>
            <li>I especially like this brush when I am applying my Bare Mineral faux tan because it adheres so well to the bristles and am able to get an even color all over my face.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a full set of brushes in this same product.</li>
            <li>It picks up powder and gently sweeps it on and with just a few taps it cleans out pretty easily without needing to be cleaned out so often.</li>
            <li>Was just like new!</li>
            <li>It allows for more product to be lifted into the brush with less excess waisted.  </li>
            <li>I tried one more time, half expecting to be picking hairs out of my eyes and off my face yet again, but this one doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li>Some cost less some cost more.</li>
            <li>The brush feels very well made and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, and it worked really well with my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>High quality, dense brush.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I toss them out when I got this one, highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super soft, solidly made and works really well.</li>
            <li>Even better, once I left it to dry overnight, it was just as soft as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and made very well...</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>It is so soft that applying makeup becomes a real treat for your face.</li>
            <li>The bristles are amazingly soft and hold onto makeup very well.</li>
            <li>It is soooo soft and the bristles are very dense.  </li>
            <li>brush is also very well made, without any shedding issues so far.  </li>
            <li>I have recently bought other brushes and by far this one is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>But ,I just love this kabuki round brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is strong, sturdy, and definitely made to last.</li>
            <li>This one bounces right back!</li>
            <li>The pressed powders and loose powders go on evenly as the bristles of this brush are super packed super thick and are extremely fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm enough to give really great coverage, but soft enough to not leave lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can use the brushes with liquid, cream, or powder foundation and they will do a fantastic job due to the densely packed bristles.</li>
            <li>and I had my new brush in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I needed a new brush and read lots of reviews.</li>
            <li>I love how the brush is soft but firm.  </li>
            <li>Not to small and not too large to it is easy to use while applying blush.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is also very soft to use on your face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, yet the bristles are dense.</li>
            <li>I was actually very surprised.</li>
            <li>I use it with Bare Minerals make-up and this brush provides better coverage than the Kabuki brush I previously used.</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft, dense brush!</li>
            <li>Soft like you have never felt before!</li>
            <li>It has a small plastic slip on coverlet that I didn&#x27;t even realize I would love.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, the kind that turns red when you so much as brush up against it, so using a traditional flat brush often left my skin ruddy after applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it and HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality brush at a ridiculously affordable price.</li>
            <li>I followed directly and cleaned it first with gentle soap and water, and let air dry.</li>
            <li>I am a fan, not only for the price, which you can&#x27;t beat for a high quality brush, but also for how dense and high quality these are!</li>
            <li>I use an all natural skin care line and whenever I introduce a new product or brush, I will immediately get a reaction.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, I was initially struck by just how soft and luxurious it was.  </li>
            <li>With my old brush, applying the foundation was a bit of a task.</li>
            <li>Soft dense brush.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s SO soft.</li>
            <li>With this brush, the bristles are so, so soft, and it requires the lightest of touches, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m beating myself up to apply my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Provides complete coverage.</li>
            <li>It keeps the product on the surface of the bristles so it is not wasted.  </li>
            <li>I have cleaned it three times so far</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever owned a brush that was so densely packed and soft as this one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush or the brush line as a whole.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shown them off to my friends and they are all surprised by the feel of them too.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully soft brush</li>
            <li>It is so soft and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This helps the makeup look even and natural with out a lot of thought to it.  </li>
            <li>We have a daughter with some tactile issues and one of the things that helps is rubbing soft things on her face.</li>
            <li>Dense, soft bristles.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old son loves to just brush his face with it.  </li>
            <li>the brush is so soft</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, non-irratating feel to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I cant begin to tell you how soft these bristles are.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but sturdy and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this brush.</li>
            <li>The coverage is even, smoothe and allows me to maintain a natural finish.</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li>SOFT AS</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and blends the makeup evenly.</li>
            <li>The brush is so amazingly soft, it feels luxurious!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This brush is extremely soft and dense.  </li>
            <li>The kabuki brush is now my new blush and powder brush the bristle part are so soft and when u applied to your face doesn&#x27;t mess up the bristles like cheap one does and not rough on your face very soft , makes your makeup look professional look without the expense that places would charge you and small to fit in my makeup travel bag</li>
            <li>While the bristles may be soft, they also hold up fairly firm and don&#x27;t flop or splay around (like other soft brushes I&#x27;ve tried that feel nice, but require a ton of pressing because the bristles flop around).  </li>
            <li>My first experience using a brush to apply loose powder</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush if you wear makeup on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s bristles are just the right length, not to long like for a blush brush and not to short like a stippling brush.  </li>
            <li>The handle is just the right length, I don&#x27;t like the short handles or extensively long handles.  </li>
            <li>I found the description very detailed informing me of all the things that matter most to me while the descriptions on other similar brushes were vague and lacking and left me with questions.</li>
            <li>You know what I mean) have some firmness to them, and deliver more precision than a run-of-the-mill big make-up brush.</li>
            <li>The kabuki brush is like no other brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but I am sure the Kabuki Brush Round is a keeper!!!  </li>
            <li>I took the plunge and bought this online because the other reviewers were so positive.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this kabuki brush as a replacement for the kabuki brush I received with my bare minerals.  </li>
            <li>Super thick and soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles on my old brush literally feels like needles after a couple of months, (and it was more expensive than this one).  </li>
            <li>Last brush was from Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>It uses much less and applies it very uniform.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are soft enough not to hurt your face or poke you but strong enough that the bristles don’t fall out over time, rendering the brush eventually useless.</li>
            <li>I have tried this with loose powder, pressed powder, light fluid foundation and thick, creamy foundation</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Soft, dense, perfect length bristles that DONT SHED!!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!  </li>
            <li> I use mineral makeup and have had no problem and consistently get great coverage.</li>
            <li> The rounded top makes application very easy and I am able to effortlessly and evenly apply my mineral makeup to all parts of  my face.  </li>
            <li> The bristles stay intact and don&#x27;t break off in my foundation as I&#x27;m applying to my face which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush.  </li>
            <li> I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  </li>

            <li> so glad I waited to check Amazon because I saved a lot of money.</li>
            <li> , so glad I added it to my collection.</li>
            <li> I really love the fact that it doesnt scratch my face</li>
            <li> Many times, when you order makeup brushes, they will come with a pungent chemical smell but this one did not.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brush!</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> Love love this brush, I had a Kabuki brush from another company and it would shed bristles when I used it.  </li>
            <li> The kabuki brush does a much better job at application of mineral powder make up.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH</li>
            <li> I have already placed another order! :)</li>
            <li> so I use liquid foundation then a pressed powder over top.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the buff and the look of finished skin.</li>
            <li> I have been in the cosmetic industry for many years.</li>
            <li> I was in the top 3 in my district for sales and I hosted many bashes for use and product displays.</li>
            <li> Love this brush....</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many makeup brushes that scratch my face or don’t provide even coverage of my makeup but these brushes do not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this brush.  </li>
            <li> I like the feel of the rounded head more than the flat&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a rounded top.</li>
            <li> I have always been on the hunt for the softest and most gentile one I could find.</li>
            <li> Holds the powder better, buffs better.</li>
            <li> The handle is the perfect length and the bristles are silky smooth, like a mink coat!I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it puts the makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> I love putting the brush away protected from having the bristles mashed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the brush every day for over a month now, and it is honestly my favorite brush in my collection.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I look forward to applying my makeup now that I have this phenomenal tool in my kit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You need this tool to perfect your overall look!</li>
            <li> Has a nice weight and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes...bought the angled one as well</li>
            <li> Then I noticed how much better my makeup looked after using it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say that it is very durable.  </li>
            <li> The diameter of the brush is the perfect size I have a lot of brushes that are to big and more makeup</li>
            <li> Love it and will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this brush more than words</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy and the appropriate size to hold.</li>

            <li> It reminds me a bit of the Cargo magic brush</li>
            <li> The handle is very comfortable in my hand and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The length and width of the handle is just right and fits good in my hand and makes applying makeup so easy.</li>
            <li> I tore into this package as soon as it arrived and was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Smooth and silky very dense brush which provides great coverage.  </li>
            <li> So soft &amp; works so great to evenly apply my pressed mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> whole still providing good coverage.  </li>
            <li> This is a good brush for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Very densely packed hairs providing good coverage of my mineral make-up.  </li>
            <li> It gives me all the coverage I want, it&#x27;s easy to use, and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase! :)</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product was made well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> how easy it spreads my liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li> This brush can be used with liquid foundations for a better application and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> Coverage is great but takes more swirling around the face to achieve it compared to a bigger brush</li>
            <li> but this brush made it so easy.</li>
            <li> The brush is sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> I was able to oder this during a special promotion for testing purposes and review.</li>
            <li> The bare minerals brush was great however, it was always shedding</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and feel nice against my face!</li>
            <li> and I am left with a beautiful airbrush - like look.</li>
            <li> This is truly a beautiful quality brush at a surprisingly low price point.  </li>
            <li> and I have a good amount to cover (old acne scars/discoloration)!</li>
            <li> It works great with my mineral makeup and is super soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li> In my experience it distributes the makeup powder as I had hoped for, which is evenly and precise.</li>
            <li> SO easy to clean, and none of the bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> This brush is sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Have used several others but this is great.  </li>
            <li> It feels smooth going on, there&#x27;s no cloud of make-up while I apply, and I have yet to find a bristle on my face.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL, MINERAL MAKEUP GOES ON SMOOTH AND IT DOESN&#x27;T SHED.</li>
            <li> Applys my foundation smoothly and evenly..</li>
            <li> I contacted Jessica at Castle Rock Essentials to let her know how happy I was with this product and her response was personal and prompt.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> It is important for me to cover every imperfection on my face...</li>
            <li> This brush is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> had ordered another kabuki brush from another very popular makeup brand, it is a telescoping brush that you click for 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals and I am impressed so far.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say its way better than my bare minerals kabuki.</li>
            <li> My new favorite brush!</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite brush!</li>
            <li> I finally found this one and it is truly amazing!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> My original review gave this 5 stars</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes but this one works really good!</li>
            <li> I own several high end brushes and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The brush cleanly and evenly applies the makeup with the look of perfection each and every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very even foundation application, great blending tool, and so incredibly soft on my face.</li>
            <li> Its great because the bristles are dense and really secured so they don&#x27;t fall out when I am applying makeup to my face but the bristles are so soft as well.</li>
            <li> When I finished I had a nice, streak free finish that looked polished--yet also natural and not too caked on either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is so incredibly soft, yet holds the powder and distributes it evenly- could not ask for more!  </li>
            <li> Love love this bare minerals brush.</li>
            <li> This thing is remarkably soft, it is so amazing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed and that&#x27;s a true sign of a quality brush.</li>
            <li> Loving this brush so far.</li>
            <li> You are definitely getting a good value for your money here and there is no risk at all.</li>
            <li> I brought the angled brush and the full kabuki brush together.  </li>
            <li> I use it with just about everything, from foundation to full coverage face powder as well as blush.</li>
            <li> It provides full coverage with any application of make-up.</li>
            <li> Nice soft brush, but it was not cut (shaped) well.</li>
            <li> The brush is very dense, the dome top does not yield severely when pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> it is not bad..</li>
            <li> I am used to a slightly wider brush, I would have preferred if this brush was wider but like many things in life, you adjust when you find a good tool.</li>
            <li> Due to this brush not having a &amp;#34;flair&amp;#34; to it, this makes a great foundation brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely dense, very soft, and the perfect length.  </li>
            <li> The foundation evenly holds onto the brush, and I am able to smoothly glide it on; there is no uneven coverage.</li>
            <li> Only a dab or two is necessary when using the brush &amp; you get perfect even coverage.</li>
            <li> I received this brush quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> I definitely grab this brush much more than many others I have.</li>
            <li> skin looks amazing, my bare minerals has never gone on more seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more of this brand to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite makeup brushes by far!</li>
            <li> Love it, and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I can go over any &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; area and add a bit more and it blends seamlessly!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve gotten, and I love this one too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and top quality.</li>
            <li> The handle is very sturdy and comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I prefer using a brush to apply foundation because I feel it gives the most natural result</li>
            <li> but it is a bit firmer for a more direct application approach.  </li>
            <li> This brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and dense but I was hoping that it it would have a bigger head of bristles if that makes sense....</li>
            <li> Although I love makeup, I am far from an expert at applying it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, the bristles are dense and I love that the bristles are short.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> This brush is worth</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are super soft and picked up powder easily and provided an even application.</li>
            <li> The handle is just the right size too.</li>
            <li> The handle is just the right length</li>
            <li> Distributes the /mineral makeup easily and evenly and is very soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft and sturdy and makes my getting ready time easy and efficient!</li>
            <li> and I really love that it&#x27;s rounded slightly at the top.</li>
            <li> I kept this at 3 stars because the bristles are still firmly secure in the ferule, and it is still a super soft brush.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my Bare Essentials make up, and it makes my make up look just that much better.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> It feels really soft and lovely on my skin but doesn&#x27;t hold the mineral makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I loved my previous Kabuki brush</li>
            <li> The Kabuki round brush by Simply Essentials is one of the best makeup brushes I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, however, still trying to figure if I&#x27;m using more powder than normal.</li>
            <li> It is seriously the most amazing makeup brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for any make-up artist from beginners to full on fab advance.</li>
            <li> I will totally buy more of these brushes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how soft and comfortable</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more brushes from Castle Rock.</li>
            <li> I never thought a brush would affect the way my makeup went on so much!</li>
            <li> This was the first ever kabuki brush I have used</li>
            <li> I have used various Kabuki brushes for many years.  </li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s even better, as you don&#x27;t need to keep using your product for &amp;#34;more coverage&amp;#34;, your makeup will also last longer.</li>
            <li> This first time I used this brush, I thought I was rubbing my face with velvet.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I&#x27;ve let replace my most favorite and cherished foundation brush in the last decade.</li>
            <li> Now, I really like that mineral powder!</li>
            <li> but I actually like this one even more, because I find it softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exceptional brush for bare minerals and other light powdered makeup.</li>
            <li> I prefer a flat top brush.</li>
            <li> It really has become my favorite go-to overall brush.</li>
            <li> You have no idea the positive effects it has had in our home.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest trying this brush if you are shopping for such a product.</li>
            <li> Very soft and useful brush.  </li>
            <li> With this brush, it encompasses a large surface of my face and does so evenly, with out making my skin look caked on.</li>
            <li> I was originally looking for the Bare Minerals kabuki brush</li>
            <li> My favorite use for this brush is for applying loose powder.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> I very seldom write reviews</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and use, and I incorporate into my daily makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I had just purchased a brush from a department store that cost twice as much that I no longer need.</li>
            <li> The brush is also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean between uses of different products because of the extra density.</li>
            <li> it really feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does give you an airbrushed finish.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find any of the bristles left on my face like I do after using some cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it uses my powder.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely CAN tell the difference (as opposed to using a puff or sponge)!!&lt;br /&gt;Still getting the feel of it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It seems to be very well made and should hold up well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this makeup brush!</li>
            <li> As a licensed esthetician I can be very picky about my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It holds and blends the mineral foundation very well.  </li>
            <li> This brush was reasonably priced and I decided to take a chance...</li>
            <li> goes on than brush than what I really need.</li>
            <li> It helps me to see how much makeup I am putting on.  </li>
            <li> However, when I applied the mineral powder, I wasn&#x27;t left with a glob of powder in one spot with a light layer in another.</li>
            <li> This brush is very well made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with liquid foundation and found that either stippling or buffing motions work very well with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have preferred a better case / mode of transport, but the clear plastic sleeve works well enough for now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT IS SO SOFT!!!  </li>
            <li> Maximum coverage, long handle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is so much softer and works so much better than any other kabuki brush I have owned.</li>
            <li> I have tried many expensive, high end brushes before and can honestly say this can match up to any one of those.  </li>
            <li> I even cleaned it, and while many other brushes lose a ton of brissles when they are cleaned, this didn&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised, as I had expected the more expensive, popular brand name to come out on top.</li>
            <li> I especially like this brush when I am applying my Bare Mineral faux tan because it adheres so well to the bristles and am able to get an even color all over my face.</li>
            <li> I wish they had a full set of brushes in this same product.</li>
            <li> It picks up powder and gently sweeps it on and with just a few taps it cleans out pretty easily without needing to be cleaned out so often.</li>
            <li> Was just like new!</li>
            <li> It allows for more product to be lifted into the brush with less excess waisted.  </li>
            <li> I tried one more time, half expecting to be picking hairs out of my eyes and off my face yet again, but this one doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> Some cost less some cost more.</li>
            <li> The brush feels very well made and the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, and it worked really well with my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> High quality, dense brush.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I toss them out when I got this one, highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super soft, solidly made and works really well.</li>
            <li> Even better, once I left it to dry overnight, it was just as soft as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and made very well...</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> It is so soft that applying makeup becomes a real treat for your face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are amazingly soft and hold onto makeup very well.</li>
            <li> It is soooo soft and the bristles are very dense.  </li>
            <li> brush is also very well made, without any shedding issues so far.  </li>
            <li> I have recently bought other brushes and by far this one is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> But ,I just love this kabuki round brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is strong, sturdy, and definitely made to last.</li>
            <li> This one bounces right back!</li>
            <li> The pressed powders and loose powders go on evenly as the bristles of this brush are super packed super thick and are extremely fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm enough to give really great coverage, but soft enough to not leave lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use the brushes with liquid, cream, or powder foundation and they will do a fantastic job due to the densely packed bristles.</li>
            <li> and I had my new brush in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush and read lots of reviews.</li>
            <li> I love how the brush is soft but firm.  </li>
            <li> Not to small and not too large to it is easy to use while applying blush.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is also very soft to use on your face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, yet the bristles are dense.</li>
            <li> I was actually very surprised.</li>
            <li> I use it with Bare Minerals make-up and this brush provides better coverage than the Kabuki brush I previously used.</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft, dense brush!</li>
            <li> Soft like you have never felt before!</li>
            <li> It has a small plastic slip on coverlet that I didn&#x27;t even realize I would love.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, the kind that turns red when you so much as brush up against it, so using a traditional flat brush often left my skin ruddy after applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it and HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality brush at a ridiculously affordable price.</li>
            <li> I followed directly and cleaned it first with gentle soap and water, and let air dry.</li>
            <li> I am a fan, not only for the price, which you can&#x27;t beat for a high quality brush, but also for how dense and high quality these are!</li>
            <li> I use an all natural skin care line and whenever I introduce a new product or brush, I will immediately get a reaction.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, I was initially struck by just how soft and luxurious it was.  </li>
            <li> With my old brush, applying the foundation was a bit of a task.</li>
            <li> Soft dense brush.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s SO soft.</li>
            <li> With this brush, the bristles are so, so soft, and it requires the lightest of touches, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m beating myself up to apply my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Provides complete coverage.</li>
            <li> It keeps the product on the surface of the bristles so it is not wasted.  </li>
            <li> I have cleaned it three times so far</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever owned a brush that was so densely packed and soft as this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush or the brush line as a whole.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shown them off to my friends and they are all surprised by the feel of them too.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully soft brush</li>
            <li> It is so soft and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This helps the makeup look even and natural with out a lot of thought to it.  </li>
            <li> We have a daughter with some tactile issues and one of the things that helps is rubbing soft things on her face.</li>
            <li> Dense, soft bristles.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son loves to just brush his face with it.  </li>
            <li> the brush is so soft</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, non-irratating feel to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I cant begin to tell you how soft these bristles are.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but sturdy and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this brush.</li>
            <li> The coverage is even, smoothe and allows me to maintain a natural finish.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li> SOFT AS</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and blends the makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> The brush is so amazingly soft, it feels luxurious!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft and dense.  </li>
            <li> The kabuki brush is now my new blush and powder brush the bristle part are so soft and when u applied to your face doesn&#x27;t mess up the bristles like cheap one does and not rough on your face very soft , makes your makeup look professional look without the expense that places would charge you and small to fit in my makeup travel bag</li>
            <li> While the bristles may be soft, they also hold up fairly firm and don&#x27;t flop or splay around (like other soft brushes I&#x27;ve tried that feel nice, but require a ton of pressing because the bristles flop around).  </li>
            <li> My first experience using a brush to apply loose powder</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush if you wear makeup on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s bristles are just the right length, not to long like for a blush brush and not to short like a stippling brush.  </li>
            <li> The handle is just the right length, I don&#x27;t like the short handles or extensively long handles.  </li>
            <li> I found the description very detailed informing me of all the things that matter most to me while the descriptions on other similar brushes were vague and lacking and left me with questions.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean) have some firmness to them, and deliver more precision than a run-of-the-mill big make-up brush.</li>
            <li> The kabuki brush is like no other brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but I am sure the Kabuki Brush Round is a keeper!!!  </li>
            <li> I took the plunge and bought this online because the other reviewers were so positive.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this kabuki brush as a replacement for the kabuki brush I received with my bare minerals.  </li>
            <li> Super thick and soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles on my old brush literally feels like needles after a couple of months, (and it was more expensive than this one).  </li>
            <li> Last brush was from Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> It uses much less and applies it very uniform.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are soft enough not to hurt your face or poke you but strong enough that the bristles don’t fall out over time, rendering the brush eventually useless.</li>
            <li> I have tried this with loose powder, pressed powder, light fluid foundation and thick, creamy foundation</li>
            <li> which I like--when I&#x27;ve tried some other brands, sometimes they&#x27;ve come with loose ferules, which I really don&#x27;t like because obviously, you want your brush to last as long as possible!)</li>
            <li> You will use way less of the liquid as you normally would applying it with your sponge or finger tips.</li>
            <li> Tip, long stroke for liquid and short circle for powder.</li>
            <li> I have a flat head brush in the size</li>
            <li> The next day when it was completely dry, I gave it a go with my mousse foundation.</li>
            <li> I wash after each use, let air dry, and then use the next day.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but also dense so they flex slightly without breaking.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t think many people will go wrong with this brush!</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft to the touch, but they firmly stay in their place.</li>
            <li> I like the firm but soft shot stubby bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a brush that doesn&#x27;t shed for way too long and always purchased ones that are &amp;#34;guaranteed not to shed&amp;#34; without luck.  </li>
            <li> It was half the price of the Bare Minerals one</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes that left pieces of brush on your face, This brush is made well and does not do that.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing the other two kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a makeup brush for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t lost one single fiber.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now with my Bare Minerals powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, the only brush I use now for foundation application.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t get smashed down as my last brush did.  </li>
            <li> I find myself actually using less product with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other buffing style brushes and had issues with the bristles being too long, so that they bend and splay out when you put any pressure on the brush.  </li>
            <li> It had become loose a few weeks ago, and one morning last week it just fell off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mineral powder make up for about a year now, and my Mary Kay brush has always left little brush pieces on my face</li>
            <li> I was originally not going to write a review for this product because I received multiple emails asking me to review it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe how soft they are.  </li>
            <li> I was really not feeling the brush I&#x27;ve been using with my foundation, it just didn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints about the product or purchase.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to let people know that the head/ferule is not very well attached to the handle</li>
            <li> Absolutely no shedding, even after washing weekly.  </li>
            <li> Extremely dense, holds loose powder without flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> It protects the shape of the brush and keeps other things from getting on it or make-up from getting on the other things.</li>
            <li> Blends extremely well.  </li>
            <li> It is everything other reviews have stated (durability factor is still being tested).</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get powder all over the place like I have with other brushes.</li>
            <li> I think the rounded style helps to blend as I struggled with that in the past with flat brushes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually use mineral powder by itself because it doesn&#x27;t cover enough typically.</li>
            <li> Without hesitation, I returned the other one since that brush was rough and not comfortably dense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : 6&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Color bristles: Dark brown&lt;br /&gt;Handle:</li>
            <li> The most annoying thing is trying to get the bristles off of my face after using a brush and that does not happen with this brush.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of brushes, I mean a lot of very expensive brushes, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to experiencing the other two!</li>
            <li> I have not used this for your typical makeup purpose.</li>
            <li> Going to have to keep this one hidden from my daughters.</li>
            <li> I was worried because with some brushes, &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; also means less dense.</li>
            <li> Handle is long and sleek and there is a glorious and thick inch of bristle heaven to work with.</li>
            <li> The ferrule was attached tightly and was not lose and wiggling around at all.</li>
            <li> I feel that less of my mineral makeup goes to waste</li>
            <li> There was a little point sticking out, which I had to cut off, and then I notices that the bristles were not rounded on one side, but cut with a sloping slant.</li>
            <li> A little heavy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about 1-1.5 inches round</li>
            <li> but I was not happy with the short handle.</li>
            <li> I decided to wait a few days to do my review because I wanted to see how well the brush held up</li>
            <li> It picks up product with a breeze and doesn&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand brushes that go limp or fray after you wash them.</li>
            <li> The bristles hold firm.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the brushes that I have used in the past leave little black bristles on your face after you use it, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The ferule also seems to be very firmly in place and the bristles are firmly packed in there (</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying this company&#x27;s other products!!!</li>
            <li> This quality is usually twice the price.</li>
            <li> but isn&#x27;t so small that it will get lost at home.</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding make up brushes that I like.  </li>
            <li> Even the hard to apply areas around my nose</li>
            <li> When I tapped the excess, hardly anything came off.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic; I have a stash of every type of makeup and foundation out there.  </li>
            <li> Well search no more!</li>
            <li> This brush make make up application so much less of a chore!!!</li>
            <li> Makeup is too expensive to waste like that.</li>
            <li> The weight is substantial, but without being too heavy or difficult to use either.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than trying to use a makeup brush and it just cakes on the makeup or leaves brush strokes on my face.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this brush thinking I&#x27;d get an acceptable replacement for the tired brush that came with my mineral foundation.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than the hairs of a makeup brush falling out.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful when I wash my brushes to keep water from running into the base.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that weird powder face in pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!</li>
            <li> In fact, as silly as this sounds, I procrastinated using it for a while because I just couldn&#x27;t stop petting it like a dog!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> I mean, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen?</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when a makeup brush sheds it bristle.</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t even received the package yet (one star doc for annoying emails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Amazingly soft, dense brush! Will definitely be buying more of this brand to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush.  I have a lot of brushes, I mean a lot of very expensive brushes, and this is my favorite.  I very seldom write reviews but I had to do so for this brush.  It buffs out my makeup flawlessly.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  A great brush at a great price!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this Kabuki Brush! I was able to oder this during a special promotion for testing purposes and review. In my opinion this product was made well, and is easy to use. It is comfortable to hold and use, and I incorporate into my daily makeup routine. I prefer to use it while applying my bronzer. In my experience it distributes the makeup powder as I had hoped for, which is evenly and precise. It is very soft on my skin and I am happy with it&#x27;s quality! One of my favorite makeup brushes by far!</li>
            <li> Exceptional brush for bare minerals and other light powdered makeup. Very soft and thick</li>
            <li> Am I ever glad I came across this brush.  I love the feel  and how easy it spreads my liquid makeup.  When I am done, I look as if I have had my makeup applied by a pro. I had just purchased a brush from a department store that cost twice as much that I no longer need. I have recommended the Kabuki to several friends who use brushes.</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding make up brushes that I like.  I took the plunge and bought this online because the other reviewers were so positive.  And I will add to that.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS SO SOFT!!!  I have used it for blush and powder and do every day.  I even cleaned it, and while many other brushes lose a ton of brissles when they are cleaned, this didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC BRUSH COVERS GREAT</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It&#x27;s super soft and top quality. The bristles stay intact and don&#x27;t break off in my foundation as I&#x27;m applying to my face which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Kabuki brush! It is seriously the most amazing makeup brush I have ever owned. I use it with my mineral foundation. The foundation evenly holds onto the brush, and I am able to smoothly glide it on; there is no uneven coverage. The brush is also very sturdy. The bristles are extremely soft to the touch, but they firmly stay in their place. With my old brush, applying the foundation was a bit of a task. It seemed like the brush would never hold enough, so I had to keep going back and reapplying, and the bristles would all spread out when I used it. I am SO happy to have found this brush. I cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for the price!</li>
            <li> My new favorite brush! This is so much softer and works so much better than any other kabuki brush I have owned. I used it with both liquid and powder foundation and it blended so well with both. It doesn&#x27;t shed and that&#x27;s a true sign of a quality brush. I will totally buy more of these brushes. Can&#x27;t wait to try them all!</li>
            <li> This brush blends makeup well and does not shed. It has an easy-to-grip handle and an attractive appearance. I do wish that it were slightly larger, but this size is workable. It is easy to clean with a little soap and water. I use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The best foundation brush I ever used! Only a dab or two is necessary when using the brush &amp; you get perfect even coverage.</li>
            <li> I like this brush! A few things that I really appreciate:&lt;br /&gt;- The bristles (are they called bristles? You know what I mean) have some firmness to them, and deliver more precision than a run-of-the-mill big make-up brush. Good for blush application, which is what I use the brush for.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush comes with a sturdy plastic protector that you can put on after use, which is great for setting on a counter or placing in a make-up bag. It protects the shape of the brush and keeps other things from getting on it or make-up from getting on the other things. The cover is open on one end so it doesn&#x27;t trap moisture.&lt;br /&gt;- The handle is sleek and nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;Very attractive and functional brush - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  It works great with my mineral makeup and is super soft against my skin.  The handle is very comfortable in my hand and easy to hold.  I don&#x27;t need a ton of powder to get the coverage that I need and the application is nice and even.  I can&#x27;t get over how soft and comfortable the bristles are on my face.  The bristles also stay in place nicely and are very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have recently bought other brushes and by far this one is my favorite!  I have used it with powder and liquid foundation and I have had wonderful blending results with both types of makeup.  The brush cleanly and evenly applies the makeup with the look of perfection each and every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and helpful review.  This review is 100% my own opinion of the item.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage of this brush!! It works great with my powder and blends well.  I find myself actually using less product with this brush.  It seems to be well made as well, no shedding bristles and the handle is well attached and fits well in my hand too. I love the softness of the bristles as well. This brush make make up application so much less of a chore!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money... so glad I waited to check Amazon because I saved a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Smooth and silky very dense brush which provides great coverage.  Not one bit of shedding.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love the brush! Great for my powders. Will be ordering a second one for blushes. I like to have a brush for each make up I use. Thank you to Jessica for all her help. Great company and great service!</li>
            <li> Good quality make-up brush.</li>
            <li> Well made. Soft dense brush. Great for buffing in foundation. Tip, long stroke for liquid and short circle for powder.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised. I did not think a brush could be used for liquid foundation, but this brush gives me the perfect coverage! Love it, and it&#x27;s so soft! Definitely will order another one!</li>
            <li> Love love this bare minerals brush. Very soft. Makeup applies nicely with this brush. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> High quality, dense brush. Very pleased with my purchase.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! Can&#x27;t believe what a difference it made in application and appearance. My organic mineral makeup now looks like foundation and stays put rather than powder that slides off.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my shipment was incorrect from Amazon but the follow up from Castle Rock was on point and I had my new brush in just a couple of days. Will definitely order more brushes from Castle Rock.</li>
            <li> I received this brush quickly after ordering. The brush is great. It spreads powder evenly, smoothes blush on without being too harsh, and blends makeup very well. I&#x27;ve already washed it, and it washed and dried very well. Was just like new! Great brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I was really not feeling the brush I&#x27;ve been using with my foundation, it just didn&#x27;t blend well and I always felt like my makeup was caked on. This brush has solved all of that! It blends the makeup beautifully, giving me the coverage I want without having to layer it on, and no streaks or lines. And it&#x27;s SO soft. I have really sensitive skin, the kind that turns red when you so much as brush up against it, so using a traditional flat brush often left my skin ruddy after applying my makeup. With this brush, the bristles are so, so soft, and it requires the lightest of touches, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m beating myself up to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s equally amazing with powder, applies and blends evenly, so I don&#x27;t get that weird powder face in pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part was when I cleaned it. SO easy to clean, and none of the bristles fell out. Even better, once I left it to dry overnight, it was just as soft as the first time I used it. Awesome brush, so glad I added it to my collection. It&#x27;s the only one I use now!</li>
            <li> Loving this brush so far. I followed directly and cleaned it first with gentle soap and water, and let air dry. The next day when it was completely dry, I gave it a go with my mousse foundation. I was afraid that because I didn&#x27;t use mineral makeup that it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective. I was so wrong! It pulled the perfect amount of product from my container, and did an AMAZING job with coverage! I was really impressed, and won&#x27;t apply with fingers or sponges anymore. I wash after each use, let air dry, and then use the next day. No shedding, keeps it shape, and does a great job with my foundation application.</li>
            <li> This brush is sturdy and easy to clean. It picks up the makeup and distributes it evenly on the face. I have used other brushes that left pieces of brush on your face, This brush is made well and does not do that. It slips into my makeup bag very easy and handy. I love the Kabuki Brush!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Provides complete coverage.</li>
            <li> Great brush worth the money,</li>
            <li> This is the softest most effective brush I have EVER used on my face.  I have used it to apply lotions, serums and powders.  It keeps the product on the surface of the bristles so it is not wasted.  It is easy to clean between uses of different products because of the extra density. I would strongly suggest trying this brush if you are shopping for such a product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I fell in love with it.  Have used several others but this is great.  Plan on buying some others</li>
            <li> This brush has short,soft, dense bristles. The length of the bristles alone is a plus. It allows for more product to be lifted into the brush with less excess waisted.  This kabuki brush has multiple uses when done properly. Due to this brush not having a &amp;#34;flair&amp;#34; to it, this makes a great foundation brush. When used on an angle with light strokes it makes a great contour brush. The brush can also be used as a blush and overall face/powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 6&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Color bristles: Dark brown&lt;br /&gt;Handle: Wooden&lt;br /&gt;Uses: Multiple areas of the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent for purpose of review</li>
            <li> This is the softest brush I have ever used. The bristles are held into the head nicely and I dont fear them falling out during use. I really love the fact that it doesnt scratch my face it really feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount for the purpose of review but that in no way determined my review. My reviews are 100% my honest unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s official! I have a new favorite brush! I own several high end brushes and this one is by far the best. It really does give you an airbrushed finish. I have cleaned it three times so far and it hasn&#x27;t lost one single fiber. It also has retained it&#x27;s shape, perfectly. Many times, when you order makeup brushes, they will come with a pungent chemical smell but this one did not. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever owned a brush that was so densely packed and soft as this one. I have tried this with loose powder, pressed powder, light fluid foundation and thick, creamy foundation and the result is the same for each one. Perfect, airbrushed looking skin.</li>
            <li> Lovely Brush!  Thank you it works great!</li>
            <li> I was originally looking for the Bare Minerals kabuki brush but it&#x27;s very expensive. That&#x27;s when I happened upon this one. It was half the price of the Bare Minerals one so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I mean, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen? As it turns out, I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this brush! It gives me all the coverage I want, it&#x27;s easy to use, and easy to clean! I highly recommend this brush!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft. I love this brush and I recommend it to everyone. note that this brush is not for liquid makeup, and very good in applying the contours and mineral powder.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush. Extremely dense, holds loose powder without flying everywhere. This quality is usually twice the price. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> it is not bad.. but hair is too short.</li>
            <li> Love love this brush, I had a Kabuki brush from another company and it would shed bristles when I used it.  I toss them out when I got this one, highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> This brush is very very nice. I&#x27;ve been using mineral powder make up for about a year now, and my Mary Kay brush has always left little brush pieces on my face and I was always inhaling make up as I applied it. The kabuki brush does a much better job at application of mineral powder make up. It feels smooth going on, there&#x27;s no cloud of make-up while I apply, and I have yet to find a bristle on my face. I&#x27;d have preferred a better case / mode of transport, but the clear plastic sleeve works well enough for now. Super fast shipping too. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH WORKS WELL, MINERAL MAKEUP GOES ON SMOOTH AND IT DOESN&#x27;T SHED.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush!!!  Love love love it!  Customer service is the best ever!! I have already placed another order! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! My skin is not so great so I use liquid foundation then a pressed powder over top. I never thought a brush would affect the way my makeup went on so much! Will definitely order it again! Bonus; can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it for applying liquid foundation.  I prefer using a brush to apply foundation because I feel it gives the most natural result whole still providing good coverage.  I like that it&#x27;s bristles are just the right length, not to long like for a blush brush and not to short like a stippling brush.  This brush is also very soft to use on your face and I don&#x27;t find any of the bristles left on my face like I do after using some cheap brushes.  For the quality and price I think this brush is a great value.</li>
            <li> The kabuki brush is like no other brush I have ever used. The flawless coverage the bristles gives is amazing. I will definitely be purchasing the other two kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Works like the $50.00 ones! I love the buff and the look of finished skin.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice. I hate when a makeup brush sheds it bristle. These do not do this at all. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Ordered two, they came promptly and they hold my mineral makeup perfectly. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been in the cosmetic industry for many years. I was in the top 3 in my district for sales and I hosted many bashes for use and product displays. I have used almost every type of make-up brush and I own to many to count. But ,I just love this kabuki round brush. It is perfect for allover face use or just dabbing in certain spots. I like the firm but soft shot stubby bristles. This brush can be used with liquid foundations for a better application and clean up is easy. You will use way less of the liquid as you normally would applying it with your sponge or finger tips. I personally use a mineral and mineral pressed power. This brush has the look of a blush brush but it is a bit firmer for a more direct application approach.  I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This brush is worth every penny. The application is smooth and flawless. The brush does not shed and does not absorb liquid make-up. Also, is great with mineral foundation. I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Applys my foundation smoothly and evenly.. Soft bristles and made very well... Love this brush....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush or the brush line as a whole. I am a fan, not only for the price, which you can&#x27;t beat for a high quality brush, but also for how dense and high quality these are!</li>
            <li> This is the second kabuki brush I&#x27;ve gotten from Simply Essentials.  I find myself running them across my hands and arms because they feel so GREAT.  It&#x27;s hard to describe how soft they are.  I&#x27;ve shown them off to my friends and they are all surprised by the feel of them too.  Great product.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful. I relied on the description of this brush before buying since I can’t touch, feel or test it out. I found the description very detailed informing me of all the things that matter most to me while the descriptions on other similar brushes were vague and lacking and left me with questions. Well, there’s no question about this brush. It is just as described. The brush hairs are super soft and picked up powder easily and provided an even application. The natural bristles felt great against my skin and my mineral makeup and blush glided on beautifully. The hairs did not shed and the brush is well made. I am very pleased with the quality of the brush and the great experience I had in using this brush.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than trying to use a makeup brush and it just cakes on the makeup or leaves brush strokes on my face.  This brush is like a magic wand and leaves a nice even layer of makeup across my face.  Even the hard to apply areas around my nose it does a great job.  The bristles are so soft and feel nice against my face!</li>
            <li> This was the first ever kabuki brush I have used and I am wondering WHY I have never used one! I really like the way it uses my powder. It uses much less and applies it very uniform. I can go over any &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; area and add a bit more and it blends seamlessly! The brush is soft and sturdy and makes my getting ready time easy and efficient! Love this brush!</li>
            <li> My first experience using a brush to apply loose powder and I absolutely CAN tell the difference (as opposed to using a puff or sponge)!!&lt;br /&gt;Still getting the feel of it but I am sure the Kabuki Brush Round is a keeper!!!  Looking forward to experiencing the other two!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush.  I do suggest that it should be tryed..</li>
            <li> I love the Kabuki brushes! I was able to review both this and the angled brush for Kabuki and was so pleased with the results! I have gone through so many makeup brushes that scratch my face or don’t provide even coverage of my makeup but these brushes do not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft enough not to hurt your face or poke you but strong enough that the bristles don’t fall out over time, rendering the brush eventually useless. These brushes have sturdy wooden handles and they come with a one year guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the brushes with liquid, cream, or powder foundation and they will do a fantastic job due to the densely packed bristles. You are definitely getting a good value for your money here and there is no risk at all. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a good brush for a reasonable price and I received it in a timely fashion,I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this brush.  It&#x27;s like silky velvet.  I love it!  I never used a perfect makeup brush before and this to me is perfect.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! I brought the angled brush and the full kabuki brush together.  I am using them for my mineral makeup and mineral veil.  They work great!  You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully soft brush and I really love that it&#x27;s rounded slightly at the top. The bristles are nice and dense but I was hoping that it it would have a bigger head of bristles if that makes sense....it&#x27;s about 1-1.5 inches round and I&#x27;ve been looking for something 2-2.5 inches. I have a flat head brush in the size I like but i&#x27;m not fond of how it feels on my face when buffing- I like the feel of the rounded head more than the flat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is good for this brush&#x27;s quality. Coverage is great but takes more swirling around the face to achieve it compared to a bigger brush</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It is so soft and sturdy.  It does a great job distributing powder evenly.  I have used several brushes that have left me looking like I have powder on or it wasn&#x27;t that even.  This helps the makeup look even and natural with out a lot of thought to it.  It does a great job blending blush as well.</li>
            <li> A lot of the brushes that I have used in the past leave little black bristles on your face after you use it, this one doesn&#x27;t. The brush is sturdy and strong. A little heavy but I like that because I feel like it is well made. The brush is also a good size. Not to small and not too large to it is easy to use while applying blush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! So soft &amp; works so great to evenly apply my pressed mineral foundation. It doesn&#x27;t shed bristles either. The handle is just the right size too.</li>
            <li> My face and I are very happy with this brush!  I&#x27;d been looking for a brush that doesn&#x27;t shed for way too long and always purchased ones that are &amp;#34;guaranteed not to shed&amp;#34; without luck.  I tried one more time, half expecting to be picking hairs out of my eyes and off my face yet again, but this one doesn&#x27;t shed, it&#x27;s super soft, solidly made and works really well.</li>
            <li> Has a rounded top. It feels really soft and lovely on my skin but doesn&#x27;t hold the mineral makeup very well. I&#x27;ve worn mineral makeup over 12 years so I know how to put it on. This brush doesn&#x27;t hold the makeup and my shirt is covered by the time I finish. Makeup is too expensive to waste like that. I prefer a flat top brush.</li>
            <li> The kabuki brush is ideal. It seems to be very well made and should hold up well. I like the size as it travels well but isn&#x27;t so small that it will get lost at home. The pressed powders and loose powders go on evenly as the bristles of this brush are super packed super thick and are extremely fine. I think the rounded style helps to blend as I struggled with that in the past with flat brushes. Absolutely no complaints about the product or purchase. I contacted Jessica at Castle Rock Essentials to let her know how happy I was with this product and her response was personal and prompt. I&#x27;ll be buying products from her company again.</li>
            <li> Soft like you have never felt before! I have not used this for your typical makeup purpose. We have a daughter with some tactile issues and one of the things that helps is rubbing soft things on her face. She has always preferred makeup brushes. I have always been on the hunt for the softest and most gentile one I could find. Well search no more! This thing is remarkably soft, it is so amazing. She can sit there for hours with this thing on her cheek keeping her calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though they did not create this product for this very reason, I want to thank the makers of this wonderful brush. You have no idea the positive effects it has had in our home.</li>
            <li> I have used various Kabuki brushes for many years.  Some cost less some cost more. This is by far the best I have ever used. I use it for mineral powder makeup.  Holds the powder better, buffs better. All around a great brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is so versatile, I just love it! I have used it to apply my powder, my blush and even my bronzer. It really has become my favorite go-to overall brush. It picks up powder and gently sweeps it on and with just a few taps it cleans out pretty easily without needing to be cleaned out so often. The handle is the perfect length and the bristles are silky smooth, like a mink coat!I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I love the way it puts the makeup on my face. I would definitely buy the brush again.</li>
            <li> Dense, soft bristles. Blends extremely well.  Will definitely buy it again. I wish they had a full set of brushes in this same product. Or maybe they do....will check.</li>
            <li> Beautiful makeup brush. The brush is soft and gentle. Perfect for my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this!  The brush feels very well made and the bristles are very soft.  It was packaged with a coupon for a % off for a different brush!  Buying make up brushes online makes me nervous because I never know what it&#x27;ll feel like, but it is luxurious to use.  It has a small plastic slip on coverlet that I didn&#x27;t even realize I would love.  I love putting the brush away protected from having the bristles mashed.  The handle is just the right length and my daughter keeps trying to steal it.  My 5 year old son loves to just brush his face with it.  Great find.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> *** Update: My original review gave this 5 stars but I came back to re-rate because I&#x27;ve recently had some problems with the brush.  The head fell off the handle last week.  It had become loose a few weeks ago, and one morning last week it just fell off.  I have since reattached it using superglue, but I know that won&#x27;t be a permanent fix.  I am very careful when I wash my brushes to keep water from running into the base. I know the bristles can loosen and that&#x27;s when you get a lot of shedding... I kept this at 3 stars because the bristles are still firmly secure in the ferule, and it is still a super soft brush.  But I wanted to let people know that the head/ferule is not very well attached to the handle and if you don&#x27;t want to reaffix it to the brush at a later date, then perhaps try a different buffing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the brush every day for over a month now, and it is honestly my favorite brush in my collection.  Absolutely no shedding, even after washing weekly.  The bristles are extremely dense, very soft, and the perfect length.  I&#x27;ve tried other buffing style brushes and had issues with the bristles being too long, so that they bend and splay out when you put any pressure on the brush.  Not so with this one!  Very even foundation application, great blending tool, and so incredibly soft on my face. I love it and HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality brush at a ridiculously affordable price.</li>
            <li> The kabuki brush is now my new blush and powder brush the bristle part are so soft and when u applied to your face doesn&#x27;t mess up the bristles like cheap one does and not rough on your face very soft , makes your makeup look professional look without the expense that places would charge you and small to fit in my makeup travel bag</li>
            <li> Amazing quality brush. Invest in this- you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brush!  I tore into this package as soon as it arrived and was not disappointed!  The brush is so incredibly soft, yet holds the powder and distributes it evenly- could not ask for more!  Just a warning- the brush is so soft you may or may not want to continually rub it on your skin!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft. It works great with my mineral makeup.  It&#x27;s made well. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out. The brush puts the makeup on evenly. Love it.</li>
            <li> Well made brush.  No stray hairs.  Very densely packed hairs providing good coverage of my mineral make-up.  Soft, non-irratating feel to the skin.  Going to have to keep this one hidden from my daughters.</li>
            <li> Very soft and useful brush.  I like the way the powder blush I use goes on evenly when using this brush.  I like the rounded head and the size of the brush over all.  It is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is the best I&#x27;ve used in my 35 years of life! I am a makeup fanatic; I have a stash of every type of makeup and foundation out there.  I also have experimented with various makeup and foundation tools. I am currently using cream foundation in a compact and this kabuki brush impeccably helps with making my face absolutely flawless.  It is important for me to cover every imperfection on my face... and I have a good amount to cover (old acne scars/discoloration)! The bristles are incredibly soft, yet the brush itself is perfectly dense.  Hands down, the only brush I use now for foundation application.  I look forward to applying my makeup now that I have this phenomenal tool in my kit.&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered another kabuki brush from another very popular makeup brand, it is a telescoping brush that you click for 3 different sizes. I tried both brushes and there was NO competition. I was surprised, as I had expected the more expensive, popular brand name to come out on top. Without hesitation, I returned the other one since that brush was rough and not comfortably dense.&lt;br /&gt; I cant begin to tell you how soft these bristles are. I was worried because with some brushes, &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; also means less dense. Not so with this beauty! Soft, dense, perfect length bristles that DONT SHED!! Perfect handle length too...&lt;br /&gt;Cant say enough about this product and the customer service was just as impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, and I look forward to trying this company&#x27;s other products!!!</li>
            <li> I just started my collection of make-up brushes and I have to say this Kabuki Brush is probably one of my favorites. I use it with just about everything, from foundation to full coverage face powder as well as blush. The bristles are soft but sturdy and doesn&#x27;t shed. It provides full coverage with any application of make-up. The handle is a good size for my hands. My favorite use for this brush is for applying loose powder. With this brush, it encompasses a large surface of my face and does so evenly, with out making my skin look caked on. Highly recommended for any make-up artist from beginners to full on fab advance.</li>
            <li> This is one of the SOFTEST kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve ever had the PLEASURE of working with. Handle is long and sleek and there is a glorious and thick inch of bristle heaven to work with. It evenly distributes and makes you finished look FLAWLESS! I was given the oppertunity to review this product and be given a intro price. You need this tool to perfect your overall look!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my daughter to use to apply mineral foundation. The brush is very soft and applies great coverage! This brush is a great value for the quality.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now with my Bare Minerals powder foundation.  I get great coverage with this brush and it does not shed at all! Love it!</li>
            <li> Really nice make-up brush.  Has a nice weight and fits comfortably in my hand.  Distributes the /mineral makeup easily and evenly and is very soft against my skin.  The coverage is flawless and, my favorite, it doesn&#x27;t LOOK like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup at all.  Have never tried any of Kabuki&#x27;s products, but am very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this brush. I feel that less of my mineral makeup goes to waste and I am left with a beautiful airbrush - like look.</li>
            <li> I love this Kabuki brush! I use it with Bare Minerals make-up and this brush provides better coverage than the Kabuki brush I previously used. The coverage is even, smoothe and allows me to maintain a natural finish.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, just as described and flows beautifully</li>
            <li> It is everything other reviews have stated (durability factor is still being tested). I use bare minerals and I am impressed so far.  Holds the powder well and transfers well. I am used to a slightly wider brush, I would have preferred if this brush was wider but like many things in life, you adjust when you find a good tool.</li>
            <li> I have been using kabuki brushes from different vendors for years.  I received the castle rock brush on Monday and have been using it since. The brush is really soft and does not shed. The handle is very sturdy and comfortable in your hand.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  This is the softest makeup brush I have ever had.  Blend my mineral make beautifully.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes...bought the angled one as well</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Super thick and soft. Does not shed bristles. Spreads the make-up evenly throughout the face. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This brush is truly fantastic. It is so soft that applying makeup becomes a real treat for your face. The rounded top makes application very easy and I am able to effortlessly and evenly apply my mineral makeup to all parts of  my face.  The bristles are soft, but also dense so they flex slightly without breaking.  I loved my previous Kabuki brush but I was not happy with the short handle. This one has the perfect length handle that makes it really easy to apply the makeup.  Although I love makeup, I am far from an expert at applying it but this brush made it so easy. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This brush is the best brush I EVER bought.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft, the bristles are dense and I love that the bristles are short.&lt;br /&gt;Best brush ever!</li>
            <li> Loved the brush. My foundation went on beautifully, and looked great</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this makeup brush! As a licensed esthetician I can be very picky about my makeup brushes. Some of the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; types will microscopically irritate your skin which can lead to sensitivity and even breakouts for some people. I tested this brush thoroughly and I have experienced none of that. I use an all natural skin care line and whenever I introduce a new product or brush, I will immediately get a reaction. In the case with this kabuki brush there was no irritation whatsoever. The bristles are amazingly soft and hold onto makeup very well. I use mineral makeup and have had no problem and consistently get great coverage. And what&#x27;s even better, as you don&#x27;t need to keep using your product for &amp;#34;more coverage&amp;#34;, your makeup will also last longer. Win win! Buy 2 or more of these for all your makeup needs and for your friends too!</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft.  It holds and blends the mineral foundation very well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush thinking I&#x27;d get an acceptable replacement for the tired brush that came with my mineral foundation.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be better!  This first time I used this brush, I thought I was rubbing my face with velvet. It is soooo soft and the bristles are very dense.  Then I noticed how much better my makeup looked after using it.  My skin looked flawless!  I decided to wait a few days to do my review because I wanted to see how well the brush held up and I&#x27;m happy to say that it is very durable.  There is no bristle fallout and is still a pleasure to use every day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kabuki brush as a replacement for the kabuki brush I received with my bare minerals.  The bare minerals brush was great however, it was always shedding and I would have ended up replacing it eventually, instead I lost it lol. I needed a new brush and read lots of reviews. This brush was reasonably priced and I decided to take a chance...it worked great!! Maximum coverage, long handle and easy to use. I can honestly say its way better than my bare minerals kabuki. And....no shedding!!! This is a steal works beautiful at a great price. Worth the purchase! :)</li>
            <li> SOFT AS A BABYS BOTTOM--I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT--PUTS ON MAKEUP FLAWLESSLY---TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT--MY WIFE IS FUSSY ABOUT HER MAKEUP AND SHE LOVES IT--W.S.CARTER</li>
            <li> The Kabuki round brush by Simply Essentials is one of the best makeup brushes I have ever used. Its great because the bristles are dense and really secured so they don&#x27;t fall out when I am applying makeup to my face but the bristles are so soft as well. The diameter of the brush is the perfect size I have a lot of brushes that are to big and more makeup goes on than brush than what I really need. I also like that I can use the brush for my liquid, mineral or powder makeup. I especially like this brush when I am applying my Bare Mineral faux tan because it adheres so well to the bristles and am able to get an even color all over my face. The length and width of the handle is just right and fits good in my hand and makes applying makeup so easy. I do have to say what I am impressed about the most is that I love that it doesn&#x27;t shed and I don&#x27;t have bristles all over my face. The most annoying thing is trying to get the bristles off of my face after using a brush and that does not happen with this brush. I did receive a discount for this brush so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback. I recommend this brush and like that the makeup also adheres to the brush so I don&#x27;t get powder all over the place like I have with other brushes. This a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> Works great with Tarte BB cream and foundation. This brush is so soft and blends the makeup evenly. Love it and will order again.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is one of my favorites. I have a ton of makeup brushes (around 70) and they range from $1-$40 each. I&#x27;m always looking for brushes that impress me. This one definitely did that. It&#x27;s very soft, yet the bristles are dense. It picks up product with a breeze and doesn&#x27;t waste it. It blends liquid, powder, and cream with ease. This is a great brush for foundation, blush, contour, or powder. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s so versatile. The ferrule was attached tightly and was not lose and wiggling around at all. When washing the brush, there is no loss in bristles. This brush is strong, sturdy, and definitely made to last. I definitely grab this brush much more than many others I have. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> I was originally not going to write a review for this product because I received multiple emails asking me to review it and I hadn&#x27;t even received the package yet (one star doc for annoying emails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks amazing, my bare minerals has never gone on more seamlessly. Amazing brush super happy with it! I will update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a makeup brush for a very long time.  I finally found this one and it is truly amazing!  I love this brush more than words can every explain.  I love how the brush is soft but firm.  It helps me to see how much makeup I am putting on.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t get smashed down as my last brush did.  This brush is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  This has changed my makeup world for the best.  Thank you for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Nice soft brush, but it was not cut (shaped) well. There was a little point sticking out, which I had to cut off, and then I notices that the bristles were not rounded on one side, but cut with a sloping slant.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I&#x27;ve let replace my most favorite and cherished foundation brush in the last decade. So happy!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve gotten, and I love this one too! It&#x27;s firm enough to give really great coverage, but soft enough to not leave lines. I use it with my Bare Essentials make up, and it makes my make up look just that much better. It&#x27;s also easy to clean, which I appreciate. I can&#x27;t stand brushes that go limp or fray after you wash them. This one bounces right back! Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy and the appropriate size to hold. It has great density and softness of the brush. The brush is very dense, the dome top does not yield severely when pressure is applied. The brush is so amazingly soft, it feels luxurious!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually use mineral powder by itself because it doesn&#x27;t cover enough typically. This kabuki brush picked up all of the powder that I dusted into the cap! When I tapped the excess, hardly anything came off. However, when I applied the mineral powder, I wasn&#x27;t left with a glob of powder in one spot with a light layer in another. This brush applies and blends product very nicely. Now, I really like that mineral powder!</li>
            <li> This brush is very well made.  The bristles hold firm.  There is nothing worse than the hairs of a makeup brush falling out.  I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about that with this one!  It works great with my mineral powder.  The bristles are so soft!</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, however, still trying to figure if I&#x27;m using more powder than normal. Last brush was from Bare Minerals and I could tap off the excess powder before applying.  This brush does not release any excess powder.</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft and dense.  I love the way my powered mineral makeup looks with this brush.  The bristles on my old brush literally feels like needles after a couple of months, (and it was more expensive than this one).  The handle is just the right length, I don&#x27;t like the short handles or extensively long handles.  Looking forward to reviewing this brush after a couple of months of daily use.</li>
            <li> This is truly a beautiful quality brush at a surprisingly low price point.  I have tried many expensive, high end brushes before and can honestly say this can match up to any one of those.  It is great that you don&#x27;t have to sacrifice quality for affordability.  When I first received it, I was initially struck by just how soft and luxurious it was.  In fact, as silly as this sounds, I procrastinated using it for a while because I just couldn&#x27;t stop petting it like a dog!  It reminds me a bit of the Cargo magic brush but I actually like this one even more, because I find it softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally got around to using it, I found that the softness doesn&#x27;t compromise the functionality of the brush.  While the bristles may be soft, they also hold up fairly firm and don&#x27;t flop or splay around (like other soft brushes I&#x27;ve tried that feel nice, but require a ton of pressing because the bristles flop around).  I&#x27;ve tried this with liquid foundation and found that either stippling or buffing motions work very well with it.  When I finished I had a nice, streak free finish that looked polished--yet also natural and not too caked on either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is also very well made, without any shedding issues so far.  The ferule also seems to be very firmly in place and the bristles are firmly packed in there (which I like--when I&#x27;ve tried some other brands, sometimes they&#x27;ve come with loose ferules, which I really don&#x27;t like because obviously, you want your brush to last as long as possible!) The weight is substantial, but without being too heavy or difficult to use either.  Overall, I don&#x27;t think many people will go wrong with this brush!</li>
            <li> Excellent Quality!  I will be ordering more of these!  I like having extras so I still have something to use when I am washing and drying my brushes.</li>
            <li> I have used other brushes but this one works really good! I was actually very surprised. The bristles are very soft, and it worked really well with my liquid foundation. I highly recommend this brush if you wear makeup on a daily basis.</li>
