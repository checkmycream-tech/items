            <li>I really enjoy washing my hands with this product.</li>
            <li>I makes me feel like I&#x27;m walking through a piney woods somewhere - fantastic and worth every penny!</li>

            <li>Love the large size!</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with Thymes.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find it online, as my local store doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>soap is mild.  </li>
            <li>I liked the larger sized bottle too.</li>
            <li>It smells really fresh and works well.</li>
            <li>These products are just Fresh, not overpowering......</li>
            <li>Frasier Fir Hand Wash is a product that you use and it brings a smile to your face.</li>
            <li>I love Thymes products and especially the Frasier Fir during the holidays.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, reminiscent of my years camping in Northern Minnesota.</li>
            <li>I am only putting it out during the holidays (which means it lasts longer :)</li>
            <li>They use quality ingredients and develop luxurious scents that make you feel pampered and keep you coming back for more.</li>
            <li>The hand wash was identifie as a Thymes Frasier Fir Large hand wash, but buried within the ad for it were</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item before and really like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t go up much</li>
            <li>and so you don&#x27;t get too much gel,</li>
            <li>This soap is a very close approximation, so if you like the candle smell, you&#x27;ll probably like the smell of this soap.  </li>
            <li>Classic way to make a customer happy.l  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t resist this scent in our home for the entire winter season and admit I use the soap any time of year when I feel I need a fresh uplifting scent.</li>
            <li>(after looking more closely, there was that smaller size oz total shown-even though the product was always referred to as &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34;--which, I believe, is only the 17 oz size.  </li>
            <li>but I love how you can actually SMELL it once you wash your hands, unlike some other brands where the scent is barely detectable.</li>
            <li>I have used it every day for a few years and would miss it greatly if I could not use it , at least, once a day.</li>
            <li>I poured it into a mason jar soap dispenser, but after doing so I realized that this soap is clear.</li>
            <li>My most recent bottle is only about 1/3 empty and the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My adult sons also like the fragrance---</li>
            <li>I have been using Thymes frasier fir candles for the last few Christmas seasons, and we really love the scent of those.  </li>
            <li>Expensive, though we use it sparingly with good results . .</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much so it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little of the soap as it is concentrated so worth every penny.</li>

            <li> I like the design of the bottle, too - simple, clear green with a single pine tree.</li>

            <li> Sad that it has to cost so much.</li>
            <li> I feel taken away for a moment to a fresh forest of Christmas trees in the cold snow.</li>
            <li> I bought it because someone had previously given it to me as a gift.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it goes pretty fast, and it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> We have a bottle of this liquid soap in all of our bathrooms and kitchen all year round.</li>
            <li> so Ihad the approximate amount that would have come with the larger advertised size.  </li>
            <li> However, their hand wash pumps are difficult to open or they fail.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the kitchen soap, hand soap, lotions, house spray (save for Company) and the candles.</li>
            <li> It does not smell artificial at all</li>

I love the scent, reminiscent of my years camping in Northern Minnesota. The one click ordering was a breeze, the order arrives on time, in good condition, and I&#x27;m getting down...time to reorder soon. I just love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much.  It is fresh and woodsy, and I just love the way it kind of wakes up your senses when you wash up with it.  My neighbor was over and washed her hands in my kitchen, and she liked it so much that I ended up buying one for her, as well.  Unfortunately, it goes pretty fast, and it is very expensive.  I have not replenished my supply, and neither has my neighbor.  Sad that it has to cost so much.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hand wash, and also have the oil for potporri and reed infuser liquid. I was so pleased to find it online, as my local store doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li> Great smelling soap. I bought it because someone had previously given it to me as a gift. A bit pricey, but if you can afford it, you&#x27;ll be happy you bought it.</li>
            <li> The hand wash was identifie as a Thymes Frasier Fir Large hand wash, but buried within the ad for it were two different oz&lt;br /&gt;sizes, one was 17 oz and the other was 8 oz.  In fact, the shipped size was 8 oz and I contacted the seller about the misleading ad  (after looking more closely, there was that smaller size oz total shown-even though the product was always referred to as &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34;--which, I believe, is only the 17 oz size.  Well, the seller immediately returned my email with an apology for an Amazon error and shipped another 8.25 oz size to me via FedEx so Ihad the approximate amount that would have come with the larger advertised size.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the seller. Classic way to make a customer happy.l  And the hand was is terrific.  Christmas tree presence everytime I wash my hands.  Nostalgic--and it works well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and it leaves your hands moisturized and not dried out.  Love the large size!</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly - like a walk in the woods.  I like the design of the bottle, too - simple, clear green with a single pine tree. I have this in all of my bathrooms - really nice for guests.</li>
            <li> Love the fir smell. good bargain for refilling my pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before and really like the fragrance.  My adult sons also like the fragrance---so they are getting bottles in their stockings!</li>
            <li> This soap smells great!  Smells just like Christmas to me.  You don&#x27;t need to use much so it should last a long time.  I liked the larger sized bottle too.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Fraiser Fir line. It does not smell artificial at all and I have yet to find anything that comes close to this beautiful scent.  I love the soap because my hands have the best scent of a fresh cut tree.  I feel taken away for a moment to a fresh forest of Christmas trees in the cold snow. I also use the Fraiser Fir Hand Lotion with this. You only need a little of the soap as it is concentrated so worth every penny. Every Winter season this scent is everywhere in my home. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the kitchen soap, hand soap, lotions, house spray (save for Company) and the candles. I bought a three wick but an going to buy a few smaller candles. I also have the pinecone reed diffuser and potpourri as well as the freshener oil. I just can&#x27;t resist this scent in our home for the entire winter season and admit I use the soap any time of year when I feel I need a fresh uplifting scent.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance....unique great bottle to display, arrived on time, will order again, would recommend to anyone interested, enjoy</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction, excellent hand wash!</li>
            <li> Ah, this hand wash smells amazing! Granted I am only putting it out during the holidays (which means it lasts longer :) but I love how you can actually SMELL it once you wash your hands, unlike some other brands where the scent is barely detectable. Perfect for the guest bath in our house and visitors have commented on how great the scent is.</li>
            <li> Smells just like Christmas. The pump doesn&#x27;t go up much and so you don&#x27;t get too much gel, but I guess that&#x27;s OK cause it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hand wash, I use the candles also. But, with this being an item that is clearly meant to be displayed and used next to the sink....I was unable to get the labels off the side of the bottle. I poured it into a mason jar soap dispenser, but after doing so I realized that this soap is clear. Not what I was expecting at all when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Smells great, kind of woodsy. Cleans hands without leaving a residue. Everybody loves to use it. Will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with Thymes. They use quality ingredients and develop luxurious scents that make you feel pampered and keep you coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Our family LOVES this soap.  The fragrence in lovely and transports you to a fragrant Christmas forrest with each use.  Expensive, though we use it sparingly with good results . . . we can&#x27;t seem to give it up!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but amazing! Smells incredible!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy washing my hands with this product. It smells really fresh and works well. I use the dish soap and the Frasier Fir diffusing oil. These products are just Fresh, not overpowering......love them!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using Thymes frasier fir candles for the last few Christmas seasons, and we really love the scent of those.

            <li> great scent, festive container. soap is mild.  I purchased one for each room of my house and just love washing my hands!</li>
            <li> This liquid hand soap is wonderful….fragrance ofd a Christmas tree lingers beyond the season!</li>
            <li> This scent from Thymes is absolutely the best evergreen scent I have ever smelled in any product, other than the original trees themselves!  I love to use this hand soap and accompanying lotion throughout the year, not just around the holidays.  I makes me feel like I&#x27;m walking through a piney woods somewhere - fantastic and worth every penny!</li>
