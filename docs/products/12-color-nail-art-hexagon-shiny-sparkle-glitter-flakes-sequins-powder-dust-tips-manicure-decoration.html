            <li>Great product for the price, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>These are so affordable and a great custom addition to my manicure.</li>
            <li>but it works great and even looks great on your nails</li>
            <li>The colors are really cute and bright!!!</li>
            <li>And when I put them on my nails, they were gorgeous.</li>
            <li>this is really good glitter</li>
            <li>I got a good mix of opaque and iridescent.</li>
            <li>Loved them came well packaged</li>
            <li>freinds just love this output.the shimmer and shine is ideal to match any accessory they have</li>
            <li>They were packaged nicely and the colours are more beautiful than the picture</li>
            <li>I brought them to my manicurist and she was easily able to use them to create a great &amp;#34;mermaid theme&amp;#34; nail to match my daughters birthday theme.</li>
            <li>and I believe she will love them!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Made my nails look amazing.</li>
            <li>I suggest to buy this for your own use rather than for clients.</li>
            <li>Well, and there are a couple glitter colors that are nice.</li>
            <li>but it is still really nice.</li>
            <li>I love love LOOOOVE these!</li>
            <li>Very bright and vibrant colours.</li>
            <li>the glitter itself is okay but not cut very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the colors are really nice, also the shipment was really quick, just make sure you have the right glue and something to place them</li>
            <li>but I was extremely pleased with the colors I got.</li>
            <li>This product is just OK.</li>
            <li>I saw many nail art pictures with this neat look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad, because I bought these for the iridescent.</li>
            <li>This makes it slightly more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was more of a clear/white color.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the different colors</li>
            <li>Definitely a better deal then going to a craft store.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Stylish.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>I love the glitter.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something bigger, but nonetheless, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>Okay, wouldn&#x27;t order again though.</li>
            <li>It was more like glitter.</li>
            <li>Overall they are adorable!!!!!</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also, most of the pots weren&#x27;t as full as they could have been</li>
            <li>These are nice and pretty color</li>
            <li>They are kind of large and translucent almost</li>
            <li>Great product, even cuts, and no double colors.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come in a case-looking package as shown in the picture, but it does come in pretty cute packaging that lets you see all the colors.</li>
            <li>guess the only good thing is that it arrived pretty fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>For instance, when I put purple glitters on my nails, it looks very light, very far from bright vivid purple.</li>
            <li>Had I read the full description though I would not have purchased them as they seem like something else.</li>
            <li>it was rather cool</li>
            <li>and I got some good feed back on my nails as well.</li>
            <li>Still not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Colors look slightly different from the picture, and rather than a tray I received separate little jars, but the glitters are very bright and large and are great for nail art.</li>
            <li>These sequins are very cute to use on your nails, just keep in mind you have to use a lot of them for the color to show good, except for the silver gold red and blue.</li>
            <li>It comes exactly like it does in the picture, with all different colors and packaged really nice!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Even though the packaging sucked the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>very pretty and shiny.</li>
            <li>cool and fun to use.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap, pretty, and come in their own individual containers.</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I have received many compliments when wearing them.</li>
            <li>The box is kinda small but a great buy.</li>
            <li>It shines so much and the packet came a week early. :)</li>
            <li>When i first got these I thought they were a rip off</li>
            <li>The same is with most colors.</li>
            <li>I want to order some more of this glitter, different colors of course, but overall, I am enjoying these glitters.</li>
            <li>it was nicely packaged and it came faster than expected</li>
            <li>When i got them i have to admit i thought they would be way bigger :) but the box they are in is 12x9 in cm.</li>
            <li>My favorite is blue, which is pretty dark, really bright and vivid, and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Firstly, it does not quite match the colors in the picture and in real.</li>
            <li>These arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got fairly large hexagon glitters.</li>
            <li>Nice, all the colors are pretty, the only thing is that they don&#x27;t come in with that big container to keep all of them together.</li>
            <li>I have black and white as well which is great.</li>
            <li>they are really nice to use as accents for nail art designs and come in neat little plastic cases to separate all the colors neatly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Most of my containers were empty.</li>
            <li>&amp;Modern.</li>
            <li>on.this has so much potencial fir ideas.</li>
            <li>There are a few that aren&#x27;t cut that well, but there&#x27;s so many that it doesn&#x27;t really matter!</li>
            <li>Nice size...bigger than the small ones at the dollar stores.</li>
            <li>but when I finally got it most of the other reviews were right</li>
            <li>glitter only fills about half of the container, and many containers were only a quarter filled (the glitter is all over the box.)</li>
            <li>These are larger glitter hexagon shapes and it is EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li>3 stars only because the colors are vivid, very pretty,  unfortunately, they are the size of your regular glitter ones very small,  and not the size that shows in the picture,  I needed them for me to be able to place them individually but can&#x27;t do that because of their size, however, I was able to use them as a cluster and it worked out nicely that way,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I will use all of the colors it came with, a few are kind of ugly,  but the pretty colors are amazing.</li>
            <li>The little containers are about the size of a quarter and not all of them were completely filled.</li>
            <li>fthis is a really good product even though it comes a little messy</li>
            <li>When I got this product in the mail, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>but I definitely have not used them as much as I thought.</li>
            <li>Not really a big problem, they all have a decent amount.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see a need for them normally since I have smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re pretty transparent outside of the pots so all the colors except for the black, red and a purple look exactly the same on the nail.</li>
            <li>The glitter is uneven and full of snags and crooked edges.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, most of the colors are not bright enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind because I like the black anyway</li>

            <li> Some of the containers are half filled, others less that half.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these to do glitter placement, and they are much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of the dark blue hexagons shown in the bottom row third to the left, I got a black.</li>
            <li> The shapes were a little bigger than I expected, but not too big.</li>
            <li> Total let down.</li>
            <li> Now bring it down to the middle of your thumb.</li>
            <li> it was a little bigger than what i wanted</li>
            <li> was expecting the glitters to be a little bigger</li>
            <li> The sequins could be a little smaller, I thought they were a little big</li>
            <li> and it came before O expected it to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this happened as the containers were tightly closed when I opened the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It came on time, but not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews that a con was that they stick out a bit and catch on clothes or other things.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers weren&#x27;t closed tight so they spilled in the box a bit</li>
            <li> I was lured in by the ultra-low price, but ultimately it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the dark blue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really worth it</li>
            <li> This makes it look sloppy and we threw a bunch of individual pieces in a discard pile because they were really choppy.</li>
            <li> and there small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it looks on my nails yet.</li>
            <li> As for the size of the containers, they are a bit small.</li>
            <li> Both had a box that listed a completely different product, which made them awkward to give as a gift to my little sisters...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like the glitters but am not very impressed with the shipping and the mess of glitter everywhere.</li>
            <li> The box was ripped and mangled, which is a shame because they&#x27;d be hard to store otherwise.</li>

            <li> The glitter is uneven and full of snags and crooked edges.  I was lured in by the ultra-low price, but ultimately it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> cool and fun to use.  these work well.</li>
            <li> The packaging was so broken when it got here. The glitter doesn&#x27;t even show up when you put it on your nails. Total let down.</li>
            <li> When i first got these I thought they were a rip off and they wouldn&#x27;t last, but once I used them I realized there&#x27;s a ton, the colors are different than in the image, but I like the colors you get over the colors in the picture anyways, and even if you only use a couple of the colors, it&#x27;s such a low price that it&#x27;s worth it. There are a few that aren&#x27;t cut that well, but there&#x27;s so many that it doesn&#x27;t really matter! It also got here over two weeks earlier than it was supposed to too:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light blue&lt;br /&gt;Light purple&lt;br /&gt;Light pink&lt;br /&gt;Pink&lt;br /&gt;Light green&lt;br /&gt;Yellow&lt;br /&gt;Orange&lt;br /&gt;Gold&lt;br /&gt;Red&lt;br /&gt;Black&lt;br /&gt;White&lt;br /&gt;Silver</li>
            <li> Perfect. I like all the colors and it came before O expected it to.</li>
            <li> I loved these glitters for the price paid! I didn&#x27;t get all the colors there but I was extremely pleased with the colors I got. The Red looked almost pinkish. Also, most of the pots weren&#x27;t as full as they could have been but I can&#x27;t complain for the great bargain I got. i am already thinking of buying another pack! I suggest to buy this for your own use rather than for clients. It won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> once again the colors vary and they dont come in a case like you see just a plastic bag. and there small.</li>
            <li> I love love LOOOOVE these! They are beautiful and are sparkly. They are on the big side. 6 of them could cover my entire nail. I have read reviews that a con was that they stick out a bit and catch on clothes or other things. I tried it and they do. I think that some have the expectation that these are going to melt/mold onto your nails. They don&#x27;t. I actually bought these to decorate homemade cards and to use for crafts for my kids. They&#x27;re cheap, pretty, and come in their own individual containers. I highly recommend these! AND these came 2 weeks after I ordered them!</li>
            <li> This product is just OK. Firstly, it does not quite match the colors in the picture and in real. For instance, I can see brown glitters in the picture, but there was no brown glitters in the set I received. Secondly, most of the colors are not bright enough. For instance, when I put purple glitters on my nails, it looks very light, very far from bright vivid purple. The same is with most colors. My favorite is blue, which is pretty dark, really bright and vivid, and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the only good thing is that it arrived pretty fast and in good condition. Well, and there are a couple glitter colors that are nice.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was ordering and I got exactly what I wanted! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> The price is great and the colors are really nice, also the shipment was really quick, just make sure you have the right glue and something to place them or else they wont stay on.</li>
            <li> This item took FOREVER to come, and when i got it, the flakes are so big. I&#x27;m not sure how it looks on my nails yet. I will updated my review when I do. I&#x27;m afraid because the flakes are SO big.</li>
            <li> These sequins are very cute to use on your nails, just keep in mind you have to use a lot of them for the color to show good, except for the silver gold red and blue.</li>
            <li> When I got this product in the mail, I was surprised. They were not the colors that the pictures showed. At all. Completely different. And the hexagon flakes were tiny.&lt;br /&gt;But...I decided that I wanted to try out these glitters on my acrylic nails anyways. And when I put them on my nails, they were gorgeous. Made my nails look amazing. Shiny and sparkly. I don&#x27;t know if I will use all of the colors it came with, a few are kind of ugly,  but the pretty colors are amazing. I want to order some more of this glitter, different colors of course, but overall, I am enjoying these glitters.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t come in the square package shown if it did then the product wouldn&#x27;t have spilled out all through the bag. Most of my containers were empty.</li>
            <li> I saw many nail art pictures with this neat look so I had to have it! It comes exactly like it does in the picture, with all different colors and packaged really nice! Great product for the price, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> this is really good glitter it was a little bigger than what i wanted but it is still really nice. it was nicely packaged and it came faster than expected</li>
            <li> Not what I ordered... the hexagon glitters showed bigger than what I received... Bad Product Boxing as well, not only was the Hexagon glitter wrong, they were all over the package itself...</li>
            <li> I got a good mix of opaque and iridescent. I&#x27;m really glad, because I bought these for the iridescent. They all appear to be about the same size. Some of the containers are half filled, others less that half. Not really a big problem, they all have a decent amount. As for the size of the containers, they are a bit small. Take you index finger and touch it to the tip of your thumb. Now bring it down to the middle of your thumb. The circular area between your thumb and index finger is about how big these containers are. They/&#x27;re about as thick as your fingers too.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any spilled flakes in my packaging (except like one or two random glitters). The containers are individual containers that came &amp;#34;wrapped&amp;#34; in a cardboard box. The box was ripped and mangled, which is a shame because they&#x27;d be hard to store otherwise. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> was expecting the glitters to be a little bigger</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would come in different shapes and sizes for different glitter mosaic manis, but it will do.</li>
            <li> I got the package really late, took about two months to deliver. Then when I opened it, there was glitter everywhere! I didn&#x27;t even get the dark blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the dark blue hexagons shown in the bottom row third to the left, I got a black. I don&#x27;t really mind because I like the black anyway but it is not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glitter only fills about half of the container, and many containers were only a quarter filled (the glitter is all over the box.) I don&#x27;t know how this happened as the containers were tightly closed when I opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these to do glitter placement, and they are much smaller than I expected. This makes it slightly more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the glitters but am not very impressed with the shipping and the mess of glitter everywhere.</li>
            <li> This product seriously took FOREVER to come in the mail but when I finally got it most of the other reviews were right: the glitter was everywhere and my container that the glitters come in with was actually cracked. The little containers are about the size of a quarter and not all of them were completely filled. Some of the containers weren&#x27;t closed tight so they spilled in the box a bit but the colors are absolutely gorgeous! Even though the packaging sucked the colors are very pretty and if you don&#x27;t mind sucky packaging and only care about the glitter itself then I&#x27;d say buy it (:</li>
            <li> The sequins could be a little smaller, I thought they were a little big but overall I like them. I like to do the ombre effects with these. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very bright and vibrant colours.</li>
            <li> It came on time, but not exactly what I expected. The colors are different than the ones pictured. There was no red. It was a brown/bronze color instead. The picture also shows silver, it had no silver. It was more of a clear/white color. The shapes were a little bigger than I expected, but not too big. Still not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Nice size...bigger than the small ones at the dollar stores. I am very happy with the different colors</li>
            <li> Nice, all the colors are pretty, the only thing is that they don&#x27;t come in with that big container to keep all of them together.</li>
            <li> These arrived pretty fast. very pretty and shiny. So far I have received many compliments when wearing them. I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t actually thoroughly read the description and just looked at the photo. Definately not dust nor powder. These are larger glitter hexagon shapes and it is EXACTLY what I wanted. Had I read the full description though I would not have purchased them as they seem like something else. Great product, even cuts, and no double colors. I have black and white as well which is great. Definitely a better deal then going to a craft store.</li>
            <li> Loved them came well packaged</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because the colors are vivid, very pretty,  unfortunately, they are the size of your regular glitter ones very small,  and not the size that shows in the picture,  I needed them for me to be able to place them individually but can&#x27;t do that because of their size, however, I was able to use them as a cluster and it worked out nicely that way, still, I can&#x27;t use them for what I bought them for...</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful. They were packaged nicely and the colours are more beautiful than the picture</li>
            <li> this set comes with a lot of hex glitter pieces. they are varying sizes and come in a variety of colors. they are really nice to use as accents for nail art designs and come in neat little plastic cases to separate all the colors neatly.</li>
            <li> My favorite nail art accessory!!! Arrived before the estimated time. I love it. Stylish. Cute. &amp;Modern. All at a good price!!!</li>
            <li> These are so affordable and a great custom addition to my manicure. I brought them to my manicurist and she was easily able to use them to create a great &amp;#34;mermaid theme&amp;#34; nail to match my daughters birthday theme.</li>
            <li> I love the glitter. It shines so much and the packet came a week early. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered two. Both had a box that listed a completely different product, which made them awkward to give as a gift to my little sisters... the glitter itself is okay but not cut very smoothly. This makes it look sloppy and we threw a bunch of individual pieces in a discard pile because they were really choppy. The larger pieces also curled a bit sometimes.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something bigger, but nonetheless, this product is awesome. I bought it for a friend who loves to do nails and I believe she will love them! The colors are great!</li>
            <li> This is awesome!! Though I thought the little containers would have been a little bigger and the colors are cool. I just did my nails blue and put the silver glitter flakes on them it was rather cool and I got some good feed back on my nails as well. So I well definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> These are nice and pretty color but I definitely have not used them as much as I thought. They are kind of large and translucent almost and I don&#x27;t see a need for them normally since I have smaller ones. Okay, wouldn&#x27;t order again though.</li>
            <li> fthis is a really good product even though it comes a little messy but it works great and even looks great on your nails</li>
            <li> I love these! They are so easy to use. They don&#x27;t come in a case-looking package as shown in the picture, but it does come in pretty cute packaging that lets you see all the colors.</li>
            <li> Bought this product thinking the hexagons were going to bigger. They are much smaller than predicted. It was more like glitter. I gave it 3 stars because it arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I got fairly large hexagon glitters. Colors look slightly different from the picture, and rather than a tray I received separate little jars, but the glitters are very bright and large and are great for nail art.</li>
            <li> They shapes are WAY smaller than you&#x27;d expect. Also, they&#x27;re pretty transparent outside of the pots so all the colors except for the black, red and a purple look exactly the same on the nail. Not really worth it</li>
            <li> freinds just love this output.the shimmer and shine is ideal to match any accessory they have on.this has so much potencial fir ideas.</li>
            <li> When i got them i have to admit i thought they would be way bigger :) but the box they are in is 12x9 in cm. The colors are really cute and bright!!! The box is kinda small but a great buy. Overall they are adorable!!!!!</li>
