            <li>I will purchase these in the future because they are the best picks I&#x27;ve used and they taste good too!</li>
            <li>I noticed that when I floss and use mouthwash (This brand of mouthwash is also my favorite!</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t break them at all and love them!</li>
            <li>Of course, that&#x27;s in the company&#x27;s best interest, if you have to buy them more quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price nothing but positive</li>
            <li>Nice going</li>
            <li>Nice for a change.</li>
            <li>Has a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy to have the pick on one end and</li>
            <li>These picks look really nice</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for these any time I have something stuck between my teeth, so I keep them handy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt so enthusiastic about flossing.</li>
            <li>These work nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using these kind of flossers for years (</li>
            <li>the stick kind).</li>
            <li>I think they were going for some kind of minty taste, but they just taste like the cheapest mint gum you could ever buy.</li>
            <li>These are handier for manual flossing but not as effective as the Flossaid</li>
            <li>the mint flavor is nice).</li>
            <li>and they have a nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have a mint flavor, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy floss and holder so didn&#x27;t break when trying to use it as well.  </li>
            <li>Without these I honestly would never floss because I can&#x27;t stand string floss.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how much more sturdy the floss is in the DenTek, which is surprising.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mint flavor and whitening portions are really kind of moot, like with all floss picks.</li>
            <li>the mint is a really nice touch, though.</li>
            <li>nice minty taste</li>
            <li>really when you think about how awesome and convenient the product is, and how inexpensive, it&#x27;s moot.</li>
            <li>A clean mouth is a happy mouth, this gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Most of all, the product itself works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>Good price and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good product but the floss breaks easy.</li>
            <li>a good product, but, the floss breaks easily...</li>
            <li>These floss picks are the perfect solution for anyone who dreads flossing, or just wants to have something better than a toothpick for on-the-go scenarios.</li>
            <li>They break and pull apart very easily.</li>
            <li>They break very easily.  </li>
            <li>Breaks apart very very easily.</li>
            <li>They break very easily..  </li>
            <li>twin lines are very strong and will not break, I had to use 2 - 3 of the Oral-B vs. 1 Plackers</li>
            <li>but it breaks very easily when flossing your teeth.</li>
            <li>Breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>They break very easily.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks away from the plastic VERY easily.</li>

            <li>They break very easily when trying to get in between teeth.</li>
            <li>These break very easily.</li>
            <li>They break very easily.  </li>
            <li>This floss breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>Besides, the great pick at the other end is superb for getting those pesky Texas BBQ bits that seems to love catching between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Good thing they are cheap take 4 to do my mouth ha</li>
            <li>The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li>* part of the floss tears free and gets stuck between my teeth, requiring a good bit of effort to dislodge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these are just good for picking and flossing your teeth, for especially good because I had gotten out of the habit for some long.  </li>
            <li>Breaks EASILY!</li>
            <li>My qualm is that the floss breaks WAY too easily!</li>
            <li>HOW EASY IT IS TO FLOSS NOW!</li>
            <li>They work good on my teeth, and keep them clean.</li>
            <li>I love Glide products as the floss is very easy to slide into the tightest spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Gentle to your gums, yet clean the best!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made...</li>
            <li>Floss string is very cheap.</li>
            <li>Very cheap as well</li>
            <li>The floss itself is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Floss breaks kind of easily</li>
            <li>quite handy, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Flossing is really important and anything that makes it easier and more enjoyable like mint flavoured picks is even better!</li>
            <li>I love the size, and keep them in my desk at work, in my purse, etc.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks almost every time - it was almost comical.  </li>
            <li>these are the best as far as what is readily available out there -</li>
            <li>We like the Glide Scope Outlast better</li>
            <li>LOVE them...</li>
            <li>I usually love the oral-b glide floss</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased better floss picks from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>But after a bag of Denteks, these are smoother/easier to use with no wrestling and have a stronger, better shaped pick.  </li>
            <li>love the pick side of this product.</li>
            <li>most of the flossing string breaks while using it ..mostly use as a toothpick</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;ll have to use a better quality floss to get the shreds out of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>hurt because I have more control than floss&lt;</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>- just make sure you get the Oral-B Glide floss picks</li>
            <li>I love how this cleans any junk in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I use them every day and I love them.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to be better off.</li>
            <li>Better and more sturdy than the Glides I&#x27;ve purchased before.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of floss and flossers for my family.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite floss picks I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Love these, the flavor and quality.beats any</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a redeeming thing about them.</li>
            <li>My family likes more than battery FLOSSERS.</li>
            <li>buy two more</li>
            <li>At night I use regular floss, but in between meals, these are the best.</li>
            <li>There are better brands for this type of product.</li>
            <li>but I used 4 on my top row of teeth</li>
            <li>Oral-B has always made my favorite flossers.</li>
            <li>Dont buy this product unless you are ok using 2-3 picks each time</li>
            <li>Is this the company&#x27;s way of making sure we have to buy more?</li>
            <li>Best to buy and it&#x27;s an American company!</li>
            <li>These are more like what I would call fish line than string-like.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time, I&#x27;ve been able to get whatever&#x27;s in my teeth out with the floss portion.</li>
            <li>Most break apart while using them.  </li>
            <li>and if you work out the numbers, the Plackers came out cheaper and better.</li>
            <li>yet you require more words.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>I like the AIM ones from the dollar store MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>The oral-b glide are my favorite floss picks because they glide well between the teeth and don&#x27;t hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>but I love them.  </li>
            <li>Avoid like the plaque :)</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It glides safely between my teeth and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the skinnier ones do.</li>
            <li>These things were cheap and they work like a charm!</li>
            <li>This is misleading, as these floss picks, are, in fact, just floss picks and do not have magical floss-gnomes that leap off of the picks to scrub your teeth to a mirror-shine.  </li>
            <li>Would be much better if the floss portion was stronger.</li>
            <li>More often than not they break.</li>
            <li>I love these flossers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The GUM is just a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Plackers brand and they are much better.</li>
            <li>Still happy with the purchase based on how much I paid.</li>
            <li>Many of these picks break, but these hold up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types of floss/picks and this is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>Smooth flossing action and the pick is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These newer ones have a better pick end.</li>
            <li>I love them because I don&#x27;t have to rip off a piece of floss</li>
            <li>The CVS and Riteaid branded ones are better.</li>
            <li>Because they are gentle, they would be great for sensative gums and kids.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks so often that I have to use a minimum of two, and more often three, picks every time I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-thicker floss allows for better cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s more plastic that ends up in the landfill, but my fingers thank me.</li>
            <li>Given that these are a brand name I was expecting a lot more from them.</li>
            <li>i love these flossers</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of floss, this was the best.</li>
            <li>It is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>This floss smells great and cleans teeth really well...</li>
            <li>Plackers are much better.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite flossers.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>love having them arrive at my door..</li>
            <li>I found that cheaper ones work much better.</li>
            <li>I love glide floss but can&#x27;t stand these floss</li>
            <li>This is more a toothpick than anything else.</li>
            <li>I rinse the pick after each tooth so that I don&#x27;t transfer germs or plaque between teeth, and I use a separate pick for my top and bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like to floss, these are better than using just a rope of floss.  </li>
            <li>Buy Plackers, they are better.</li>
            <li>I wish that these Gide picks were more durable, but they aren&#x27;t...  </li>
            <li>I have had much better luck with Plackers</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together, and most dental floss causes me a great deal of pain, when I try to squeeze it between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Its better to use a thread instead of buying this product.</li>
            <li>As this is not the case, I would have to rate the GUM Eez-Thru&#x27;s as the better buy.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>so we love them.</li>
            <li>, surely they could do</li>
            <li>They break very easily, they also shred easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon, as usual you are the best in providing good deals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My mouths pretty good after having braces and taking care of my teeth</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.</li>
            <li>How about just doing a good job of flossing first?  </li>
            <li>If the Glide picks were as stiff as the Eez-Thru picks, they would be a most excellent and effective cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li>I love these for the kiddos because they are so easy to use, and it gets them flossing every day.</li>
            <li>When you find a product that you love to use, you strongly dislike when sellers quit selling it.  </li>
            <li>At one time you have to use more than one because they break easily and loosen as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are easy to use, and the minty taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li>floss itself is superior to others because it is coated in a wax and when you move it against gums it is much more gentle against the gums.</li>
            <li>These are great to keep in your purse and the extra mint flavor is nice also.</li>
            <li>The strand part has good traction and also the pick part of it, which is very sharp and great for safely scrapping between your teeth.</li>
            <li>the floss itself was fine and the mint was refreshing</li>
            <li>They work just fine for me though and they taste pretty good.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks almost immediately and it&#x27;s the most bizarre material.</li>
            <li>and they have been FANTASTIC, and never needed more than 1.  </li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every brand of floss picks and these Glide variety from Oral-B really are the best by more than one</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is light and refreshing and the convenience is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also been a great way to teach my young son to floss.</li>
            <li>When it comes to my mouth, I am pretty loyal to Oral B brand products because I think that they are the best, so I really can&#x27;t believe this is Oral B brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been flossing with these regularly and they taste great, do a fantastic job of cleaning debris, and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been going on line and buying up as mush overstock of the original picks as I can - many Amazon resellers have them.</li>
            <li>The pick end works well, but the floss breaks way to easy</li>
            <li>The floss breaks too easily.</li>
            <li>Break too easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to floss.</li>

            <li>The floss breaks so easily I go through five floss picks just to floss my teeth once,</li>
            <li>They break up easily.</li>
            <li>These flossers break so easily I had to use 5 just for one floss cleaning.</li>
            <li>Easily using.</li>

            <li>It breaks so easily.</li>
            <li>They slide easily between my teeth.</li>
            <li>They glide just like the glide floss but are as easy to use as the reach flosser (which always hurt my gums)</li>
            <li>I keep them everywhere for easy use.</li>
            <li>slides easily.  </li>
            <li>3 for one time because Floss breaks so easily.</li>
            <li>The floss seems to break way to easily whenever i try to use it</li>
            <li>I have to use about five for each floss because the floss strip breaks so easily.</li>
            <li>breaks too easily -- try Flossaid instead</li>
            <li>so so easy to use</li>
            <li>It would take me 2-3 picks to get through my teeth because the floss would break too easily.</li>
            <li>these do break easily, though.</li>
            <li>easy use, and my kids like it.</li>
            <li>handles are goo; However since the floss tears easily, the product doesn&#x27;t serve its purpose.</li>
            <li>They slide easily between my teeth</li>
            <li>Takes 4 or 5 to floss all my teeth since they break so easily.  </li>
            <li>Like the mint flavor and easy to carry in purse or pocket</li>
            <li>/&gt;The floss snaps so easily.</li>
            <li>I tried these, break too easily.  </li>
            <li>these dont break as easy as others i have used.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work, string breaks easily.</li>
            <li>used 2 from the Walmart purchase, the threads broke easily</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shred as easily and truly do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have crowded teeth, and this floss glides between them easily.</li>
            <li>The bags I have gotten from here seem to break easily.  </li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>They break WAY TOO EASILY</li>
            <li>These broke too easily for me.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they break or bend easily.</li>
            <li>flimsy, breaks easily.</li>
            <li>but they tear remarkably easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shred easily, or get stuck in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>The floss breaks easily and sometimes even gets stuck between teeth sometimes and I need another floss just to get this one out.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>On a plus side the flavor on them is really strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly urge you to find an alternative.</li>
            <li>so I guess these aren&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>These are not as strong as the Dentek brand.</li>
            <li>But for me it is preferable to the  getting stuck, or to pulling a crown from my tooth when the floss line is too strong and tension</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, 5 stars for a good overall product (I have always liked using Oral-B&#x27;s floss picks and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really strong</li>
            <li>I feel the floss isn&#x27;t as strong in this pack.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is not too strong.</li>
            <li>The mint taste was actually not bad, I mostly use unflavoured.</li>
            <li>best part is that floss is pretty strong and does not break in middle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s easy to use, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>These worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s fine and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>He says the handle is comfortable but the floss tears easily.</li>
            <li>The folks at Glide need to get with the program and bring back the successful product before they lose more market share.</li>
            <li>They work just fine and don&#x27;t break like cheaper knock offs.</li>
            <li>sometimes they would stick just like regular floss - these are great because they do what they say &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; - they glide right through my teeth without getting stuck!!  </li>
            <li>It is true these picks will 50% slide more easily, they just don&#x27;t tell you, it will slide 50% more easily right off the pick.  </li>
            <li>These floss picks are easy to use and are nice and gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>My dentist keeps telling me that floss threads are better and my fingers would be fine if I do it right.  </li>
            <li>:) Smile allot and do it often</li>
            <li>I would return them for a refund if they weren&#x27;t so cheap, but instead I wanted to warn everyone and make this company accountable for putting this garbage out there..</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable..</li>
            <li>Skip this junk and go for the cheap, off-brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a great product that I buy several times a year.  </li>
            <li>plus comfortably also.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap price.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to keep your mouth clean and flossed.</li>
            <li>I got a pack free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Plus it glides through smoothly.</li>
            <li>great price for a standard product .</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews say their floss broke, which made me hesitant to buy these, but I did anyway because they were Prime and fairly cheap, and I had NO problems.</li>
            <li>it is waxed if also comes out and goes in smoothly and almost never pulls on the crowns if you have any.</li>
            <li>It does indeed glide between teeth smoothly.</li>
            <li>The toothpick on the back is great</li>
            <li>Mint flavor is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great for flossing daily</li>
            <li>Oral B is usually a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>These picks go in really smoothly</li>
            <li>Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love these because my teeth are very close together and most types of floss I have tried tend to rip or break apart.</li>
            <li>I really like this flosser!!!</li>
            <li>plastic isn&#x27;t super strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a loyal Oral-B customer, so when I saw these I bought them (even added to my Subscribe and Save).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the floss breaks too easily</li>
            <li>They make flossing quick and easy.</li>
            <li>They break super easily.</li>
            <li>They provide a consistent, smooth cleaning most of the time.  </li>
            <li>These work very well and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more and get a good quality product than this excuse of a floss!</li>
            <li>These picks work okay, but the floss is very flimsy and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>But with these, its quick, simple, and works great.</li>
            <li>but i am actually excited to floss -</li>
            <li>Love the delivery, wish product quality was higher.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Glide floss picks since 2005.  </li>
            <li>It seems strange to me because when I ordered 2 packages in November 2013 the delivered floss picks were great.</li>
            <li>I originally got these as a filler for the 20% off subscribe and save items, but I have to tell you, I am hooked now.</li>
            <li>While Glide floss is great stuff, these flossing picks are a minor disaster.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really represent a very good value at 3.47 for 75, but I constantly floss and had run out of Plackers that morning, so I needed to pick up something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The floss is perfect for my sensitive gums and clears out deep between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I bring this to work and keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>By far the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used 6-7 different kinds!</li>
            <li>Oral B should know better, and clearly needs to a much better job of design and product testing, when it comes to flossing tools.</li>
            <li>It even says it right on the package!</li>
            <li>You and your dentist will wonder what the heck you&#x27;ve been doing right after using these babies!</li>
            <li>The pic works good, and they last longer than just once-and-toss.  </li>
            <li>I need 2-3, sometimes as many as 4 of these to floss my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>I use these for my 4.5 year old son, and they slide in and out so nice that he lets me do it.  </li>
            <li>Nice for sensitive teeth...</li>
            <li>Overall good.</li>
            <li>honestly I dont think I would floss as often if all I had was the old string.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t have much more to say.</li>
            <li>We use glide floss, so it is good to find these for the car and my purse when I can&#x27;t use regular floss.</li>
            <li>But one has to use something so this is good enough.</li>
            <li>things considered, this is a good solution, especially with Subscribe &amp; Save pricing.</li>
            <li>Many people have problem not flossing as much as they should be.</li>
            <li>Not as good as regular Glide floss.</li>
            <li>do think the softness is a good quality for younger children.</li>
            <li>I really am completely satisfied with the product and with the attention given by you really that I have recommended my friends</li>
            <li>The minty flavour is lovely, but again I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much whitening happening with these.  </li>
            <li>My husband lives for these and loves mint so it was a true winner for him.</li>
            <li>Kind of neat not to have to use the old wrap around the finger floss, but</li>
            <li>superior to regular floss although i did bleed the freshness and gentleness are unparalleled</li>
            <li>I saw a guy at work with them and have loved this product immensely ever since I found them.  </li>
            <li>I now use DenTek extra strong floss picks and they work amazing compared to these.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, works better than other flosses and is entirely painless</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is by design but the floss breaks pretty easy</li>
            <li>and these would break pretty easy on that spot, but find on the rest.  </li>
            <li>- the floss itself does not snap, as I&#x27;ve experienced with other brands, and they even offer some whitening, and a minty flavor.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other floss picks than these to compare to, but these ones work great.</li>
            <li>These also cost about 25% more than regular floss picks and you are wasting anywhere from 1 to 3 more picks when you floss.</li>
            <li>Super flimsy and break after a couple teeth.</li>
            <li>-just breaks quickly.  </li>
            <li>These are super flimsy and rip when I use them.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I know its better to use regular floss</li>
            <li>We received them quickly and will reorder them online.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and well</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t break too quickly and they do the job.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t money worthy.</li>
            <li>The floss seemed to break quite quickly and sometimes caused pieces of floss to get stuck in between my teeth.</li>
            <li>top of this, a 75 pack of these are actually 20 cents more than a 150 count package of Plackers Twin-lines at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Love them and will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of different brands and these are my favorites, primarily for the wider, more comfortable floss.</li>
            <li>Go get a cheap knock off of these, as the oral-B ones break consistently... I end up having to use 2-3 per time</li>
            <li>But, I think Oral-B puts out a long like of good products.  </li>
            <li>am not an abusive user, and have happily used other brands (namely Plackers, to be honest) and tried to save some money last time</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and makes oral hygiene so easy.</li>
            <li>I have gone through an entire pack of these and love them!  </li>
            <li>you are able to use ordinary dental floss without shredding it, then you may be able to use these dental picks without too many problems.  </li>
            <li>work great for people like me with tight teeth</li>
            <li>These works great if you&#x27;re teeth are really tight.</li>
            <li>best pick i ever used but very hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li>The floss is soft and very cheap.</li>
            <li>The string busts right quick.</li>
            <li>the glide part is great, the 3 stars are because there is little to no tension on the floss.  </li>
            <li>These are very convenient and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I like to floss, flossing is fun</li>
            <li>This is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they rarely break if I do it the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>have a minty fresh flavor that make you want to use one daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each time a fresh one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even worth</li>
            <li>It was a rare occasion that I didn&#x27;t need  two picks to finish flossing my breath.</li>
            <li>The fact that I&#x27;m making the effort to write this review proves how aggravated I am with this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>having been said, here&#x27;s why these picks might be worth it to you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pointy tip at the bottom is useful for cleaning close to the gums between teeth.</li>
            <li>if he or she thinks it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I realize that they break sometime, but that&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li>I really liked the white ones that the floss element was perpendicular to the body of each piece.</li>
            <li>With this style I rarely had the floss break or separate from the holder when I was flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so fresh with this products that one could almost be fooled to not brush afterwards.</li>
            <li>Fresh and minty floss.  </li>
            <li>hey it is useful</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel they are worth the money.</li>
            <li>Surprised that there are so many folks for whom they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had regular Oral-B floss picks and liked them</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty easy to handle and use, much better than actual floss.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not Oral-B Glide 3d White Floss Picks&#x27; fault, so I can&#x27;t deduct a star for my inability to find the right kind of floss.</li>
            <li>The strings break easy but they&#x27;re super cheap on Amazon especially with subscribe and save so worth</li>
            <li>I am definitely way too excited over a dental tool!!</li>
            <li>The mint lasts a bit longer than the other competitors I&#x27;ve tried (3 of them) and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall still superior floss picks to any other.</li>
            <li>The dentist hasn&#x27;t complained so they must work good!</li>
            <li>They literally glide right in.</li>
            <li>Come right out of the plastic housing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>the pick end is amazing for small spots and I love the glide floss.</li>
            <li>For the price this was quite a decent pack- filled to the brim with picks.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re ok with using multiple picks for a flossing session then it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Second they break very easily.  </li>
            <li>The floss does break easily (pulls out of the holder) but not usually before it is used for a while (they are disposable after all).  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to hold and constructed such that it&#x27;s easy to access hard-to-reach teeth.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use and more comfortable than traditional floss packs.</li>
            <li>Best floss out there, a little thicker than regular floss</li>
            <li>The floss doesn&#x27;t break as easily as with other more string-like floss picks.  </li>
            <li>The other end is a tooth pick, not as strong but sure gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The pick end is sharp and strong - stronger than most others&#x27;.</li>
            <li>These picks, while they have some good reviews, have all of the common problems of cheap floss picks and more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much easier to use this type of floss over the regular string kind.  </li>
            <li>The branding bit didn&#x27;t really enter my consciousness when I purchased these, but for those who want to know if these picks have extraordinary teeth-whitening properties, they do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tiny things are simple to use, and they work great.</li>
            <li>It breaks far too easily.</li>
            <li>Only thing is if you leave them on for more than 10 minutes your teeth will become very sensitive and feel kind of soft.</li>
            <li>I find that they slide so easily through my teeth compared to regular wax floss, so if you have tight tooth junctions, this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li>I expected better from this company!  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to remove them from between your teeth at the ends where the floss goes into the handle rather than trying to rip them out from between your teeth in the middle of the floss... they break every time if I don&#x27;t take them out the right way..</li>
            <li>say good bye to conventional flossing and toothpicking!</li>
            <li>The kids like using them and even my little one can do a pretty good job by herself.</li>
            <li>I have osteoarthritis and flossing is a pain (literally), so I was super excited to find that these require barely any effort.</li>
            <li>Product does exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the Oral-B ProHealth picks better, especially for crowded teeth.</li>
            <li>They leave your teeth the very refreshed feeling after flossing!</li>
            <li>Just pull it out of the bag and use it as opposed to having to unwind floss, wrap it around your fingers, constantly unwind more ect.</li>
            <li>Sometimes on the first tooth..</li>
            <li>Definitely doing it so much more.</li>
            <li>For mah in between ;)</li>
            <li>So guess what that most likely means,</li>
            <li>Most of them fall apart after only flossing a couple of teeth.</li>
            <li>These picks do exactly what they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I have been using floss picks for years and have tried so many different brands.  </li>
            <li>This is the first floss that has made my gums bleed or gotten stuck that I feel like I am pushing my teeth apart.  </li>
            <li>no lasting for sure.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many brands of floss picks and this is the ONLY type that works well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have some teeth that are pretty close together</li>
            <li>The string breaks the first time you try to slip it between your teeth.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer keenly pointed out, these are branded as being &amp;#34;3D White,&amp;#34; as if they somehow whitened your teeth more than the next leading brand of floss.  </li>
            <li>The floss breaks pretty often.</li>
            <li>Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time trying Oral B after years of Dentek.</li>
            <li>I started scraping my teeth with these and my dental exams really improved!</li>
            <li>The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I love glides regular floss</li>
            <li>My husband really enjoys using these!  </li>
            <li>My honey refuses to use them and unfortunately I&#x27;m not a fan</li>
            <li>/&gt;-much more convenient than regular floss&lt;</li>
            <li>Teeth are the only area of your body that can&#x27;t heal itself, so be sure to massage your gums, and reduce tarter, plaque and bacteria by flossing.</li>
            <li>The store brand ones I get at a local drugstore are more sturdy than these are.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that Amazon carries them because my local Walgreens (where I had been purchasing them), WalMart, Krogers no longer sell them!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much better than trying to use dental floss when you have an infant and a toddler constantly pestering you when you are trying to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested in suggestions.</li>
            <li>Much more efficient than those wooden tooth picks that can break apart in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t mention them (because I can&#x27;t remember exactly which company)</li>
            <li>The whitening power is real!)</li>
            <li>I love these 3d white products.</li>
            <li>I was expecting higher quality from a Glide product.</li>
            <li>And on top of the flimsiness of the floss strip, they did a poor job of actually getting the food out of my teeth, a task that&#x27;s handled superbly by the Plackers Twin-line flossers I normally use.  </li>
            <li>, however I have been able to use the DenTek, rinse it, use it again, rinse it again, and use it a third time.</li>
            <li>bought these because it was my first time flossing</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this product even though it looks like a good value.</li>
            <li>The variety that are green and doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; mentioned are just as good.</li>
            <li>The glide floss slides right in between and the plastic pick makes it easy to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li>so instead of doing it once a week like with the other kind i am flossing 2-3 times a day with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is a nice touch, but other brands also offer that feature.</li>
            <li>All other flossers aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth or easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the material for the floss is kinda flimsy so its only good for one or two uses..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anybody wanting to use the old kind of floss anymore since, to reach the back teeth</li>
            <li>They make flossing significantly easier than your traditional floss, and it&#x27;s easy to keep some handy anywhere, because of their small, discreet size.</li>
            <li>Spend less time on the packaging and more on the quality control Glade!</li>
            <li>The picks on the back end are pretty weak/bend easily, but I dont care because I dont use them</li>
            <li>Have seen positive effects on my teeth.</li>
            <li>floss picks are pretty much what one would expect from floss picks.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much does what you expect.</li>
            <li>You usually makes good products</li>
            <li>I put a hand full in my purse so I am prepared for the unexpected meat or</li>
            <li>Yes, the floss is fragile and can break, but these slide between my tight teeth so easily!!!</li>
            <li>The minty taste isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak, it leaves a nice feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li>They break really easy to the point where I would have to use three of them for my entire mouth .</li>
            <li>I now only use this make - they don&#x27;t break easily, and they slide between your teeth well.</li>
            <li>I have seen several reviews noting that the picks easily broke, but that has not been the case for me.</li>
            <li>I switched from different Glide Floss Picks which did tear easily.  </li>
            <li>String is strong enough as well and has a mint coating.</li>
            <li>but you are getting large quantity</li>
            <li>I did get these pretty cheap with a coupon but don&#x27;t go above and beyond to use these when a generic one will work just as fine as the floss part seems to fray easier than I feel it should.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a different style of Oral-B dental floss gadgets which I was quite happy with.</li>
            <li>the floss does break fairly easy compared to regular floss but much easier to use plus a bonus of a pick</li>
            <li>The original pick is only 30 per pack, but worth every single one of them:  the floss is strong, easily glides between teeth, and reaches the back teeth.</li>
            <li>but a friend of mine told me how much she likes these because they are much sturdier and solid than the easily bendable Dentek version</li>
            <li>Pretty decent for its price.</li>
            <li>They are flimsy and flat and break very quickly.</li>
            <li>flat, strong and minty.</li>
            <li>They are very average and have a nice scent to them.</li>
            <li>I understand this floss can&#x27;t do much to make your teeth &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; compared to others, but I actually found this easier to fit between my tighter teeth.</li>
            <li>i know this sounds really dorky</li>
            <li>I expected much better quality from Glide.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to use 4-5 of them to finish your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are also very close together</li>
            <li>They are also much easier and faster to use them floss.</li>
            <li>I can even do this with one hand while getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses them.</li>
            <li>Wife buys another brand accidentally - they head straight to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a minty taste or smell</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>Made my teeth at least 50% whiter overall and made me more confident with my smile.</li>
            <li>Oh yeha they break very</li>
            <li>having to maneuver one&#x27;s whole hand in your mouth to floss w/these... try that</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t recommend them to anyone, also there is too much mint paste on them.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt the teeth, the design is reasonable</li>
            <li>Very minty</li>
            <li>this does both very well.</li>
            <li>Once it breaks you can&#x27;t really use a 1 inch piece of floss, so I feel a bit wasteful.</li>
            <li>I brought these so called floss picks because they were an add-on item and the price seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li>With Dentek, I can floss whole mouth with one.</li>
            <li>I have another brand that work much bettter..</li>
            <li>It can take up to 3 of these picks to do my whole teeth.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t unusually close together or anything.</li>
            <li>floss picks haven&#x27;t really caused me any pain.</li>
            <li>the whole family uses these.</li>
            <li>Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li>The pick end is great too for areas around permanent dental work (permanent spacer bars behind teeth after braces).</li>
            <li>The 2 packages I just ordered will go straight into the garbage can.</li>
            <li>these work really well.  </li>
            <li>much cheaper than Walmart</li>
            <li>These perform their intended function very well.</li>
            <li>I had to use 3 or 4 just to floss my whole mouth.</li>
            <li>These flossers work really well for me; my teeth are close together</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like flossing that much</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see that.</li>
            <li>These are great because they are made of the thin Glide tape material and they never break.</li>
            <li>Really, Oral B ???</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Some break before i get through the whole mouth, so one or two with rinses in between.  </li>
            <li>These work, but are not as durable as the ones with real floss in them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>It takes me 2-4 picks to get through my whole</li>
            <li>They are so much sturdier than the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this and really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>These are the second best flossers I have used, but are number one for value as the white ones are more expensive.</li>
            <li>It came factory sealed with fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I floss after every meal, but at work, I like to use these disposable picks because i can use and toss it fast.</li>
            <li>I find them to break and shred wayyyyyyy too much.</li>
            <li>So there isn&#x27;t much else</li>
            <li>I really like the way these feel to use, however I am giving 3 stars since they break often.</li>
            <li>It takes about five of these to make it through all of your teeth and most of your time is spent trying to get the pieces that broke off of the flosser out of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Even when they do not break, they become very frayed by the end.</li>
            <li>so it really become uneconomical.</li>
            <li>Does it really help whiten surfaces between teeth?  </li>
            <li>I would order Glide products again but would recommend the straight handles which are much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li>They rip after just one or two teeth and it takes four or more picks to complete both upper and lower jaw.</li>
            <li>The floss on the Oral-B Glide 3D white floss picks is simply too flimsy to be effective.</li>
            <li>These are not like other pick floss products, the floss is flat which sounds good at first but never feels like it is doing the job.  </li>
            <li>main issue is.. cost,  what I get out of a bag of this vs a roll of floss,  the roll is just much cheaper and lasts me a lot longer than a bag of these, if they were much much cheaper and came in a large bulk, then I would switch to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These flossers would be really good if the floss was a little stronger, but about 1 in 5 times I need to pull out a second flosser because the floss on the first one breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are not a sting but more of a band, with a sharp edge.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks very easily; much more than other brands.</li>
            <li>The floss on these breaks more than any other flossing sword I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>these don&#x27;t seem to do anything more for whitening your teeth than any other floss would).</li>
            <li>Other brands work a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love these floss picks because they seem sturdier then other brands.  </li>
            <li>The floss holds together better than other ones I have used.  </li>
            <li>The mint is slightly more pronounced with these picks than with other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive tried these and many other brands.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges and you can use the other end more safely.</li>
            <li>These guys are about 1/2&amp;#34; shorter than the other brands and WAAAAY more durable.  </li>
            <li>They slide in the teeth and out without getting stuck like many other flosses.</li>
            <li>So they might cost a tad more than the other brands</li>
            <li>The floss is not weak, it is how it is lodged in the plastic which is faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, these floss picks glide a lot better than other cheaper brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>You will need to be VERY gentle when using this product, and I&#x27;ve used several other brands that are far superior.</li>
            <li>Overall saves me time, and keeps my mouth clean.</li>
            <li>pic end is slightly textured which feels like its doing a better job than a simple smooth ended pic&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some floss picks that are quite durable, some that will not break even if you tried to break it, but these broke after going through 2 gaps, I end up using 3 to clean an entire mouth, rather than using one and rinsing between gaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using them for a few weeks and have had 2 break on me; however, I wonder if they made it more durable, if it wouldn&#x27;t slide so easily, just like all the others.</li>
            <li>I went back to using Dentek comfort clean</li>
            <li>Not hard on the gums at all!</li>
            <li>Extra ironic; flossing actually resulting in MORE stuff being stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I will get more of a knack for using these down the line and maybe not break them anymore.</li>
            <li>Perfect for tight fitting teeth and crowns - the only drawback are the very sharp pointy pick ends - they could hurt if not used very carefully.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s rare for the floss to completely pull free from one side or the other, about once a week I&#x27;ll experience one of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say 5% of them break in my mouth, which happens to be 5% more than the store brand at half the price.</li>
            <li>I have much more control over the string which means less pain for me.</li>
            <li>More than half of the flossers have fallen apart when used.  </li>
            <li>I tried to floss it out, and 2 more picks broke in half.  </li>
            <li>I used another brand previous to this and they worked much better.</li>
            <li>Easier to use that actual floss and is a bit more acceptable to do in a diner than to actually floss.</li>
            <li>floss product (which is what happened to me), which is a much better product (also more expensive).</li>
            <li>these break quickly - need several to floss each time.  </li>
            <li>I love the white picks as they last</li>
            <li>Compared to regular floss these cost a bit more, but they make flossing enormously easier.</li>
            <li>I wish P &amp; G would stop producing this particular product.  </li>
            <li>Decent Product for the price.</li>
            <li>My wife finds around the same wastage--maybe a tiny bit more because she works faster than I do.</li>
            <li>They work decently well, assuming the floss thread survives.</li>
            <li>These ones in particular have a sturdy handle.</li>
            <li>These are decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is the one I like best so far, especially because they break so much less often.</li>
            <li>If your teeth are tight together, stay away from this and try a better brand like Plackers instead.</li>
            <li>I was highly displeased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now the price is too high</li>
            <li>For anyone who hates to use floss but appreciates the benefits of flossing, I HIGHLY recommend this product; is it genius?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this product over the floss picks I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this product over the floss picks I used to buy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>This cuts up my gums frequently, even when other most picks would not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure what their definition of &amp;#34;shred resistant&amp;#34; is but these shred VERY easily and break even easier.</li>
            <li>the floss breaks very easily and does not hold up past 3-4 teeth.</li>
            <li>OK, maybe not excited...</li>
            <li>I have found better quality glide floss picks - these are a little flimsy but they do the trick.</li>
            <li>recommend spending little more money and buying the Plackers Twin Line Whitening Floss</li>
            <li>/&gt;Y&#x27;know, if they gave *these* away at the dentist&#x27;s office instead of those little &amp;#34;6 feet of no-thank-you&amp;#34; packs, I bet more people would floss.</li>
            <li>I do have a spot or two where the floss tends to snag a little more than it does in the rest of my mouth.</li>
            <li>easy to use, the floss doesn&#x27;t fray apart during use like other brands.</li>
            <li>But again, the other ones cut my gums too easily</li>
            <li>but the floss is very flimsy and would break frequently while flossing.  </li>
            <li>These were a great price as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; but they are difficult to use because of the curved handles.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re reasonably priced and have enough in the way of added features to justify the slightly higher price, depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for from a floss pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re reasonably priced and have enough in the way of added features to justify the slightly higher price, depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for from a floss pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We just figure that into the total price of the package and make a judgment on whether it&#x27;s worth it for the quality of the flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I like this one because your mouth feels fresh after flossing.</li>
            <li>Way easier than normal floss.</li>
            <li>As for the mint flavor, I only really taste it when I first go in, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li>I sometimes go through a few of them just to floss one time, where before, I never had to use more than one.</li>
            <li>This has a stringy type of rubbery plastic that shreds off pieces that get stuck between if you use it for more than a few passes between teeth - you then need to get another one to get the piece of plastic out which defeats the purpose for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried normal floss</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the normal glide floss and use plackers for my floss picks.</li>
            <li>The floss get broken doing front teeth who have a good gap.</li>
            <li>But if you like the thick kind, you will like these.</li>
            <li>but I might have to go back to normal floss because these seem to break really easily when I&#x27;m trying to floss my back teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have used other floss and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I love floss picks because I am always finding times when I need a quick floss/pick and its just too inconvenient to bust out the full roll of floss.</li>
            <li>Some reviews say these break too easily... but they are average floss picks.  </li>
            <li>pointed end is great as a toothpick but the floss section quickly breaks, typically leaving behind shreds of dental floss in my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started with simple generic ones from the grocery store and they worked fine.</li>
            <li>some break on the first tooth, so I count myself lucky if I can do half my mouth with one of these.</li>
            <li>Extra is the nice little flavor it leaves in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li>so I live with these.</li>
            <li>I can get through maybe 3 teeth before I have to throw it away and get a new one.  </li>
            <li>and i wanted to live longer</li>
            <li>The floss in between the plastic tears easy after getting through half of my teeth.</li>
            <li>They do not make a huge difference in whitening or removing stains, and the mint is super subtle.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really taste the Mint but that no big deal since you aren&#x27;t supposed to suck on them haha.  </li>
            <li>We use the regular rolls ourselves because these floss picks create a lot of waste, but we buy these for the kids so that they can floss on their own.  </li>
            <li>I understand the mixed reviews here, but both my wife and I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than Oral-B&#x27;s cheaper flossers, these are more durable (no more broken floss) and the &#x27;pick&#x27; end gets in between the teeth nicely.</li>
            <li>The only difference is in the pretty packaging with the new buzz words you&#x27;ve been seeing plastered all over dental products these days.</li>
            <li>The floss thread gets loose quickly.</li>
            <li>Although I really like the Oral B Glide 3D white picks, I wish they were constructed a little bit better.</li>
            <li>We all have tight teeth and dental work that snags floss easily.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not that tight together, and yet I still go through 2-4 picks every time I floss as they break almost laughably easily.  </li>
            <li>I love these because they can be carried in a small bag in your purse and you will have both floss and a pick in an emergency.</li>
            <li>I have used many floss picks in the past and had no issues.</li>
            <li>Buy Plackers instead - they are usually around the same price if not cheaper and are 1000 times better!  </li>
            <li>Reaches all corners of all teeth due to the unique angle of its string.</li>
            <li>After about the first to second tooth the floss comes apart and then I have to switch to the handle.</li>
            <li>Lower quality than expected but not bad.</li>
            <li>I have very tight teeth and bought these because standard string doesn&#x27;t work effectively for me.  </li>
            <li>Kind of ridiculous, I&#x27;m guessing the pack may be old.</li>
            <li>The main reason that I use Glide is that my teeth are very close together, so I can&#x27;t use traditional floss without shredding it.</li>
            <li>They break when using them but not if your super careful.</li>
            <li>Flat ribbon floss also works much better than the average brand.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Floss doesn&#x27;t seem quite the same as the glide in large roles.  </li>
            <li>The floss on these breaks super easily so be careful!</li>
            <li>Stay clear of this product.</li>
            <li>The glide type is the only one that I like to use for my teeth because it&#x27;s soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>I have to use 4-5 floss per cleaning cycle to do complete flossing.</li>
            <li>Some the floss strand detaches from the flosser completely, and others bits of the floss shed itself into my mouth or between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I end up using about 3 picks each time to completely floss my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far (three days in), I have had no issues with it</li>
            <li>As far as their effectiveness at cleaning between the teeth, I don&#x27;t know how they compare to flossing with the type of floss tape that comes in a roll.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use then regular floss.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE DA MONEY</li>
            <li>it is from oral-b, but its too soft and like tofu.</li>
            <li>Floss picks are much, much easier than trying to use your hands to maneuver regular floss.</li>
            <li>MUCH TOO FRAGILE.</li>
            <li>I would stay far away of this brand.</li>
            <li>The product claims shred resistance, but they shred frequently.</li>
            <li>I floss at least 4 times a day, just to be flossing most times -</li>
            <li>The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end bends within seconds, absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>I continue to buy this one as it is the smoothest between my teeth of all brands I tried so far.</li>
            <li>Plus I can use these at my desk after lunch without looking like a complete weirdo.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use up to four to complete flossing every evening.</li>
            <li>The type of floss used in the Eez-Thru picks, is not as smooth as Glide floss, but the floss does remain quite taught under heavy usage.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t happen every time and really maybe only once a week</li>
            <li>Sadly, my husband wants the kind of floss pick that has &amp;#34;two strings&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li>used a few more from the Amazon order, same experience</li>
            <li>Unlike cheap generic floss picks the floss doesn&#x27;t break off and the pick is just the right balance between hard and soft.</li>
            <li>: the only drawback is that if you apply more power, pull left and right,  then pull up hard the floss may break.</li>
            <li>Comes with the whiting on the floss to clean in between teeth, These do NOT break when your trying to use them in between teeth that are tightly together.  </li>
            <li>and I dont really have them break very often, but when they do its a very tight section between 2 very crammed teeth where no floss would survive.</li>
            <li>Upon encountering any obstruction or resistance, the floss would promptly break (I once went through no less than five picks to completely floss my mouth).</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of floss picks available at my local store like the Dentek ones and they hurt and cut my gums.</li>
            <li>What makes these so fantastic is that the pointy edge is flat and somewhat rough and you can use it to scrape the sides of your teeth before flossing.</li>
            <li>The floss doesn&#x27;t break easily and lends a small mint flavor</li>
            <li>My first time buying this type of floss picks and found that the string breaks every single time.</li>
            <li>The floss is not tight</li>
            <li>string wears down quickly on some pics.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these, but only wish the handles were angled like the previous style so that it was far easier to access the teeth properly</li>
            <li>someone higher up that makes these kind of cost cutting decisions needs to be fired for this.</li>
            <li>I usually have trouble getting floss between my teeth, but this worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t typical floss material, they are more of a wide plastic like material.</li>
            <li>I have normal teeth and spaces between (I&#x27;m assuming, as my dentist has never told me any different)</li>
            <li>they are smooth but a little too fragile.</li>
            <li>If I remember where, I just go through that space a little more carefully.</li>
            <li>So if you were thinking of buying this particular product because it supposedly has some special properties beyond ordinary floss, don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li>This is my new regular brand.</li>
            <li>I really like these, they are about the same as any of the others similar to these, so</li>
            <li>Thin enough for people with nice teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together and most types of floss are unable to get in between without breaking.  </li>
            <li>I personally hate to floss because my teeth are SO tight, but I was so happy when I tried Glide because of how easy it fits in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I get tired of the stores marking up the prices on these, they arrived quickly and were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The floss is flat and thin, so it fits nicely.</li>
            <li>but it is very easy to use and cleans in between teeth very well without cutting gums.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Glides are made with a much softer plastic material unlike the harder plastic handles of some brands.</li>
            <li>Chinese garbage.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>I have used a couple different flosser products so far</li>
            <li>I have to use multiple picks to floss completely.</li>
            <li>These minty-flavored floss picks are not lasting nearly as long as my other original pack.</li>
            <li>Subtle mint flavor and strong floss doesn&#x27;t rip during use.</li>
            <li>These haven&#x27;t broken once yet (vs. before I would get a dozen or more that would break), so they have improved.  </li>
            <li>thick floss that goes between your teeth smoothly.</li>
            <li>and then I have to use more to try and get the broken floss remnants out from where they broke</li>
            <li>I go through at least 4 or 5 picks for each flossing simply because the floss separates between the two sides of the pick so easily.</li>
            <li>I used to get cheap glosses at walmart or dollar tree but no more!</li>
            <li>I have used other Oral-B Products in the past, and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Admittedly, my teeth are rather tight, but then that&#x27;s the compelling reason to use a ribbon-type floss instead of the traditional waxed variety.</li>
            <li>This floss is very soft and comfortable on your gums unlike other types we&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>and I guess they don&#x27;t create as much friction as the other ones do.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it really makes your teeth any whiter than flossing with any other floss.</li>
            <li>Compared to &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; picks, I much prefer the Glide floss due to its comparatively lower rate of breakage and the ease with which it can access the often-tight spaces between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the wide, ribbon-shaped nature of the floss, along with the slightly waxed surface, that makes this floss pick clean so thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers say this does not happen, but it does, and frequently, even if you have only moderately close teeth.</li>
            <li>, I got the floss in but for whatever reason it wouldn&#x27;t pop back out and it was kind of scary.</li>
            <li>I literally went through 5 in a row before I gave up and used some of the other brand I usually use which were much better and around the same price.  </li>
            <li>It takes me on the average of 3 or 4 picks to clean in between all of my teeth one time due to breakage.  </li>
            <li>It began to split apart after the first few teeth I cleaned, and by the time I got to the end</li>
            <li>the first few swipes</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a true negative 1 star.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad floss, it is actually really nice to use and slides between teeth really smoothly!</li>
            <li>Stay away, floss breaks way too easily compared to the Plackers floss I got at Walmart and other brands i&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Easily break compared to other flossing tools I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>They do this so well that the first time I used them, I went between my teeth several times to confirm that I wasn&#x27;t missing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But have to say first time I bought those blue once instead of green and there are so week, breaking as soon</li>
            <li>but like how thin they are and easy to use</li>
            <li>A single flossing session sometimes required two or three of these to complete.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands where the string doesn&#x27;t pull out of one end with normal use.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really get everything because the floss isn&#x27;t really tight.  </li>
            <li>These gliders work very well in tight spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only gave this a 4 star rating rather than a 5 because they are a little large for my mouth and for children.  </li>
            <li>This product (ordered beginning of March 2014) is pretty useless because the floss shreds very fast.</li>
            <li>I have some teeth that are very close together, and others that are difficult to floss, and require a little more force.  </li>

            <li> I will purchase these in the future because they are the best picks I&#x27;ve used and they taste good too!</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I floss and use mouthwash (This brand of mouthwash is also my favorite!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t break them at all and love them!</li>
            <li> Of course, that&#x27;s in the company&#x27;s best interest, if you have to buy them more quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price nothing but positive</li>
            <li> Nice going</li>
            <li> Nice for a change.</li>
            <li> Has a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy to have the pick on one end and</li>
            <li> These picks look really nice</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for these any time I have something stuck between my teeth, so I keep them handy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so enthusiastic about flossing.</li>
            <li> These work nicely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using these kind of flossers for years (</li>
            <li> the stick kind).</li>
            <li> I think they were going for some kind of minty taste, but they just taste like the cheapest mint gum you could ever buy.</li>
            <li> These are handier for manual flossing but not as effective as the Flossaid</li>
            <li> the mint flavor is nice).</li>
            <li> and they have a nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have a mint flavor, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy floss and holder so didn&#x27;t break when trying to use it as well.  </li>
            <li> Without these I honestly would never floss because I can&#x27;t stand string floss.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how much more sturdy the floss is in the DenTek, which is surprising.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mint flavor and whitening portions are really kind of moot, like with all floss picks.</li>
            <li> the mint is a really nice touch, though.</li>
            <li> nice minty taste</li>
            <li> really when you think about how awesome and convenient the product is, and how inexpensive, it&#x27;s moot.</li>
            <li> A clean mouth is a happy mouth, this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Most of all, the product itself works exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> Good price and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good product but the floss breaks easy.</li>
            <li> a good product, but, the floss breaks easily...</li>

            <li> They break very easily..  </li>
            <li> twin lines are very strong and will not break, I had to use 2 - 3 of the Oral-B vs. 1 Plackers</li>
            <li> but it breaks very easily when flossing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> They break very easily.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks away from the plastic VERY easily.</li>
            <li> The strings break very easily.</li>
            <li> They break very easily when trying to get in between teeth.</li>
            <li> These break very easily.</li>
            <li> They break very easily.  </li>
            <li> This floss breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> Besides, the great pick at the other end is superb for getting those pesky Texas BBQ bits that seems to love catching between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Good thing they are cheap take 4 to do my mouth ha</li>
            <li> The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li> * part of the floss tears free and gets stuck between my teeth, requiring a good bit of effort to dislodge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these are just good for picking and flossing your teeth, for especially good because I had gotten out of the habit for some long.  </li>
            <li> Breaks EASILY!</li>
            <li> My qualm is that the floss breaks WAY too easily!</li>
            <li> HOW EASY IT IS TO FLOSS NOW!</li>
            <li> They work good on my teeth, and keep them clean.</li>
            <li> I love Glide products as the floss is very easy to slide into the tightest spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Gentle to your gums, yet clean the best!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made...</li>
            <li> Floss string is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very cheap as well</li>
            <li> The floss itself is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Floss breaks kind of easily</li>
            <li> quite handy, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Flossing is really important and anything that makes it easier and more enjoyable like mint flavoured picks is even better!</li>
            <li> I love the size, and keep them in my desk at work, in my purse, etc.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost every time - it was almost comical.  </li>
            <li> these are the best as far as what is readily available out there -</li>
            <li> We like the Glide Scope Outlast better</li>
            <li> LOVE them...</li>
            <li> I usually love the oral-b glide floss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better floss picks from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> But after a bag of Denteks, these are smoother/easier to use with no wrestling and have a stronger, better shaped pick.  </li>
            <li> love the pick side of this product.</li>
            <li> most of the flossing string breaks while using it ..mostly use as a toothpick</li>
            <li> Then you&#x27;ll have to use a better quality floss to get the shreds out of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> hurt because I have more control than floss&lt;</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> - just make sure you get the Oral-B Glide floss picks</li>
            <li> I love how this cleans any junk in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I use them every day and I love them.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to be better off.</li>
            <li> Better and more sturdy than the Glides I&#x27;ve purchased before.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of floss and flossers for my family.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite floss picks I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Love these, the flavor and quality.beats any</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a redeeming thing about them.</li>
            <li> My family likes more than battery FLOSSERS.</li>
            <li> buy two more</li>
            <li> At night I use regular floss, but in between meals, these are the best.</li>
            <li> There are better brands for this type of product.</li>
            <li> but I used 4 on my top row of teeth</li>
            <li> Oral-B has always made my favorite flossers.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this product unless you are ok using 2-3 picks each time</li>
            <li> Is this the company&#x27;s way of making sure we have to buy more?</li>
            <li> Best to buy and it&#x27;s an American company!</li>
            <li> These are more like what I would call fish line than string-like.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time, I&#x27;ve been able to get whatever&#x27;s in my teeth out with the floss portion.</li>
            <li> Most break apart while using them.  </li>
            <li> and if you work out the numbers, the Plackers came out cheaper and better.</li>
            <li> yet you require more words.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> I like the AIM ones from the dollar store MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> The oral-b glide are my favorite floss picks because they glide well between the teeth and don&#x27;t hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> but I love them.  </li>
            <li> Avoid like the plaque :)</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It glides safely between my teeth and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the skinnier ones do.</li>
            <li> These things were cheap and they work like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is misleading, as these floss picks, are, in fact, just floss picks and do not have magical floss-gnomes that leap off of the picks to scrub your teeth to a mirror-shine.  </li>
            <li> Would be much better if the floss portion was stronger.</li>
            <li> More often than not they break.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The GUM is just a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Plackers brand and they are much better.</li>
            <li> Still happy with the purchase based on how much I paid.</li>
            <li> Many of these picks break, but these hold up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of floss/picks and this is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Smooth flossing action and the pick is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These newer ones have a better pick end.</li>
            <li> I love them because I don&#x27;t have to rip off a piece of floss</li>
            <li> The CVS and Riteaid branded ones are better.</li>
            <li> Because they are gentle, they would be great for sensative gums and kids.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks so often that I have to use a minimum of two, and more often three, picks every time I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-thicker floss allows for better cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s more plastic that ends up in the landfill, but my fingers thank me.</li>
            <li> Given that these are a brand name I was expecting a lot more from them.</li>
            <li> i love these flossers</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of floss, this was the best.</li>
            <li> It is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> This floss smells great and cleans teeth really well...</li>
            <li> Plackers are much better.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite flossers.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> love having them arrive at my door..</li>
            <li> I found that cheaper ones work much better.</li>
            <li> I love glide floss but can&#x27;t stand these floss</li>
            <li> This is more a toothpick than anything else.</li>
            <li> I rinse the pick after each tooth so that I don&#x27;t transfer germs or plaque between teeth, and I use a separate pick for my top and bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like to floss, these are better than using just a rope of floss.  </li>
            <li> Buy Plackers, they are better.</li>
            <li> I wish that these Gide picks were more durable, but they aren&#x27;t...  </li>
            <li> I have had much better luck with Plackers</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together, and most dental floss causes me a great deal of pain, when I try to squeeze it between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Its better to use a thread instead of buying this product.</li>
            <li> As this is not the case, I would have to rate the GUM Eez-Thru&#x27;s as the better buy.  </li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> so we love them.</li>
            <li> , surely they could do</li>
            <li> They break very easily, they also shred easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon, as usual you are the best in providing good deals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My mouths pretty good after having braces and taking care of my teeth</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.</li>
            <li> How about just doing a good job of flossing first?  </li>
            <li> If the Glide picks were as stiff as the Eez-Thru picks, they would be a most excellent and effective cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li> I love these for the kiddos because they are so easy to use, and it gets them flossing every day.</li>
            <li> When you find a product that you love to use, you strongly dislike when sellers quit selling it.  </li>
            <li> At one time you have to use more than one because they break easily and loosen as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are easy to use, and the minty taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li> floss itself is superior to others because it is coated in a wax and when you move it against gums it is much more gentle against the gums.</li>
            <li> These are great to keep in your purse and the extra mint flavor is nice also.</li>
            <li> The strand part has good traction and also the pick part of it, which is very sharp and great for safely scrapping between your teeth.</li>
            <li> the floss itself was fine and the mint was refreshing</li>
            <li> They work just fine for me though and they taste pretty good.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost immediately and it&#x27;s the most bizarre material.</li>
            <li> and they have been FANTASTIC, and never needed more than 1.  </li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every brand of floss picks and these Glide variety from Oral-B really are the best by more than one</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is light and refreshing and the convenience is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also been a great way to teach my young son to floss.</li>
            <li> When it comes to my mouth, I am pretty loyal to Oral B brand products because I think that they are the best, so I really can&#x27;t believe this is Oral B brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing with these regularly and they taste great, do a fantastic job of cleaning debris, and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been going on line and buying up as mush overstock of the original picks as I can - many Amazon resellers have them.</li>
            <li> The pick end works well, but the floss breaks way to easy</li>
            <li> The floss breaks too easily.</li>
            <li> Break too easily.</li>

            <li> They break up easily.</li>
            <li> These flossers break so easily I had to use 5 just for one floss cleaning.</li>
            <li> Easily using.</li>

            <li> They slide easily between my teeth.</li>
            <li> They glide just like the glide floss but are as easy to use as the reach flosser (which always hurt my gums)</li>
            <li> I keep them everywhere for easy use.</li>
            <li> slides easily.  </li>
            <li> 3 for one time because Floss breaks so easily.</li>
            <li> The floss seems to break way to easily whenever i try to use it</li>
            <li> I have to use about five for each floss because the floss strip breaks so easily.</li>
            <li> breaks too easily -- try Flossaid instead</li>
            <li> so so easy to use</li>
            <li> It would take me 2-3 picks to get through my teeth because the floss would break too easily.</li>
            <li> these do break easily, though.</li>
            <li> easy use, and my kids like it.</li>
            <li> handles are goo; However since the floss tears easily, the product doesn&#x27;t serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> They slide easily between my teeth</li>
            <li> Takes 4 or 5 to floss all my teeth since they break so easily.  </li>
            <li> Like the mint flavor and easy to carry in purse or pocket</li>
            <li> /&gt;The floss snaps so easily.</li>
            <li> I tried these, break too easily.  </li>
            <li> these dont break as easy as others i have used.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, string breaks easily.</li>
            <li> used 2 from the Walmart purchase, the threads broke easily</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shred as easily and truly do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have crowded teeth, and this floss glides between them easily.</li>
            <li> The bags I have gotten from here seem to break easily.  </li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> They break WAY TOO EASILY</li>
            <li> These broke too easily for me.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they break or bend easily.</li>
            <li> flimsy, breaks easily.</li>
            <li> but they tear remarkably easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shred easily, or get stuck in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> The floss breaks easily and sometimes even gets stuck between teeth sometimes and I need another floss just to get this one out.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong.  </li>
            <li> On a plus side the flavor on them is really strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly urge you to find an alternative.</li>
            <li> so I guess these aren&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> These are not as strong as the Dentek brand.</li>
            <li> But for me it is preferable to the  getting stuck, or to pulling a crown from my tooth when the floss line is too strong and tension</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, 5 stars for a good overall product (I have always liked using Oral-B&#x27;s floss picks and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really strong</li>
            <li> I feel the floss isn&#x27;t as strong in this pack.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is not too strong.</li>
            <li> The mint taste was actually not bad, I mostly use unflavoured.</li>
            <li> best part is that floss is pretty strong and does not break in middle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to use, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s fine and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> He says the handle is comfortable but the floss tears easily.</li>
            <li> The folks at Glide need to get with the program and bring back the successful product before they lose more market share.</li>
            <li> They work just fine and don&#x27;t break like cheaper knock offs.</li>
            <li> sometimes they would stick just like regular floss - these are great because they do what they say &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; - they glide right through my teeth without getting stuck!!  </li>
            <li> It is true these picks will 50% slide more easily, they just don&#x27;t tell you, it will slide 50% more easily right off the pick.  </li>
            <li> These floss picks are easy to use and are nice and gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist keeps telling me that floss threads are better and my fingers would be fine if I do it right.  </li>
            <li> :) Smile allot and do it often</li>
            <li> I would return them for a refund if they weren&#x27;t so cheap, but instead I wanted to warn everyone and make this company accountable for putting this garbage out there..</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable..</li>
            <li> Skip this junk and go for the cheap, off-brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a great product that I buy several times a year.  </li>
            <li> plus comfortably also.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap price.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to keep your mouth clean and flossed.</li>
            <li> I got a pack free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Plus it glides through smoothly.</li>
            <li> great price for a standard product .</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews say their floss broke, which made me hesitant to buy these, but I did anyway because they were Prime and fairly cheap, and I had NO problems.</li>
            <li> it is waxed if also comes out and goes in smoothly and almost never pulls on the crowns if you have any.</li>
            <li> It does indeed glide between teeth smoothly.</li>
            <li> The toothpick on the back is great</li>
            <li> Mint flavor is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great for flossing daily</li>
            <li> Oral B is usually a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> These picks go in really smoothly</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love these because my teeth are very close together and most types of floss I have tried tend to rip or break apart.</li>
            <li> I really like this flosser!!!</li>
            <li> plastic isn&#x27;t super strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a loyal Oral-B customer, so when I saw these I bought them (even added to my Subscribe and Save).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the floss breaks too easily</li>
            <li> They make flossing quick and easy.</li>
            <li> They break super easily.</li>
            <li> They provide a consistent, smooth cleaning most of the time.  </li>
            <li> These work very well and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay more and get a good quality product than this excuse of a floss!</li>
            <li> These picks work okay, but the floss is very flimsy and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> But with these, its quick, simple, and works great.</li>
            <li> but i am actually excited to floss -</li>
            <li> Love the delivery, wish product quality was higher.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Glide floss picks since 2005.  </li>
            <li> It seems strange to me because when I ordered 2 packages in November 2013 the delivered floss picks were great.</li>
            <li> I originally got these as a filler for the 20% off subscribe and save items, but I have to tell you, I am hooked now.</li>
            <li> While Glide floss is great stuff, these flossing picks are a minor disaster.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t really represent a very good value at 3.47 for 75, but I constantly floss and had run out of Plackers that morning, so I needed to pick up something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss is perfect for my sensitive gums and clears out deep between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I bring this to work and keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> By far the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used 6-7 different kinds!</li>
            <li> Oral B should know better, and clearly needs to a much better job of design and product testing, when it comes to flossing tools.</li>
            <li> It even says it right on the package!</li>
            <li> You and your dentist will wonder what the heck you&#x27;ve been doing right after using these babies!</li>
            <li> The pic works good, and they last longer than just once-and-toss.  </li>
            <li> I need 2-3, sometimes as many as 4 of these to floss my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> I use these for my 4.5 year old son, and they slide in and out so nice that he lets me do it.  </li>
            <li> Nice for sensitive teeth...</li>
            <li> Overall good.</li>
            <li> honestly I dont think I would floss as often if all I had was the old string.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t have much more to say.</li>
            <li> We use glide floss, so it is good to find these for the car and my purse when I can&#x27;t use regular floss.</li>
            <li> But one has to use something so this is good enough.</li>
            <li> things considered, this is a good solution, especially with Subscribe &amp; Save pricing.</li>
            <li> Many people have problem not flossing as much as they should be.</li>
            <li> Not as good as regular Glide floss.</li>
            <li> do think the softness is a good quality for younger children.</li>
            <li> I really am completely satisfied with the product and with the attention given by you really that I have recommended my friends</li>
            <li> The minty flavour is lovely, but again I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much whitening happening with these.  </li>
            <li> My husband lives for these and loves mint so it was a true winner for him.</li>
            <li> Kind of neat not to have to use the old wrap around the finger floss, but</li>
            <li> superior to regular floss although i did bleed the freshness and gentleness are unparalleled</li>
            <li> I saw a guy at work with them and have loved this product immensely ever since I found them.  </li>
            <li> I now use DenTek extra strong floss picks and they work amazing compared to these.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works better than other flosses and is entirely painless</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is by design but the floss breaks pretty easy</li>
            <li> and these would break pretty easy on that spot, but find on the rest.  </li>
            <li> - the floss itself does not snap, as I&#x27;ve experienced with other brands, and they even offer some whitening, and a minty flavor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other floss picks than these to compare to, but these ones work great.</li>
            <li> These also cost about 25% more than regular floss picks and you are wasting anywhere from 1 to 3 more picks when you floss.</li>
            <li> Super flimsy and break after a couple teeth.</li>
            <li> -just breaks quickly.  </li>
            <li> These are super flimsy and rip when I use them.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I know its better to use regular floss</li>
            <li> We received them quickly and will reorder them online.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and well</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t break too quickly and they do the job.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t money worthy.</li>
            <li> The floss seemed to break quite quickly and sometimes caused pieces of floss to get stuck in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> top of this, a 75 pack of these are actually 20 cents more than a 150 count package of Plackers Twin-lines at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Love them and will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different brands and these are my favorites, primarily for the wider, more comfortable floss.</li>
            <li> Go get a cheap knock off of these, as the oral-B ones break consistently... I end up having to use 2-3 per time</li>
            <li> But, I think Oral-B puts out a long like of good products.  </li>
            <li> am not an abusive user, and have happily used other brands (namely Plackers, to be honest) and tried to save some money last time</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and makes oral hygiene so easy.</li>
            <li> I have gone through an entire pack of these and love them!  </li>
            <li> you are able to use ordinary dental floss without shredding it, then you may be able to use these dental picks without too many problems.  </li>
            <li> work great for people like me with tight teeth</li>
            <li> These works great if you&#x27;re teeth are really tight.</li>
            <li> best pick i ever used but very hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> The floss is soft and very cheap.</li>
            <li> The string busts right quick.</li>
            <li> the glide part is great, the 3 stars are because there is little to no tension on the floss.  </li>
            <li> These are very convenient and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I like to floss, flossing is fun</li>
            <li> This is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they rarely break if I do it the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> have a minty fresh flavor that make you want to use one daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each time a fresh one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even worth</li>
            <li> It was a rare occasion that I didn&#x27;t need  two picks to finish flossing my breath.</li>
            <li> The fact that I&#x27;m making the effort to write this review proves how aggravated I am with this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> having been said, here&#x27;s why these picks might be worth it to you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pointy tip at the bottom is useful for cleaning close to the gums between teeth.</li>
            <li> if he or she thinks it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I realize that they break sometime, but that&#x27;s rare.</li>
            <li> I really liked the white ones that the floss element was perpendicular to the body of each piece.</li>
            <li> With this style I rarely had the floss break or separate from the holder when I was flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh with this products that one could almost be fooled to not brush afterwards.</li>
            <li> Fresh and minty floss.  </li>
            <li> hey it is useful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Surprised that there are so many folks for whom they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had regular Oral-B floss picks and liked them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty easy to handle and use, much better than actual floss.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not Oral-B Glide 3d White Floss Picks&#x27; fault, so I can&#x27;t deduct a star for my inability to find the right kind of floss.</li>
            <li> The strings break easy but they&#x27;re super cheap on Amazon especially with subscribe and save so worth</li>
            <li> I am definitely way too excited over a dental tool!!</li>
            <li> The mint lasts a bit longer than the other competitors I&#x27;ve tried (3 of them) and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall still superior floss picks to any other.</li>
            <li> The dentist hasn&#x27;t complained so they must work good!</li>
            <li> They literally glide right in.</li>
            <li> Come right out of the plastic housing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> the pick end is amazing for small spots and I love the glide floss.</li>
            <li> For the price this was quite a decent pack- filled to the brim with picks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re ok with using multiple picks for a flossing session then it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> Second they break very easily.  </li>
            <li> The floss does break easily (pulls out of the holder) but not usually before it is used for a while (they are disposable after all).  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable to hold and constructed such that it&#x27;s easy to access hard-to-reach teeth.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to use and more comfortable than traditional floss packs.</li>
            <li> Best floss out there, a little thicker than regular floss</li>
            <li> The floss doesn&#x27;t break as easily as with other more string-like floss picks.  </li>
            <li> The other end is a tooth pick, not as strong but sure gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The pick end is sharp and strong - stronger than most others&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These picks, while they have some good reviews, have all of the common problems of cheap floss picks and more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much easier to use this type of floss over the regular string kind.  </li>
            <li> The branding bit didn&#x27;t really enter my consciousness when I purchased these, but for those who want to know if these picks have extraordinary teeth-whitening properties, they do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These tiny things are simple to use, and they work great.</li>
            <li> It breaks far too easily.</li>
            <li> Only thing is if you leave them on for more than 10 minutes your teeth will become very sensitive and feel kind of soft.</li>
            <li> I find that they slide so easily through my teeth compared to regular wax floss, so if you have tight tooth junctions, this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li> I expected better from this company!  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to remove them from between your teeth at the ends where the floss goes into the handle rather than trying to rip them out from between your teeth in the middle of the floss... they break every time if I don&#x27;t take them out the right way..</li>
            <li> say good bye to conventional flossing and toothpicking!</li>
            <li> The kids like using them and even my little one can do a pretty good job by herself.</li>
            <li> I have osteoarthritis and flossing is a pain (literally), so I was super excited to find that these require barely any effort.</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what its supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> the Oral-B ProHealth picks better, especially for crowded teeth.</li>
            <li> They leave your teeth the very refreshed feeling after flossing!</li>
            <li> Just pull it out of the bag and use it as opposed to having to unwind floss, wrap it around your fingers, constantly unwind more ect.</li>
            <li> Sometimes on the first tooth..</li>
            <li> Definitely doing it so much more.</li>
            <li> For mah in between ;)</li>
            <li> So guess what that most likely means,</li>
            <li> Most of them fall apart after only flossing a couple of teeth.</li>
            <li> These picks do exactly what they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I have been using floss picks for years and have tried so many different brands.  </li>
            <li> This is the first floss that has made my gums bleed or gotten stuck that I feel like I am pushing my teeth apart.  </li>
            <li> no lasting for sure.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many brands of floss picks and this is the ONLY type that works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have some teeth that are pretty close together</li>
            <li> The string breaks the first time you try to slip it between your teeth.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer keenly pointed out, these are branded as being &amp;#34;3D White,&amp;#34; as if they somehow whitened your teeth more than the next leading brand of floss.  </li>
            <li> The floss breaks pretty often.</li>
            <li> Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time trying Oral B after years of Dentek.</li>
            <li> I started scraping my teeth with these and my dental exams really improved!</li>
            <li> The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love glides regular floss</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys using these!  </li>
            <li> My honey refuses to use them and unfortunately I&#x27;m not a fan</li>
            <li> /&gt;-much more convenient than regular floss&lt;</li>
            <li> Teeth are the only area of your body that can&#x27;t heal itself, so be sure to massage your gums, and reduce tarter, plaque and bacteria by flossing.</li>
            <li> The store brand ones I get at a local drugstore are more sturdy than these are.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that Amazon carries them because my local Walgreens (where I had been purchasing them), WalMart, Krogers no longer sell them!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much better than trying to use dental floss when you have an infant and a toddler constantly pestering you when you are trying to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be interested in suggestions.</li>
            <li> Much more efficient than those wooden tooth picks that can break apart in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t mention them (because I can&#x27;t remember exactly which company)</li>
            <li> The whitening power is real!)</li>
            <li> I love these 3d white products.</li>
            <li> I was expecting higher quality from a Glide product.</li>
            <li> And on top of the flimsiness of the floss strip, they did a poor job of actually getting the food out of my teeth, a task that&#x27;s handled superbly by the Plackers Twin-line flossers I normally use.  </li>
            <li> , however I have been able to use the DenTek, rinse it, use it again, rinse it again, and use it a third time.</li>
            <li> bought these because it was my first time flossing</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this product even though it looks like a good value.</li>
            <li> The variety that are green and doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; mentioned are just as good.</li>
            <li> The glide floss slides right in between and the plastic pick makes it easy to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> so instead of doing it once a week like with the other kind i am flossing 2-3 times a day with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is a nice touch, but other brands also offer that feature.</li>
            <li> All other flossers aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth or easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the material for the floss is kinda flimsy so its only good for one or two uses..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anybody wanting to use the old kind of floss anymore since, to reach the back teeth</li>
            <li> They make flossing significantly easier than your traditional floss, and it&#x27;s easy to keep some handy anywhere, because of their small, discreet size.</li>
            <li> Spend less time on the packaging and more on the quality control Glade!</li>
            <li> The picks on the back end are pretty weak/bend easily, but I dont care because I dont use them</li>
            <li> Have seen positive effects on my teeth.</li>
            <li> floss picks are pretty much what one would expect from floss picks.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much does what you expect.</li>
            <li> You usually makes good products</li>
            <li> I put a hand full in my purse so I am prepared for the unexpected meat or</li>
            <li> Yes, the floss is fragile and can break, but these slide between my tight teeth so easily!!!</li>
            <li> The minty taste isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak, it leaves a nice feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> They break really easy to the point where I would have to use three of them for my entire mouth .</li>
            <li> I now only use this make - they don&#x27;t break easily, and they slide between your teeth well.</li>
            <li> I have seen several reviews noting that the picks easily broke, but that has not been the case for me.</li>
            <li> I switched from different Glide Floss Picks which did tear easily.  </li>
            <li> String is strong enough as well and has a mint coating.</li>
            <li> but you are getting large quantity</li>
            <li> I did get these pretty cheap with a coupon but don&#x27;t go above and beyond to use these when a generic one will work just as fine as the floss part seems to fray easier than I feel it should.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a different style of Oral-B dental floss gadgets which I was quite happy with.</li>
            <li> the floss does break fairly easy compared to regular floss but much easier to use plus a bonus of a pick</li>
            <li> The original pick is only 30 per pack, but worth every single one of them:  the floss is strong, easily glides between teeth, and reaches the back teeth.</li>
            <li> but a friend of mine told me how much she likes these because they are much sturdier and solid than the easily bendable Dentek version</li>
            <li> Pretty decent for its price.</li>
            <li> They are flimsy and flat and break very quickly.</li>
            <li> flat, strong and minty.</li>
            <li> They are very average and have a nice scent to them.</li>
            <li> I understand this floss can&#x27;t do much to make your teeth &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; compared to others, but I actually found this easier to fit between my tighter teeth.</li>
            <li> i know this sounds really dorky</li>
            <li> I expected much better quality from Glide.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to use 4-5 of them to finish your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are also very close together</li>
            <li> They are also much easier and faster to use them floss.</li>
            <li> I can even do this with one hand while getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses them.</li>
            <li> Wife buys another brand accidentally - they head straight to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a minty taste or smell</li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth at least 50% whiter overall and made me more confident with my smile.</li>
            <li> Oh yeha they break very</li>
            <li> having to maneuver one&#x27;s whole hand in your mouth to floss w/these... try that</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t recommend them to anyone, also there is too much mint paste on them.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt the teeth, the design is reasonable</li>
            <li> Very minty</li>
            <li> this does both very well.</li>
            <li> Once it breaks you can&#x27;t really use a 1 inch piece of floss, so I feel a bit wasteful.</li>
            <li> I brought these so called floss picks because they were an add-on item and the price seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li> With Dentek, I can floss whole mouth with one.</li>
            <li> I have another brand that work much bettter..</li>
            <li> It can take up to 3 of these picks to do my whole teeth.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t unusually close together or anything.</li>
            <li> floss picks haven&#x27;t really caused me any pain.</li>
            <li> the whole family uses these.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.  </li>
            <li> The pick end is great too for areas around permanent dental work (permanent spacer bars behind teeth after braces).</li>
            <li> The 2 packages I just ordered will go straight into the garbage can.</li>
            <li> these work really well.  </li>
            <li> much cheaper than Walmart</li>
            <li> These perform their intended function very well.</li>
            <li> I had to use 3 or 4 just to floss my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> These flossers work really well for me; my teeth are close together</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like flossing that much</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see that.</li>
            <li> These are great because they are made of the thin Glide tape material and they never break.</li>
            <li> Really, Oral B ???</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Some break before i get through the whole mouth, so one or two with rinses in between.  </li>
            <li> These work, but are not as durable as the ones with real floss in them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> It takes me 2-4 picks to get through my whole</li>
            <li> They are so much sturdier than the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this and really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> These are the second best flossers I have used, but are number one for value as the white ones are more expensive.</li>
            <li> It came factory sealed with fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I floss after every meal, but at work, I like to use these disposable picks because i can use and toss it fast.</li>
            <li> I find them to break and shred wayyyyyyy too much.</li>
            <li> So there isn&#x27;t much else</li>
            <li> I really like the way these feel to use, however I am giving 3 stars since they break often.</li>
            <li> It takes about five of these to make it through all of your teeth and most of your time is spent trying to get the pieces that broke off of the flosser out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Even when they do not break, they become very frayed by the end.</li>
            <li> so it really become uneconomical.</li>
            <li> Does it really help whiten surfaces between teeth?  </li>
            <li> I would order Glide products again but would recommend the straight handles which are much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> They rip after just one or two teeth and it takes four or more picks to complete both upper and lower jaw.</li>
            <li> The floss on the Oral-B Glide 3D white floss picks is simply too flimsy to be effective.</li>
            <li> These are not like other pick floss products, the floss is flat which sounds good at first but never feels like it is doing the job.  </li>
            <li> main issue is.. cost,  what I get out of a bag of this vs a roll of floss,  the roll is just much cheaper and lasts me a lot longer than a bag of these, if they were much much cheaper and came in a large bulk, then I would switch to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These flossers would be really good if the floss was a little stronger, but about 1 in 5 times I need to pull out a second flosser because the floss on the first one breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not a sting but more of a band, with a sharp edge.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks very easily; much more than other brands.</li>
            <li> The floss on these breaks more than any other flossing sword I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t seem to do anything more for whitening your teeth than any other floss would).</li>
            <li> Other brands work a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love these floss picks because they seem sturdier then other brands.  </li>
            <li> The floss holds together better than other ones I have used.  </li>
            <li> The mint is slightly more pronounced with these picks than with other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive tried these and many other brands.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges and you can use the other end more safely.</li>
            <li> These guys are about 1/2&amp;#34; shorter than the other brands and WAAAAY more durable.  </li>
            <li> They slide in the teeth and out without getting stuck like many other flosses.</li>
            <li> So they might cost a tad more than the other brands</li>
            <li> The floss is not weak, it is how it is lodged in the plastic which is faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , these floss picks glide a lot better than other cheaper brands I have used.  </li>
            <li> You will need to be VERY gentle when using this product, and I&#x27;ve used several other brands that are far superior.</li>
            <li> Overall saves me time, and keeps my mouth clean.</li>
            <li> pic end is slightly textured which feels like its doing a better job than a simple smooth ended pic&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some floss picks that are quite durable, some that will not break even if you tried to break it, but these broke after going through 2 gaps, I end up using 3 to clean an entire mouth, rather than using one and rinsing between gaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using them for a few weeks and have had 2 break on me; however, I wonder if they made it more durable, if it wouldn&#x27;t slide so easily, just like all the others.</li>
            <li> I went back to using Dentek comfort clean</li>
            <li> Not hard on the gums at all!</li>
            <li> Extra ironic; flossing actually resulting in MORE stuff being stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I will get more of a knack for using these down the line and maybe not break them anymore.</li>
            <li> Perfect for tight fitting teeth and crowns - the only drawback are the very sharp pointy pick ends - they could hurt if not used very carefully.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s rare for the floss to completely pull free from one side or the other, about once a week I&#x27;ll experience one of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say 5% of them break in my mouth, which happens to be 5% more than the store brand at half the price.</li>
            <li> I have much more control over the string which means less pain for me.</li>
            <li> More than half of the flossers have fallen apart when used.  </li>
            <li> I tried to floss it out, and 2 more picks broke in half.  </li>
            <li> I used another brand previous to this and they worked much better.</li>
            <li> Easier to use that actual floss and is a bit more acceptable to do in a diner than to actually floss.</li>
            <li> floss product (which is what happened to me), which is a much better product (also more expensive).</li>
            <li> these break quickly - need several to floss each time.  </li>
            <li> I love the white picks as they last</li>
            <li> Compared to regular floss these cost a bit more, but they make flossing enormously easier.</li>
            <li> I wish P &amp; G would stop producing this particular product.  </li>
            <li> Decent Product for the price.</li>
            <li> My wife finds around the same wastage--maybe a tiny bit more because she works faster than I do.</li>
            <li> They work decently well, assuming the floss thread survives.</li>
            <li> These ones in particular have a sturdy handle.</li>
            <li> These are decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is the one I like best so far, especially because they break so much less often.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are tight together, stay away from this and try a better brand like Plackers instead.</li>
            <li> I was highly displeased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now the price is too high</li>
            <li> For anyone who hates to use floss but appreciates the benefits of flossing, I HIGHLY recommend this product; is it genius?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend this product over the floss picks I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend this product over the floss picks I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This cuts up my gums frequently, even when other most picks would not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what their definition of &amp;#34;shred resistant&amp;#34; is but these shred VERY easily and break even easier.</li>
            <li> the floss breaks very easily and does not hold up past 3-4 teeth.</li>
            <li> OK, maybe not excited...</li>
            <li> I have found better quality glide floss picks - these are a little flimsy but they do the trick.</li>
            <li> recommend spending little more money and buying the Plackers Twin Line Whitening Floss</li>
            <li> /&gt;Y&#x27;know, if they gave *these* away at the dentist&#x27;s office instead of those little &amp;#34;6 feet of no-thank-you&amp;#34; packs, I bet more people would floss.</li>
            <li> I do have a spot or two where the floss tends to snag a little more than it does in the rest of my mouth.</li>
            <li> easy to use, the floss doesn&#x27;t fray apart during use like other brands.</li>
            <li> But again, the other ones cut my gums too easily</li>
            <li> but the floss is very flimsy and would break frequently while flossing.  </li>
            <li> These were a great price as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; but they are difficult to use because of the curved handles.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re reasonably priced and have enough in the way of added features to justify the slightly higher price, depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for from a floss pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re reasonably priced and have enough in the way of added features to justify the slightly higher price, depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for from a floss pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We just figure that into the total price of the package and make a judgment on whether it&#x27;s worth it for the quality of the flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I like this one because your mouth feels fresh after flossing.</li>
            <li> Way easier than normal floss.</li>
            <li> As for the mint flavor, I only really taste it when I first go in, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> I sometimes go through a few of them just to floss one time, where before, I never had to use more than one.</li>
            <li> This has a stringy type of rubbery plastic that shreds off pieces that get stuck between if you use it for more than a few passes between teeth - you then need to get another one to get the piece of plastic out which defeats the purpose for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried normal floss</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the normal glide floss and use plackers for my floss picks.</li>
            <li> The floss get broken doing front teeth who have a good gap.</li>
            <li> But if you like the thick kind, you will like these.</li>
            <li> but I might have to go back to normal floss because these seem to break really easily when I&#x27;m trying to floss my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have used other floss and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I love floss picks because I am always finding times when I need a quick floss/pick and its just too inconvenient to bust out the full roll of floss.</li>
            <li> Some reviews say these break too easily... but they are average floss picks.  </li>
            <li> pointed end is great as a toothpick but the floss section quickly breaks, typically leaving behind shreds of dental floss in my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started with simple generic ones from the grocery store and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> some break on the first tooth, so I count myself lucky if I can do half my mouth with one of these.</li>
            <li> Extra is the nice little flavor it leaves in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li> so I live with these.</li>
            <li> I can get through maybe 3 teeth before I have to throw it away and get a new one.  </li>
            <li> and i wanted to live longer</li>
            <li> The floss in between the plastic tears easy after getting through half of my teeth.</li>
            <li> They do not make a huge difference in whitening or removing stains, and the mint is super subtle.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really taste the Mint but that no big deal since you aren&#x27;t supposed to suck on them haha.  </li>
            <li> We use the regular rolls ourselves because these floss picks create a lot of waste, but we buy these for the kids so that they can floss on their own.  </li>
            <li> I understand the mixed reviews here, but both my wife and I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than Oral-B&#x27;s cheaper flossers, these are more durable (no more broken floss) and the &#x27;pick&#x27; end gets in between the teeth nicely.</li>
            <li> The only difference is in the pretty packaging with the new buzz words you&#x27;ve been seeing plastered all over dental products these days.</li>
            <li> The floss thread gets loose quickly.</li>
            <li> Although I really like the Oral B Glide 3D white picks, I wish they were constructed a little bit better.</li>
            <li> We all have tight teeth and dental work that snags floss easily.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not that tight together, and yet I still go through 2-4 picks every time I floss as they break almost laughably easily.  </li>
            <li> I love these because they can be carried in a small bag in your purse and you will have both floss and a pick in an emergency.</li>
            <li> I have used many floss picks in the past and had no issues.</li>
            <li> Buy Plackers instead - they are usually around the same price if not cheaper and are 1000 times better!  </li>
            <li> Reaches all corners of all teeth due to the unique angle of its string.</li>
            <li> After about the first to second tooth the floss comes apart and then I have to switch to the handle.</li>
            <li> Lower quality than expected but not bad.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth and bought these because standard string doesn&#x27;t work effectively for me.  </li>
            <li> Kind of ridiculous, I&#x27;m guessing the pack may be old.</li>
            <li> The main reason that I use Glide is that my teeth are very close together, so I can&#x27;t use traditional floss without shredding it.</li>
            <li> They break when using them but not if your super careful.</li>
            <li> Flat ribbon floss also works much better than the average brand.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Floss doesn&#x27;t seem quite the same as the glide in large roles.  </li>
            <li> The floss on these breaks super easily so be careful!</li>
            <li> Stay clear of this product.</li>
            <li> The glide type is the only one that I like to use for my teeth because it&#x27;s soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> I have to use 4-5 floss per cleaning cycle to do complete flossing.</li>
            <li> Some the floss strand detaches from the flosser completely, and others bits of the floss shed itself into my mouth or between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I end up using about 3 picks each time to completely floss my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far (three days in), I have had no issues with it</li>
            <li> As far as their effectiveness at cleaning between the teeth, I don&#x27;t know how they compare to flossing with the type of floss tape that comes in a roll.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to use then regular floss.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE DA MONEY</li>
            <li> it is from oral-b, but its too soft and like tofu.</li>
            <li> Floss picks are much, much easier than trying to use your hands to maneuver regular floss.</li>
            <li> MUCH TOO FRAGILE.</li>
            <li> I would stay far away of this brand.</li>
            <li> The product claims shred resistance, but they shred frequently.</li>
            <li> I floss at least 4 times a day, just to be flossing most times -</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end bends within seconds, absolute garbage.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this one as it is the smoothest between my teeth of all brands I tried so far.</li>
            <li> Plus I can use these at my desk after lunch without looking like a complete weirdo.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use up to four to complete flossing every evening.</li>
            <li> The type of floss used in the Eez-Thru picks, is not as smooth as Glide floss, but the floss does remain quite taught under heavy usage.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t happen every time and really maybe only once a week</li>
            <li> Sadly, my husband wants the kind of floss pick that has &amp;#34;two strings&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li> used a few more from the Amazon order, same experience</li>
            <li> Unlike cheap generic floss picks the floss doesn&#x27;t break off and the pick is just the right balance between hard and soft.</li>
            <li> : the only drawback is that if you apply more power, pull left and right,  then pull up hard the floss may break.</li>
            <li> Comes with the whiting on the floss to clean in between teeth, These do NOT break when your trying to use them in between teeth that are tightly together.  </li>
            <li> and I dont really have them break very often, but when they do its a very tight section between 2 very crammed teeth where no floss would survive.</li>
            <li> Upon encountering any obstruction or resistance, the floss would promptly break (I once went through no less than five picks to completely floss my mouth).</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of floss picks available at my local store like the Dentek ones and they hurt and cut my gums.</li>
            <li> What makes these so fantastic is that the pointy edge is flat and somewhat rough and you can use it to scrape the sides of your teeth before flossing.</li>
            <li> The floss doesn&#x27;t break easily and lends a small mint flavor</li>
            <li> My first time buying this type of floss picks and found that the string breaks every single time.</li>
            <li> The floss is not tight</li>
            <li> string wears down quickly on some pics.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE these, but only wish the handles were angled like the previous style so that it was far easier to access the teeth properly</li>
            <li> someone higher up that makes these kind of cost cutting decisions needs to be fired for this.</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble getting floss between my teeth, but this worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t typical floss material, they are more of a wide plastic like material.</li>
            <li> I have normal teeth and spaces between (I&#x27;m assuming, as my dentist has never told me any different)</li>
            <li> they are smooth but a little too fragile.</li>
            <li> If I remember where, I just go through that space a little more carefully.</li>
            <li> So if you were thinking of buying this particular product because it supposedly has some special properties beyond ordinary floss, don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> This is my new regular brand.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are about the same as any of the others similar to these, so</li>
            <li> Thin enough for people with nice teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together and most types of floss are unable to get in between without breaking.  </li>
            <li> I personally hate to floss because my teeth are SO tight, but I was so happy when I tried Glide because of how easy it fits in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I get tired of the stores marking up the prices on these, they arrived quickly and were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The floss is flat and thin, so it fits nicely.</li>
            <li> but it is very easy to use and cleans in between teeth very well without cutting gums.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Glides are made with a much softer plastic material unlike the harder plastic handles of some brands.</li>
            <li> Chinese garbage.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I have used a couple different flosser products so far</li>
            <li> I have to use multiple picks to floss completely.</li>
            <li> These minty-flavored floss picks are not lasting nearly as long as my other original pack.</li>
            <li> Subtle mint flavor and strong floss doesn&#x27;t rip during use.</li>
            <li> These haven&#x27;t broken once yet (vs. before I would get a dozen or more that would break), so they have improved.  </li>
            <li> thick floss that goes between your teeth smoothly.</li>
            <li> and then I have to use more to try and get the broken floss remnants out from where they broke</li>
            <li> I go through at least 4 or 5 picks for each flossing simply because the floss separates between the two sides of the pick so easily.</li>
            <li> I used to get cheap glosses at walmart or dollar tree but no more!</li>
            <li> I have used other Oral-B Products in the past, and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, my teeth are rather tight, but then that&#x27;s the compelling reason to use a ribbon-type floss instead of the traditional waxed variety.</li>
            <li> This floss is very soft and comfortable on your gums unlike other types we&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> and I guess they don&#x27;t create as much friction as the other ones do.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it really makes your teeth any whiter than flossing with any other floss.</li>
            <li> Compared to &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; picks, I much prefer the Glide floss due to its comparatively lower rate of breakage and the ease with which it can access the often-tight spaces between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the wide, ribbon-shaped nature of the floss, along with the slightly waxed surface, that makes this floss pick clean so thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers say this does not happen, but it does, and frequently, even if you have only moderately close teeth.</li>
            <li> , I got the floss in but for whatever reason it wouldn&#x27;t pop back out and it was kind of scary.</li>
            <li> I literally went through 5 in a row before I gave up and used some of the other brand I usually use which were much better and around the same price.  </li>
            <li> It takes me on the average of 3 or 4 picks to clean in between all of my teeth one time due to breakage.  </li>
            <li> It began to split apart after the first few teeth I cleaned, and by the time I got to the end</li>
            <li> the first few swipes</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a true negative 1 star.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad floss, it is actually really nice to use and slides between teeth really smoothly!</li>
            <li> Stay away, floss breaks way too easily compared to the Plackers floss I got at Walmart and other brands i&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Easily break compared to other flossing tools I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> They do this so well that the first time I used them, I went between my teeth several times to confirm that I wasn&#x27;t missing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But have to say first time I bought those blue once instead of green and there are so week, breaking as soon</li>
            <li> but like how thin they are and easy to use</li>
            <li> A single flossing session sometimes required two or three of these to complete.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands where the string doesn&#x27;t pull out of one end with normal use.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really get everything because the floss isn&#x27;t really tight.  </li>
            <li> These gliders work very well in tight spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 4 star rating rather than a 5 because they are a little large for my mouth and for children.  </li>
            <li> This product (ordered beginning of March 2014) is pretty useless because the floss shreds very fast.</li>
            <li> I have some teeth that are very close together, and others that are difficult to floss, and require a little more force.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the right angle to insert.</li>
            <li> I went through three other types of floss sticks to see which one I&#x27;d like and this one came out the clear winner, as a note I floss after every</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long though, and will need to use several of these to floss my teeth before brushing.</li>
            <li> They are thin and flat and not angled like the original ones.</li>
            <li> expected, the Glide floss slides easily in between my teeth, but unfortunately the floss easily becomes loose, and loses tension.  </li>
            <li> The toothpick end is usually also flat and thin, so it fits nicely, but some are blunt (maybe a shipping issue?).</li>
            <li> Unlike other cheap floss picks, these have another serious problem.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this iteration from Glide isn&#x27;t as nice as their last one; the floss isn&#x27;t as tightly secured.</li>
            <li> These exact picks are hard to find in grocery stores or pharmacies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I wonder how much floss is in this bag compared to a small box of floss.</li>
            <li> I like the flat floss it uses and the pick</li>
            <li> I use one green floss normally, with this it is up to three per use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously used Oral-B Complete Floss</li>
            <li> I am lucky to get through 1/4 of my mouth before I have to toss the broken flosser.</li>
            <li> Strong yet thin enough to for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I expected higher (or at least the same) level quality but have had the hardest time with them breaking.</li>
            <li> Finally, they are more expensive than other picks!</li>
            <li> My teeth are a bit tight in some spots, and these frequently pull the floss off of the handle, or just tear it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are a bit on the tight side, but I didn&#x27;t have this problem nearly as often as the Plackers brand.</li>
            <li> Oh, the &amp;#34;radiant mint&amp;#34; flavor is pretty subtle.</li>
            <li> I have tried these picks and they are a very poor substitute for the original floss picks of the same name - do not be fooled as I was and buy them.</li>
            <li> Cheap and poor quality!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said these are the most durable out there, in spite of the handles being awkward.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a weird plastic material that frays with the first pass, assuming it didn&#x27;t snap completely.</li>
            <li> So, with this in mind, I am thankful to the manufacturer, for giving me this gift in strange wrapping.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product since long time</li>
            <li> If you floss rough enough to break them you should talk to your dentist.  </li>
            <li> bought some of these 3d Glide picks in this listing from a drugstore this week, because we are on a long vacation</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about trying floss picks for a long time.</li>
            <li> It can break sometimes, but usually only if I am too rough with the floss.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product; saved my teeth and gums from a bad review at the dentist the other day.</li>
            <li> These are my new floss sticks, hands down!!</li>
            <li> Whereas I could typically use a single Placker for days on end (flossing 2-3 times daily), these barely lasted for a single floss -- if that!</li>
            <li> terrible, cheap quality, break so easily.  </li>
            <li> The actual floss is not too tight on the stick so it reaches deep between the gums (and doesn&#x27;t hurt like the others)</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s very thin and smooth.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my teeth are just abnormal somehow; but after seeing the same problems described in other reviews, I suspect that my experience is the rule rather than the exception.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i agree with the other reviewer who said that these are not minty - no, they&#x27;re not, but if you&#x27;re brushing your teeth afterwards i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal.</li>
            <li> , I got these because they were the same price as the other glide floss picks</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely no different from any other floss you can get when it comes to whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give back to Mother Earth in other ways, I guess.</li>
            <li> I end up using about 3 flossers each time due to them constantly breaking.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks every single time I use it.</li>
            <li> Every single one breaks in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Other brands will break and requiring you to use at least 4 for your whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was curious and had two other people try them and all had the same result.</li>
            <li> This product is above average in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but it hurt my fingers, teeth, and took too long and got my hands all wet with saliva.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of floss picks, and prefer Glide floss, but these fall apart or one end of the floss break loose from the plastic before you can finish three teeth.  </li>
            <li> The floss seems to come loose from the plastic and just snaps off.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks loose quite often with these.</li>
            <li> I can say that I have noticed a difference in teeth whitening, but I will say the flosses are loose and break.</li>
            <li> One of our toddler twins would constantly bite down on our fingers and knuckles when flossing her teeth.</li>
            <li> I had to hunt someone down to find regular floss to get it out.  </li>
            <li> I have used Dentek floss in the past but recently ordered Glide 3D white floss picks as they were on sale on Amazon</li>
            <li> As with just about any set of floss picks, these make flossing significantly less onerous and saves your from having to cut off circulation to your fingertips with traditional floss.  </li>
            <li> They break in half instantly.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, I got a pack from Walmart and 2 days later my Amazon order arrived (I had forgot that I also ordered it from Amazon ;)</li>
            <li> I find these less productive than regular floss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every single one of these will break if your teeth are even remotely close together.  </li>
            <li> have several teeth that are tight together (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> Definitely do not purchase if you have tight teeth.</li>
            <li> But for those with some tight spots, and places that shred regular floss, you may have some problems using these picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not recommend the Oral-B Glide 3d White floss picks for anyone who has any tight spaces between their teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for Glide floss picks, but unfortunately this product has a major issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many flosses, even brands I have not heard of, none of them have performed so badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to the green ones I used before.</li>
            <li> They shred or break after only flossing a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> However the green pack has a sharper tip at the back where I could use as a toothpick.</li>
            <li> What I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I started on my bottom teeth in the center</li>
            <li> But every time I floss with one of these, the &amp;#34;thread&amp;#34; becomes very loose when I&#x27;m about halfway through, and then it breaks altogether.</li>
            <li> messy and easier to use than traditional floss&lt;</li>
            <li> I started using these about six months ago after I broke a tooth and had trouble with food getting stuck under an ill-fitting cap that regular flossing and brushing could not always dislodge.</li>
            <li> The feet of floss, wrapping around fingers that get jammed in and out of my mouth, it&#x27;s not something I look forward to.  </li>
            <li> Minus 2 stars for deceptive marketing.</li>
            <li> Matter of fact, I had two break in a row just a few minutes ago trying to get between the same two teeth!</li>
            <li> They do work, but not as sturdy as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> I think people are paying for the Oral B name plastered on the package and not really much</li>
            <li> Came in time and just what expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really never had that problem with picks before</li>
            <li> I have trouble cleaning my back teeth with these.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing my teeth, but I put things next to the sofa and it makes flossing a lot more convenient when I&#x27;m watching a tv show.</li>
            <li> However, the floss strands are much too wide, and too thin - they fray and snap when flossing.</li>
            <li> These picks are generally not up to the task, as the floss often begins to sag after using the pick on just a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very fun.</li>
            <li> I am reducing my review to two stars as this 3d white floss pick are quite less strongfull than the green ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any issue with other floss breaking.</li>
            <li> Work as well as other floss picks I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> the floss on the other.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviewers, if they were amy tighter it would rip out a tooth.</li>
            <li> These floss picks pretty much fail when trying to use them.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other brands of floss picks that I have tried-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like it gets as much as other flossers do.</li>
            <li> Literally every other floss I try to use falls apart in my hands.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any other brand.</li>
            <li> I understand why they broke, but do other floss brands not break?  </li>
            <li> It does happen to me when I try other floss</li>
            <li> plastic itself is softer than other picks.</li>
            <li> Other brands don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over any other set of floss sticks.</li>
            <li> The pick end is way too sharp and pointy for its function.  </li>
            <li> After stabbing myself under the cuticle this evening, I threw my almost full bag out and will be getting that other brand tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> Before you are finished with the first tooth, the floss breaks making the stick completely useless.</li>
            <li> They think it&#x27;s a treat to floss perhaps due to the minty</li>
            <li> I go through 2-3 picks every time I floss, a problem I&#x27;ve never had with other brands of picks.</li>
            <li> picks are durable and do not break on every other tooth.  </li>
            <li> think, I will go with GUM or other brands</li>
            <li> Other flosses I use are too wire-y</li>
            <li> My local Walmart was out of the usual Plackers brand I buy, so I decided to give these a chance.  </li>
            <li> With that said I have been a repeat customer of these due to the taste and the price.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the floss will break, but that&#x27;s usually when I go in between/around my back tooth that has a crown.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t break and  are thin enough to fit between my tight teeth that are difficult to floss.</li>
            <li> Typically it is one side breaking loose, not the floss breaking in half.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty much useless if you have teeth that are tight or have any snags or sharp spots.</li>
            <li> After a few flossings the thread becomes loose and falls apart.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m new to the little floss stick devices - but I oftentimes have to use 2 or 3 per floss because the floss seems to be weak.</li>
            <li> I do have to work a little harder with these because they glide so well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these are so hard to find in an actual store.</li>
            <li> I know it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to use regular floss, but it is.  </li>
            <li> They sticks are too flimsy, which makes it hard to floss properly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get in there with regular flossers.  </li>
            <li> Every other flosser I&#x27;ve used have always got stuck between some of my teeth because they are so tightly aligned, and have been so hard to get in and out, especially back by my crown.</li>
            <li> Yet not worth the price.</li>
            <li> not worth the buy</li>
            <li> I like the way they feel - they really do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; between your teeth (although the &amp;#34;3d White&amp;#34; thing is questionable -</li>
            <li> I bought 20 of these packages and they break very easily, not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I floss once a day on average, I do drink a lot of tea though.  </li>
            <li> and they are not worth the bag they come in.</li>
            <li> Ones that -actually whiten-, or at least pretend to.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cardbox it came in.</li>
            <li> On average I use two each time, sometimes three.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they aren&#x27;t supper durable...if you need to force it between your teeth and pull it sometimes comes apart.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This is highly annoying and hurts, but also causes me to use a lot more picks trying to get the stuck pieces out, but those keep breaking as well, etc...</li>
            <li> The floss in the pick gets very loose after flossing a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had picks from a different brand before and that floss was not as thick as this one, and it never came off at either end even if it got stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I hate the overly minty flavor, personally, it&#x27;s almost candy sweet and who knows what that chemical is????</li>
            <li> If you have issues with breaking or fraying of thicker floss due to tightly packed teeth, then these might work well for you.</li>
            <li> It is narrow and sharp but if you push hard somewhere it is likely to bend rather than pierce the gums.</li>
            <li> jerk down to my gums and cut them.</li>
            <li> but when it comes down to it they suck.</li>
            <li> I would jiggle the thread in there, go up and down a couple of times and repeat for all teeth gaps that I can reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a little pick on one side and the floss on the other, making it the go-to multitool of oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> next to the usual floss you buy (in my case, the scope-flavored Oral-B floss picks, which I&#x27;ve never had a problem with) and say, \\&quot;Hey!</li>
            <li> so i usually end up using 2-3 floss picks every single time that i try to floss.</li>
            <li> to get the rear teeth, design makes it a little difficult, though absolutely doable&lt;</li>
            <li> the thread in these is not very strong .</li>
            <li> not very strong, have to use two per one cleaning</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could care less about the whitenening aspect</li>
            <li> If you want to pay for quality, save money and buy a less sucky product.</li>
            <li> Not super sturdy, the floss breaks from the handle after a couple teeth.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for or even less.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and don&#x27;t break like the typical picks.</li>
            <li> so it tends to shred or break less often</li>
            <li> (They&#x27;re always shifting slightly, and so are yours, whether you know it or not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always wondered why that brand had an odd safety guard you have to snap off to use the non-flossing end as a pick.  </li>
            <li> If your teeth are even slightly close, dont buy these.</li>
            <li> Your fingers don&#x27;t get the blood cut off from them and it takes less time to floss.  </li>
            <li> everyday for the past three days since I bought them, and I haven&#x27;t had ONE single strand of floss break.</li>
            <li> I have to use, on average 3-4 picks each time I floss, because they stretch or break and become unusable after just a few teeth.</li>
            <li> This may be a product of how tight my teeth are</li>
            <li> into every tight space, in every crook n cranny of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was stuck, I guess my teeth were too tight together</li>
            <li> , if you have teeth that are a bit tight, you may want to consider that they CAN get stuck</li>
            <li> my teeth are unusually tight but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> My teeth are fairly tight.  </li>
            <li> If you have crowded tight teeth, I think these work well.</li>
            <li> works well for tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> you do not have tight spaces between teeth, this may work for you.</li>
            <li> The string on this kept breaking on me, I have one spot that is a little tight on my teeth</li>
            <li> It fits a little tight there</li>
            <li> These flossers aren&#x27;t minty in the slightest (not even a little bit).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other brands do as well</li>
            <li> together-- not super-tight, but needing a little bit of push to get the floss through--</li>
            <li> which doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums and seems to even \\&quot;curve\\&quot; around the teeth a little.  </li>
            <li> These are relatively expensive, to just buying plain old dental floss, and cutting the amount you need, BUT these are pretty darn convenient, which is why I keep on buying them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are fragile, cheaply made, and a terrible value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I always seemed to try for a few weeks after going.</li>
            <li> I always have few in a bag.</li>
            <li> This one has a blunt end and thicker than the green ones.</li>
            <li> I prefer green packages which are not available on the Amazon now.  </li>
            <li> , the floss strings kept breaking after a few teeth...</li>
            <li> Honestly, they are terrible, the floss just breaks away from the stick every time.</li>
            <li> Then I ordered these and have used, or tried to use, them for a few days now.</li>
            <li> Just a few days ago I went through 4 at one time.</li>
            <li> And a few times while I was flossing they string broke.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> So I always have to use 2 to get through one round of flossing, sometimes 3.</li>
            <li> It seems like a waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> and I waste a ton of floss.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a burst of showery minty goodness in your mouth when you use these.</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s say I round that up to about 10 a week.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I like them since have trouble</li>
            <li> I ended up constantly with broken shreds of floss shoved up my gums.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it in Scope so that it killed the germs.  </li>
            <li> I have narrow gaps between my teeth and these</li>
            <li> are thin but sturdy enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> my teeth, like a lot of people are close together and these slide right through them and gets the crude out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I see my dentist and dental hygienist every 6 months, I mention that I have a spot where floss gets caught, and the dentist will sometimes make a slight adjustment (using a drill, yes!)</li>
            <li> These are no better than drug store brands costing much less</li>
            <li> It takes me 2-3 to clean my teeth because these stupid things break every time.</li>
            <li> usually use that competing brand with green packaging and green flossers.  </li>
            <li> That usually clears up the problem until my teeth shift a little again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these fragile little useless things.</li>
            <li> have big fingers that make it nearly impossible for me to manually floss my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> On average I have to use at least 2 pieces every time I floss because either the floss separates from the floss holder ends or it breaks while I floss</li>
            <li> Works just like it should and helps with flossing since I have a small mouth I have trouble using my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I keep a few in my purse in a small zip lock - just in case, as well as a package in my desk at work, and a package at home.</li>
            <li> If there is a lot of food trapped between my teeth, the floss could be quite loose, or perhaps even broken, by the time I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use them and have very tight spacing between my teeth</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth and</li>
            <li> Super annoying, then I try to get it out with another one and it rips too....................</li>
            <li> and there have been times where I have broken 4-5 flossers trying to get into a single crack...</li>
            <li> I will not reorder this bag of floss picks because the floss comes loose/breaks apart with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I bought these with the intention to start flossing since I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> These things are uncomfortable to use and way too fragile.</li>
            <li> These things are so pointless</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the flosses fault</li>
            <li> It usually takes 2 and sometimes 3 flossers to do my teeth each time.</li>
            <li> The small string of floss snaps after one or two teeth.</li>
            <li> I do have 3 crowns and thats usually where they break.  </li>
            <li> , IT BROOKE WASTE OF $$$$$$$$$!</li>
            <li> Instead of going with the usual brand I use</li>
            <li> No more excuses with these.</li>
            <li> I usually use this Glide product that I buy from Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Glide-Floss-Picks-30-count-Packages/dp/B007Y14AWC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1413484657&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;glide+pro-health+picks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more teeth marks on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whitening power of them, but they haven&#x27;t shredded or broke on me yet.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with floss picks in the past, but this brand is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to return them and buy the ones I usually use-- Dentek.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for the past week or so, and none of them have broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more running to the pharmacy and waiting in line for them.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Not a winning combination for any product.  </li>
            <li> I actually can&#x27;t find these in the store (maybe I&#x27;m looking at the wrong stores).</li>
            <li> Very frustrating because the last batch I had was also Oral-B Glide</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cut your gums like the other thin ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands of floss picks before and they haven&#x27;t broken when he used them</li>
            <li> Comparing to other floss products i have tried, this one performs poorly.</li>
            <li> I like these floss sticks, but trying other less expensive alternatives including floss sticks from Costco.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave poor reviews, but I find myself frustrated in this case.</li>
            <li> But the floss constantly breaking is horrible and super frustrating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post reviews but this product is so bad I was compelled to call it out here.</li>
            <li> These are literally the worst floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used, I go through five or six in one sitting because they break so easily.</li>
            <li> Awful product it breaks so easily</li>
            <li> These are terrible and break way too easily.</li>
            <li> The pick part is a little weird and not very easy to use on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss may break if it works too hard.</li>
            <li> My husband is really hard on dental products (toothbrushes and floss) and these did not meet his requirements.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t hard or brittle.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not that tight but every on single one of these the floss is breaking which makes them useless!</li>
            <li> This one comes off if you pull hard at either end.  </li>
            <li> how hard is it to make pics?????  </li>
            <li> and I have a hard time using.</li>
            <li> : my experience with this product was so negative, I was moved to take the time and energy to warn others in a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to use at least two of them to floss all my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have to use at least 3-4 of these every time I floss.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst floss I&#x27;ve used, it looks and tastes cheap, literally, I can feel the plastic taste after flossing with them.</li>
            <li> I think once, I had scissors in my mouth, cutting the generic brand out.</li>
            <li> You have to use at least four of them for each floss.</li>
            <li> Like all the whitening products you&#x27;ve been seeing lately?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so you won&#x27;t have to fear stabbing yourself under the nail and drawing blood, as you have a likely chance of doing with the Oral-B Glide 3D Pick.  </li>
            <li> .. I think everyone should at least try these once, maybe you will decide to switch to them.</li>
            <li> Would give it negative 5 - DO NOT BUY.  </li>
            <li> I had to write my review to counter the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I do like these floss picks, but a few of them I pulled out of the bag and the string was broken.</li>
            <li> Perhaps also because it is shaped like a narrow ribbon instead of a thin line&lt;br /&gt;-because of the ribbon shape</li>
            <li> I did not like these because they were too thick.  </li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve tried are too thick</li>
            <li> Other ones are too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
            <li> hope that this doesn&#x27;t mean that the floss is ineffective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I mean where the floss comes out.</li>
            <li> mean, -3D</li>
            <li> mean which means I use 3-4 a day.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s something weird about the floss on this thing that makes my gums hurt unlike the other brand.</li>
            <li> Makes me mad enough to write a review.  </li>
            <li> Other than the breaking factor (which makes this product useless)</li>
            <li> (know what I mean?)</li>
            <li> Besides having a less convenient angle on the floss, the attachment of the floss is very weak, and you&#x27;ll probably use at least 2 or 3 of them at a time.</li>
            <li> it is ridiculous...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality broke quickly during flossing CVS quality ones are stronger</li>
            <li> The floss breaks easily, difficult to use to reach the back teeth, not sure of the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; ingredients (probably artificial) since packaging doesn&#x27;t disclose any flavoring ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Not good a quality even if bag was unopened.</li>
            <li> Not a good deal.</li>
            <li> this is not good.</li>
            <li> these are not good quality.  </li>
            <li> I HATE the old fashion floss</li>
            <li> when it does get stuck, it tends to break---don&#x27;t have to go looking awkwardly for scissors as with other thicker flossers.</li>
            <li> The others are hard plastic and break off between my teeth!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too flexible and the floss is too weak.</li>
            <li> but then again the floss is a bit weak</li>
            <li> The thread is weak</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t go slow, SNAP!  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to try VERY hard to get a Plackers Twin-line to break.  </li>
            <li> I tried two bags of this brand (in case the first bag was just a bad run), and had a really bad experience.</li>
            <li> The one positive is the mint flavoring... but terrible for flossing.</li>
            <li> It is tough to break it.</li>
            <li> Oral B needs to rethink their design for attaching the floss to the stick since flossing is some tough business that demands durablity in the flossing instrument.</li>
            <li> I finished flossing and have a dozen broken sitting on my desk.</li>
            <li> Poor design.  </li>
            <li> This low quality makes this product worthless.</li>
            <li> Tried 2 different batches, really annoying.</li>
            <li> The floss get broken just after cleaning 4-6 teeth.</li>
            <li> 10% of the product is broken in the packaging.</li>
            <li> They really are terrible.</li>
            <li> and I hate regular thread floss.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.</li>
            <li> Not a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at keeping my flossing habit.  </li>
            <li> The floss would get broken from the end during use.  </li>
            <li> However, about 60% of mine have broken before I have completed flossing</li>
            <li> The dentist told me my teeth were not happy because I didn&#x27;t floss.</li>
            <li> These are not great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with these.</li>
            <li> Frustrating as hell.  </li>
            <li> Absolute worst floss picks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> So, they have poor value and poor performance.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality product for the Oral-B brand</li>
            <li> these are less unpleasant to use, versus floss</li>
            <li> For 3 bucks and change, 75 picks isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, given that &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; brands will give you 90-100 picks for slightly less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss on these are very weak.</li>
            <li> Very, very weak.</li>
            <li> Lousy product.</li>
            <li> Something is definitely wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry PLACKERS please forgive me for trying a competitor</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> That makes it way too expensive in my book.</li>
            <li> disturbing; no where on the package is the country of manufacture stated.  </li>
            <li> These are useless because the floss breaks after one or two teeth.</li>
            <li> Breaks off in mouth, useless.</li>
            <li> Worse, when it doesn&#x27;t break, it shreds and leaves shreds of floss stuck between your teeth, which you have to use ANOTHER pick to get out!</li>
            <li> Not impressed...</li>
            <li> Meaningless &amp;#34;3D White&amp;#34; billboarding.  </li>
            <li> Not only do they break immediately upon use, they taste terrible.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It looks like a bargain, but when they&#x27;re completely useless</li>
            <li> it was virtually useless.</li>
            <li> Floss is a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> Pick on the bottom is useless though.</li>
            <li> , sorry for the cheese.</li>
            <li> there is serious decrease of bad breath for me.</li>
            <li> Very very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> As others have said, these are very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> 1 in every 5 in the bad was broken before I even took it out of the bag.  </li>
            <li> This is a terribly disappointing product, it&#x27;s essentially useless.</li>
            <li> Those Den-Tek floss picks, or any other brand that doesn&#x27;t have an equivalent to glide is horrible.</li>
            <li> Just like a previous shopper said: this product is terrible!  </li>
            <li> Added perk of stabbing your finger and drawing blood when you reach your hand in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I was afraid of dislodging my crown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This floss breaks crazy often.</li>
            <li> These are definitely disappointing...</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with that!</li>
            <li> For me flossing was always very difficult and time consuming.</li>
            <li> Bad decision.  </li>
            <li> This floss is so bad that I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> It puzzles me why some reviews are bad.</li>
            <li> Proctor and Gamble thinks that they are going to continue profit growth by continuously degrading product quality, instead of by encouraging repeat purchases, I think that they are in for a bad surprise...</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> Bad product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible, every floss pick I&#x27;ve used has broken.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in the lack of quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the name brand but was quickly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product does exactly what its supposed to do.  Would recommend to others,</li>
            <li> The pick end works well, but the floss breaks way to easy</li>
            <li> The floss breaks too easily. I needed 2~3 to finish flossing.</li>
            <li> These work great.  I love the size, and keep them in my desk at work, in my purse, etc.</li>
            <li> The pic works good, and they last longer than just once-and-toss.  Well worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These pics are great. Subtle mint flavor and strong floss doesn&#x27;t rip during use.</li>
            <li> Lower quality than expected but not bad.</li>
            <li> easy to use, the floss doesn&#x27;t fray apart during use like other brands.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost every time - it was almost comical.  I literally went through 5 in a row before I gave up and used some of the other brand I usually use which were much better and around the same price.  I&#x27;ve never had this issue with any other brand.  Oral-B should be ashamed to put their name on this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to floss. If you go from no floss to this floss, you have taken a great step towards self-improvement and you may skip your workout for the day.</li>
            <li> Good price and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was highly displeased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Plackers brand floss picks for some time, I bought some of these, and found them to be of comparably terrible quality. Whereas I could typically use a single Placker for days on end (flossing 2-3 times daily), these barely lasted for a single floss -- if that! Upon encountering any obstruction or resistance, the floss would promptly break (I once went through no less than five picks to completely floss my mouth). Perhaps my teeth are just abnormal somehow; but after seeing the same problems described in other reviews, I suspect that my experience is the rule rather than the exception. I&#x27;ll put it this way: my experience with this product was so negative, I was moved to take the time and energy to warn others in a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, my experience with the Glide picks did serve as a contrast to the Plackers, illuminating just how great a product the Plackers are. So, with this in mind, I am thankful to the manufacturer, for giving me this gift in strange wrapping.</li>
            <li> My mom got this for Christmas and six months later I&#x27;m still using them. They break when using them but not if your super careful.</li>
            <li> Not a lot I can say about floss picks. They work and I like the minty taste. I have it on my reorder list when the time comes.</li>
            <li> These picks, while they have some good reviews, have all of the common problems of cheap floss picks and more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They break and pull apart very easily. I finished flossing and have a dozen broken sitting on my desk. It looks like a floss pick massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Threads break off and get stuck in your teeth. Some reviewers say this does not happen, but it does, and frequently, even if you have only moderately close teeth. This is highly annoying and hurts, but also causes me to use a lot more picks trying to get the stuck pieces out, but those keep breaking as well, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Unlike other cheap floss picks, these have another serious problem. They are not a sting but more of a band, with a sharp edge. This cuts up my gums frequently, even when other most picks would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Finally, they are more expensive than other picks! Yet not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure what their definition of &amp;#34;shred resistant&amp;#34; is but these shred VERY easily and break even easier. Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> If you need Floss Picks these are the best as far as what is readily available out there - that I have found. The pricing was great via Amazon but now the price is too high so I have to revert back to Walmart to buy these but that is not reflected in my star rating.</li>
            <li> work great for people like me with tight teeth</li>
            <li> The floss breaks very easily; much more than other brands.</li>
            <li> Break too easily. We like the Glide Scope Outlast better</li>
            <li> Not too strong.  I like the Oral-B ProHealth picks better, especially for crowded teeth.</li>
            <li> Good product. I hate flossing my teeth, but I put things next to the sofa and it makes flossing a lot more convenient when I&#x27;m watching a tv show.</li>
            <li> Forget about string floss. The pick part is the best. It&#x27;s so easy to floss. I keep some at work, in the car and at home.</li>
            <li> i used to hate flossing. the brand i used before would shred and cause pain in my gums. these flossers actually do glide in between your teeth and don&#x27;t shred. i know this sounds really dorky but i am actually excited to floss - so instead of doing it once a week like with the other kind i am flossing 2-3 times a day with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i agree with the other reviewer who said that these are not minty - no, they&#x27;re not, but if you&#x27;re brushing your teeth afterwards i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal.</li>
            <li> These are horrible. I have to use like three for one flossing because the string keeps breaking. Cheap and poor quality! Will never purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Works great and you get a lot</li>
            <li> Dentist&#x27;s daughter: 71 and hate flossing.  Now I do it twice a day because of these Floss-Picks!</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars, I would. The floss breaks so easily that I end up using 2-3 picks per session. Of course, that&#x27;s in the company&#x27;s best interest, if you have to buy them more quickly. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Great floss picks, why you may ask?  Comes with the whiting on the floss to clean in between teeth, These do NOT break when your trying to use them in between teeth that are tightly together.  Other brands will break and requiring you to use at least 4 for your whole mouth.  These work great, and look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the car, before a date, bathroom, etc!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++</li>
            <li> These are the worst flossing picks I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I put them between some of my tighter-together teeth the string breaks and gets stuck in between. Super annoying, then I try to get it out with another one and it rips too....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could care less about the whitenening aspect, that isn&#x27;t why I bought them. I got them because they were the only ones as a prime addon that were cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy these again, and didnt even finish the pack. I will stick to the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used &amp;#34;Plackers twin line&amp;#34; which are superior in quality and functionality.</li>
            <li> These are relatively expensive, to just buying plain old dental floss, and cutting the amount you need, BUT these are pretty darn convenient, which is why I keep on buying them. Love these!</li>
            <li> The floss breaks way too easily. I have to use at least two of them to floss all my teeth.</li>
            <li> They snap too easily.</li>
            <li> floss keeps breaking away from holder</li>
            <li> LOVE them...thank you!</li>
            <li> flat, strong and minty.</li>
            <li> i tried all of them.. this is the best</li>
            <li> I like to floss, flossing is fun and I like my pearlie whites :) Smile allot and do it often</li>
            <li> Constantly breaking in between teeth. Need 3-4 for every flossing. I&#x27;ll go back to the green ones I used before.</li>
            <li> I usually love the oral-b glide floss but these floss picks are horrible. They break really easy to the point where I would have to use three of them for my entire mouth . I&#x27;ve purchased better floss picks from the dollar store. Don&#x27;t waste your money! I now use DenTek extra strong floss picks and they work amazing compared to these.</li>
            <li> Easier to use that actual floss and is a bit more acceptable to do in a diner than to actually floss.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite floss picks! They are for sure the gliding ones! They leave your teeth the very refreshed feeling after flossing!</li>
            <li> It is true these picks will 50% slide more easily, they just don&#x27;t tell you, it will slide 50% more easily right off the pick.  I need 2-3, sometimes as many as 4 of these to floss my whole mouth. These also cost about 25% more than regular floss picks and you are wasting anywhere from 1 to 3 more picks when you floss.</li>
            <li> These flossers aren&#x27;t minty in the slightest (not even a little bit). So if you&#x27;re looking for minty floss, look else where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not sold on their supposed whitening powers, but the jury is still out on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are el sucko to the max. I&#x27;d say 5% of them break in my mouth, which happens to be 5% more than the store brand at half the price. If you want to pay for quality, save money and buy a less sucky product.</li>
            <li> OK, maybe not excited... But after a bag of Denteks, these are smoother/easier to use with no wrestling and have a stronger, better shaped pick.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have to use at least 3-4 of these every time I floss.  They break very easily.  Typically it is one side breaking loose, not the floss breaking in half.  Poor design.  I expected much better quality from Glide.</li>
            <li> love the pick side of this product. easily cleans between teeth.</li>
            <li> These suck.  The moment you apply any pressure working it between your teeth, it breaks.  Very frustrating because the last batch I had was also Oral-B Glide and they were great.</li>
            <li> (My 1st amazon review) This is the worst floss I&#x27;ve used, it looks and tastes cheap, literally, I can feel the plastic taste after flossing with them. Doesn&#x27;t live up to Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li> most of the flossing string breaks while using it ..mostly use as a toothpick</li>
            <li> Not super sturdy, the floss breaks from the handle after a couple teeth. Flavor is good though!</li>
            <li> These have been the best floss picks I have had yet. These are quality built. I have owned cheap-o brand floss picks that fall apart, stab you or just break. I like the thickness of the floss, it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning well. Never have broke the floss from the pick. They are supposedly 3d ones so they might be helping the whitening alongside of my crest 3d toothpaste .... happy customer</li>
            <li> They work good on my teeth, and keep them clean.</li>
            <li> I love these because they can be carried in a small bag in your purse and you will have both floss and a pick in an emergency.</li>
            <li> These picks work okay, but the floss is very flimsy and breaks easily. I would get a different brand that is stronger.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awful.  They shred or break after only flossing a few teeth.  You&#x27;ll have to use 4-5 of them to finish your whole mouth.  Then you&#x27;ll have to use a better quality floss to get the shreds out of your teeth.  This is a terribly disappointing product, it&#x27;s essentially useless.</li>
            <li> Lousy product. Don&#x27;t confuse this with the Oral-B &amp;#34;pro-health&amp;#34; floss product (which is what happened to me), which is a much better product (also more expensive). Besides having a less convenient angle on the floss, the attachment of the floss is very weak, and you&#x27;ll probably use at least 2 or 3 of them at a time.</li>
            <li> Super flimsy and break after a couple teeth.</li>
            <li> Very very poor quality. Stay away, floss breaks way too easily compared to the Plackers floss I got at Walmart and other brands i&#x27;ve used in the past. This low quality makes this product worthless. I would return them for a refund if they weren&#x27;t so cheap, but instead I wanted to warn everyone and make this company accountable for putting this garbage out there.. Nice going oral-b you just lost a customer for life because you cut corners on such a low cost product...someone higher up that makes these kind of cost cutting decisions needs to be fired for this. I don&#x27;t normally post reviews but this product is so bad I was compelled to call it out here.</li>
            <li> These are the worst floss sticks I have ever used. They break with just the slightest pressure. It took 8 of these to floss my teeth this morning. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these fragile little useless things.</li>
            <li> The floss on these breaks super easily so be careful! The handle is comfortable.. just with the floss didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use. Can&#x27;t explain what a pain in the ass flossing is for me.&lt;br /&gt;-Flavors are good. Leaves your mouth refreshed&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-Doesnt hurt because I have more control than floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-None. Probably more expensive than floss but who cares. This is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist always told me to floss and I always seemed to try for a few weeks after going. For me flossing was always very difficult and time consuming. Now I know people that floss regularly are shaking their heads but it is time consuming for someone just learning to floss. My teeth are also very close together so sometimes floss would jam then suddenly jerk down to my gums and cut them. Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These changed that for me. I now floss regularly with these. I have much more control over the string which means less pain for me. They are also much easier and faster to use them floss. Just pull it out of the bag and use it as opposed to having to unwind floss, wrap it around your fingers, constantly unwind more ect. I can even do this with one hand while getting ready in the morning. Overall saves me time, and keeps my mouth clean.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are very sturdy and makes oral hygiene so easy. My whole family uses them.</li>
            <li> These get the job done. I HATE the old fashion floss so I live with these. The floss often breaks and I need to use two. If you want a durable product, you may not want to buy this.</li>
            <li> These break way too easily. Can&#x27;t even get through your teeth once with one pick.</li>
            <li> The only floss picks I use. Wife buys another brand accidentally - they head straight to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY brand that has a quality floss side and a pick side that doesn&#x27;t collapse or bend during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color or flavor doesn&#x27;t matter - just make sure you get the Oral-B Glide floss picks and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this got any reviews. Requires 2-3 of them to floss teeth once. Breaks apart very very easily.</li>
            <li> The filament repeatedly shreds as you floss. Tried 2 different batches, really annoying. Had to use 3 to floss each time. My husband had the same problem.</li>
            <li> the thread in these is not very strong . one thing I cant stand is to have thread stuck in my teeth .</li>
            <li> few items do I really find a big difference between generic and branded. These Glides are one of them. I went generic, drug store brand and the floss was too think, would get stuck and with fear of breaking a tooth I&#x27;d break the string. I think once, I had scissors in my mouth, cutting the generic brand out.</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble getting floss between my teeth, but this worked surprisingly well. The pick part is a little weird and not very easy to use on my bottom teeth. The mint taste was actually not bad, I mostly use unflavoured. Nice for a change.</li>
            <li> The floss on these are very weak. I have to use 2 or 3 at each flossing. I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> I love how this cleans any junk in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> floss breaks prematurely, but the tooth pick side is awesome</li>
            <li> These are the worst flossers I have  ever used. They are flimsy and flat and break very quickly. Matter of fact they tend to get stuck in between your teeth once they break and then you have to go look for something to floss them out from between your teeth. On a plus side the flavor on them is really strong.</li>
            <li> these break quickly - need several to floss each time.  the floss itself was fine and the mint was refreshing -just breaks quickly.  I will not order these again</li>
            <li> these are less unpleasant to use, versus floss</li>
            <li> The floss breaks so easily I go through five floss picks just to floss my teeth once,</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily! I used 4 picks on two gaps and gave up. I&#x27;ve never had any issue with other floss breaking.</li>
            <li> Best floss picks Ive used!</li>
            <li> I bought these with the intention to start flossing since I have a small mouth but I might have to go back to normal floss because these seem to break really easily when I&#x27;m trying to floss my back teeth.  I don&#x27;t really notice a minty taste or smell and I don&#x27;t think they help with whitening at all.</li>
            <li> I use them every day and I love them. I always have few in a bag. I cant stand flossing, so this is the best solution.</li>
            <li> This deal is great. However the green pack has a sharper tip at the back where I could use as a toothpick. This one has a blunt end and thicker than the green ones. Otherwise, they are the same. I prefer green packages which are not available on the Amazon now.  I am reducing my review to two stars as this 3d white floss pick are quite less strongfull than the green ones. I use one green floss normally, with this it is up to three per use. Something is definitely wrong. They break up easily.</li>
            <li> This product is so terrible, I am spending time to write a review for floss. I hope that speaks volumes in and of itself. The floss breaks almost immediately and it&#x27;s the most bizarre material. It&#x27;s almost a weird plastic material that frays with the first pass, assuming it didn&#x27;t snap completely. It&#x27;s completely useless.  Skip this junk and go for the cheap, off-brand. You&#x27;re going to be better off.</li>
            <li> These are super flimsy and rip when I use them. I end up going through 2-3 during one flossing session</li>
            <li> Better and more sturdy than the Glides I&#x27;ve purchased before.  These haven&#x27;t broken once yet (vs. before I would get a dozen or more that would break), so they have improved.  I use these for my 4.5 year old son, and they slide in and out so nice that he lets me do it.  Other ones are too difficult to use. I also use them and have very tight spacing between my teeth so these work great.</li>
            <li> Worked really well. Made my teeth at least 50% whiter overall and made me more confident with my smile. Only thing is if you leave them on for more than 10 minutes your teeth will become very sensitive and feel kind of soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of floss and flossers for my family.  We all have tight teeth and dental work that snags floss easily.  These are perfect, they never snag and they taste fresh.  These are now a stple toiletry in our house!</li>
            <li> Pieces of the floss coating/string kept coming off and getting stuck in between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the floss strings kept breaking after a few teeth... it would take 5 floss picks to do my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> Favorite flossers of all time! Gentle to your gums, yet clean the best!</li>
            <li> I now only use this make - they don&#x27;t break easily, and they slide between your teeth well.</li>
            <li> these are total junk ,,,floss will break before you floss 4 teeth ,,,,i cannot understand how oral-b put their name on this junk,,,throw these in the trash,,,if you want a 5 STAR FLOSSER ,,buy GUM EEZ-THRU FLOSSERS ,,,best i have ever used</li>
            <li> Have seen positive effects on my teeth. Look forward to purchasing it again. Doesn&#x27;t last long though, and will need to use several of these to floss my teeth before brushing.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Glides are made with a much softer plastic material unlike the harder plastic handles of some brands. The pick end features serrations to aid in removal of food particles between teeth. The mint taste is awesome and you can chew on them for hours without fear of chunks breaking off and accidentally swallowing..  :-)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember why I didn&#x27;t wonder these again... Oh yeha they break very easly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouths pretty good after having braces and taking care of my teeth and I get maybe 4 teeth in and these things break... Good thing they are cheap take 4 to do my mouth ha</li>
            <li> Great Buy Great Seller!!!</li>
            <li> Convenient, perfect for office usage or on-the-go travels. The plastic part is not of very good quality, but the floss is okay and the mint smell is good. The floss may break if it works too hard.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these, but only wish the handles were angled like the previous style so that it was far easier to access the teeth properly w/out having to maneuver one&#x27;s whole hand in your mouth to floss w/these... try that w/kids... it is ridiculous...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said these are the most durable out there, in spite of the handles being awkward.  Just be sure to remove them from between your teeth at the ends where the floss goes into the handle rather than trying to rip them out from between your teeth in the middle of the floss... they break every time if I don&#x27;t take them out the right way.. but they rarely break if I do it the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; way.</li>
            <li> thick floss that goes between your teeth smoothly. These are my favorite floss picks I&#x27;ve ever purchased. They do an excellent job!</li>
            <li> Love these, the flavor and quality.beats any I&#x27;ve used before. I used to get cheap glosses at walmart or dollar tree but no more! I&#x27;ll be keeping these on the list because they are worth the price and impressed me.</li>
            <li> Oral B tests on animals, so I&#x27;m never buying anything from Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;find another brand please not this Oral B.!</li>
            <li> Came on time. What I expected.  Gets the job done.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> These are great floss picks however you need to use a couple of them if you have teeth that are close together. The floss in between the plastic tears easy after getting through half of my teeth.</li>
            <li> These floss/pics are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-They have a minty fresh flavor that make you want to use one daily.&lt;br /&gt;-The pic end is slightly textured which feels like its doing a better job than a simple smooth ended pic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The string wears down quickly on some pics.  This may be a product of how tight my teeth are but it is worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great product that I buy several times a year.  It keeps me up on my flossing and my dental hygienist notices!</li>
            <li> I like the glide because that&#x27;s what it does and it doesn&#x27;t cut your gums like the other thin ones.</li>
            <li> FLIMSY! not worth the buy, At some angles the material string would snap off of the pick. Not good a quality even if bag was unopened.</li>
            <li> This piece of junk will break in between your teeth. I just ran through ten trying to get them between my teeth. These are junk and I can&#x27;t recommend them to anyone, also there is too much mint paste on them. The picks are flimsy and won&#x27;t actually pick anything out of your teeth. There isn&#x27;t a redeeming thing about them.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt the teeth, the design is reasonable</li>
            <li> These floss picks are one of the worst I have ever used. The floss is not secured well. It rips off from the pick. I have to use 2 or 3 to every time I floss.</li>
            <li> These are the worst floss sticks ever! Honestly, they are terrible, the floss just breaks away from the stick every time. I had to use 5 to get every tooth. Do NOT buy these.</li>
            <li> Best available. Tried the rest.</li>
            <li> Each time a fresh one. My family likes more than battery FLOSSERS.</li>
            <li> Floss breaks kind of easily</li>
            <li> Bought these to keep at my desk at work. Taste great and are designed well. Unlike cheap generic floss picks the floss doesn&#x27;t break off and the pick is just the right balance between hard and soft.</li>
            <li> Probably one of THE top best flossers I&#x27;ve every tried and I&#x27;ve tried them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t break&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes good!  Very minty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One lasts for every tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No breakage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets into every tight space, in every crook n cranny of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buy two more packs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them every day, even twice a day (AM &amp; PM)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUST have</li>
            <li> These are good if you just want the toothpick.  The glide strip (dental floss) breaks almost immediately.  It has no strength.  1 in every 5 in the bad was broken before I even took it out of the bag.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I know its better to use regular floss but these are just good for picking and flossing your teeth, for especially good because I had gotten out of the habit for some long.  Excellent product that works well.</li>
            <li> say good bye to conventional flossing and toothpicking! this does both very well. plus comfortably also. At night I use regular floss, but in between meals, these are the best.</li>
            <li> Every third or forth pick, the floss breaks immediately. Love the delivery, wish product quality was higher.</li>
            <li> These break a lot. I&#x27;m not sure if other brands do as well - I&#x27;m new to the little floss stick devices - but I oftentimes have to use 2 or 3 per floss because the floss seems to be weak. Once it breaks you can&#x27;t really use a 1 inch piece of floss, so I feel a bit wasteful.</li>
            <li> Perfect sized picks with Glide floss. No shredding!  I don&#x27;t know why these are so hard to find in an actual store. We received them quickly and will reorder them online.  I&#x27;m finished wandering around in every store &amp;#34;hoping&amp;#34; they&#x27;ll have what I want.</li>
            <li> There are better brands for this type of product. The floss picks tend to break during use.</li>
            <li> Cheapest floss picks you&#x27;ll find, but it&#x27;s not without reason. The floss on these breaks away from the pick too often,10-20% are what i would call defective.</li>
            <li> I brought these so called floss picks because they were an add-on item and the price seemed reasonable. Well, I received them and started using them the same day. These flossers break so easily I had to use 5 just for one floss cleaning. I&#x27;m so sorry PLACKERS please forgive me for trying a competitor, I won&#x27;t make that mistake again! Oral-B stick to tooth brushes. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
            <li> I have used Dentek floss in the past but recently ordered Glide 3D white floss picks as they were on sale on Amazon and I used subscribe and save. The floss get broken just after cleaning 4-6 teeth. I have to use 4-5 floss per cleaning cycle to do complete flossing. The floss get broken doing front teeth who have a good gap. With Dentek, I can floss whole mouth with one. Will not recommend.</li>
            <li> Useless. The floss breaks almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Nice for sensitive teeth... plastic isn&#x27;t super strong.</li>
            <li> Title speaks for itself. 10% of the product is broken in the packaging. Cheaply made product but I guess when you pay $3 dollars or so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Work as well as other floss picks I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> These Floss Picks are terrible. They rip after just one or two teeth and it takes four or more picks to complete both upper and lower jaw. Why even produce something that simply does not do the job. They really are terrible. Shame on Oral B for putting their name on this product.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a different style of Oral-B dental floss gadgets which I was quite happy with. Then I ordered these and have used, or tried to use, them for a few days now. They are awful. They break at the slightest pressure. I rarely leave poor reviews, but I find myself frustrated in this case. These things are uncomfortable to use and way too fragile. I strongly urge you to find an alternative.</li>
            <li> I love the white picks as they last but these are terrible. I&#x27;m going to try the white ones again to ensure that Crest hasn&#x27;t reduced the quality of them.</li>
            <li> they break immediately</li>
            <li> The floss on these breaks more than any other flossing sword I&#x27;ve used. Just a few days ago I went through 4 at one time.</li>
            <li> I like it. Easily using.</li>
            <li> These things are so pointless I don&#x27;t know why I thought they&#x27;d be so beneficial. I sort of hate flossing because it&#x27;s time consuming so I thought these would make it easier or something but I used 4 on my top row of teeth and I started on my bottom teeth in the center and I picked the floss between two teeth and I couldn&#x27;t get it back out!! It was stuck, I guess my teeth were too tight together, I got the floss in but for whatever reason it wouldn&#x27;t pop back out and it was kind of scary. I had to cut the floss with scissors to pull it out. Not sure if it was the flosses fault but I guess I can&#x27;t use these because they get stuck in my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have teeth that are a bit tight, you may want to consider that they CAN get stuck and it&#x27;s not very fun. Also, I wonder how much floss is in this bag compared to a small box of floss. I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Oral-B has always made my favorite flossers. The strand part has good traction and also the pick part of it, which is very sharp and great for safely scrapping between your teeth. The strand can take a lot of abuse without falling off either end. I&#x27;ll keep buying these forever.</li>
            <li> Works good. Has a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> These are great floss picks that wont split and get stuck between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of floss picks, and prefer Glide floss, but these fall apart or one end of the floss break loose from the plastic before you can finish three teeth.  I will go back to regular floss when I use picks.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try it since there was a coupon... Bad decision.  The floss breaks every time after two teeth if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Compared to regular floss these cost a bit more, but they make flossing enormously easier. I find that they slide so easily through my teeth compared to regular wax floss, so if you have tight tooth junctions, this is a great product for you.</li>
            <li> These are perfect on the go or just in replacement of floss string altogether!</li>
            <li> My first time buying this type of floss picks and found that the string breaks every single time. I have used many floss picks in the past and had no issues. I was curious and had two other people try them and all had the same result. I had bought three packs and tried some from all just in case I had a faulty one, they were all bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously avoid, spend the extra 10 cents and get another brand/model.</li>
            <li> I must say these thing are the worst I have every bought.. They break very easily..  Sometimes on the first tooth.. I have another brand that work much bettter..</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product. Breaks EASILY! You get what you paid for or even less. Doesn&#x27;t even worth it&#x27;s cheap price. Terrible quality!</li>
            <li> I do like these floss picks, but a few of them I pulled out of the bag and the string was broken. And a few times while I was flossing they string broke. I would repurchase though.</li>
            <li> Horrible. The floss breaks so easily. It can take up to 3 of these picks to do my whole teeth. Very frustrating. I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> The strings break easy but they&#x27;re super cheap on Amazon especially with subscribe and save so worth the price but I wouldn&#x27;t pay anymore than I do for them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works better than other flosses and is entirely painless</li>
            <li> The floss string used in the flosser is flimsy and broke often. My husband is really hard on dental products (toothbrushes and floss) and these did not meet his requirements. I would suggest the flossers from Oral B instead.</li>
            <li> very bad. Breaks really easily. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to regular floss again. I love the convenience and the shape and design and the way it literally glides between my teeth!</li>
            <li> Good product but the floss breaks easy.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and comfortable to use. It&#x27;s handy to have the pick on one end and the floss on the other.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of trying to put my fingers at the back of my mouth to Floss the back of my teeth. These leave my mouth feeling great. Makes flossing so much easier. Definitely doing it so much more. Great for my family.</li>
            <li> I have been using flossers for about a year now. I started with simple generic ones from the grocery store and they worked fine. I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to the name brand Oral-B flossers. I expected higher (or at least the same) level quality but have had the hardest time with them breaking. It usually takes 2 and sometimes 3 flossers to do my teeth each time. That makes it way too expensive in my book. The plastic holder is good quality but that&#x27;s not where you need it. You need the quality in the floss itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible my teeth are unusually tight but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. Just get generic ones.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks before you can finish. Dont buy this product unless you are ok using 2-3 picks each time</li>
            <li> These are the only floss pics that I don&#x27;t have to shove between my teeth with 1000lbs of force. They literally glide right in.</li>
            <li> They break continuously........Buyer beware......waste of money. Get the Plackers, as they don&#x27;t break.  I thought I would give these a try, but they were terrible.</li>
            <li> For mah in between ;)</li>
            <li> I have to use 3 or 4 to get through all of my teeth because it breaks so easily.  I cancelled my subscribe and save immediately.</li>
            <li> everything was good with these , They work great</li>
            <li> I have been using these daily for about 3 weeks now.  They are of terrible quality.  More than half of the flossers have fallen apart when used.  Some the floss strand detaches from the flosser completely, and others bits of the floss shed itself into my mouth or between my teeth.  Extra ironic; flossing actually resulting in MORE stuff being stuck between your teeth.  My teeth are not unnaturally tight-fitting or anything, these things just suck.&lt;br /&gt;Also disturbing; no where on the package is the country of manufacture stated.  So guess what that most likely means, Chinese garbage.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I like the way they feel - they really do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; between your teeth (although the &amp;#34;3d White&amp;#34; thing is questionable - these don&#x27;t seem to do anything more for whitening your teeth than any other floss would). My qualm is that the floss breaks WAY too easily! My teeth aren&#x27;t unusually close together or anything. But every time I floss with one of these, the &amp;#34;thread&amp;#34; becomes very loose when I&#x27;m about halfway through, and then it breaks altogether. So I always have to use 2 to get through one round of flossing, sometimes 3. Is this the company&#x27;s way of making sure we have to buy more?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviewers, if they were amy tighter it would rip out a tooth. Best to buy and it&#x27;s an American company!</li>
            <li> I finished my pack of these floss picks. I bought the pack because it was a good price and I hate regular thread floss. It was a rare occasion that I didn&#x27;t need  two picks to finish flossing my breath. Sometimes I needed three picks. Not a good deal.</li>
            <li> Most of them fall apart after only flossing a couple of teeth. You will end up using 2-3 each time you floss. Other brands work a lot better.</li>
            <li> Good price for the amount so I can&#x27;t complain about that but the quality is not the same as what you might be expecting. I also don&#x27;t know what these have to do with whitening. I have found better quality glide floss picks - these are a little flimsy but they do the trick.</li>
            <li> These picks look really nice but when it comes down to it they suck. It takes me 2-3 to clean my teeth because these stupid things break every time. Spend less time on the packaging and more on the quality control Glade!</li>
            <li> Floss slides easily between teeth.  I only gave this a 4 star rating rather than a 5 because they are a little large for my mouth and for children.  The floss doesn&#x27;t break as easily as with other more string-like floss picks.  These are more like what I would call fish line than string-like.  The pointy end is flexible and tapered so it&#x27;s really great for getting between teeth or in hard-to-reach places.  I find myself reaching for these any time I have something stuck between my teeth, so I keep them handy.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is the one I like best so far, especially because they break so much less often.</li>
            <li> I use these picks while watching TV as it keeps me from eating junk food. My dentist is so impressed she now recommends this product to her patients who just cannot seem to floss. Extra is the nice little flavor it leaves in your mouth.  Carry them with you in your bag, in the car and a bag at work. I&#x27;ve never felt so enthusiastic about flossing.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Fit what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;No defects or blemishes. Will order this product again. I like to keep these in car for after lunch.</li>
            <li> It takes about 3 of these to floss your teeth.  The string constantly breaks.  Would never ever get these again</li>
            <li> These work nicely. The floss is flat and thin, so it fits nicely. The floss does break easily (pulls out of the holder) but not usually before it is used for a while (they are disposable after all).  The toothpick end is usually also flat and thin, so it fits nicely, but some are blunt (maybe a shipping issue?). Overall good.</li>
            <li> These picks do exactly what they are supposed to do.  The mint flavor is nice also, besides the fact they were a good deal!</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d have to check reviews for floss picks, but I wish I had! These are useless because the floss breaks after one or two teeth. I went through about 5 of them in a sitting before I gave up and threw them out.</li>
            <li> Great product and the floss doesnt break. The picks on the back end are pretty weak/bend easily, but I dont care because I dont use them</li>
            <li> Easily it breaks off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things daily for the last six months or so. They&#x27;re pretty easy to handle and use, much better than actual floss. Most of the time, I&#x27;ve been able to get whatever&#x27;s in my teeth out with the floss portion. A couple of times I&#x27;ve had to flip it around and use the pick portion. There has been maybe one time where I couldn&#x27;t get something out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These floss picks haven&#x27;t really caused me any pain. Any pain I&#x27;ve had while using them has been irregular. From the look of my teeth, they work rather well. As with all health-related things, your mileage may vary. However, I&#x27;d recommend these floss picks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a loyal Oral-B customer, so when I saw these I bought them (even added to my Subscribe and Save).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the floss breaks too easily and I end up using about 3 picks each time to completely floss my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to a different brand.</li>
            <li> It takes me on the average of 3 or 4 picks to clean in between all of my teeth one time due to breakage.  I have used other Oral-B Products in the past, and have been satisfied.  I will have to pass on this brand next time.</li>
            <li> These are the worst floss picks on the market. The floss breaks with every use and requires 3-4 picks to get a proper flossing. I cannot wait to be done with this bag. Shocking that Glide would put their name on this product.</li>
            <li> the whole family uses these. honestly I dont think I would floss as often if all I had was the old string.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars.  I have been using floss picks for years and have tried so many different brands.  I tried this because it was on sale, so figured why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using DenTek and they have been FANTASTIC, and never needed more than 1.  Oral-B Glide...I use about 8 after lunch. I just opened the bag and it&#x27;s almost gone. Never again.</li>
            <li> Since my dentist told me I have tartar-prone teeth and gums, I have been flossing daily. I have used a couple different flosser products so far and I was pretty satisfied with them. I would jiggle the thread in there, go up and down a couple of times and repeat for all teeth gaps that I can reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this product. I didn&#x27;t know flossers could be used so effortlessly. The &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; brand lives up to its name. The floss strings are ribbon-shaped. They simply float between my teeth. They do this so well that the first time I used them, I went between my teeth several times to confirm that I wasn&#x27;t missing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this doesn&#x27;t mean that the floss is ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far (three days in), I have had no issues with it and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made... Fell apart immediately after use</li>
            <li> Takes me 5 picks to floss my mouth once because the floss breaks constantly.  Worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  Get the Dentek instead.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. Floss string is very cheap. Brakes easily.</li>
            <li> Like the convenience of these floss picks and especially love the minty flavor.  I don&#x27;t like the quality or durability.  Most break apart while using them.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing Oral B again soon.</li>
            <li> Dental floss break constantly. Extremely poor quality. I would say we have to use 2-3 picks per flossing sometimes because they are -constantly- breaking.</li>
            <li> I bought 20 of these packages and they break very easily, not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend spending little more money and buying the Plackers Twin Line Whitening Floss Picks.&lt;br /&gt;The twin lines are very strong and will not break, I had to use 2 - 3 of the Oral-B vs. 1 Plackers and if you work out the numbers, the Plackers came out cheaper and better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dental floss. good stuff. i really don&#x27;t have much more to say. yet you require more words.&lt;br /&gt;great dental floss. use it every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Glide floss picks since 2005.  The original floss pick is best.  I wish P &amp; G would stop producing this particular product.  The floss breaks easily, difficult to use to reach the back teeth, not sure of the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; ingredients (probably artificial) since packaging doesn&#x27;t disclose any flavoring ingredients.  The original pick is only 30 per pack, but worth every single one of them:  the floss is strong, easily glides between teeth, and reaches the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these, because I like Glide floss...but couldn&#x27;t.  I have a couple of teeth which are close together-- not super-tight, but needing a little bit of push to get the floss through-- these things break every time.  Come right out of the plastic housing.  I like the AIM ones from the dollar store MUCH better.  If you need to wiggle the floss to get it between your teeth, you will not like these.</li>
            <li> these didn&#x27;t break as often as some I have purchased so I give them 5 stars.  some break on the first tooth, so I count myself lucky if I can do half my mouth with one of these.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price nothing but positive</li>
            <li> Absolute junk.  Floss breaks after three teeth.</li>
            <li> These did not work well.  They would break when I was using it, which cause me to have to use another one.</li>
            <li> The fact that I&#x27;m making the effort to write this review proves how aggravated I am with this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;. These floss picks pretty much fail when trying to use them. The small string of floss snaps after one or two teeth. It&#x27;s completely ridiculous. Stay clear of this product.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth.  This is the first floss that has made my gums bleed or gotten stuck that I feel like I am pushing my teeth apart.  The pick end is great too for areas around permanent dental work (permanent spacer bars behind teeth after braces).</li>
            <li> The oral-b glide are my favorite floss picks because they glide well between the teeth and don&#x27;t hurt my gums.  I have tried other brands of floss picks available at my local store like the Dentek ones and they hurt and cut my gums. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these is that sometimes they break after only flossing 1-3 teeth so I end up using 2 or sometimes even 3.  I do have 3 crowns and thats usually where they break.  As far as their effectiveness at cleaning between the teeth, I don&#x27;t know how they compare to flossing with the type of floss tape that comes in a roll.  Compared to the other brands of floss picks that I have tried- I do have to work a little harder with these because they glide so well and I guess they don&#x27;t create as much friction as the other ones do.  But again, the other ones cut my gums too easily so that&#x27;s why I prefer the glide ones.  In regards to the claim that these reduce surface stains in between teeth: I haven&#x27;t noticed that benefit and I have used 2-3 bags of these, I floss once a day on average, I do drink a lot of tea though.  I do like to have white teeth and use whitening products like the white strips, I got these because they were the same price as the other glide floss picks so I figured I would continue to buy these.  If they were more expensive than the regular glide ones I would not pay the extra money for them.</li>
            <li> Love them!  Not hard on the gums at all!</li>
            <li> Between teeth the particles stand no chance with these on your side.  Fresher breath and fewer caveties!!</li>
            <li> great price but it breaks very easily when flossing your teeth.</li>
            <li> no lasting for sure. sometimes, i got to use 2 picks to finish flossing all my teeth.</li>
            <li> I wish the tongue scraper actually was functional. It seems like a waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> We use glide floss, so it is good to find these for the car and my purse when I can&#x27;t use regular floss. Just don&#x27;t use them in public....yuck!</li>
            <li> picks break... wouldn&#x27;t not recommend</li>
            <li> Great for the price. I just wish the opposite ends were stronger so it could be used as a toothpick.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use this type of floss over the regular string kind.  Nice resealable bag makes this a good buy.</li>
            <li> The floss was constantly breaking, it would sometimes take 2 or 3 picks just to finish. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Pick and floss together&lt;br /&gt;*Less messy and easier to use than traditional floss&lt;br /&gt;*Mint flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering&lt;br /&gt;*Lots of picks in one pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Floss itself sometimes breaks too easily</li>
            <li> I always use this brand even if they break too easy. But one has to use something so this is good enough.</li>
            <li> They make flossing quick and easy. I have seen several reviews noting that the picks easily broke, but that has not been the case for me. The floss has made it through the entire mouth of flossing. No problems at all for me. I love these.</li>
            <li> Use daily. Works great.</li>
            <li> Worst floss ever. It breaks so easily. You have to use at least four of them for each floss.</li>
            <li> I love these floss picks because they seem sturdier then other brands.  The floss holds together better than other ones I have used.  This is the only ones we keep in the house.</li>
            <li> but I love them.  I know it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to use regular floss, but it is.  It makes my fingers hurt and I waste a ton of floss.  With these, I actually floss, instead of just lying to my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have gone through an entire pack of these and love them!  I have had only 1 break.  They slide easily between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different flosses and flossers. These are the only ones I don&#x27;t mind using. They glide just like the glide floss but are as easy to use as the reach flosser (which always hurt my gums)</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY!  Breaks off in mouth, useless.</li>
            <li> I love floss picks because I am always finding times when I need a quick floss/pick and its just too inconvenient to bust out the full roll of floss. I Do not like these though as they arent durable at all. I&#x27;ve used some floss picks that are quite durable, some that will not break even if you tried to break it, but these broke after going through 2 gaps, I end up using 3 to clean an entire mouth, rather than using one and rinsing between gaps. I like the flat floss it uses and the pick but the floss doesn&#x27;t stay in and thats a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I like this floss but my husband can&#x27;t use it without breaking it! I&#x27;ve bought other brands of floss picks before and they haven&#x27;t broken when he used them so I guess these aren&#x27;t as strong. They work just fine for me though and they taste pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good picks and great buy. Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> I have to use two or three of these each flossing to floss my entire mouth.  My teeth are fairly tight.  The floss in the pick gets very loose after flossing a few teeth.  Then it breaks.  Not a great product.</li>
            <li> These are the worst picks I have ever used, the floss breaks with the slightest amount of pressure to get between your teeth, and I end up using 5 picks every time. Worse, when it doesn&#x27;t break, it shreds and leaves shreds of floss stuck between your teeth, which you have to use ANOTHER pick to get out! Avoid like the plaque :)</li>
            <li> These are not as strong as the Dentek brand.</li>
            <li> It´s a good product, but, the floss breaks easily...</li>
            <li> For anyone who hates to use floss but appreciates the benefits of flossing, I HIGHLY recommend this product; is it genius? Maybe.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is double stringed.  But, I think Oral-B puts out a long like of good products.  I don&#x27;t know that it really makes your teeth any whiter than flossing with any other floss.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to keep your mouth clean and flossed. I keep them everywhere for easy use. Try them!</li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really get everything because the floss isn&#x27;t really tight.  But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily. Sometimes the floss breaks twice before I finish flossing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different brands and these are my favorites, primarily for the wider, more comfortable floss. It glides safely between my teeth and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the skinnier ones do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many brands of floss picks and this is the ONLY type that works well for me.  slides easily.  isn&#x27;t hard or brittle. has &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; floss in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to use, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not too keen on the floss that is attached. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it gets as much as other flossers do. However, I do like that it does glide smoother than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and don&#x27;t break like the typical picks. Flat ribbon floss also works much better than the average brand.&lt;br /&gt;Once you try these you will never go back.&lt;br /&gt; Flavor is just icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> the string pulls out way to easy,i do however like the tooth pick part just wish the string would stay put</li>
            <li> These things were cheap and they work like a charm! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> the glide part is great, the 3 stars are because there is little to no tension on the floss.  Still works, just not a title floss pick.</li>
            <li> These are great for use on the go, at work or well travelling. I still prefer the vibrating style flosser for at home use. Much easier to use then regular floss. I got a pack free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> DA FLOSS GOT STUCK IN MY TOOTH, IT BROOKE WASTE OF $$$$$$$$$! DO NOT WASTE DA MONEY THIS SHOULD BE -8CENTS AGH IT MADE MY GRANDPAS AND MY GUMS BLEED TOO, DO NOT BUY THE FLOSS BREAKS, just like my heart after using this product</li>
            <li> This product (ordered beginning of March 2014) is pretty useless because the floss shreds very fast. It seems strange to me because when I ordered 2 packages in November 2013 the delivered floss picks were great. (That was the reason I reordered them.) I am wondering if the production changed. The 2 packages I just ordered will go straight into the garbage can. At this moment I would not order this brand again and I will try a different brand.</li>
            <li> I started using these about six months ago after I broke a tooth and had trouble with food getting stuck under an ill-fitting cap that regular flossing and brushing could not always dislodge. These work wonderfully. I keep a bag at work with me as well as at home and in the car. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> this is not good. 3 for one time because Floss breaks so easily. it is from oral-b, but its too soft and like tofu.</li>
            <li> I have some teeth that are pretty close together and these flossers kept breaking every time I would try to floss them! I would have to get three out just to floss all my teeth! Not impressed...</li>
            <li> The floss seems to break way to easily whenever i try to use it so i usually end up using 2-3 floss picks every single time that i try to floss.</li>
            <li> Best floss out there, a little thicker than regular floss so it tends to shred or break less often yet it is easier to get between teeth  than regular floss.  The best thing about it is, you can floss with one hand and don&#x27;t have to stick your fingers in your in your mouth.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every single one of these will break if your teeth are even remotely close together.  Buy Plackers instead - they are usually around the same price if not cheaper and are 1000 times better!  Those almost never break on me.  This product was a joke.  Oral-B should be embarrased to have its name associated with this product and discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible. I just used 8 of these to floss my mouth. They break very easily. I&#x27;d previously used Oral-B Complete Floss Picks Mint 90 Count which were great, these are junk.</li>
            <li> Love these.. very easy to use and fits between teeth perfectly!</li>
            <li> These are awful. The string breaks the first time you try to slip it between your teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> These worked fine for me.  Seems like alot of people have been having a problem with them But they are causing me any troubles.  Works just like it should and helps with flossing since I have a small mouth I have trouble using my fingers.  Great for children (if your watching them) or teens.  I couldn&#x27;t really taste the Mint but that no big deal since you aren&#x27;t supposed to suck on them haha.  Decent Product for the price.</li>
            <li> The floss is perfect for my sensitive gums and clears out deep between my teeth.</li>
            <li> These work very nicely because of the glide floss. Perfect for tight fitting teeth and crowns - the only drawback are the very sharp pointy pick ends - they could hurt if not used very carefully.</li>
            <li> i have these stashed everywhere (purse, bathroom. Desk at work, etc. the pick end is amazing for small spots and I love the glide floss.</li>
            <li> best floss picks out there</li>
            <li> These are great for flossing out toddler. Much easier to use and more comfortable than traditional floss packs.</li>
            <li> the best, smoothest floss ever.</li>
            <li> These are floss picks and they work like floss picks should. They don&#x27;t break too quickly and they do the job. Sadly, my husband wants the kind of floss pick that has &amp;#34;two strings&amp;#34; on it. Heck, I can&#x27;t figure out what those are! Can&#x27;t find them anywhere. But it&#x27;s not Oral-B Glide 3d White Floss Picks&#x27; fault, so I can&#x27;t deduct a star for my inability to find the right kind of floss. Oh, the &amp;#34;radiant mint&amp;#34; flavor is pretty subtle. Don&#x27;t expect a burst of showery minty goodness in your mouth when you use these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at keeping my flossing habit.  The feet of floss, wrapping around fingers that get jammed in and out of my mouth, it&#x27;s not something I look forward to.  But Oral-B came up with something that makes it simple.  Even my dentist noticed the difference.  Open the bag (they are not individually wrapped, but the bag is resealable), take out a floss bow, and toss it out when you&#x27;re done.  Has a little pick on one side and the floss on the other, making it the go-to multitool of oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y&#x27;know, if they gave *these* away at the dentist&#x27;s office instead of those little &amp;#34;6 feet of no-thank-you&amp;#34; packs, I bet more people would floss.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon Shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These floss picks are pretty much what one would expect from floss picks.  The handle is comfortable to hold and constructed such that it&#x27;s easy to access hard-to-reach teeth.  As with just about any set of floss picks, these make flossing significantly less onerous and saves your from having to cut off circulation to your fingertips with traditional floss.  For 3 bucks and change, 75 picks isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, given that &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; brands will give you 90-100 picks for slightly less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That having been said, here&#x27;s why these picks might be worth it to you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Glide floss.  Compared to &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; picks, I much prefer the Glide floss due to its comparatively lower rate of breakage and the ease with which it can access the often-tight spaces between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Minty.  The mint is slightly more pronounced with these picks than with other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Ziplock bag.  I like that the bag has a reliable zip-lock function.  It prevents the picks from spilling everywhere should one absentmindedly grab it from a drawer or shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what to look out for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Meaningless &amp;#34;3D White&amp;#34; billboarding.  As another reviewer keenly pointed out, these are branded as being &amp;#34;3D White,&amp;#34; as if they somehow whitened your teeth more than the next leading brand of floss.  This is misleading, as these floss picks, are, in fact, just floss picks and do not have magical floss-gnomes that leap off of the picks to scrub your teeth to a mirror-shine.  The branding bit didn&#x27;t really enter my consciousness when I purchased these, but for those who want to know if these picks have extraordinary teeth-whitening properties, they do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Not unbreakable. These picks, while they never &amp;#34;shred,&amp;#34; do sometimes lose the floss, resulting in your having to grab another one to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s about the sum of it.  They&#x27;re reasonably priced and have enough in the way of added features to justify the slightly higher price, depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for from a floss pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.of it.  They&#x27;re reasonably priced and have enough in the way of added features to justify the slightly higher price, depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for from a floss pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I subscribe this for a regular delivery from amazon every 3 months. The price and convenience is great. Most of all, the product itself works exceptionally well. Reaches all corners of all teeth due to the unique angle of its string. String is strong enough as well and has a mint coating. The pointy tip at the bottom is useful for cleaning close to the gums between teeth. Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I understand the mixed reviews here, but both my wife and I like this product very much. Yes, the floss tends to tear. I use it once a day. I&#x27;d say once or twice a week the floss tears and I have to pull out another floss pick. So let&#x27;s say I round that up to about 10 a week. My wife finds around the same wastage--maybe a tiny bit more because she works faster than I do. We just figure that into the total price of the package and make a judgment on whether it&#x27;s worth it for the quality of the flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the wide, ribbon-shaped nature of the floss, along with the slightly waxed surface, that makes this floss pick clean so thoroughly. Food remnants tend to get carried off by and stick onto the wider tape, so I can see all the stuff it&#x27;s removing. Plus it glides through smoothly. I do have a spot or two where the floss tends to snag a little more than it does in the rest of my mouth. If I remember where, I just go through that space a little more carefully. When I see my dentist and dental hygienist every 6 months, I mention that I have a spot where floss gets caught, and the dentist will sometimes make a slight adjustment (using a drill, yes!) if he or she thinks it&#x27;s worth the effort. That usually clears up the problem until my teeth shift a little again. (They&#x27;re always shifting slightly, and so are yours, whether you know it or not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, this is a good solution, especially with Subscribe &amp; Save pricing.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  It took 7 or 8 of them to floss my teeth.  The floss breaks away from the plastic VERY easily.</li>
            <li> Many people have problem not flossing as much as they should be. I now have the opposite problem. I can&#x27;t go on without a pack of these in my house, car, and at work. These tiny things are simple to use, and they work great. I used to never floss because I hated using the string ones. But with these, its quick, simple, and works great. They have different flavors. Personally, I like this one because your mouth feels fresh after flossing. Buy three of these today and put one in your house, car, and work. You won&#x27;t regret it. #healthyteeth</li>
            <li> Literally every other floss I try to use falls apart in my hands.  I guess my teeth are too close together for this product.  The floss seems to come loose from the plastic and just snaps off.</li>
            <li> Instead of going with the usual brand I use (CVS cheap-o brand!) I ordered these because I figured it would be easier than heading out to CVS. I&#x27;ve had the package for about a week and they are not worth the bag they come in. I have to use about five for each floss because the floss strip breaks so easily. I have normal teeth and spaces between (I&#x27;m assuming, as my dentist has never told me any different) and I&#x27;ve been using these kind of flossers for years (the stick kind). As I&#x27;ve said they break immediately and I&#x27;ve never had that problem with any other brand. Not only do they break immediately upon use, they taste terrible. I think they were going for some kind of minty taste, but they just taste like the cheapest mint gum you could ever buy. Don&#x27;t spend your money on these, they&#x27;re worthless.</li>
            <li> They work decently well, assuming the floss thread survives. My teeth are a bit tight in some spots, and these frequently pull the floss off of the handle, or just tear it. Would be much better if the floss portion was stronger.</li>
            <li> I used to like this brand, but now every 2nd or 3rd one I use breaks. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> My favorite way to floss!  All other flossers aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth or easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I have fillings in my teeth.  I have used other floss and it worked fine.  I tried these out and they broke when my fillings got in the way.  I understand why they broke, but do other floss brands not break?  Comparing to other floss products i have tried, this one performs poorly.</li>
            <li> These are terrible. They break super easily. I have to use multiple picks to floss completely. Avoid!!!</li>
            <li> great price for a standard product .</li>
            <li> these work really well.  my teeth, like a lot of people are close together and these slide right through them and gets the crude out from between my teeth. hope i can always get them here.  much cheaper than Walmart</li>
            <li> Not as durable as I was hoping. It&#x27;s almost too flexible and the floss is too weak. More often than not they break.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Works as described&lt;br /&gt;-- Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Sometime thread breaks but you are getting large quantity</li>
            <li> They sticks are too flimsy, which makes it hard to floss properly.</li>
            <li> These perform their intended function very well. Floss picks are much, much easier than trying to use your hands to maneuver regular floss. These ones in particular have a sturdy handle. A lot of reviews say their floss broke, which made me hesitant to buy these, but I did anyway because they were Prime and fairly cheap, and I had NO problems. I&#x27;ve done my entire mouth with one of these (just one) everyday for the past three days since I bought them, and I haven&#x27;t had ONE single strand of floss break. So, I would recommend these wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> I love these flossers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the store brand junk sold at drugstores, these don&#x27;t break and pull all the gunk out from in between my teeth!</li>
            <li> Best Floss ever used! It is tough to break it. Recommended item.</li>
            <li> Great ,it look good and beautiful</li>
            <li> These are pretty good. I have only had one or two fall apart and I mean where the floss comes out.</li>
            <li> The string busts right quick. I won&#x27;t buy these again!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st ever review. This floss is so bad that I decided to write a review. I&#x27;d like to prevent others from making the mistake of buying this product. Please don&#x27;t waste your time ordering this product even though it looks like a good value. It breaks at the 1st teeth! I have used many flosses, even brands I have not heard of, none of them have performed so badly. I&#x27;d rather pay more and get a good quality product than this excuse of a floss!</li>
            <li> Great for me because I have veneers, and they get between the teeth without any problem!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product since long time and i am very happy with this. best part is that floss is pretty strong and does not break in middle. i will continue buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, as usual you are the best in providing good deals.</li>
            <li> These are handier for manual flossing but not as effective as the Flossaid device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have big fingers that make it nearly impossible for me to manually floss my back teeth.  The Flossaid flosser worked the best for me and soon stopped my bleeding gums.  .  .  .  .  .  dave in austin, texas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;summary:  breaks too easily -- try Flossaid instead</li>
            <li> I will only  use the GUM brand from now on. Ive tried these and many other brands. The GUM is just a MUCH better product.</li>
            <li> Pretty much does what you expect. Disposable floss picks.</li>
            <li> These are excellent floss toothpicks. It puzzles me why some reviews are bad. I have tried nearly every brand of floss picks and these Glide variety from Oral-B really are the best by more than one criteria.&lt;br /&gt;-the floss itself is superior to others because it is coated in a wax and when you move it against gums it is much more gentle against the gums. Perhaps also because it is shaped like a narrow ribbon instead of a thin line&lt;br /&gt;-because of the ribbon shape it is easier to dig stuff out from between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-because it is waxed if also comes out and goes in smoothly and almost never pulls on the crowns if you have any. It does happen to me when I try other floss picks.&lt;br /&gt;-the plastic itself is softer than other picks. It doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges and you can use the other end more safely. It is narrow and sharp but if you push hard somewhere it is likely to bend rather than pierce the gums. It happened to me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: the only drawback is that if you apply more power, pull left and right,  then pull up hard the floss may break. But for me it is preferable to the  getting stuck, or to pulling a crown from my tooth when the floss line is too strong and tension doesn&#x27;t reduce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall still superior floss picks to any other. The variety that are green and doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; mentioned are just as good.</li>
            <li> MUCH TOO FRAGILE. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. I have to use, on average 3-4 picks each time I floss, because they stretch or break and become unusable after just a few teeth. Other brands don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> they are smooth but a little too fragile.</li>
            <li> This floss picks can reach almost anywhere.Very cheap as well</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t great for floss but the pick portion works well!</li>
            <li> The floss broke on two of these within 30 seconds. Kind of ridiculous, I&#x27;m guessing the pack may be old. Either way this will be the last time I buy these and I&#x27;ll probably just need to throw the rest of the package away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with caution!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent for its price. I bring this to work and keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Opened the package and had to use 3 to floss. 1st two broke in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Not as good as regular Glide floss.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks pretty often. Sometimes, they break and the fibers get stuck between your teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss is not tight</li>
            <li> The strings break very easily. I would rather using regular floss than these. I&#x27;ve been using the Plackers brand and they are much better.</li>
            <li> Did anybody else see this product sitting on the shelves (or on Amazon) next to the usual floss you buy (in my case, the scope-flavored Oral-B floss picks, which I&#x27;ve never had a problem with) and say, \\&quot;Hey! 3D White! Even floss picks are whitening now!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, -3D White-. Like all the whitening products you&#x27;ve been seeing lately? It even says it right on the package! So great, put it in the cart and let&#x27;s go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I got home with it that it occurred to me to look at it and see how the whitening feature actually works or what additional ingredient they put into the floss. (Even on the Amazon page for this product, it lists 3D White as a product feature.) Want to know how it works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It...reduces...plaque...between...teeth. Like ALL floss is supposed to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right. This product is absolutely no different from any other floss you can get when it comes to whitening. The only difference is in the pretty packaging with the new buzz words you&#x27;ve been seeing plastered all over dental products these days. Ones that -actually whiten-, or at least pretend to. So if you were thinking of buying this particular product because it supposedly has some special properties beyond ordinary floss, don&#x27;t bother! Any floss will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 5 stars for a good overall product (I have always liked using Oral-B&#x27;s floss picks and the mint flavor is nice). Minus 2 stars for deceptive marketing.</li>
            <li> These are decent. I bought some from Meijer (my local grocery store) that were no name brand that seem to hold up just as well. I did get these pretty cheap with a coupon but don&#x27;t go above and beyond to use these when a generic one will work just as fine as the floss part seems to fray easier than I feel it should. Still happy with the purchase based on how much I paid.</li>
            <li> Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The floss on the Oral-B Glide 3D white floss picks is simply too flimsy to be effective. I go through at least 4 or 5 picks for each flossing simply because the floss separates between the two sides of the pick so easily. You will need to be VERY gentle when using this product, and I&#x27;ve used several other brands that are far superior. I&#x27;d recommend passing on this one.</li>
            <li> These are horrible. I just went through 3 floss picks during 1 flossing session. Back to cvs store brand for me.</li>
            <li> No more excuses with these. They work great most of the time. I have very tight teeth and the floss occasionally falls out of the pick so it takes 2 to floss sometimes.</li>
            <li> good taste, perfect for work!</li>
            <li> Have used now for a week and every time I floss, at-least one of the floss-sticks break. The floss/wire detaches from one side of the holder, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time trying Oral B after years of Dentek. Dentek isn&#x27;t perfect, but I&#x27;m off to order the kind I used to get.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks when you&lt;br /&gt;Use them</li>
            <li> working well. good product.</li>
            <li> I bought these after I ran out of Dollar Store floss picks. I went by the Oral-B name and thought I was getting something good. I was wrong. These are literally the worst floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used, I go through five or six in one sitting because they break so easily. Matter of fact, I had two break in a row just a few minutes ago trying to get between the same two teeth! And they&#x27;re not pushed close together either! I should&#x27;ve stuck with the dollar store ones.</li>
            <li> These are my new floss sticks, hands down!! I went through three other types of floss sticks to see which one I&#x27;d like and this one came out the clear winner, as a note I floss after every mean which means I use 3-4 a day. The actual floss is not too tight on the stick so it reaches deep between the gums (and doesn&#x27;t hurt like the others) and it&#x27;s really strong, I had to once use the same floss stick twice and it worked well the second time (flossed then ate dessert). The other end is a tooth pick, not as strong but sure gets the job done. I would recommend these over any other set of floss sticks.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not that tight but every on single one of these the floss is breaking which makes them useless! I had to use 5 of them in one sitting just to floss my teeth!  I will never ever buy these again.  I will stick with Plackers. http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Micro-Mint-Flossers-Count/dp/B008IHHPJ6/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_hpc_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0SWB6ECFQHQ00W89Y1Y6</li>
            <li> these are not good quality.  they break ever time you use them.  I would not buy these again do not purchase</li>
            <li> Way easier than normal floss. Many of these picks break, but these hold up. Strong yet thin enough to for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Some reviews say these break too easily... but they are average floss picks.  If you floss rough enough to break them you should talk to your dentist.  They are very average and have a nice scent to them.</li>
            <li> This floss is very soft and comfortable on your gums unlike other types we&#x27;ve used in the past.  We use the regular rolls ourselves because these floss picks create a lot of waste, but we buy these for the kids so that they can floss on their own.  The kids like using them and even my little one can do a pretty good job by herself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of floss/picks and this is the best of the bunch. Smooth flossing action and the pick is the best I&#x27;ve used. Only brand I buy now.</li>
            <li> These are great flossers! I realize that they break sometime, but that&#x27;s rare. What makes these so fantastic is that the pointy edge is flat and somewhat rough and you can use it to scrape the sides of your teeth before flossing. I started scraping my teeth with these and my dental exams really improved!</li>
            <li> My title says it all. I am lucky to get through 1/4 of my mouth before I have to toss the broken flosser.</li>
            <li> May work for some people; but these tend to break when going between some of my tighter spaced teeth. I prefer the glide floss or the GUM Dental pics.</li>
            <li> Just like a previous shopper said: this product is terrible!  It looks like a bargain, but when they&#x27;re completely useless it&#x27;s actually a ripoff and a waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several teeth that are tight together (who doesn&#x27;t?) and there have been times where I have broken 4-5 flossers trying to get into a single crack... and then I have to use more to try and get the broken floss remnants out from where they broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an abusive user, and have happily used other brands (namely Plackers, to be honest) and tried to save some money last time I bought these.  BIG MISTAKE, DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I originally got these as a filler for the 20% off subscribe and save items, but I have to tell you, I am hooked now. Each pick is well constructed and I have never had a problem with the floss coming off the unit. As for the mint flavor, I only really taste it when I first go in, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. Each package lasts me about two months as I only floss at night. Take care of your teeth!!</li>
            <li> These work very well and are very easy to use. They were just what I was looking for. Good price too.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than Oral-B&#x27;s cheaper flossers, these are more durable (no more broken floss) and the &#x27;pick&#x27; end gets in between the teeth nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been uskng Glide products for about 15 years. I really liked the white ones that the floss element was perpendicular to the body of each piece. With this style I rarely had the floss break or separate from the holder when I was flossing.&lt;br /&gt;These newer ones have a better pick end. But the floss end is terrible for my flossing needs. The main reason that I use Glide is that my teeth are very close together, so I can&#x27;t use traditional floss without shredding it. On average I have to use at least 2 pieces every time I floss because either the floss separates from the floss holder ends or it breaks while I floss...argh!</li>
            <li> These work great. I love them because I don&#x27;t have to rip off a piece of floss everytime I want to floss. I just reach into the bag and grab one. The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I had picks from a different brand before and that floss was not as thick as this one, and it never came off at either end even if it got stuck between your teeth.  This one comes off if you pull hard at either end.  Maybe that&#x27;s a feature, but I didn&#x27;t like it.  Otherwise it&#x27;s fine and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These Floss Picks work great - the floss itself does not snap, as I&#x27;ve experienced with other brands, and they even offer some whitening, and a minty flavor. I keep a few in my purse in a small zip lock - just in case, as well as a package in my desk at work, and a package at home. They make flossing significantly easier than your traditional floss, and it&#x27;s easy to keep some handy anywhere, because of their small, discreet size. These floss picks are the perfect solution for anyone who dreads flossing, or just wants to have something better than a toothpick for on-the-go scenarios.</li>
            <li> Pro:  They floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: They don&#x27;t floss as well as competing brands.  Added perk of stabbing your finger and drawing blood when you reach your hand in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use that competing brand with green packaging and green flossers.  I always wondered why that brand had an odd safety guard you have to snap off to use the non-flossing end as a pick.  Now I know why.  It&#x27;s so you won&#x27;t have to fear stabbing yourself under the nail and drawing blood, as you have a likely chance of doing with the Oral-B Glide 3D Pick.  The Oral-B does not have a safety guard to prevent puncture when you reach in the bag.  The pick end is way too sharp and pointy for its function.  After stabbing myself under the cuticle this evening, I threw my almost full bag out and will be getting that other brand tomorrow.  Also, there&#x27;s something weird about the floss on this thing that makes my gums hurt unlike the other brand.</li>
            <li> I love this they are great and so so easy to use I think every one should use these great!!!</li>
            <li> Before you are finished with the first tooth, the floss breaks making the stick completely useless. I Threw them away.</li>
            <li> They shred and the floss comes out of the plastic. Terrible. The CVS and Riteaid branded ones are better. I love glides regular floss but this stuff is a travesty.</li>
            <li> I tried two bags of this brand (in case the first bag was just a bad run), and had a really bad experience. It would take me 2-3 picks to get through my teeth because the floss would break too easily. My teeth are a bit on the tight side, but I didn&#x27;t have this problem nearly as often as the Plackers brand. If your teeth are tight together, stay away from this and try a better brand like Plackers instead.</li>
            <li> terrible, cheap quality, break so easily.  waste of money</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth and bought these because standard string doesn&#x27;t work effectively for me.  These are not like other pick floss products, the floss is flat which sounds good at first but never feels like it is doing the job.  Second they break very easily.  I go through 3-4 picks in one flossing session.  Defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys using these!  They were a great price and the quality is great too!  Would recommend to anyone looking for floss picks!</li>
            <li> These are a joke. Very, very weak. I had to use 3 or 4 just to floss my whole mouth. Definitely do not purchase if you have tight teeth.</li>
            <li> These are in now way comparable to the DenTek.  The floss would get broken from the end during use.  It would sometime take up to 3 Oral-B floss picks to do the same job as one DenTek.  I am switching over to DenTek.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so fresh with this products that one could almost be fooled to not brush afterwards. Fresh and minty floss.  My dentist even recommends it.</li>
            <li> These minty-flavored floss picks are not lasting nearly as long as my other original pack. I sometimes go through a few of them just to floss one time, where before, I never had to use more than one. I feel the floss isn&#x27;t as strong in this pack.</li>
            <li> These flossers work really well for me; my teeth are close together and it&#x27;s hard to get in there with regular flossers.  these do break easily, though.</li>
            <li> Awful product it breaks so easily you can even floss 1tooth! Not worth the cardbox it came in.</li>
            <li> The floss falls out as soon as I put it through any molars.</li>
            <li> easy use, and my kids like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss every day for almost a year now.  I switched from different Glide Floss Picks which did tear easily.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with these.  I might have had maybe one tear on me out of every packaging of 75.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Glide is a must.  Those Den-Tek floss picks, or any other brand that doesn&#x27;t have an equivalent to glide is horrible.</li>
            <li> Durability wise, these aren&#x27;t the best &#x27;floss picks&#x27; on the market. The floss is soft and very cheap. It began to split apart after the first few teeth I cleaned, and by the time I got to the end it was virtually useless. The mint flavor is a nice touch, but other brands also offer that feature. For the price this was quite a decent pack- filled to the brim with picks. But unfortunately, it definitely lacked qualitty. My honey refuses to use them and unfortunately I&#x27;m not a fan either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the softness is a good quality for younger children. Because they are gentle, they would be great for sensative gums and kids. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think many kids will be too fond of the mint taste. So maybe, if you do purchase this brand for your kids, opt for the unflavored ones.</li>
            <li> These works great if you&#x27;re teeth are really tight. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I usually use this Glide product that I buy from Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Glide-Floss-Picks-30-count-Packages/dp/B007Y14AWC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1413484657&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;glide+pro-health+picks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those work well enough, even though Proctor and Gamble has cheapened them with thinner floss since P&amp;G bought the brand from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some of these 3d Glide picks in this listing from a drugstore this week, because we are on a long vacation and I forgot to bring my Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Glide 3d floss picks are absolutely awful.  The worst product I have ever used.  The floss breaks so often that I have to use a minimum of two, and more often three, picks every time I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fragile, cheaply made, and a terrible value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Proctor and Gamble thinks that they are going to continue profit growth by continuously degrading product quality, instead of by encouraging repeat purchases, I think that they are in for a bad surprise...</li>
            <li> The floss breaks loose quite often with these. When it stays put, it works splendidly. It does indeed glide between teeth smoothly. However, about 60% of mine have broken before I have completed flossing</li>
            <li> Floss is a necessary evil. These are great on the go. If you like to follow the advice of your dentist, as I do, these are good to have.</li>
            <li> This product is above average in my opinion.  It is the best I have gotten my hands on, but there is room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Can bite the pick to get the floss between your teeth&lt;br /&gt;-much more convenient than regular floss&lt;br /&gt;-thicker floss allows for better cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-difficult to get the rear teeth, design makes it a little difficult, though absolutely doable&lt;br /&gt;-floss sometimes breaks in your teeth, not the strongest material</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen brands for floss picks and got this as an &amp;#34;Add On&amp;#34; via Amazon Prime.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  These guys are about 1/2&amp;#34; shorter than the other brands and WAAAAY more durable.  In fact they feel stronger than a regular toothpick.  The mint lasts a bit longer than the other competitors I&#x27;ve tried (3 of them) and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  This is my new regular brand.</li>
            <li> I like the taste but these guys do not hold up on my teeth. I have some crooked ones and the floss just breaks after 5 or so teeth. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are the only floss picks I like.  I wish they came in non-flavor as the mint can be a bit over-bearing.  But they work for my teeth so that makes me happy.  They slide in the teeth and out without getting stuck like many other flosses.</li>
            <li> One of our toddler twins would constantly bite down on our fingers and knuckles when flossing her teeth. She couldn&#x27;t just keep her mouth open while I did it, so we decided to try these out. No more teeth marks on my fingers. They think it&#x27;s a treat to floss perhaps due to the minty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s more plastic that ends up in the landfill, but my fingers thank me. I&#x27;ll give back to Mother Earth in other ways, I guess.</li>
            <li> I really am completely satisfied with the product and with the attention given by you really that I have recommended my friends and well I hope to buy something and receive the same attention</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for a while and it is remarkable. I don&#x27;t like flossing that much but it is very easy to use and cleans in between teeth very well without cutting gums. Must Buy!</li>
            <li> The floss has a good flavor to it, but it tears easily.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are goo; However since the floss tears easily, the product doesn&#x27;t serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> As others have said, these are very poor quality.  My teeth are not that tight together, and yet I still go through 2-4 picks every time I floss as they break almost laughably easily.  I was subscribing to this but just canceled in favor of something else.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.</li>
            <li> I love these for the kiddos because they are so easy to use, and it gets them flossing every day. I use these mixed in once in a while with regular floss.  The only reason I give  4 stars if for their claim that it whitens teeth. I really don&#x27;t see that. I cannot even see how floss would ever even do that, so I guess I bought into their marketing schemes on that one. Doesn&#x27;t mean it is a bad floss, it is actually really nice to use and slides between teeth really smoothly!</li>
            <li> A clean mouth is a happy mouth, this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I brush 3 times a day and had a couple cavities last year as well as two root canals. The dentist told me my teeth were not happy because I didn&#x27;t floss. Teeth are the only area of your body that can&#x27;t heal itself, so be sure to massage your gums, and reduce tarter, plaque and bacteria by flossing.</li>
            <li> I love these because my teeth are very close together and most types of floss I have tried tend to rip or break apart. These are great because they are made of the thin Glide tape material and they never break. They slide easily between my teeth and they have a nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li> Given that these are a brand name I was expecting a lot more from them. The store brand ones I get at a local drugstore are more sturdy than these are. The floss breaks after only a couple times of shoving it in between two molars. I&#x27;m really disappointed in the lack of quality.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money. The thing they are specifically designed to do they cannot do!!!  Really, Oral B ???? how hard is it to make pics?????  You usually makes good products but you bombed with these.  PS  I hate the overly minty flavor, personally, it&#x27;s almost candy sweet and who knows what that chemical is????</li>
            <li> When you find a product that you love to use, you strongly dislike when sellers quit selling it.  That has been my dilemma with these floss picks!&lt;br /&gt;These are the only picks I can find on the market that have a &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; tip on the end.  The others are hard plastic and break off between my teeth!  I am so glad that Amazon carries them because my local Walgreens (where I had been purchasing them), WalMart, Krogers no longer sell them!!&lt;br /&gt;They work well and when I have these, I know I WILL floss my teeth!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whitening power of them, but they haven&#x27;t shredded or broke on me yet.  Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Unlike cheap pharmacy floss sticks, these are thin enough to slide in between teeth and thus actually work. The pick side is also nice and slender so it works great as a pick. Only downside is the material for the floss is kinda flimsy so its only good for one or two uses..</li>
            <li> i love these flossers the floss does break fairly easy compared to regular floss but much easier to use plus a bonus of a pick</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these. The floss itself is very cheaply made. It breaks far too easily. Once it took me 4 of them just to floss all my teeth. I would stay far away of this brand. Quality &#x3D; not.</li>
            <li> I get tired of the stores marking up the prices on these, they arrived quickly and were exactly what I ordered. Saves me the hassle of going to the store while saving me money. Cant go wrong with that!</li>
            <li> go for it, why not.  Some break before i get through the whole mouth, so one or two with rinses in between.  Thin enough for people with nice teeth.  Pick on the bottom is useless though.</li>
            <li> I personally hate to floss because my teeth are SO tight, but I was so happy when I tried Glide because of how easy it fits in my teeth.  I grabbed a bag of 75 picks to have in my purse for work.  They are TERRIBLE.  They break in half instantly.  I can get through maybe 3 teeth before I have to throw it away and get a new one.  Today, I got one STUCK in my back 2 teeth.  The floss BROKE OFF of the pick and was stuck in my teeth.  I tried to floss it out, and 2 more picks broke in half.  I had to hunt someone down to find regular floss to get it out.  The Glide rope floss is great, but the picks?  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> not that great. good price, but flimsy tooth picks. would not recommend. They do work, but not as sturdy as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Very bad Quality , the floss is Separated so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they need to fix this issue as soon as possible</li>
            <li> the only floss picks I use- they don&#x27;t break and  are thin enough to fit between my tight teeth that are difficult to floss.</li>
            <li> I did not like these because they were too thick.  After using them once my gums hurt.  I prefer the skinny type of floss.  But if you like the thick kind, you will like these.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> These are not great quality. They break very easily when trying to get in between teeth.</li>
            <li> Worst floss ever.  Takes 4 or 5 to floss all my teeth since they break so easily.  Don&#x27;t buy.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Work great! Have bought more!</li>
            <li> These work, but are not as durable as the ones with real floss in them.  This has a stringy type of rubbery plastic that shreds off pieces that get stuck between if you use it for more than a few passes between teeth - you then need to get another one to get the piece of plastic out which defeats the purpose for me.</li>
            <li> best flossing product around</li>
            <li> This is simply horrible. The floss breaks every single time I use it. I go through 2-3 picks every time I floss, a problem I&#x27;ve never had with other brands of picks. Avoid this! Defective product!</li>
            <li> Breaks everytime! Everytime! Bad. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Like the mint flavor and easy to carry in purse or pocket</li>
            <li> The product claims shred resistance, but they shred frequently. Otherwise, they do what they are made to do when they don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> These exact picks are hard to find in grocery stores or pharmacies.&lt;br /&gt;These picks are durable and do not break on every other tooth.  So they might cost a tad more than the other brands but this one is the best value and the best at keeping your teeth clean.  Highly recommended!  5 STARS !</li>
            <li> Exceptional product; saved my teeth and gums from a bad review at the dentist the other day. I&#x27;ve been flossing with these regularly and they taste great, do a fantastic job of cleaning debris, and are very easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> hey it is useful but then again the floss is a bit weak but i have no poblems its all good</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of floss, this was the best. My teeth are very close together and most types of floss are unable to get in between without breaking.  The glide floss slides right in between and the plastic pick makes it easy to reach the back teeth. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> These are the smoothest gliding flosspick I&#x27;ve ever used. -1 because the floss breaks easier than others. It&#x27;s not a big problem but I feel like 1 out of every 20 breaks.</li>
            <li> perfect resealable bag fits in the car glove box to pick and preen when you&#x27;re on the go and can&#x27;t brush.</li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with floss picks in the past, but this brand is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss snaps so easily. It takes me 2-4 picks to get through my whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never buying again.</li>
            <li> Horrible!  Every single one breaks in my mouth.  I expected better from this company!  Hate them.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with these. At all. I have to use three (plus) each time I floss. The floss breaks constantly. The pick end is sharp and strong - stronger than most others&#x27;. But the floss constantly breaking is horrible and super frustrating.</li>
            <li> I used to get the regular Glide floss picks and they are great, when they became unavailable Amazon suggested these. I don&#x27;t like them. They are thin and flat and not angled like the original ones. I discontinued my subscribe and save order and purchased the regular ones through Drugstore.com. I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are terrible and break way too easily. I did not floss one tooth, and went through 5 sticks. I am going to return them and buy the ones I usually use-- Dentek. They are so much sturdier than the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks with just one use on a tooth. In one tooth floss time, I went through 6 flossers. :(&lt;br /&gt;It is a waste of money on that, plus, they really don&#x27;t even whiten. I floss at least 4 times a day, just to be flossing most times - I&#x27;m OCD about it and didn&#x27;t notice any whiten change. These aren&#x27;t money worthy.</li>
            <li> These flossers are working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the same as ones that I saw in my parents&#x27; house when I visited, and so to save time I just went and ordered them from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using them for the past week or so, and none of them have broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a mint flavor, which is nice. The mint flavor is not too strong.</li>
            <li> quite handy, easy to use. good quality, the floss didnt break/get stuck in the teeth while using.</li>
            <li> Although I really like the Oral B Glide 3D white picks, I wish they were constructed a little bit better. The floss seemed to break quite quickly and sometimes caused pieces of floss to get stuck in between my teeth. If you&#x27;re ok with using multiple picks for a flossing session then it&#x27;s not bad but you definitely will not get away with using one pick for your entire mouth. The minty flavour is lovely, but again I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much whitening happening with these.  Even though they didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth I will purchase these in the future because they are the best picks I&#x27;ve used and they taste good too!</li>
            <li> I tried these, break too easily.  I would not buy these again.  I don&#x27;t feel they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really like this flosser!!! It is now my favorite. Yes, the floss is fragile and can break, but these slide between my tight teeth so easily!!! I have osteoarthritis and flossing is a pain (literally), so I was super excited to find that these require barely any effort. I&#x27;ve only been using them for a few weeks and have had 2 break on me; however, I wonder if they made it more durable, if it wouldn&#x27;t slide so easily, just like all the others. I&#x27;m hoping I will get more of a knack for using these down the line and maybe not break them anymore. I am definitely way too excited over a dental tool!! I LOVE HOW EASY IT IS TO FLOSS NOW! Ha ha, sorry for the cheese. Every other flosser I&#x27;ve used have always got stuck between some of my teeth because they are so tightly aligned, and have been so hard to get in and out, especially back by my crown. What a nuisance it was. Sometimes I was afraid of dislodging my crown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to stock up on these and hope they never get discontinued! Hope my review helped and happy shopping :)</li>
            <li> Great  Highly Recommend this product over the floss picks I used to buy. Great  Highly Recommend this product over the floss picks I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality. It is not durable at all. At one time you have to use more than one because they break easily and loosen as well. If there was an option to give it zero star, I would never have hesitated to do so. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> So much better than trying to use dental floss when you have an infant and a toddler constantly pestering you when you are trying to brush your teeth.  Nice sturdy floss and holder so didn&#x27;t break when trying to use it as well.  I would suggest them to anyone to use as part of their daily routine.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end bends within seconds, absolute garbage. The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my husband because I like and use Glide floss.  He says the handle is comfortable but the floss tears easily.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  I just bought a pack of 75 floss picks. I have used 3 out of the pack, and each time the floss breaks off of the floss pick when I am only a third of the way through flossing my teeth. When it comes to my mouth, I am pretty loyal to Oral B brand products because I think that they are the best, so I really can&#x27;t believe this is Oral B brand. The floss picks have a good minty flavor, but that is all that they have going for them. Oral B needs to rethink their design for attaching the floss to the stick since flossing is some tough business that demands durablity in the flossing instrument.</li>
            <li> I had 3 break trying to floss one tooth.  I&#x27;ve used other brands where the string doesn&#x27;t pull out of one end with normal use.  Frustrating as hell.  Makes me mad enough to write a review.  Avoid these unless you like throwing money away.</li>
            <li> these dont break as easy as others i have used. a nice amount for a good price. i will order these everytime i run out.</li>
            <li> My dentist, wife, and mother have been trying to get me to floss for years. I&#x27;ve tried normal floss but it hurt my fingers, teeth, and took too long and got my hands all wet with saliva. I had been thinking about trying floss picks for a long time. These ones being so inexpensive on Amazon I figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. Yup, they worked great, and I think I can develop a habit of flossing now. I haven&#x27;t used any other floss picks than these to compare to, but these ones work great.</li>
            <li> best pick i ever used but very hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are even slightly close, dont buy these. I end up using about 3 flossers each time due to them constantly breaking. Also, the advertising is misleading.. no whitening from this brand.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Go get a cheap knock off of these, as the oral-B ones break consistently... I end up having to use 2-3 per time I floss because the quality is just not there.  The one positive is the mint flavoring... but terrible for flossing.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time in lieu of regular floss and this brand breaks easier than some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This floss smells great and cleans teeth really well... When it works! This floss breaks crazy often. I often go through 3 picks just to floss one time. This is unacceptable. Other than the breaking factor (which makes this product useless) I really like the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please fix the floss strength!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, string breaks easily. I would give 0 star if possible.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I got a pack from Walmart and 2 days later my Amazon order arrived (I had forgot that I also ordered it from Amazon ;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 2 from the Walmart purchase, the threads broke easily so I read some of the reviews from Amazon and it turned out that others have had similar experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a few more from the Amazon order, same experience --&amp;#62; The product is one of the worst flosses I have ever used and I like Oral-B dental care products. The floss is not weak, it is how it is lodged in the plastic which is faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think, I will go with GUM or other brands I have good experience with.</li>
            <li> I like these floss sticks, but trying other less expensive alternatives including floss sticks from Costco. I&#x27;d be interested in suggestions.</li>
            <li> I like them since have trouble holding strings</li>
            <li> I got this and really wanted to like it but the floss is very flimsy and would break frequently while flossing.  The toothpick on the back is great so it gets two stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried these picks and they are a very poor substitute for the original floss picks of the same name - do not be fooled as I was and buy them. I have been going on line and buying up as mush overstock of the original picks as I can - many Amazon resellers have them. The folks at Glide need to get with the program and bring back the successful product before they lose more market share. These are no better than drug store brands costing much less</li>
            <li> Horrible!!  They break very easily, they also shred easy.  It takes 2 or 3 to floss my teeth.  Bad product.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy and so easy to use! Good product to have handy! Much more efficient than those wooden tooth picks that can break apart in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Absolute worst floss picks I&#x27;ve used. These break very easily. I used nine floss picks this morning. Awful product. Plackers are much better.</li>
            <li> the pointed end is not that pointed to get into my teeth. The thread is weak</li>
            <li> These are my favorite flossers. They don&#x27;t shred as easily and truly do &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;. Mint flavor is light and not overpowering. The dentist hasn&#x27;t complained so they must work good!</li>
            <li> Great for flossing daily</li>
            <li> I actually used 4 picks in one flossing experience. I don&#x27;t think I need to say anything else. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> If you have crowded tight teeth, I think these work well. Only brand and style that works for me. Surprised that there are so many folks for whom they don&#x27;t work. If you have issues with breaking or fraying of thicker floss due to tightly packed teeth, then these might work well for you. Also, I like that when it does get stuck, it tends to break---don&#x27;t have to go looking awkwardly for scissors as with other thicker flossers.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping I would recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The minty taste isn&#x27;t too strong or too weak, it leaves a nice feeling in my mouth. However, the floss strands are much too wide, and too thin - they fray and snap when flossing. They aren&#x27;t typical floss material, they are more of a wide plastic like material.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning between the teeth without damaging the gums, I love the  into scent; my teeth always feel better when I use them&lt;br /&gt;I love having them arrive at my door.. No more running to the pharmacy and waiting in line for them.&lt;br /&gt;Fast ship</li>
            <li> works well for tight teeth.  But I always get some in the package that breaks on me.  I continue to buy this one as it is the smoothest between my teeth of all brands I tried so far.</li>
            <li> These split every time I used them.  I ended up constantly with broken shreds of floss shoved up my gums. Definitely not buying this brand again.  I&#x27;d have to use like 12 floss picks to do all my teeth.  Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Break every time.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the name brand but was quickly disappointed.  Perhaps this is by design but the floss breaks pretty easy so you end up using a bunch of them.  I found that cheaper ones work much better.</li>
            <li> My husband lives for these and loves mint so it was a true winner for him. Great working product. .</li>
            <li> The floss thread gets loose quickly.</li>
            <li> These things work great! I can&#x27;t imagine anybody wanting to use the old kind of floss anymore since, to reach the back teeth, you gotta practically stick both hands in there. Sheesh, what are we, animals?</li>
            <li> I love glide floss but can&#x27;t stand these floss picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed end is great as a toothpick but the floss section quickly breaks, typically leaving behind shreds of dental floss in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the normal glide floss and use plackers for my floss picks.</li>
            <li> These are the second best flossers I have used, but are number one for value as the white ones are more expensive.</li>
            <li> But have to say first time I bought those blue once instead of green and there are so week, breaking as soon you try to use them. I&#x27;ll never buy this one again</li>
            <li> You had one job.....  These don&#x27;t do their job - which is to enable you to floss your teeth with them.  They break very easily.  And I would only complain about this if there was another company&#x27;s that actually NEVER broke.  I won&#x27;t mention them (because I can&#x27;t remember exactly which company) and I want my review to remain unbiased.</li>
            <li> This floss breaks very easily. After about the first to second tooth the floss comes apart and then I have to switch to the handle. This is more a toothpick than anything else.</li>
            <li> I find that Oral B makes the best floss sticks on the market. Without these I honestly would never floss because I can&#x27;t stand string floss.</li>
            <li> By far the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used 6-7 different kinds! I have crowded teeth, and this floss glides between them easily. I rinse the pick after each tooth so that I don&#x27;t transfer germs or plaque between teeth, and I use a separate pick for my top and bottom teeth. I noticed that when I floss and use mouthwash (This brand of mouthwash is also my favorite! The whitening power is real!) there is serious decrease of bad breath for me. I love these 3d white products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve subscribed to these for a while, but the quality of the floss on these seems to be going downhill.  While it&#x27;s rare for the floss to completely pull free from one side or the other, about once a week I&#x27;ll experience one of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* floss snaps in the middle&lt;br /&gt;* floss shreds&lt;br /&gt;* part of the floss tears free and gets stuck between my teeth, requiring a good bit of effort to dislodge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, my teeth are rather tight, but then that&#x27;s the compelling reason to use a ribbon-type floss instead of the traditional waxed variety.</li>
            <li> 8 out of 10 snap as soon as you put the floss between your teeth. I was expecting higher quality from a Glide product.</li>
            <li> I understand this floss can&#x27;t do much to make your teeth &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; compared to others, but I actually found this easier to fit between my tighter teeth. It can break sometimes, but usually only if I am too rough with the floss. Other flosses I use are too wire-y (know what I mean?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had regular Oral-B floss picks and liked them but my teeth are so close together sometimes they would stick just like regular floss - these are great because they do what they say &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; - they glide right through my teeth without getting stuck!!  I like the taste of the mint too.</li>
            <li> Kind of neat not to have to use the old wrap around the finger floss, but... The string on this kept breaking on me, I have one spot that is a little tight on my teeth and these would break pretty easy on that spot, but find on the rest.  I like the feel of using one of these, cleaner and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue is.. cost,  what I get out of a bag of this vs a roll of floss,  the roll is just much cheaper and lasts me a lot longer than a bag of these, if they were much much cheaper and came in a large bulk, then I would switch to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But.. I think everyone should at least try these once, maybe you will decide to switch to them.</li>
            <li> These are usually great flossers.  The bags I have gotten from here seem to break easily.  I won&#x27;t be buying here anymore.  Oral B is usually a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> My local Walmart was out of the usual Plackers brand I buy, so I decided to give these a chance.  They didn&#x27;t really represent a very good value at 3.47 for 75, but I constantly floss and had run out of Plackers that morning, so I needed to pick up something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were terrible.  I have closely spaced teeth, and the floss strip would snap even with the lightest of back and forth cleaning motions.  A single flossing session sometimes required two or three of these to complete.  And on top of the flimsiness of the floss strip, they did a poor job of actually getting the food out of my teeth, a task that&#x27;s handled superbly by the Plackers Twin-line flossers I normally use.  Also, you have to try VERY hard to get a Plackers Twin-line to break.  They are sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this, a 75 pack of these are actually 20 cents more than a 150 count package of Plackers Twin-lines at Walmart.  So, they have poor value and poor performance.  Not a winning combination for any product.  I think people are paying for the Oral B name plastered on the package and not really much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy these here, as I&#x27;ve mentioned, but I figured I would provide a cautionary review for those thinking of buying these.  They are a low quality product and should be avoided.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like to floss, these are better than using just a rope of floss.  Your fingers don&#x27;t get the blood cut off from them and it takes less time to floss.  Plus I can use these at my desk after lunch without looking like a complete weirdo.</li>
            <li> Fair product.  String breaks easily on my back teeth.  Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> Would give it negative 5 - DO NOT BUY.  The floss breaks immediately.  I repeat - DO NOT BUY.  Buy Plackers, they are better.</li>
            <li> The glide type is the only one that I like to use for my teeth because it&#x27;s soft and gentle. It came factory sealed with fast shipping.  It&#x27;s a great price also. I will buy it again from amazon.</li>
            <li> I can say that I have noticed a difference in teeth whitening, but I will say the flosses are loose and break.</li>
            <li> I floss after every meal, but at work, I like to use these disposable picks because i can use and toss it fast. I bought a bag of them. On average I use two each time, sometimes three. They break WAY TOO EASILY and that is a defect, because I only use Glide floss at home and it never shreds or breaks for me. I do still have a permanent lingual bar that I don&#x27;t use the pick for because you simply can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always bought the DenTek but a friend of mine told me how much she likes these because they are much sturdier and solid than the easily bendable Dentek version, however I have been able to use the DenTek, rinse it, use it again, rinse it again, and use it a third time. I rinsed it in Scope so that it killed the germs.  I was amazed how much more sturdy the floss is in the DenTek, which is surprising. I wish that these Gide picks were more durable, but they aren&#x27;t...  They are pretty much useless if you have teeth that are tight or have any snags or sharp spots.</li>
            <li> These broke too easily for me. I have had much better luck with Plackers</li>
            <li> People seem to be complaining that these break. I broke a couple until I understood the angle of my teeth. Now I don&#x27;t break them at all and love them! I can floss all my teeth in 30 seconds... And yes, I still have all my teeth.</li>
            <li> not very strong, have to use two per one cleaning but like how thin they are and easy to use</li>
            <li> These floss picks are easy to use and are nice and gentle on my gums. The mint flavor is light and refreshing and the convenience is unbeatable. Love them and will buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> the floss breaks very easily and does not hold up past 3-4 teeth. I used another brand previous to this and they worked much better.</li>
            <li> With these in hand I am not scared to tackle corn on the cob, salad or steak! They are very effective at getting food out from between your teeth. The floss doesn&#x27;t break easily and lends a small mint flavor the first few swipes</li>
            <li> Effectively removes residue between teeth! Just what my family needs. Fresher breath.</li>
            <li> I put a hand full in my purse so I am prepared for the unexpected meat or whatever else stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Easily break compared to other flossing tools I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> These are great to keep in your purse and the extra mint flavor is nice also.</li>
            <li> I actually can&#x27;t find these in the store (maybe I&#x27;m looking at the wrong stores). This brand/type are the only type of floss picks that I like bc I have narrow gaps between my teeth and these are thin but sturdy enough to do the job. Others I&#x27;ve tried are too thick and I have a hard time using.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they break or bend easily.</li>
            <li> These are the worst picks I have ever used (and ironically, Oral-B makes the pick I consider to be the best as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint flavor and whitening portions are really kind of moot, like with all floss picks. They do not make a huge difference in whitening or removing stains, and the mint is super subtle. So no big deal here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is how they hold up. I find them to break and shred wayyyyyyy too much. Sometimes it took me 3 different picks for one session because they kept shredding and breaking. So there isn&#x27;t much else I can say because these floss picks just do a poor job at their primary function: flossing teeth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible, every floss pick I&#x27;ve used has broken. The glide floss just comes apart. It&#x27;s not the $3 loss that ticks me off, it&#x27;s such a defective product they had to know, and sold it anyway.</li>
            <li> I really like the way these feel to use, however I am giving 3 stars since they break often. With that said I have been a repeat customer of these due to the taste and the price. If only they were a bit stronger I would give 5 stars without thinking.</li>
            <li> 5 stars if not occasionally breaking during use.  Floss doesn&#x27;t seem quite the same as the glide in large roles.  I hate wrapping it around my fingers.</li>
            <li> flimsy, breaks easily. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they are about the same as any of the others similar to these, so no big difference that I can tell, however, I do like them, and will continue to use them, I bought them through subscribe and save, and with the discount i cant beat the price, and they are a good product.</li>
            <li> Love these. I&#x27;m so happy I found these!</li>
            <li> These work well for me.  My teeth are very close together, and most dental floss causes me a great deal of pain, when I try to squeeze it between my teeth.  These gliders work very well in tight spaces.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend to anyone who hates to floss, and/or has teeth that are close together!</li>
            <li> I am so uncoordinated with floss &amp; this is the perfect solution. It&#x27;s also been a great way to teach my young son to floss. I highly recommend this product it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a floss pick and gets the job done. Unfortunately this iteration from Glide isn&#x27;t as nice as their last one; the floss isn&#x27;t as tightly secured. After a few flossings the thread becomes loose and falls apart.</li>
            <li> Came in time and just what expected. I like they&#x27;re floss cause it&#x27;s very thin and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t get stuck.</li>
            <li> These picks go in really smoothly but they tear remarkably easily. I&#x27;ve really never had that problem with picks before so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my teeth... It takes about five of these to make it through all of your teeth and most of your time is spent trying to get the pieces that broke off of the flosser out of my teeth. These are definitely disappointing...the mint is a really nice touch, though.</li>
            <li> Flossing is really important and anything that makes it easier and more enjoyable like mint flavoured picks is even better!</li>
            <li> Very good floss picks, hold up well. nice minty taste</li>
            <li> Terrible quality broke quickly during flossing CVS quality ones are stronger</li>
            <li> These work great and I dont really have them break very often, but when they do its a very tight section between 2 very crammed teeth where no floss would survive.</li>
            <li> Product breaks between my teeth constantly! I will never buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and again</li>
            <li> Best Floss Sticks PERIOD..&lt;br /&gt;No need to look at others,  This is the only one you will ever need....</li>
            <li> I sometimes use up to four to complete flossing every evening. They just snap. Even when they do not break, they become very frayed by the end.</li>
            <li> I have been using these floss picks for over a year now.  They provide a consistent, smooth cleaning most of the time.  Sometimes the floss will break, but that&#x27;s usually when I go in between/around my back tooth that has a crown.  It fits a little tight there and if I don&#x27;t go slow, SNAP!  Other than that, these floss picks glide a lot better than other cheaper brands I have used.  As for the whitening claims, I can&#x27;t say that they have made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have trouble cleaning my back teeth with these. It&#x27;s hard to find the right angle to insert. I find these less productive than regular floss.</li>
            <li> I wanted the white flossers. The floss string breaks in the blue ones.  I thought I had ordered the white ones, but it was the blue ones that arrived.  I tried them, but they did not do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that effective! Its better to use a thread instead of buying this product. I rate 1 star for this product.</li>
            <li> These flossers would be really good if the floss was a little stronger, but about 1 in 5 times I need to pull out a second flosser because the floss on the first one breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use, and the minty taste is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Oral B&#x27;s Glide floss is a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t shred easily, or get stuck in between teeth.  I had high expectations for Glide floss picks, but unfortunately this product has a major issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, the Glide floss slides easily in between my teeth, but unfortunately the floss easily becomes loose, and loses tension.  I have some teeth that are very close together, and others that are difficult to floss, and require a little more force.  These picks are generally not up to the task, as the floss often begins to sag after using the pick on just a few teeth.  If there is a lot of food trapped between my teeth, the floss could be quite loose, or perhaps even broken, by the time I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are able to use ordinary dental floss without shredding it, then you may be able to use these dental picks without too many problems.  But for those with some tight spots, and places that shred regular floss, you may have some problems using these picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used [[ASIN:B00015XBE6 GUM Eez-Thru Flossers]].  The type of floss used in the Eez-Thru picks, is not as smooth as Glide floss, but the floss does remain quite taught under heavy usage.  If the Glide picks were as stiff as the Eez-Thru picks, they would be a most excellent and effective cleaning tool.  As this is not the case, I would have to rate the GUM Eez-Thru&#x27;s as the better buy.  While Glide floss is great stuff, these flossing picks are a minor disaster.  Oral B should know better, and clearly needs to a much better job of design and product testing, when it comes to flossing tools.</li>
            <li> bought these because it was my first time flossing and i wanted to live longer so i used these. superior to regular floss although i did bleed the freshness and gentleness are unparalleled</li>
            <li> This is a very good value for a good item.  Great Value for a great product.</li>
            <li> I had to write my review to counter the negative reviews. I love these things. I saw a guy at work with them and have loved this product immensely ever since I found them.  The floss string is quality and does sometimes break, but really when you think about how awesome and convenient the product is, and how inexpensive, it&#x27;s moot. Besides, the great pick at the other end is superb for getting those pesky Texas BBQ bits that seems to love catching between the teeth. Also the mint flavor rounds it out to the solid 5 star rating.  I tell you what, have those nay sayers try another brand,  talk about worthless, I think it was Walgreens offering. That&#x27;s a true negative 1 star. You and your dentist will wonder what the heck you&#x27;ve been doing right after using these babies!</li>
            <li> We are used to this brand of floss sticks so we love them.</li>
            <li> These do not have minty flavoring on the floss.  They work just fine and don&#x27;t break like cheaper knock offs.</li>
            <li> I will not reorder this bag of floss picks because the floss comes loose/breaks apart with very little pressure. Several times I&#x27;ve had to use 4-5 of these floss picks to floss my teeth so it really become uneconomical.</li>
            <li> I prefer using floss picks because floss threads seem to cut off blood circulation in my fingers.  My dentist keeps telling me that floss threads are better and my fingers would be fine if I do it right.  However, I prefer convenience and ease-of-use.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend the Oral-B Glide 3d White floss picks for anyone who has any tight spaces between their teeth.  The floss breaks easily and sometimes even gets stuck between teeth sometimes and I need another floss just to get this one out.  I went back to using Dentek comfort clean which doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums and seems to even \\&quot;curve\\&quot; around the teeth a little.  The one pro of using the Oral-B floss pick is that it seems thicker and easier to hold compared to Dentek which is too thin.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;3d white\\&quot; seems just hype.  Does it really help whiten surfaces between teeth?  How about just doing a good job of flossing first?  Poor quality product for the Oral-B brand, surely they could do better!&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have tight spaces between teeth, this may work for you.</li>
            <li> Like it very much!!!!</li>
            <li> I love Glide products as the floss is very easy to slide into the tightest spaces between teeth.  These were a great price as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; but they are difficult to use because of the curved handles.  I would order Glide products again but would recommend the straight handles which are much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> These fall apart while you&#x27;re flossing, terrible.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they aren&#x27;t supper durable...if you need to force it between your teeth and pull it sometimes comes apart.  it doesn&#x27;t happen every time and really maybe only once a week but it&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    </ol>
