            <li>great rotary machine</li>
            <li>and it does great</li>
            <li>This tattoo gun works great for lining and shading it out</li>
            <li>The machine i recieved was in good working order.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li>ran perfect at first</li>
            <li>excellent buy very strong machine used right out the package</li>
            <li>and I thought it was better than my coil tattoo machines this rotary does great line work and shading used it on a 3 / 4 hour piece and didn&#x27;t get hot nor stopped on me</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>for the price its outstanding, the weight is light and nicley ballanced and the needle throw is almost 1/4\\</li>
            <li>but it got here on time steady machine good for an apprentice or pro tool</li>
            <li>Gets the ink in precision accurate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and light weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought similar models of this rotary that worked great</li>
            <li>&quot; long, love it and just bought 2 more just in case if it gives out!</li>
            <li>I love my rotary guns and this is pure junk......</li>
            <li>good overall machine couldn&#x27;t track padkage</li>
            <li>so i was lucky</li>
            <li>my very first one I just wanted it too try it out</li>
            <li>they work pretty good for the price I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>am so far well pleased with mine.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use it yet, as I am still waiting on the power source for action...</li>
            <li>and as the saying goes you get what you pay for which is nothing but a laugh...</li>
            <li>Out of the box it don&#x27;t work right.....</li>
            <li>My first time using a rotary tattoo machine and its so much better than using a traditional tattoo machine.i don&#x27;t have to worry about all that tuning nonsense and can just focus on tattooing itslef.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get it tightened back up and then after another 5 minutes of use the motor stopped working.</li>
            <li>after that, it&#x27;s a pretty decent machine.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it ran very good for 5 minutes then it broke.</li>
            <li>the cost of the machine it looks and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t like how the tube would fit it not a big deal</li>
            <li>be ready to replace the contacts.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for it too..</li>
            <li>The bottom of this unit is made of cheap circuit board instead of metal the prongs are lose and moves the unit also had a missing tube holder.</li>
            <li>, i recommend this to others its quiet and there isnt really any vibrations</li>
            <li>The machine came in the mail much sooner than I expected.</li>

            <li> I was getting stale on regular coil machines, until this.</li>
            <li> It was not able to run at a lower voltage.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this one just had a crappy motor or what.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This machine is a very poor imitation of a very poor machine to begin with....</li>

            <li> they work pretty good for the price I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Came a few days after I ordered it. I&#x27;m a aspiring tattoo artist and have been using practice skin. My first time using a rotary tattoo machine and its so much better than using a traditional tattoo machine.i don&#x27;t have to worry about all that tuning nonsense and can just focus on tattooing itslef. Only part I&#x27;d complain about is I thought the machine was going to be black all round but I got a lil tiger design on mine</li>
            <li> for the price its outstanding, the weight is light and nicley ballanced and the needle throw is almost 1/4\\&quot; long, love it and just bought 2 more just in case if it gives out!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item from the seller {the power of the dream}...The machine i recieved was in good working order.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost of the machine it looks and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I am so far well pleased with mine.</li>
            <li> The bottom of this unit is made of cheap circuit board instead of metal the prongs are lose and moves the unit also had a missing tube holder.</li>
            <li> Out of the box it don&#x27;t work right.....I love my rotary guns and this is pure junk......Had high hopes for it too..</li>
            <li> I was getting stale on regular coil machines, until this. Gets the ink in precision accurate. Smooth and quiet. Love it</li>
            <li> good overall machine couldn&#x27;t track padkage but it got here on time steady machine good for an apprentice or pro tool 4/5 stars from me</li>
            <li> ran perfect at first but then it came apart in the middle of a tattoo on my client, i had extra machines so i was lucky</li>
            <li> great rotary machine my very first one I just wanted it too try it out and I thought it was better than my coil tattoo machines this rotary does great line work and shading used it on a 3 / 4 hour piece and didn&#x27;t get hot nor stopped on me I just didn&#x27;t like how the tube would fit it not a big deal but still I think they should work on that</li>
            <li> The machine came in the mail much sooner than I expected. I love it. It&#x27;s smooth and light weight. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it ran very good for 5 minutes then it broke. It was not able to run at a lower voltage. It took at least 9v to run a small liner and sometimes more. It wasn&#x27;t consistent.  After five minutes. The set screw came loose and seem to be stripped a little.  I was able to get it tightened back up and then after another 5 minutes of use the motor stopped working. I&#x27;ve bought similar models of this rotary that worked great so I&#x27;m not sure if this one just had a crappy motor or what.</li>
            <li> Never worked! What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> be ready to replace the contacts. after that, it&#x27;s a pretty decent machine. I run mine from 6-9v and it does great</li>
            <li> The product was delivered within a few days of the order and arrived as advertised. I have not been able to use it yet, as I am still waiting on the power source for action... It looks absolutely beautiful, though.</li>
            <li> excellent buy very strong machine used right out the package no problems and worldwide tattoo supply carries all the extra parts</li>
            <li> This tattoo gun works great for lining and shading it out did my expectations, i recommend this to others its quiet and there isnt really any vibrations when using, it can run for hours without having to stop</li>
            <li> This machine is a very poor imitation of a very poor machine to begin with....at the price I bought for a joke...and as the saying goes you get what you pay for which is nothing but a laugh...</li>
