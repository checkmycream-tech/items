            <li>I don&#x27;t think the company will be very happy to hear you are selling perfume under their name and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they will be very happy.  </li>

            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Love it !!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 10 years, and not a week goes by when I don&#x27;t get compliments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li>One very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love the attention you get from it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for everyone, but I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this scent-always get compliments!</li>
            <li>Any time i wear it i get so many compliments!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells sooo amazing</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I just had to warm up to it, so I sprayed it on each wrist and tried to keep it on all day.</li>
            <li>It is perfect really for any season of the year; from Winter to Summer.  </li>
            <li>Instead, this is warm and comforting and smells like a walking bakery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of perfumes (think asthma attack and severe headache), and was nervous to try this, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I absolutely LOVE this scent!  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh and happy.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a much greater cost than Amazon.</li>
            <li>Perfume station is great, good price, shipped out my order the very same day I placed it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what I would consider a sophisticated scent</li>
            <li>if you like vanilla and coconut and are looking for an authentic scent without the chemical smell</li>
            <li>makes it universally appealing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of vanilla, and if you do as well, you&#x27;ll probably love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has a light apricot note, which is nicely blended with vanilla.  </li>
            <li>My two favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I love the Abricot and Vanilla combination.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and make sure my wife always has some around.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much apricot except for in the very beginning, nevertheless, its still one of the best Vanilla based EDTs out there.</li>
            <li>Has a vanilla scent, but the apricot gives it a more original scent.  </li>
            <li>then you better get dressed up because even though this is a nice daily scent it makes me want to show off my lovely wife of 20 years!  </li>
            <li>Smells sweet almost like cotton candy, but not overbearing :)</li>
            <li>Anyway, now I purchase it through Amazon which seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>I received compliments the first time I wore it, but most importantly, I love it</li>
            <li>You will love this, even if you are not crazy about vanilla....</li>
            <li>This perfume however, is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a tin secure bottle, it&#x27;s a glass leaky bottle.</li>
            <li>I just wish they had a cologne for men that I liked as much as this.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and sweet.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>It is a sweet a combination of sugar cookie and cotton candy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sweet, you know?  </li>
            <li>If you are not one to like sweet scents, this probably is not the scent for you.</li>
            <li>I preferred the old packaging, but still love the yummy fresh and light scent.</li>
            <li>I knew for sure when my son said Mom I like your new perfume</li>
            <li>The lasting power isn&#x27;t amazing -- I&#x27;d say it lasts about 3 or 4 hours.</li>
            <li>I really like the spray nozzle because it delivers the fragrance in this huge mist that covers a lot of area (just my persona tidbit).</li>
            <li>There is a sexy vanilla burbon undertone to it that really makes it last while having an almost cotton candy top</li>
            <li>If you want an more excotic, yet equally lovely vanilla scent, try the Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Extreme.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider it an everyday or signature scent, but very nice when in the flirty and cutsy mood.  </li>
            <li>I always use a lotion first to help give the purfume stick to something.</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is subtle, so you don&#x27;t smell like a cheap candle, and is nicely combined with a sugary, almost cotton candy-like smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not one for wearing anything scented, especially perfumes, because most give me headaches and smell too \\&quot;chemical-ish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to wear to work or strong enough to wear out.</li>
            <li>had some problem with my local post and the seller helped me to quickly resolve the problem!</li>
            <li>Be careful if you carry it in your purse, the top will leak just a tad.</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like the description and is VERY overpowering.</li>
            <li>so this really hit the spot for me.</li>
            <li>It smells very vanilla-y.</li>
            <li>i only wear this on special occasions i don&#x27;t want it to run out..</li>
            <li>It is definitely on the sweeter end of the sweet spectrum.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any woman, any age.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle was clear so I can see how much I&#x27;ve used up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell that makes your eyes water, but a faint, sweet smell that kind of lingers around.</li>
            <li>bottle, new and unused.  </li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t  be happier to have found this new fragrance line.</li>
            <li>However, CSP Vanille Abricot is different - not sickly strong, creamy smelling, good longetivy and throw, you only need two sprays.</li>
            <li>as soon as i sprayed this my four year old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told I smell like cookies on numerous occasions and that&#x27;s really what it smells like.</li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes, the smell is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I love all things vanilla and this really stepped up the game.  </li>
            <li>CSP is such a nice alternative to Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar because it&#x27;s not as sharp and stingy as PS.</li>
            <li>what I received was a half full 1.6 oz.</li>
            <li>I would say it has slightly better than average lasting power and it has just enough umph to be noticable but not overwhelm a room.  </li>
            <li>It gets a little dodgy when the follow their noses, right to me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually go for sweet foody scents because of the cloying/headachey aspects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m stuck with one closed new bottle of perfume purchased from you</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a keeper and it lasts quite long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried Coco Extreme, which smells like yummy coconutty sunscreen from my childhood, and Matin Calin, which is very subtle and light and smells like white sugar.</li>
            <li> tried this once before buying some perfume being lured in by the low price only to be completely blown away that the perfume was bootleg.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;S a weak attempt of the real thing.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> and I have lost half of it in the bottom of my travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They will tell me I smell like cupcakes or cookies, this is a dangerous scent for a married woman to have on...</li>
            <li> There really is something to the theory that men go crazy for a vanilla scent -- I know because of all the perfumes I wear, this one makes my guy a little nuts.  </li>
            <li> I lasted for a few hours and just could not take it anymore...</li>
            <li> It does not have a heavy flowery or chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> However, when I got the product and smelled it...I was disappointed right away.</li>
            <li> I am a little embarrassed!</li>
            <li> I should have known with the price being so low something was wrong.</li>
            <li> bottle that was dented and dirty, obviously used.  </li>
            <li> I am a sucker for vanilla/foody fragrances</li>
            <li> Seriously, he loves it when I wear this perfume.  </li>
            <li> It has the tendency to test your will power for dessert though and if you are on a diet not a good thing, but atleast I can smell like dessert.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to contact Paris and let them know about the false adverstisement.  </li>
            <li> I would prepare for some bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at this point it gave me a horrible headache and when my boyfriend came home he asked what the \\&quot;weird smell\\&quot; was and looked disgusted...</li>
            <li> Bottom line: was very disappointed, will not order again, and will not recommend this to my friends.</li>

            <li> I have been using this perfume for over 15 years. I should have known with the price being so low something was wrong. The perfume is not the same.  It&#x27;S a weak attempt of the real thing. The scent is different.  The perfume looses its scent rapidly.  I knew for sure when my son said Mom I like your new perfume and then he went ha ha ha.  Even he could tell!  I don&#x27;t think the company will be very happy to hear you are selling perfume under their name and it is definetly not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this once before buying some perfume being lured in by the low price only to be completely blown away that the perfume was bootleg.  My husband ordered this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I&#x27;m not going to lay back and do nothing.  I&#x27;m going to contact Paris and let them know about the false adverstisement.  I don&#x27;t think they will be very happy.  I would prepare for some bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m stuck with one closed new bottle of perfume purchased from you and I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Vanille Abricot for almost 6 months. Since then I have gotten daily comments to the point I am a little embarrassed! I am 31 and have men (and women) of all ages ask me what I have on. It gets a little dodgy when the follow their noses, right to me! They will tell me I smell like cupcakes or cookies, this is a dangerous scent for a married woman to have on...&lt;br /&gt;  Be careful if you carry it in your purse, the top will leak just a tad. The scent is long lasting, around 8 hours or so. I always use a lotion first to help give the purfume stick to something. I like to use 2 vanilla lotions from the lotion store in the mall (Amber and Apricot Vanilla)It mixes well but you can use a unscented lotion if you like.&lt;br /&gt;  There is a sexy vanilla burbon undertone to it that really makes it last while having an almost cotton candy top note.&lt;br /&gt;  You will love this, even if you are not crazy about vanilla.... you&#x27;ll love the attention you get from it!</li>
            <li> After reading the rave reviews on this spray, I decided to give it a try. However, when I got the product and smelled it...I was disappointed right away. It smells nothing like the description and is VERY overpowering. I thought maybe I just had to warm up to it, so I sprayed it on each wrist and tried to keep it on all day. I lasted for a few hours and just could not take it anymore... at this point it gave me a horrible headache and when my boyfriend came home he asked what the \\&quot;weird smell\\&quot; was and looked disgusted... I had to take a shower to scrub it off for both of our sake! Bottom line: was very disappointed, will not order again, and will not recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> The Vanille Abricot is a great smell.  I love all things vanilla and this really stepped up the game.  It&#x27;s light enough to wear to work or strong enough to wear out. yummmmmy!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a much greater cost than Amazon. I will purchase it from Amazon next time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go for sweet foody scents because of the cloying/headachey aspects. However, CSP Vanille Abricot is different - not sickly strong, creamy smelling, good longetivy and throw, you only need two sprays. It has the tendency to test your will power for dessert though and if you are on a diet not a good thing, but atleast I can smell like dessert. I don&#x27;t get much apricot except for in the very beginning, nevertheless, its still one of the best Vanilla based EDTs out there. Perfume station is great, good price, shipped out my order the very same day I placed it. One very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 10 years, and not a week goes by when I don&#x27;t get compliments on how good it smells. It is a sweet a combination of sugar cookie and cotton candy. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but I love it!</li>
            <li> There really is something to the theory that men go crazy for a vanilla scent -- I know because of all the perfumes I wear, this one makes my guy a little nuts.  Seriously, he loves it when I wear this perfume.  It&#x27;s not what I would consider a sophisticated scent but it&#x27;s sweet, you know?  It smells like french apple tart and vanilla sugar.  It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.  It is perfect really for any season of the year; from Winter to Summer.  Sephora used to carry this but they stopped -- I don&#x27;t understand why?  Anyway, now I purchase it through Amazon which seems to be fine.  I would highly recommend this to any woman, any age.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I preferred the old packaging, but still love the yummy fresh and light scent.</li>
            <li> Beware of this one!  I ordered this product and what I received was a half full 1.6 oz. bottle that was dented and dirty, obviously used.  The ad says 3.3 oz. bottle, new and unused.  That is NOT what I received.</li>
            <li> as soon as i sprayed this my four year old said, \\&quot; what is that smell? i want some ice cream, i want some cotton candy ice cream!\\&quot; it is so delicious. i couldn&#x27;t  be happier to have found this new fragrance line. i can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents. if you like vanilla and coconut and are looking for an authentic scent without the chemical smell this is it!</li>
            <li> This is one of those scents that has me smelling my wrists when I wear it.  I would say it has slightly better than average lasting power and it has just enough umph to be noticable but not overwhelm a room.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider it an everyday or signature scent, but very nice when in the flirty and cutsy mood.  If you are not one to like sweet scents, this probably is not the scent for you. It is definitely on the sweeter end of the sweet spectrum.  I had no problems with the integrity, packaging or shipping of the probuct.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not one for wearing anything scented, especially perfumes, because most give me headaches and smell too \\&quot;chemical-ish\\&quot;. This perfume however, is fantastic. It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell that makes your eyes water, but a faint, sweet smell that kind of lingers around. The vanilla scent is subtle, so you don&#x27;t smell like a cheap candle, and is nicely combined with a sugary, almost cotton candy-like smell. The scent lasts quite a while too, without having to re-apply all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance (Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Abricot) off and on for about 7 years. I keep coming back to it because it&#x27;s simplicity makes it universally appealing. I always get tons of compliments on it every time I wear it. I&#x27;ve been told I smell like cookies on numerous occasions and that&#x27;s really what it smells like. Both men and women seem to adore this smell. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper and it lasts quite long. This is a really great brand. I&#x27;ve also tried Coco Extreme, which smells like yummy coconutty sunscreen from my childhood, and Matin Calin, which is very subtle and light and smells like white sugar.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of vanilla, and if you do as well, you&#x27;ll probably love this fragrance.  It does not have a heavy flowery or chemical smell.  I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of perfumes (think asthma attack and severe headache), and was nervous to try this, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I absolutely LOVE this scent!  It has a light apricot note, which is nicely blended with vanilla.  I received compliments the first time I wore it, but most importantly, I love it (did I say that already?).  If you want an more excotic, yet equally lovely vanilla scent, try the Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Extreme.  My two favorite scents.  On second thought, don&#x27;t try them...</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sooo amazing i love it!!! Some say it smells like vanilla waffles.. i only wear this on special occasions i don&#x27;t want it to run out.. Love it !! Must have</li>
            <li> Love this scent-always get compliments!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;m dance coach, so when I wear Vanille Abricot my students always hug me and sniff sniff sniff )))&lt;br /&gt;I had some problem with my local post and the seller helped me to quickly resolve the problem!</li>
            <li> This has been a fav of mine for 20 years. People ask what it is when I wear it..I love the Abricot and Vanilla combination.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for vanilla/foody fragrances so this really hit the spot for me. It smells like vanilla cake with a dash of tarte apricot in it. The apricot enhances the sweetness of the vanilla instead of making it sweeter which was such a relief for me. CSP is such a nice alternative to Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar because it&#x27;s not as sharp and stingy as PS. Instead, this is warm and comforting and smells like a walking bakery. Amazon is definitely the place to get it because I would NOT pay $85 for it. The lasting power isn&#x27;t amazing -- I&#x27;d say it lasts about 3 or 4 hours. I wish the bottle was clear so I can see how much I&#x27;ve used up. I really like the spray nozzle because it delivers the fragrance in this huge mist that covers a lot of area (just my persona tidbit).</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume! Any time i wear it i get so many compliments! Smells sweet almost like cotton candy, but not overbearing :)</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again, although the smell is similar, the bottle leaks and I have lost half of it in the bottom of my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a tin secure bottle, it&#x27;s a glass leaky bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and make sure my wife always has some around.  I love it.  Smells fresh and happy.  It&#x27;s got a terrific character.  Spray some on and see what your husband does......if he&#x27;s like me then you better get dressed up because even though this is a nice daily scent it makes me want to show off my lovely wife of 20 years!  I just wish they had a cologne for men that I liked as much as this.....lol</li>
            <li> Great cologne, great service!  Will buy from this seller again.  This cologne is suttle, but smells wonderful.  Has a vanilla scent, but the apricot gives it a more original scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is excellent. It smells very vanilla-y. I read that a lot of people get complements on this fragrance, but I don&#x27;t see how this is possible. After about 5 minutes, the smell is nearly gone. It has no staying power at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for a while. It&#x27;s light and sweet. I have gotten many compliments on this scent.</li>
