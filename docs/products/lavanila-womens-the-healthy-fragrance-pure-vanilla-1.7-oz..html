            <li>Best Vanila smell ever :)</li>
            <li>Its not too strong and lasts all day - it has the perfect lingering smell that makes you happy just to smell it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just not the wonderful, light, vanilla cookie scent of Vanilla Lace.</li>
            <li>I had a sample of this and loved it</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed, in fact, I would say that this is the best smelling vanilla perfume I own.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful pure vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is nice.  </li>
            <li>I wear this from time to time kind of as a body spray with unscented body lotion, and I will continue to use it till it&#x27;s finished</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d avoid floral lotions though as it can bring on kind of a granny scent</li>
            <li>Beautiful light scent, you will smell like a cupcake or cookie :)</li>
            <li>The scent is decidedly vanilla, but it is warm and creamy with a sophisticated blend of layered aromas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sweet, charming, and youthful.  </li>
            <li>Also, I like that it&#x27;s a very light fragrance, not over powering.</li>
            <li>But if you love vanilla</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I had purchased this fragrance and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>I always always get compliments and invariably someone, (mostly men), will say something along the lines of, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m smelling cookies.</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of a good fresh vanilla you will love this.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I Love LaVanilla perfumes and Baby Lotion.</li>
            <li>This is such a delicious and sexy scent.  </li>
            <li>I love Lavanila products but this scent is just not for me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite vanilla perfume....</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of vanilla.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>This has got to be my favorite fragrance  </li>
            <li>Love the purity and freshness.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Vanilla has been one of my favorite, signature scents since I was a teenager</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a vanilla fan, you will undoubtedly love this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this on my wife.</li>
            <li>My favorite - lasts all day and not overpowering</li>
            <li>I normally love aquatic or very clean fragrance</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t an overwhelming or strong musk, I have to admit it was a very light scent, but musk none-the-less.</li>
            <li>Gives me a healthy and unique scent!</li>
            <li>The scent is warm, sweet  and sexy.</li>
            <li>So warm and sweet.</li>
            <li>LaVanilla is a beautiful, sweet, pure vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this (and for the record, I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of musks as well).  </li>
            <li>They make other fragrances, but the vanilla one is the best one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like sweat smelling or really strong smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a light scent and like musk then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>also use Lavanila&#x27;s vanilla blackberry and vanilla grapefruit and they also fantastic.</li>
            <li>Totally love the fresh vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy for me to wear and it&#x27;s great to layer under any other scents you like to wear.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a perfume that has a sweet smell, like vanilla extract, I strongly suggest that you keep looking.</li>
            <li>If you were looking for a clean and lovely fresh vanilla scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and clean smelling</li>
            <li>It was authentic, packed well and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li>Its my favorite by far - I also love the vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li>Such a nice, clean scent!</li>
            <li>Smells so sweet.</li>
            <li>Vanilla without smelling too sweet.</li>
            <li>Feminine, subtle, awesome.</li>
            <li>I have read many many reviews for this perfume from different sites as well.</li>
            <li>Simply a classic  if you love vanilla.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is natural and phthalate free makes it even better.</li>
            <li>Lavender is a lucky scent, wear it to the casino</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user of vanilla perfumes and prefer a more pure vanilla fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually never written a review before, but I&#x27;ve got to say I&#x27;ve received more compliments on this perfume, than anything I&#x27;ve ever worn, and I&#x27;m a huge scent person.  </li>
            <li>you want a nice perfume that is ACTUALLY vanilla without being a cupcake then this is NOT for you!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a Bath&amp;Body Works vanilla, but much more mature.</li>
            <li>This is a soft fragrance you&#x27;ll love to wear and every one loves it.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that if you love vanilla fragrances, you can&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other fragrances but have heard good things about this line of perfumes, colognes and soaps.</li>
            <li>When you first smell it you quickly notice the warm scent of vanilla, but then you smell something else slightly spicy.</li>
            <li>I tend to react to perfume sprayed directly on skin and usually resort to spraying it on clothing which isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li>but I doubt I would repurchase this exact scent in the Lavanila line.</li>
            <li>I personally love the musk mixed with vanilla.  </li>
            <li>After reading several dozen reviews of Lavanila fragrances, I decided to play it safe and spring for Pure Vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li>My first impression was a sweet, natural vanilla flavor.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that I cannot wear most store bought skin products, but I can spray this directly on my skin with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I always get compliments when in public on the fresh light vanilla smell and always asked what I am wearing where can they get it</li>
            <li>I found it a little too &amp;#34;pina-colada&amp;#34; but I really liked the vanilla notes in that perfume</li>
            <li>This is a lovely little perfume spray that you can comfortably spray on sensitive skin without it causing problems.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smell much like vanilla to me.</li>
            <li>Unlike others, I don&#x27;t find this very musky - the vanilla stands out for me.  </li>
            <li>but this is really, really good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t last long at all if you spray it on clothing, but it&#x27;s good for 4+ hours if you spray it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it because of my daughter as my previous scent was too strong and not all natural, as this one was.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sweet without seeming childish and lingers lightly.</li>
            <li>Wow, this fragrance is so warm and cozy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys vanilla scented perfume.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Yes, this smells of vanilla, but there are heavy muskier notes that overpower the lovely vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>Great to wear at home or on any casual days or even just to snuggle with someone.</li>
            <li>I first bought this years ago from QVC when Sephora was the only company that sold this !!</li>
            <li>I just smell pure vanilla essence without the alcohol found in the actual extract.</li>
            <li>Lavanila hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems in the couple of months I&#x27;ve been using it directly on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive nose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and has a sweetness to it.  </li>
            <li>As a 24-year-old girl, I was reminded of something an old lady might wear.</li>
            <li>The unexpected comments from all men, I&#x27;ve received on it, keeps me wearing it every day and even when I go out at night.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scents or are around others who are, this is a non offensive scent</li>
            <li>I saw this perfume recommended by a few beauty bloggers and since I already knew I enjoyed vanilla scented perfumes I went ahead and purchased it without actually smelling it beforehand.</li>
            <li>I can still smell it after several hours, but I do reapply at least once in the day because I enjoy the scent so much.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin--no problems with the aforementioned products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep (almost masculine but not quite) vanilla fragarence.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a replacement for my favorite scent, Vanilla Lace eau de toilette from Victoria&#x27;s secret, which I can no longer find.  </li>
            <li>have read reviews about the perfume being too musky, but the musk dies down within ten minutes and you are left with a lovely and long lasting vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite vanilla perfume was a vanilla scent made by Victoria&#x27;s Secret long ago (and as far as I can tell, it was discontinued years and years ago - not the same vanilla they currently sell).  </li>

            <li> I found it a little too &amp;#34;pina-colada&amp;#34; but I really liked the vanilla notes in that perfume</li>
            <li> This is a lovely little perfume spray that you can comfortably spray on sensitive skin without it causing problems.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell much like vanilla to me.</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I don&#x27;t find this very musky - the vanilla stands out for me.  </li>
            <li> but this is really, really good!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last long at all if you spray it on clothing, but it&#x27;s good for 4+ hours if you spray it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it because of my daughter as my previous scent was too strong and not all natural, as this one was.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sweet without seeming childish and lingers lightly.</li>
            <li> Wow, this fragrance is so warm and cozy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys vanilla scented perfume.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes, this smells of vanilla, but there are heavy muskier notes that overpower the lovely vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> Great to wear at home or on any casual days or even just to snuggle with someone.</li>
            <li> I first bought this years ago from QVC when Sephora was the only company that sold this !!</li>
            <li> I just smell pure vanilla essence without the alcohol found in the actual extract.</li>
            <li> Lavanila hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems in the couple of months I&#x27;ve been using it directly on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive nose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and has a sweetness to it.  </li>
            <li> As a 24-year-old girl, I was reminded of something an old lady might wear.</li>
            <li> The unexpected comments from all men, I&#x27;ve received on it, keeps me wearing it every day and even when I go out at night.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scents or are around others who are, this is a non offensive scent</li>
            <li> I saw this perfume recommended by a few beauty bloggers and since I already knew I enjoyed vanilla scented perfumes I went ahead and purchased it without actually smelling it beforehand.</li>
            <li> I can still smell it after several hours, but I do reapply at least once in the day because I enjoy the scent so much.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin--no problems with the aforementioned products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep (almost masculine but not quite) vanilla fragarence.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a replacement for my favorite scent, Vanilla Lace eau de toilette from Victoria&#x27;s secret, which I can no longer find.  </li>
            <li> have read reviews about the perfume being too musky, but the musk dies down within ten minutes and you are left with a lovely and long lasting vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite vanilla perfume was a vanilla scent made by Victoria&#x27;s Secret long ago (and as far as I can tell, it was discontinued years and years ago - not the same vanilla they currently sell).  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised to read other reviewers describe it as &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I like to layer it with Lavender and some other Young Living oils I wear.</li>
            <li> For such an expensive perfume, I expected more.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though, after about 20 minutes, you are left with a whole lot of nothing, as the scent completely disappears.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it and it is not a real strong smell which personally turns me off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly heavy, romantic scent.  </li>
            <li> so I get this plain vanilla perfume, thinking I&#x27;d be getting the same experience</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO VANILLA scent whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I also like to mix it with other scents to add the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> i dont use any of my other scents anymore.....</li>
            <li> I prefer the other scents in this line.</li>
            <li> This perfume is extremely musky, and the smell of vanilla is overpowered by the additional notes.</li>
            <li> Only problem is, after a few days i started to not love the scent.</li>
            <li> The musky notes to me are at odds with the vanilla fragrance and if anything smell a little &amp;#34;unclean&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li> but without the heavy coconut scent.</li>
            <li> However, I found it to be overwhelmed by musk which I find too heavy and made me feel head achy.</li>
            <li> The ones some people think they have to &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; in and you can smell them half way across a store!</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed and I returned the product (a first for me!).</li>
            <li> This is a lavender/vanilla scent that is hard to find in the stores and even perfume shops don&#x27;t always carry it.  </li>
            <li> (I am in my late 30s now).  </li>
            <li> I seriously cannot stop smelling my wrists.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whilst this perfume is by no means terrible or unwearable particularly if you like muskier, heavier scents.</li>
            <li> I would wear this to work, on a date or for casual events.</li>
            <li> and I am bothered by artificial fragrances, however, this perfume does not make me feel like I&#x27;m having an allergy attack.</li>
            <li> and  it doesnt have all that bad phalate chemical stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I hate and detest and despise</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Delightful warm scent!</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a replacement for my favorite scent, Vanilla Lace eau de toilette from Victoria&#x27;s secret, which I can no longer find.  This fragrance is nice.  It&#x27;s a slightly heavy, romantic scent.  I have no complaints, it&#x27;s just not the wonderful, light, vanilla cookie scent of Vanilla Lace.</li>
            <li> I have read many many reviews for this perfume from different sites as well. I finally decided to try it so I went to my local mall and sprayed some on. I was highly disappointed.  There is absolutely NO VANILLA scent whatsoever! All I could smell was musk and I hate and detest and despise musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t an overwhelming or strong musk, I have to admit it was a very light scent, but musk none-the-less. If you enjoy a light scent and like musk then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a nice perfume that is ACTUALLY vanilla without being a cupcake then this is NOT for you!</li>
            <li> The best vanilla ive found!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! I also like to mix it with other scents to add the vanilla scent. Simply a classic  if you love vanilla.</li>
            <li> This has been the only perfume I wear since I discovered it in 2010.  Only need to apply once and last all day!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell much like vanilla to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving three stars for the seller. It was authentic, packed well and shipped fast! Only problem is, after a few days i started to not love the scent. My first impression was a sweet, natural vanilla flavor. After a while all i could smell was baby powder. I guess it didn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry. But if you love vanilla it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! Hands down my favorite perfume ever!</li>
            <li> this stuff is delicious. i love it. its all i were now.  it smells yummy and  it doesnt have all that bad phalate chemical stuff.  i dont use any of my other scents anymore.....</li>
            <li> I love the purity of the smell and that the company does not test on animals!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful . . .</li>
            <li> Used this fragrance for years.  I love it.  I get comments all the time and its not that chemical overpowering perfume smell,  it smells like cookies,  and men love it!!</li>
            <li> i buy this, my only fragrance, often! Great service...better scent! ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Years ago I had purchased this fragrance and fell in love with it so I was surprised to read other reviewers describe it as &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t find it that way at all. I just smell pure vanilla essence without the alcohol found in the actual extract. I always always get compliments and invariably someone, (mostly men), will say something along the lines of, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m smelling cookies. What is that aroma?&amp;#34; It&#x27;s feminine. It&#x27;s light. And very sexy.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Smells so sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! It&#x27;s not a Bath&amp;Body Works vanilla, but much more mature. The fact that it is natural and phthalate free makes it even better. My skin is so sensitive that I cannot wear most store bought skin products, but I can spray this directly on my skin with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews about the perfume being too musky, but the musk dies down within ten minutes and you are left with a lovely and long lasting vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li> This perfume I wear daily. It&#x27;s healthy for me to wear and it&#x27;s great to layer under any other scents you like to wear. I like to layer it with Lavender and some other Young Living oils I wear. Gives me a healthy and unique scent!</li>
            <li> The wife loves it and it is not a real strong smell which personally turns me off.  This is a lavender/vanilla scent that is hard to find in the stores and even perfume shops don&#x27;t always carry it.  Lavender is a lucky scent, wear it to the casino and you will win (according to the wife, not me! :)</li>
            <li> Only Perfume I Will Wear !!! I first bought this years ago from QVC when Sephora was the only company that sold this !! I don&#x27;t like sweat smelling or really strong smelling perfumes. The ones some people think they have to &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; in and you can smell them half way across a store! This has a wonderful pure vanilla smell. It&#x27;s not over powering. I always get compliments when in public on the fresh light vanilla smell and always asked what I am wearing where can they get it etc. I have been purchasing this for years now. I don&#x27;t wear perfumes/colognes all the time but when I do this is the only one I will use. If you like the smell of a good fresh vanilla you will love this. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other fragrances but have heard good things about this line of perfumes, colognes and soaps.</li>
            <li> After reading several dozen reviews of Lavanila fragrances, I decided to play it safe and spring for Pure Vanilla.  I love it.  The scent is decidedly vanilla, but it is warm and creamy with a sophisticated blend of layered aromas.  I seriously cannot stop smelling my wrists.  It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but I am going to eventually make up my mind on a second Lavanila scent and start a collection.  Yum.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely little perfume spray that you can comfortably spray on sensitive skin without it causing problems. I tend to react to perfume sprayed directly on skin and usually resort to spraying it on clothing which isn&#x27;t ideal. Lavanila hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems in the couple of months I&#x27;ve been using it directly on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this spray after smelling the Vanilla Coconut scent at Sephora. I found it a little too &amp;#34;pina-colada&amp;#34; but I really liked the vanilla notes in that perfume so I get this plain vanilla perfume, thinking I&#x27;d be getting the same experience but without the heavy coconut scent. This is not the case at all. Yes, this smells of vanilla, but there are heavy muskier notes that overpower the lovely vanilla smell. The musky notes to me are at odds with the vanilla fragrance and if anything smell a little &amp;#34;unclean&amp;#34; to me. Like trying to use perfume to mask a not-so-pleasant smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst this perfume is by no means terrible or unwearable particularly if you like muskier, heavier scents. If you were looking for a clean and lovely fresh vanilla scent, this isn&#x27;t it. I wear this from time to time kind of as a body spray with unscented body lotion, and I will continue to use it till it&#x27;s finished but I doubt I would repurchase this exact scent in the Lavanila line. This doesn&#x27;t last long at all if you spray it on clothing, but it&#x27;s good for 4+ hours if you spray it directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> Best smell, ever. Love love love. Some Vanilla perfumes smell like children or flowers or goth chicks. Not this. Feminine, subtle, awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance!!!! Such a nice, clean scent!</li>
            <li> I saw this perfume recommended by a few beauty bloggers and since I already knew I enjoyed vanilla scented perfumes I went ahead and purchased it without actually smelling it beforehand. I was not disappointed, in fact, I would say that this is the best smelling vanilla perfume I own. When you first smell it you quickly notice the warm scent of vanilla, but then you smell something else slightly spicy. I find that it wears quite well on my skin. I can still smell it after several hours, but I do reapply at least once in the day because I enjoy the scent so much. I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys vanilla scented perfume. I would wear this to work, on a date or for casual events.</li>
            <li> The best perfume I&#x27;ve ever used. Vanilla without smelling too sweet.</li>
            <li> I Love LaVanilla perfumes and Baby Lotion. They smell great and are natural--non toxic!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin--no problems with the aforementioned products.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best vanilla perfume out there. The best perfume, period. The scent is warm, sweet  and sexy. I have been using this brand exclusively since I discovered several years ago. I have a really sensitive nose and I am bothered by artificial fragrances, however, this perfume does not make me feel like I&#x27;m having an allergy attack. It is quite wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Lavanila&#x27;s vanilla blackberry and vanilla grapefruit and they also fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is such a delicious and sexy scent.  It&#x27;s not heavy and has a sweetness to it.  I wear it every day and my sweetie LOVES it on me.</li>
            <li> I love Lavanila products but this scent is just not for me. It must be my body chemistry. This perfume smells so musky on me. I prefer the other scents in this line. All of the Lavanila perfumes last all day !</li>
            <li> Totally love the fresh vanilla scent.  This is my favorite vanilla perfume....EVER!</li>
            <li> This is a soft fragrance you&#x27;ll love to wear and every one loves it.  My sister loves it and will wear nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;You should try this fragrance it makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume because it received excellent reviews and I love the smell of vanilla. However, if you are looking for a perfume that has a sweet smell, like vanilla extract, I strongly suggest that you keep looking. This perfume is extremely musky, and the smell of vanilla is overpowered by the additional notes. As a 24-year-old girl, I was reminded of something an old lady might wear. I was greatly disappointed and I returned the product (a first for me!). I don&#x27;t think this is the vanilla perfume for you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. So warm and sweet. I get compliments on it often, although sometimes people think I smell like cupcakes.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of vanilla perfumes and prefer a more pure vanilla fragrance.  I tried this based on the great reviews it received. However, I found it to be overwhelmed by musk which I find too heavy and made me feel head achy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually never written a review before, but I&#x27;ve got to say I&#x27;ve received more compliments on this perfume, than anything I&#x27;ve ever worn, and I&#x27;m a huge scent person.  I personally love the musk mixed with vanilla.  I originally bought it because of my daughter as my previous scent was too strong and not all natural, as this one was.  The unexpected comments from all men, I&#x27;ve received on it, keeps me wearing it every day and even when I go out at night.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for a gift and it is the only fragrance that does not trigger a migraine in my daughter..</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this and loved it It is very fresh and clean smelling It is a perfect scent</li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite fragrance  Love the purity and freshness.</li>
            <li> Best Vanila smell ever :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell of vanilla......lasts all day.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Smells Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I always get compliments about it. Also, I like that it&#x27;s a very light fragrance, not over powering.</li>
            <li> Vanilla has been one of my favorite, signature scents since I was a teenager (I am in my late 30s now).  I absolutely love this (and for the record, I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of musks as well).  Unlike others, I don&#x27;t find this very musky - the vanilla stands out for me.  My favorite vanilla perfume was a vanilla scent made by Victoria&#x27;s Secret long ago (and as far as I can tell, it was discontinued years and years ago - not the same vanilla they currently sell).  This perfume is the closest I&#x27;ve come to replicating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sweet, charming, and youthful.  If you&#x27;re a vanilla fan, you will undoubtedly love this.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that if you love vanilla fragrances, you can&#x27;t get better than this. LaVanilla is a beautiful, sweet, pure vanilla fragrance. Unfortunately, though, after about 20 minutes, you are left with a whole lot of nothing, as the scent completely disappears. For such an expensive perfume, I expected more. I would not suggest wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely lovely! Especially when paired with sweeter smelling lotions. I&#x27;d avoid floral lotions though as it can bring on kind of a granny scent</li>
            <li> Beautiful light scent, you will smell like a cupcake or cookie :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this on my wife. Its my favorite by far - I also love the vanilla fragrance. They make other fragrances, but the vanilla one is the best one. Its not too strong and lasts all day - it has the perfect lingering smell that makes you happy just to smell it.</li>
            <li> Wow, this fragrance is so warm and cozy. Great to wear at home or on any casual days or even just to snuggle with someone. I normally love aquatic or very clean fragrance but this is really, really good!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sweet without seeming childish and lingers lightly. It&#x27;s a deep (almost masculine but not quite) vanilla fragarence. If you are sensitive to scents or are around others who are, this is a non offensive scent</li>
            <li> My favorite - lasts all day and not overpowering</li>
