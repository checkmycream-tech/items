            <li>Love how I can actually know if my ears are really clean even though I clean the heck outta them</li>
            <li>They work better than the regular white cotton swabs you get in the US, but still not as good as the ones I used in Japan</li>
            <li>I bought these cotton buds because they looked different and cool but in reality they are better than I thought they were going to be</li>
            <li>really stand out, and more so - the shape gets in those corners of your inner ear to clean out whatever you have.</li>

            <li> ;  have not played with them yet;  more of a novlty, or possible gag gift at some point</li>
            <li> The fact that they are black and match my bathroom is an added bonus and worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> and once again  adds to my black and white  bathroom  !!  </li>
            <li> Once I went to Japan and used their &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34; I am not happy with the regular american swabs.</li>
            <li> The cotton pellets at the end aren&#x27;t loose like other brands, they are quite firm.</li>
            <li> Could be cheaper because it says 250Yen on item which converts to less that $2.5</li>
            <li> 200pcs inside Black...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like firm cotton buds, don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard than I thought.</li>
            <li> these  being  not the  ordinary  !!</li>

            <li> I like the  ideal  of  these  being  not the  ordinary  !! These are  nice  and once again  adds to my black and white  bathroom  !!  Five stars  !!</li>
            <li> over promised delivery date.  Better than described.</li>
            <li> Once I went to Japan and used their &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34; I am not happy with the regular american swabs. Will order again and again.</li>
            <li> I bought these cotton buds because they looked different and cool but in reality they are better than I thought they were going to be and I get a lot of compliments about them. The only thing is that they are the most expensive cotton buds that I&#x27;ve ever bought on my life so I&#x27;m not going back to white ones anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this I coudnt find it anywhere else</li>

            <li> Their unique shape (and color!) really stand out, and more so - the shape gets in those corners of your inner ear to clean out whatever you have. The cotton pellets at the end aren&#x27;t loose like other brands, they are quite firm. If you don&#x27;t like firm cotton buds, don&#x27;t buy these. There&#x27;s something that&#x27;s just &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34; about using these. Very high end!</li>
            <li> A bit on the pricy side. However, they are good and we love them.</li>
