            <li>I tried it and Love it!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I never knew something that came from a chickens butt could taste so good until now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how people can think it tastes good.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best, most incredibly wonderful lip balm product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Perfect texture with a mild smell/taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super effective, no-nonsense and the best in it&#x27;s price range.  </li>
            <li>I love the name, the quality is great and does a nice job for lip protection in the winter.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm - you will too!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Got this as a gag gift for Xmas and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about it.</li>
            <li>It glides on, feels so nice and lubricates your lips.</li>
            <li>put on a coat in the car and wasn&#x27;t really overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>So I was thrilled by the ingredient list on this lip</li>
            <li>Made with all natural oils it feels great, smells great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of my favorite stuff (avocado, oranges, lavender), AND no mineral oil or petrolatum!!</li>
            <li>Bought tubes for mothers day gift as a gag gift and it has become a popular favorite around here.</li>
            <li>The product, though, is really some incredible stuff.</li>
            <li>The scent of lavender is very strong and I love the way it smells on his lips when I kiss him.</li>
            <li>This has more oil than wax making for a very smooth glide even when the tube gets</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>what more can one say about goo one puts one&#x27;s lips?</li>
            <li>though grossest named :)</li>
            <li>and here I am, getting him some more.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this lip junk, I&#x27;ve been using it for 4-5 years.</li>
            <li>I bought a tube because I thought the name was hilarious -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most  every product &amp; none have even come close to the healing properties of this outstanding product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>He never uses lip balm but he ended up not losing track of the tube (which was also remarkable) and has now come to the end and wants some more.</li>
            <li>The name is funny, smell good, I use more in  autumn and winter, leaves my lips hydrated and don&#x27;t removed skin</li>
            <li>The balm is easy to apply and has a nice smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>It was the first good chap of the winter</li>
            <li>The best stuff ever for dry lips.</li>
            <li>THANKS ,KIDS LOVED IT</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a strong lavendar odor, and is clearish in color.</li>
            <li>I opened up the package of the lip junk and the smell was over powering, think really cheap perfume over-applied.</li>
            <li>I buy it where I originally saw it at Bed, Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li>I have tried various types of chap-sticks and this one, by far, is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll last a good while after applying if you can refrain from licking your lips because it&#x27;s so  favorable.</li>
            <li>scent is lavender and sweet orange oil with no sweeteners so you won&#x27;t lick it off your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great applied to bare lips before bed - you&#x27;ll wake up with soft, smooth, kissable lips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about lip balms.</li>
            <li>Sounds gross but in a pinch it works pretty good keeping your lips moist.</li>
            <li>However putting it on it glided and felt pretty great, a slight stinging on severe chappy lips because of the orange oil, but not bad.</li>
            <li>The primary oil in it is avocado oil, which absorbs really well into skin to soften it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great under dark, richly pigmented lipstick that you want to sheer out a bit.  </li>
            <li>No questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;poop&amp;#34; really works!  </li>
            <li>The name is funny for your friends that have a sense of humor - I am a runner and put this on every morning before my jog.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like lavender you most likely will not like this one.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I thought it was funny, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>When i first used it i couldn&#x27;t believe the flavor and how it felt on my lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told my RN colleagues about this product &amp; all who&#x27;ve purchased feel the same as I. I will &amp;#34;die&amp;#34; if this product ever ceases to be available!  </li>
            <li>I get that it is a funny gimmick and lots of people</li>
            <li>I get that it is a funny gimmick and lots of people</li>
            <li>So i have lips that are easily irritated yet constantly chapped.    </li>
            <li>Being an herbalist from the ingredients it sounded pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The ingredients were much of what I endorse for skin.</li>
            <li>I think $7.00 is a bit much, though.</li>
            <li>In the winter time my lips are often very chapped.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>By the time I made it home, though, I noticed that my lips were already much softer.  </li>
            <li>, the name really grosses me out.  </li>
            <li>, the name really grosses me out.  </li>
            <li>There was absolutely no dry skin and the crack, while not magically healed, had improved remarkably.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the time I&#x27;ll just make my own because it can be hard to find just the right balm with natural ingredients, no petroleum by products</li>
            <li>you eill love it &amp; never find sny other lip balm product even close to tbis one!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but paired with certain flavors, it can leave an icky taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most of the stuff makes my lips feel a little better while they&#x27;ve got a thick coating, only to feel more chapped than ever when it wears off.  </li>
            <li>But this is actually a high quality lip balm and I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t prepared with the dozen tubes of blistex I normally keep around.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m something of a lip-balm aficionado and right now own/use perhaps 8-10 different ones.  </li>
            <li>Chicken Poop is just effective lip protection that WORKS to relieve dry, chapped lips... and seals in moisture for a good, long while.  </li>
            <li>a reason.&lt;br /&gt;It contains the following oils: avocado, jojoba and has both lavender and sweet orange essential oils.</li>
            <li>Seriously, chicken poop is a great gag to play on friends and foe alike</li>
            <li>It keeps his lips really soft and he feels &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smearing something called &amp;#34;chicken poop&amp;#34; on them.</li>
            <li>This happened while I was in a store that doesn&#x27;t sell Blistex, and my 3 year old was so close to a nuclear meltdown</li>
            <li>you are chemically sensitive to any of these oils please avoid.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the silly name, but it&#x27;s an incredibly good lip balm.</li>
            <li>In other words, it feels just right.</li>
            <li>The product, though, is really some incredible stuff.after just a few hours of Chicken Poop.  </li>
            <li>major cons -&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I personally use it less and less because it has made my lips so healthy.  </li>
            <li>Finally, my bottom lip split right down the middle</li>
            <li>His lips and nose tend to dry out a lot due to the weather and this product really helps them stay moisturized.</li>

            <li> His lips and nose tend to dry out a lot due to the weather and this product really helps them stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> The only downside to the product is that it&#x27;s not as long lasting as some other lip balms (kiehl&#x27;s), but that&#x27;s not a major issue for me, as I&#x27;m used to reaching for a lip balm several times a day anyways.</li>
            <li> Love that Chicken Poop is made from only a few ingredients and it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> Any one who is a super smeller or super taster is going to hate this product without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I like better than others and Chicken Poop</li>
            <li> I have PERPETUALLY chapped lips, and up until now, my lip balm of choice has been chapstick medicated and kiehl&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
            <li> I hate the sticky feeling of mineral oil/petrolatum, which are the main ingredients in most other lip balms as well.</li>
            <li> get so dry @</li>
            <li> An old fisherman&#x27;s secret when out at sea is to take your index finger and run it down the crease of your nose starting at the bridge and applying the natural oil produced by your body to your lips.</li>
            <li> Chapstick, which I think is the crappiest of the crappy, Burt&#x27;s Bees, which is nice for a while but makes my lips much worse in the long run, or Chicken Poop, an unknown and very gross sounding option.  </li>
            <li> trying the product, much to my surprise and delight, it didn&#x27;t smell or resemble chicken poop at all! ;)</li>
            <li> Apparently a lot, it is very heavy in lavender, and the orange oil clashes with the smell.</li>
            <li> what a let down, i purchased because of the great reviews, but it smells so disgusting</li>
            <li> I work overseas in the desert and this product works extremely well.,</li>

            <li> I have PERPETUALLY chapped lips, and up until now, my lip balm of choice has been chapstick medicated and kiehl&#x27;s lip balm. I&#x27;m allergic to the sunscreen ingredient in chapsticks--it makes my lips look stung and inflamed, but it&#x27;s so difficult to find a lip balm without SPF now. I hate the sticky feeling of mineral oil/petrolatum, which are the main ingredients in most other lip balms as well. So i have lips that are easily irritated yet constantly chapped.    So imagine my excitement when i found this! It&#x27;s full of my favorite stuff (avocado, oranges, lavender), AND no mineral oil or petrolatum!! I love this stuff. I can slather it on with no worries of irritating my skin! The only downside to the product is that it&#x27;s not as long lasting as some other lip balms (kiehl&#x27;s), but that&#x27;s not a major issue for me, as I&#x27;m used to reaching for a lip balm several times a day anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m something of a lip-balm aficionado and right now own/use perhaps 8-10 different ones.  I have them in my purse, on my desk at work, in my master bath, on the desk of my home office, on the coffee table... all over my house.  Some I like better than others and Chicken Poop is one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s super effective, no-nonsense and the best in it&#x27;s price range.  Chicken Poop is not greasy/slippery like Vaseline... Chicken Poop is not waxy like Chapstick... Chicken poop has no taste and once applied has no scent... Chicken poop imparts no \\&quot;shine\\&quot; so boys won&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all girly.  Chicken Poop is just effective lip protection that WORKS to relieve dry, chapped lips... and seals in moisture for a good, long while.  It&#x27;s great under dark, richly pigmented lipstick that you want to sheer out a bit.  It&#x27;s great applied to bare lips before bed - you&#x27;ll wake up with soft, smooth, kissable lips.  Chicken Poop is a terrific value and a lip balm that everyone needs to try... including you!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gag gift for Xmas and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about it. The packaging is sort of blah. But this is actually a high quality lip balm and I would buy it again and again. Perfect texture with a mild smell/taste. It rivals the fancy expensive brand name ones. No questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this for me as a joke but I love it. It glides on, feels so nice and lubricates your lips. Smells great. It is the perfect lip stuff. I buy a bunch at a time and put them all over the house and office so I am never without.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worked well as part of the gift package i was putting together.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;poop&amp;#34; really works!  No bleeding lips for me in the Midwest Winter.</li>
            <li> what more can one say about goo one puts one&#x27;s lips?</li>
            <li> This is the best..though grossest named :)....lip balm on the market!!!  My son has horrible chapped lips year around and this is the ONLY product that heals them -- with one application!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like chicken poop? Seriously, chicken poop is a great gag to play on friends and foe alike, it feels great on your lips and I especially love the smell! Chicken poop...don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. I work overseas in the desert and this product works extremely well.,</li>
            <li> Best Chapstick there is!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed  was hard to put on and then no results</li>
            <li> yummy flavor.  Bought tubes for mothers day gift as a gag gift and it has become a popular favorite around here.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son got Chicken Poop lip balm for a joke and loves it. His lips and nose tend to dry out a lot due to the weather and this product really helps them stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever for dry lips. Loved it!!</li>
            <li> I never knew something that came from a chickens butt could taste so good until now. Best chicken crap I&#x27;ve ever tasted. I smear it on chicken whenever I eat it. Yummy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but my lips are too close to my mouth to be putting chemicals on them.  Love that Chicken Poop is made from only a few ingredients and it is all natural.  Works great and I personally use it less and less because it has made my lips so healthy.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A friend bought this for me as a gag gift and my husband stole it from me! He never uses lip balm but he ended up not losing track of the tube (which was also remarkable) and has now come to the end and wants some more. The scent of lavender is very strong and I love the way it smells on his lips when I kiss him. It keeps his lips really soft and he feels &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smearing something called &amp;#34;chicken poop&amp;#34; on them. Made with all natural oils it feels great, smells great and here I am, getting him some more.</li>
            <li> The name is funny, smell good, I use more in  autumn and winter, leaves my lips hydrated and don&#x27;t removed skin</li>
            <li> The name is funny for your friends that have a sense of humor - I am a runner and put this on every morning before my jog.  I love this lip balm - you will too!</li>
            <li> The name caught me last year in a store. The ingredients were much of what I endorse for skin. I tried it and Love it!! If you don&#x27;t like lavender you most likely will not like this one. It works beautifully in keeping my lips moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: Whoever posted the photo for this product needs to make it just ONE.</li>
            <li> I love the name, the quality is great and does a nice job for lip protection in the winter.  :)</li>
            <li> Love this lip junk, I&#x27;ve been using it for 4-5 years. Delivery was noted between 2-18-15 and 2-23-15, received 2-17-15! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought it for the silly name, but it&#x27;s an incredibly good lip balm. I think $7.00 is a bit much, though. I buy it where I originally saw it at Bed, Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> I thought this product for a joke for my husband but he still has not try the product just yet.</li>
            <li> Do not show two chapsticks if it&#x27;s only selling one in the pack!</li>
            <li> In the winter time my lips are often very chapped. I keep tupes of similar products everywhere - my purse, car, backpack, kitchen, ect. I typically purchase Burts Bees because it seemed to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day while buying feed for my chickens, I noticed a box of \\&quot;Chicken Poop\\&quot; at the register. I bought a tube because I thought the name was hilarious - I didn&#x27;t actually expect it to work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon trying the product, much to my surprise and delight, it didn&#x27;t smell or resemble chicken poop at all! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong lavendar odor, and is clearish in color. It goes on smoothly - not so thick that it rips your chapped lips or makes you feel like you lips are encased in ick and not so thin that you just become gooey. In other words, it feels just right. This form of chicken poop has healed my lips in the dead of winter when they were painfully chapped, and after I started using it regularly prevented severe chapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major cons -&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the smell of lavendar, you won&#x27;t like this product. Again, the scent is strong.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned not to eat or drink after using. The taste doesn&#x27;t bother me on it&#x27;s own, but paired with certain flavors, it can leave an icky taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a white elephant gift for Christmas.  I thought it was funny, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. It tastes like soap.  It is disgusting.  My kids even agreed with me.  I would never buy this for myself.  I don&#x27;t understand how people can think it tastes good.  The flavor stays in your mouth forever too.  I just put it on again before writing this review to see if it was maybe was from something I ate before putting it on, but no.  Every time I give it another chance I regret it.  It is horrible.</li>
            <li> Its not very moisturizing and it smells AWFUL rate 1/10 😷</li>
            <li> I bought it as a joke because my girlfriend always asks to use my chap stick whenever i pull it out and i thought she&#x27;d hand it back after seeing chicken poop on the label.When i first used it i couldn&#x27;t believe the flavor and how it felt on my lips.Then i read the ingredients.Makes sense since it&#x27;s all natural and all these chemical products are all cheaper,inferior and mostly unhealthy.This beeswax is the bomb.Using regular chap stick is like rubbing candle wax on your lips next to chicken poop.It&#x27;ll last a good while after applying if you can refrain from licking your lips because it&#x27;s so  favorable.I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again.An old fisherman&#x27;s secret when out at sea is to take your index finger and run it down the crease of your nose starting at the bridge and applying the natural oil produced by your body to your lips.Sounds gross but in a pinch it works pretty good keeping your lips moist.</li>
            <li> The absolute best, most incredibly wonderful lip balm product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried most  every product &amp; none have even come close to the healing properties of this outstanding product. It&#x27;s 5+++ stars for it&#x27;s healing of dry, chapped, burned, peeling &amp; uncomfortable lips. I&#x27;m a RN Case Manager &amp; my lips get so dry @ the hospital where I work. I&#x27;ve told my RN colleagues about this product &amp; all who&#x27;ve purchased feel the same as I. I will &amp;#34;die&amp;#34; if this product ever ceases to be available!  Purchase this- you eill love it &amp; never find sny other lip balm product even close to tbis one!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It works immediately and relieves you of chapped lips. I have tried various types of chap-sticks and this one, by far, is the best. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about lip balm.  I&#x27;ve found that most of the stuff makes my lips feel a little better while they&#x27;ve got a thick coating, only to feel more chapped than ever when it wears off.  I&#x27;m also not too keen on slowly eating bits of petroleum.  My go to lip balm for years has been the blistex medicated ointment that comes in the white tube.  It is the only brand I&#x27;ve ever found that actually healed my lips when they were badly chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips had been slowly chapping for days.  It was the first good chap of the winter and I wasn&#x27;t prepared with the dozen tubes of blistex I normally keep around.  I work nights and I hadn&#x27;t found the time to go buy any, so they kept getting worse.  Finally, my bottom lip split right down the middle and I had a painful crack.  This happened while I was in a store that doesn&#x27;t sell Blistex, and my 3 year old was so close to a nuclear meltdown (it was past her naptime) that I didn&#x27;t think we could make it to the drugstore without disaster.  The store we were in had three choices.  Chapstick, which I think is the crappiest of the crappy, Burt&#x27;s Bees, which is nice for a while but makes my lips much worse in the long run, or Chicken Poop, an unknown and very gross sounding option.  I knew that the other two wouldn&#x27;t work, so I bought the Chicken Poop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on a coat in the car and wasn&#x27;t really overly impressed.  The balm is easy to apply and has a nice smooth texture.  The taste is not fantastic, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have artificial flavoring concocted in some lab and I&#x27;m okay with that.  By the time I made it home, though, I noticed that my lips were already much softer.  My daughter and I both took naps and, when I woke up, the difference in my lips was incredible.  There was absolutely no dry skin and the crack, while not magically healed, had improved remarkably.  It would&#x27;ve taken several days of regular application of Blistex ointment to see the difference that I saw after just a few hours of Chicken Poop.  After several days of using it, my lips just continued to improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the name really grosses me out.  I get that it is a funny gimmick and lots of people have probably purchased it as a gag that wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise given it a second look.  Still, it is gross.

            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about lip balms. A lot of the time I&#x27;ll just make my own because it can be hard to find just the right balm with natural ingredients, no petroleum by products and that&#x27;s soft enough not tug even in winter when it gets cold. So I was thrilled by the ingredient list on this lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not vegan, since it has bee&#x27;s wax. The primary oil in it is avocado oil, which absorbs really well into skin to soften it. This has more oil than wax making for a very smooth glide even when the tube gets cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lavender and sweet orange oil with no sweeteners so you won&#x27;t lick it off your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this lip balm, it&#x27;s a good one for winter months here in Alaska.</li>
            <li> what a let down, i purchased because of the great reviews, but it smells so disgusting i cant even get passed it! had to throw away</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim. Being an herbalist from the ingredients it sounded pretty decent. After all what could happen? Apparently a lot, it is very heavy in lavender, and the orange oil clashes with the smell. Great idea for a product but horrid. Any one who is a super smeller or super taster is going to hate this product without a doubt. I opened up the package of the lip junk and the smell was over powering, think really cheap perfume over-applied. However putting it on it glided and felt pretty great, a slight stinging on severe chappy lips because of the orange oil, but not bad. The taste and the smell were overpowering. I passed it around to my honey, child, and friend all of whom have a poor sense of smell and they all thought it didn&#x27;t smell bad. I guess it was called chicken poop for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;It contains the following oils: avocado, jojoba and has both lavender and sweet orange essential oils. Vitamin E and Beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;If you are chemically sensitive to any of these oils please avoid.</li>
