            <li>GOOD NAIL HARDENER AND HELPS THEM GROW FAST</li>
            <li>Makes my nails strong.</li>
            <li>When i wear my nail polish it looks like i have strong gel nails on.</li>
            <li>So I stopped getting the manicures and looked for something that would help my nails be strong again.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll get real satisfaction !</li>
            <li>This product does not harm my nails and makes them look a little more attractive with some sheen.  </li>
            <li>other than that, its great.</li>
            <li>I love the Revlon Gel Nail Hardener because my nails are brittle and makes my nails like normal again.</li>
            <li>-- it really works to keep my nails strong, which has always been a problem.</li>
            <li>This hardener makes them very hard while adding a very nice shiny coati on top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months, and so far Im satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it enough to re-order.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite nail product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who is ready to transfer from acrylic and gel nails and start wearing natural, healthy nails that look like you just stepped out of the nail salon:)</li>
            <li>This is a great product for nails that are thin, easy to chip or tear.  </li>
            <li>It would make me, and several people I know, happy if Revlon put this SKU back into production.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast too.  </li>
            <li>it is a wonderful product for weak nails!</li>
            <li>I am trying it for the first time.</li>
            <li>(I hear that this comes with being a &amp;#34;senior citizen.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li>Very effective product, just as are the base coat and top coat!  </li>
            <li>and I really needed something to make them stronger.  </li>
            <li>dries fast .</li>
            <li>Now my nails grow so fast that I literally have to cut them like almost every two weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It has really helped my nails get stronger and stop peeling.  </li>
            <li>Delivery is fast via US mail.</li>
            <li>so much I order it often.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I do a lot of gardening, scrubbing and home improvement, and this has really kept me from looking grubby and nail-bitten.</li>
            <li>They all really strengthen the nails.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product a few years ago through a media release and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon still carries this, as a previous souce discontinued it.</li>
            <li>I have bought more expensive hardeners and they don&#x27;t work any better.  </li>
            <li>When I found Revlon Calcium Gel - this product is terrific and started to work quickly.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be  sure that it does really strengthen nails</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Revlon Calcium Gel and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Regular polish remover takes it right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and a new bottle was mailed to me.</li>
            <li>Great product for weak nails or after using gel polish to renew surface!!  </li>
            <li>The beginning process kind of sucked because I was not really familiar with what products were out there to promote not only ail growth but offer certain ingredients to make your nails a lot harder to break...</li>
            <li>Use of the Revlon Calcium Gel Nail Hardener has completely stopped my nails splitting and flaking.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Revlon Gel Nail Builder product and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Finally a nail product that really strenthens brittle nails.</li>
            <li>No point in getting a manicure if your nails are all broken and splitting, but I can get by with a &#x27;natural&#x27; look now, and get a nice manicure when I feel the need.</li>
            <li>My nails looked so thick and they felt strong.</li>
            <li>I have very soft nails which split and regular nail polish</li>
            <li>If I had to say anything negative it would be that it takes longer then most polishes or treatments to dry.</li>
            <li>With only one coat, they felt significantly harder, and it dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have to cut my nails down now because they get so long so fast!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it loses its sheen quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought the shipping and handling fees were a little high!</li>

            <li> The only drawback is that it loses its sheen quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought the shipping and handling fees were a little high!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear base coats, and my nails are healthy in general.</li>
            <li> Over the course of the last year, I found the time to research and came across Revlon and other nail care products in my collection.</li>
            <li> I like to apply 3 coats of the hardener on bare nails or use 2 coats as a base for polish (but be careful, it takes a long time for polish to dry on top of it).&lt;br</li>
            <li> nails are healthier and a bit harder .</li>
            <li> problem is I have to apply it every other day for results, and it takes forever to take nail polish off.</li>
            <li> After about 4 manicures my nails started to brake down.</li>
            <li> I started using it and EUREKA, my nails start groing again long and hard</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it seems to have a very subtle yellowish tinge, so when I wear it without colored polish, my nails look a tiny bit yellower than they otherwise would.</li>
            <li> Really works on weak nails!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of nail hardeners - I doubted they&#x27;d make my nails any harder than regular polish.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone having trouble with their nails.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off, makes my nails hard and works well under polish or alone for a slight shine.  </li>
            <li> This product is not sold in stores no more that why i buy from amozon.</li>
            <li> I hear it is hard to find, so I ordered two bottles, just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using that product as base coat and already see a real difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have weak nails &amp; this</li>
            <li> I recommend Revlon Gel Nail Hardener to anyone with weak or brittle nails.</li>
            <li> This is either discontinued in stores or very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> When I received the package, one bottle was broken.</li>
            <li> makes them worse.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my thin flexible nails from breaking and cracking.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a base coat or when I want to keep my nails nude and only apply it about once a week.</li>
            <li> After using this base coat, my nails have become dry, brittle and they peel at the tips.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, price has been increased from $5 to almost $8 within three months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, cannot find the calcium gel in the stores anymore and don&#x27;t understand why?</li>
            <li> I use a moisturizing base coat and follow that with this nail hardener.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use this base coat so that when SI painted my nails with darker colors, my nails wouldn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base &amp; overcoat.</li>
            <li> Even when my nails are no longer split, I plan to use this as a base coat.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product,stays on</li>
            <li> GOOD NAIL HARDENER AND HELPS THEM GROW FAST</li>
            <li> Really great product......nails grow and are very strong!!!</li>
            <li> Use of the Revlon Calcium Gel Nail Hardener has completely stopped my nails splitting and flaking.  Only wish it was obtainable in the UK.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product as described and it sort of works, but not that well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Dang, this stuff is awesome.  I recently removed a gel mani that destroyed my nails and I really needed something to make them stronger.  I was a little skeptical of nail hardeners - I doubted they&#x27;d make my nails any harder than regular polish.  I was wrong.  With only one coat, they felt significantly harder, and it dried very quickly.  I like to apply 3 coats of the hardener on bare nails or use 2 coats as a base for polish (but be careful, it takes a long time for polish to dry on top of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it seems to have a very subtle yellowish tinge, so when I wear it without colored polish, my nails look a tiny bit yellower than they otherwise would.</li>
            <li> So good for nails. Keeps them strong and healthy</li>
            <li> received quickly, this stuff works great if u change it every three days. Two light coats and your nails will start to look better. Wish I could find it at a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months, and so far Im satisfied with it. problem is I have to apply it every other day for results, and it takes forever to take nail polish off. unfortunately, price has been increased from $5 to almost $8 within three months. other than that, its great.</li>

            <li> After Many years, looking for something that make my nails grow, some one in a pharmacy this product Washington very good. I started using it and EUREKA, my nails start groing again long and hard I am facinated</li>
            <li> Ordering process was easy and item arrived in perfect condition when promised! I thought the shipping and handling fees were a little high! Even though I ordered two identical items each was an additional charge! There was no discount for combined items!&lt;br /&gt;The gel goes on easily and works great! it is a wonderful product for weak nails! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I started using this product last year &amp; bought it local &amp; all of a sudden couldn&#x27;t find it in any store I was so glad to find it on amazon I have weak nails &amp; this made them stronger &amp; grow faster. I bought several bottles &amp; gave them to friends and now they are all hooked too. I have tried all the others but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> This Revlon hardener seems to keep my nails from peeling or splitting.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone having trouble with their nails.</li>
            <li> This product is so great I can&#x27;t say it enough. This product thickened my nails in just 3 days and my nails looked soooo different, like salon level manicure. My nails looked so thick and they felt strong. My nails used to break a lot, but they don&#x27;t now. This hardener makes them very hard while adding a very nice shiny coati on top so they look attractive! Love it! This will be a permanent part of my nail care routine so I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I had an old Revlon Gel Nail Builder product and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  This is a nearly perfect replacement and sooooo cheap.  My nails get so brittle in the winter and start chipping and splitting.  I use a moisturizing base coat and follow that with this nail hardener.  It has really helped my nails get stronger and stop peeling.  And, it isn&#x27;t a gel product that requires soaking in acetone to remove.  Regular polish remover takes it right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it enough to re-order.  Delivery is fast via US mail.</li>
            <li> Really works on weak nails!!</li>
            <li> very happy with the prompt delivery. The product was recommended by my podiatrist. I am trying it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this nail hardener.  It keeps my thin flexible nails from breaking and cracking.  it is also priced to purchase.  I have bought more expensive hardeners and they don&#x27;t work any better.  I recommend this nail  hardener.</li>
            <li> This is either discontinued in stores or very hard to find.  I like it so much I order it often.  It doesn&#x27;t peel off, makes my nails hard and works well under polish or alone for a slight shine.  It dries super fast too.  By far my favorite nail product.</li>
            <li> Great product for weak nails or after using gel polish to renew surface!!  I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Says that it hardens nails after just 4 days. Been using for couple of weeks now and my nails are still breaking.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this base coat so that when SI painted my nails with darker colors, my nails wouldn&#x27;t stain. I normally don&#x27;t wear base coats, and my nails are healthy in general. After using this base coat, my nails have become dry, brittle and they peel at the tips. This product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Use this gel all the time.</li>
            <li> Item was what I wanted. This is the only place I can get this item now</li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon Gel Nail Hardener but received Revlon Cuticle Remover instead. I sent an email informing them of the mistake and was told the problem would be corrected. It has been almost a month now with no reply or product. I have ordered from another site and received the Gel Hardener within 3 days. I love the Revlon Gel Nail Hardener because my nails are brittle and makes my nails like normal again. I recommend Revlon Gel Nail Hardener to anyone with weak or brittle nails. A great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff -- it really works to keep my nails strong, which has always been a problem. I do a lot of gardening, scrubbing and home improvement, and this has really kept me from looking grubby and nail-bitten. No point in getting a manicure if your nails are all broken and splitting, but I can get by with a &#x27;natural&#x27; look now, and get a nice manicure when I feel the need. I hear it is hard to find, so I ordered two bottles, just in case.</li>
            <li> It lasts a week but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be  sure that it does really strengthen nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using that product as base coat and already see a real difference.&lt;br /&gt;My nails are healthier and a bit harder . I &#x27;m gonna keep on applying it regularly and i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll get real satisfaction !</li>
            <li> I have brittle nails &amp; have used Mystic Nail polish as a strengthener but Mystic Nail isn&#x27;t in production anymore. My nails grow but break &amp; split. This gel hardens them. I use it as a base &amp; overcoat. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with yellowing either. I love this polish!</li>
            <li> Very effective product, just as are the base coat and top coat!  They all really strengthen the nails. Unfortunately, cannot find the calcium gel in the stores anymore and don&#x27;t understand why?</li>
            <li> This is a great product for nails that are thin, easy to chip or tear.  Finally a nail product that really strenthens brittle nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months and what a huge difference in the strength of my nails! I use it as a base coat or when I want to keep my nails nude and only apply it about once a week. I have to cut my nails down now because they get so long so fast! If I had to say anything negative it would be that it takes longer then most polishes or treatments to dry. Otherwise this is a must have for healthy nails!!</li>
            <li> I had heard about Revlon&#x27;s Calcium Gel Nail Hardener. So glad Amazon still carries this, as a previous souce discontinued it. I have a severe problem with my thumbnails splitting. (I hear that this comes with being a &amp;#34;senior citizen.&amp;#34;)  This product is working!! I put on 3 coats. It will take a while for my thumbnails to grow out, so I plan to remove the present coats with polish remover, and keep reapplying this every week or two.. Even when my nails are no longer split, I plan to use this as a base coat. Glad I purchased 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found which will actually help my nails grow.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I was getting a french manicure every 3 weeks using gel polish. After about 4 manicures my nails started to brake down. So I stopped getting the manicures and looked for something that would help my nails be strong again. When I found Revlon Calcium Gel - this product is terrific and started to work quickly. I have been using it for about 2 months and my nails are stronger then they were before all of this happened. I will continue to use Revlon Calcium Gel and I highly recommend it.</li>
