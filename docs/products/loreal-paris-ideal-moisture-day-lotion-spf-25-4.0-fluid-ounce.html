            <li>Product is great</li>
            <li>A great value.</li>
            <li>Sane great product as in the stores.</li>
            <li>Well, I am sure this is a good product, and it was a very good price with coupon clipped, however, when I received it, it has an expiration date of 3/15!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light weight formula that doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell and the best part, it&#x27;s spf 25.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and wonderful for keeping my face clean but not oily.</li>
            <li>Well, I sure hope this stuff still works, as it is already expired!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked the Loreal skincare lines</li>
            <li>The packaging and bottle of this item is nice.</li>
            <li>Super for all-over moisturizing- great for face, neck, hands, arms, legs...</li>
            <li>I hope it does her lovely face good as she has better tolerance than I.</li>
            <li>I gave this item 5 stars because I have used it for years and works perfectly for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>but I just felt like I needed more hydration from it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a formula that is a bit more moisturizing</li>
            <li>End of the day though, I still have that lingering sticky residue most sunblocks have.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face and wanted a size that would last me a while, this is perfect!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an ok lotion.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Ideal Moisture Day Lotion SPF 25 works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It more than met my expectations and protects from the sun to boot.</li>
            <li>Not too oily and they were really cute for Halloween.</li>
            <li>I ordered it here because I was no longer able to find it in my community.</li>
            <li>I use moisturizer on my face, neck, hands and arms every day, in the morning, mostly for the sake of the sunblock.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I do love it, just would love the chance to use it for a couple more months before it expires.</li>
            <li>however, which is the most important thing.  </li>
            <li>The product is great the price is nice but having less than thirty days before expiration does not leave this customer satisfied.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a very light, almost unnoticeable, coconut smell that disappears quite quickly after you rub it in.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>so far this has been an AMAZING moisturizer!It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin,it hydrates and soothes,and I love the fact that it&#x27;s spf 25.</li>
            <li>but in the wintertime, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>and this feels very nice after a shower when my skin is most dry.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fragrance free, although it doesn&#x27;t claim to be</li>
            <li>I liked how gentle this lotion is.  </li>
            <li>The feel of the lotion is reasonably light.</li>
            <li>A great daily moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and smooth.</li>
            <li>products glide on smoothly and evaporates into the skin.  </li>
            <li>This day lotion is light, and blends in well.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizing cream (not too light, not too heavy) and the SPF does not irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>The product keeps my skin well moisturized for a full day with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use at a reasonable price - includes the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>My first time ordering it too!</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but may be good for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct improvement.  </li>
            <li>It really does compete with high end brands that cost 4 or 5 times more.  </li>
            <li>It may be fine with people who have normal face skin.</li>
            <li>Now I have to pretty much rub the lotion right around my eyes for the lotion to burn, and I haven&#x27;t had sweat burning my eyes at all since I switched to L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a large bottle (4 ounces).</li>
            <li>VERY moisturizing, lasts all day, and is in a long-lasting large bottle.</li>
            <li>and I think this product works really well.</li>
            <li>I have trouble always finding this moisture lotion, so it made a nice add-on to another order.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I was willing to try the one made for dry skin, but it irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I liked it felt lightweight compared to other lotions with spf, but I don&#x27;t want to walk around with a shiny face all day while wearing the lotion or end up every few hours applying more powder.  </li>
            <li>I use it for the simple quick errand days since its easy to pack with my bag and easier to put on than my regular baby sunblocks.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Good product but a little too thick for the face, more like a beach sunscreen than a moisturizer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but not easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>Thank You amazon for not making me send it back and the full refund.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that completely moisturized my skin throughout all seasons, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a decent product</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin looking for an oil free medium SPF formula.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t not inflame the red patches on my face and seemed to even calm them a bit.  </li>
            <li>I performed a patch test on my already-irritated skin and this actually helped to calm the inflammation.</li>
            <li>Normally, lotions with spf&#x27;s sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It feels really heavy and sticky most of the day</li>
            <li>One note:  a little bit goes a long way, making this bottle even more economical.</li>
            <li>this lotion is good for nighttime use but if I use it during the day my face feels sticky and unclean, it&#x27;s a little heavy for daytime use for me</li>
            <li>It is an oil-free formula, which I really didn&#x27;t want, but this fact was left off the description.  </li>
            <li>This Sensitive Skin Day Lotion did NOT sting my face or eyes.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal Sensitive Skin to see if it would be easier on my eyes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference from the others that do not say &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where the sun is murder and this would likely be unsuitable for the blistering summer months (you need an SPF 50 then)</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and this really didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and was dismayed that the stores I usually bought it at didn&#x27;t carry it any more.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>I generally use hand lotion a couple of times a day in addition to the moisturizer, but my hands get a lot of abuse with housework and gardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SENSITIVE</li>
            <li>Fragrance and my sensitive facial skin don&#x27;t mix for me..... ever!</li>
            <li>It is great for my sensitive skin, which reacts even to other products labeled as &amp;#34;sensitive.&amp;#34; My one complaint is that it takes a little while to absorb, but it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a little too much moisture for oily skin, however.  </li>

            <li> at least it doesn&#x27;t enflame my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; - I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Still leaves my face heavy feeling and though it says for sensitive skin I couldn&#x27;t get over the scent.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to find in stores and glad amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties, but my skin isn&#x27;t particularly dry, so the moisturizing part of face lotion is a side benefit for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe this would work for people with very dry skin, but it even caused my husband to breakout and he has dry skin.</li>
            <li> The slight oily feeling left after use goes away after 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I have had major problems using various kinds of sunscreens on my face over the years, so I am wary of even the lotions that are marketed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I returned the product after a few days to the local store where I bought the item.</li>
            <li> It is a thicker lotion that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually wear a dusting of powder, and this dusting of powder helped with the immediate sheen; however, hours later, my face was shiny again!  </li>
            <li> Like all the other moisture lotion I have tried except for Ponds, this one sweats into my eyes during the course of the day and burns.  </li>
            <li> It feels really very heavy on my face, makes me extra shiny and caused my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin (made so by retinol, unfortunately)</li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunscreen lotions that I can apply to my face without my eyes burning and my face breaking out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble with acne breakouts or sunburns while using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Lotion is lightweight, not too heavy or sticky in any way.  </li>
            <li> But when I accidentally got lotion near my eyes, or sweated into my eyes, the Neutrogena would burn my eyes quite badly.  </li>
            <li> However, I tend to buy sun protection products with at least zinc oxide which this item did not have.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was desperate to find something I could use for SPF while my face is recovering from an allergic reaction (I don&#x27;t know the cause) which left my skin red and painful.</li>
            <li> but once it expires the sunscreen capability becomes weaker to useless for me.</li>
            <li> Would have never have bought if I knew that.  :(</li>

            <li> I have combination acne prone skin and thought this would work for me, but it didn&#x27;t. It feels really very heavy on my face, makes me extra shiny and caused my skin to breakout. Maybe this would work for people with very dry skin, but it even caused my husband to breakout and he has dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was okay I guess but I just felt like I needed more hydration from it. My skin is dry and this really didn&#x27;t help me. It may be fine with people who have normal face skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores in my city. However, I had to return it because it was expired. I love this product so much that I was willing to try the one made for dry skin, but it irritated my sensitive skin. I will have to keep searching for a replacement.</li>
            <li> this lotion is good for nighttime use but if I use it during the day my face feels sticky and unclean, it&#x27;s a little heavy for daytime use for me</li>
            <li> This made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best moisturizer on the market. It&#x27;s a light weight formula that doesn&#x27;t have a perfume smell and the best part, it&#x27;s spf 25.  It really does compete with high end brands that cost 4 or 5 times more.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 years and wouldn&#x27;t switch to anything else. A little difficult to find in stores and glad amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I think this lotion was marketed overseas since the packaging is unfamiliar to me.  It is an oil-free formula, which I really didn&#x27;t want, but this fact was left off the description.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin (made so by retinol, unfortunately) however, which is the most important thing.  I think it&#x27;s fragrance free, although it doesn&#x27;t claim to be but there&#x27;s no detectable perfume.  It states that it has 24 hour hydration and will not cause breakouts.  I think it&#x27;s a little too much moisture for oily skin, however.  I live in Florida where the sun is murder and this would likely be unsuitable for the blistering summer months (you need an SPF 50 then) but in the wintertime, it&#x27;s fine.  I wanted a formula that is a bit more moisturizing so I&#x27;ll have to find something else but I will use this on my t-zone.  It seems to be a decent product and I&#x27;ve always liked the Loreal skincare lines so this is in keeping with my experience.  It&#x27;s quite a large bottle (4 ounces). It was a $5 add on item and well worth it.  I definitely recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin looking for an oil free medium SPF formula.  It didn&#x27;t not inflame the red patches on my face and seemed to even calm them a bit.  One note:  a little bit goes a long way, making this bottle even more economical.</li>
            <li> I am a sunscreen-holic. The packaging and bottle of this item is nice. However, I tend to buy sun protection products with at least zinc oxide which this item did not have. I use it for the simple quick errand days since its easy to pack with my bag and easier to put on than my regular baby sunblocks.&lt;br /&gt;As for the moisturizer side of the product promises: yes, definitely gives me that extra moisture I needed. End of the day though, I still have that lingering sticky residue most sunblocks have.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunscreen lotions that I can apply to my face without my eyes burning and my face breaking out.</li>
            <li> VERY moisturizing, lasts all day, and is in a long-lasting large bottle. I use this on my face and wanted a size that would last me a while, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Loreal Ideal Moisture is great but expiration date is days away!!!  The product is great the price is nice but having less than thirty days before expiration does not leave this customer satisfied.</li>
            <li> Super for all-over moisturizing- great for face, neck, hands, arms, legs... anywhere... and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy at all!</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product! Very smooth and wonderful for keeping my face clean but not oily. Works great with the matching loreal soap!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I wanted to try something new.(I&#x27;ve been using the Target brand moisturizer that sucked.) And I gotta say,so far this has been an AMAZING moisturizer!It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin,it hydrates and soothes,and I love the fact that it&#x27;s spf 25. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I liked how gentle this lotion is.  Normally, lotions with spf&#x27;s sting my eyes.  This Sensitive Skin Day Lotion did NOT sting my face or eyes.  Even with that benefit, I noticed a sheen to my skin after applying, even when the product had been sitting on my skin for hours.  I usually wear a dusting of powder, and this dusting of powder helped with the immediate sheen; however, hours later, my face was shiny again!  I just couldn&#x27;t seem to keep up with shine this lotion gives my combination skin throughout the day.  I liked it felt lightweight compared to other lotions with spf, but I don&#x27;t want to walk around with a shiny face all day while wearing the lotion or end up every few hours applying more powder.  I returned the product after a few days to the local store where I bought the item.</li>
            <li> Still leaves my face heavy feeling and though it says for sensitive skin I couldn&#x27;t get over the scent. It lingers and irritates my nose.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I think this product works really well. It is great for my sensitive skin, which reacts even to other products labeled as &amp;#34;sensitive.&amp;#34; My one complaint is that it takes a little while to absorb, but it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my local store was out of Eucerin and it&#x27;s an ok lotion. It feels really heavy and sticky most of the day and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but may be good for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Ideal Moisture Day Lotion SPF 25 works well for my sensitive skin. The product keeps my skin well moisturized for a full day with no irritation. I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive dry skin. It more than met my expectations and protects from the sun to boot.</li>
            <li> I gave this item 5 stars because I have used it for years and works perfectly for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry/sensitive skin and this feels very nice after a shower when my skin is most dry.</li>
            <li> Not too oily and they were really cute for Halloween.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I ordered it here because I was no longer able to find it in my community.</li>
            <li> I have trouble always finding this moisture lotion, so it made a nice add-on to another order.</li>
            <li> Fragrance and my sensitive facial skin don&#x27;t mix for me..... ever! Thank You amazon for not making me send it back and the full refund. I gave it to my mom I hope it does her lovely face good as she has better tolerance than I.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use at a reasonable price - includes the sunscreen. It is a thicker lotion that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use moisturizer on my face, neck, hands and arms every day, in the morning, mostly for the sake of the sunblock. I&#x27;m in my fifties, but my skin isn&#x27;t particularly dry, so the moisturizing part of face lotion is a side benefit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL AND FEEL: The lotion has a very light, almost unnoticeable, coconut smell that disappears quite quickly after you rub it in. The feel of the lotion is reasonably light. A bit oilier than oil-free formulas I&#x27;ve tried, but you aren&#x27;t left feeling sticky after you use it. The slight oily feeling left after use goes away after 30 minutes or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOTION PERFORMANCE: The lotion absorbs quickly. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with acne breakouts or sunburns while using this lotion.  My skin on my face, arms and neck feel moisturized all day. I generally use hand lotion a couple of times a day in addition to the moisturizer, but my hands get a lot of abuse with housework and gardening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SENSITIVE SKIN PROPERTIES: I actually prefer the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the Neutrogena oil-free SPF moisturizer over the L&#x27;Oreal lotion.  The Neutrogena has a lighter feel. But when I accidentally got lotion near my eyes, or sweated into my eyes, the Neutrogena would burn my eyes quite badly.  I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal Sensitive Skin to see if it would be easier on my eyes and I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct improvement.  Now I have to pretty much rub the lotion right around my eyes for the lotion to burn, and I haven&#x27;t had sweat burning my eyes at all since I switched to L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> A great daily moisturizer with SPF. Goes on light and smooth. Will definitely purchase again once bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Like all the other moisture lotion I have tried except for Ponds, this one sweats into my eyes during the course of the day and burns.  I don&#x27;t see any difference from the others that do not say &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and was dismayed that the stores I usually bought it at didn&#x27;t carry it any more.  Thank goodness for Amazon.com.  This product has worked so well for me and I&#x27;m always receiving complements on what I put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Good product but a little too thick for the face, more like a beach sunscreen than a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless moisturizers during the winter season, however  my skin always had severe and noticeable dryness. This is the first moisturizer that completely moisturized my skin throughout all seasons, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely moisturizes. Though somehow when I bought it I only had a month to use it before it expired. If your going to buy, once you get it make sure you check the expiration date!!!! I got mine and it expired in that month. This is why I have to give one star. Product is great but once it expires the sunscreen capability becomes weaker to useless for me. Otherwise I do love it, just would love the chance to use it for a couple more months before it expires.</li>
            <li> L oreal product are always top quality!!!</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin...at least it doesn&#x27;t enflame my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; - I really like this product! My first time ordering it too!</li>
            <li> products glide on smoothly and evaporates into the skin.  Lotion is lightweight, not too heavy or sticky in any way.  A great value.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was desperate to find something I could use for SPF while my face is recovering from an allergic reaction (I don&#x27;t know the cause) which left my skin red and painful. This is an excellent moisturizing cream (not too light, not too heavy) and the SPF does not irritate my skin! I have had major problems using various kinds of sunscreens on my face over the years, so I am wary of even the lotions that are marketed for sensitive skin. I performed a patch test on my already-irritated skin and this actually helped to calm the inflammation. Great product!</li>
            <li> Sane great product as in the stores.</li>
            <li> This day lotion is light, and blends in well. I have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> Well, I am sure this is a good product, and it was a very good price with coupon clipped, however, when I received it, it has an expiration date of 3/15!  Well, I sure hope this stuff still works, as it is already expired!  Would have never have bought if I knew that.  :(</li>
