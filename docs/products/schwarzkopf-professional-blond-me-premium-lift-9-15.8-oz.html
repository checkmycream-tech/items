            <li>Smells great and works good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for an even application though.</li>
            <li>That is good cuz its cooling that out of it.</li>
            <li>it is great product very easy to mix and works faster than others</li>

            <li>This bleach is amazing</li>
            <li>Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>, I would think probably it would lift all the way to level 10 the first time, it&#x27;s very good stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good bleach and smells fine.</li>
            <li>This powder is fantastic, the smell is so good and not aggressive...</li>
            <li>Excellent product, works great on dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Great product thanks!</li>
            <li>(this is very important because you could burn yourself) they have the instructions and tips you need if you&#x27;re not a pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is one of the better lighteners that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I made an appointment with their top level colorist) with my printed picture.</li>
            <li>and 2 : 3 (20) for the scalp.</li>
            <li>and don&#x27;t wrap the plastic around the hair, just lay it on top so the sections don&#x27;t touch</li>
            <li>I recommend it to people who have really healthy hair and have experience/are professionals.</li>
            <li>I love their products.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The best bleach I had try in my entire life.</li>
            <li>It sort of reminds me of how a light rose perfume might smell like.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used this magenta Pravana many times over bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also did a lot more damage than most bleach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I FRIGGIN LOVE</li>
            <li>The lifting power is better than most, but not dramatically so.</li>
            <li>im in love</li>
            <li>She was very excited and confident....</li>
            <li>Also, the powder is very fine and smooth.</li>
            <li>works fast and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and fresh, I love it, I want my house to smell like this, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Redken, Up to 7 dust free lightener but the Schwarzkopf one gets out more orange than the Redken</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light and clean smell.</li>
            <li>Easy to use texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; I wanted to try a beautiful Red to Blond ombre that I saw on Pinterest, I went into the salon</li>
            <li>The power lift works really quick!</li>
            <li>Another plus is the smell which is pleasant like a shampoo or conditioner and not harsh.</li>
            <li>So it had to fight dye that was stuck in my hair and my stubborn hair, my hair is naturally light but hates being lighten.</li>
            <li>So great for brunettes going blonde!!!</li>
            <li>Schwarzopf is fantastic.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re trying to go blonde, I bet this is great.</li>
            <li>If you have light hair to begin with you don&#x27;t need anything stronger.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a professional product line, I would recommend this product to someone experienced and willing to research how to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a professional product line, I would recommend this product to someone experienced and willing to research how to use it.</li>
            <li>I used it along with Schwarzkopf Professional Blond Me Premium Care Developer 6%/20 Vol and am very pleased with the ease of application and the results.</li>
            <li>The only issue with this product is the price, about twice as much as most of the popular bleaching product but that alone, would not affect my decision to continue using it.</li>
            <li>and she used this special &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; oil based color that she had to &amp;</li>
            <li>Great bleach, higher lift than most other bleaches.</li>
            <li>I did two full bleaching sessions in two days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Control: for a full head lift you have to premix your volumes (scalp and length)</li>
            <li>I prefer to have a product line that delivers full power,</li>
            <li>I prefer to have a product line that delivers full power,</li>
            <li>Very gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s Pravana and not a processing dye</li>
            <li>I was nervous that my stubborn ends would be slightly damaged but beyond happy to see that they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to add that it just smells amazing, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li>texture and consistency is super smooth, not dusty fallout when you scoop, etc.  </li>
            <li>hair was super healthy to start (frequent cuts</li>
            <li>the condition it leaves your hair in after using this marvelous product is just unbelievable!!</li>
            <li>Does a great job without being excessively harsh.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;ll probably go with the 6 or 9% next time...</li>
            <li>I had to use a toner to finish getting the golden parts out.</li>
            <li>This stuff gets super hot.</li>
            <li>I bought this for balayaging, but the texture of it isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>(I should really buy a full gown instead of using plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I should really buy a full gown instead of using plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far the best bleach I&#x27;ve ever used,worth the money,gets my hair white blonde!!!!</li>
            <li>Its bot gonna make darker hair like mine which is dark brown to blond in one application but lighten it up pretty good.</li>
            <li>Blond me really does lift 9 levels of hair!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m blonde with no damage hair. :)</li>
            <li>Hot like simmering, steam boil like soup on the stove</li>
            <li>And be sure to buy the developer as well, because they truly are a dynamic duo.</li>
            <li>love the Schwarzkopf Blondme so much, that I bought the ice toner, ice brilliance shampoo and deep conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, you can really saturate the hair and it soaks in a bit to the hair underneath, you can feel confident that the product has been brushed onto all the hair.</li>
            <li>but it was more of a dark yellow (on the top).</li>
            <li>and I cannot stress enough that you have to quickly apply!</li>
            <li>The Blond Me product line that Schwarzkopf created works very well during the lifting stage</li>
            <li>The Blond Me product line that Schwarzkopf created works very well during the lifting stage</li>
            <li>Besides that, it came in really fast, maybe two days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>So i have no idea how much that is.</li>
            <li>That happened fast and i lost 2 extensions over processed them.</li>
            <li>So works fast.</li>
            <li>again for fast delivery</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and I accomplished that.</li>
            <li>The price may be more that the beauty supply options, but take into consideration that this is a professional brand that offers seriously professional quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfort: this stuff gets super hot and it will (very obviously) discolor your skin for weeks so plan to use a skin protector around your hairline and ears.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfort: this stuff gets super hot and it will (very obviously) discolor your skin for weeks so plan to use a skin protector around your hairline and ears.</li>
            <li>This product arrived very fast and it was completely sealed.</li>
            <li>After 3 bleaching sessions (the last one not truly being a full session)</li>
            <li>not in the same day), then used the Schwarzkopf Ice toner to cool it out and achieve the &amp;#34;white platinum&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fully lift 9 levels for me but my hair is super stubborn and product I used to strip my previous dye out didn&#x27;t work that well leaving the tips full of dye...</li>
            <li>Starting from a medium/light brown auburn color I was able to bleach my hair in one session to go platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>Besides, it does provide more lift so while another brand of bleach might take two applications, you would only require one with the Blond Me-a big PLUS.</li>
            <li>but I gotta say that I appleid lots of coconut oil prior to bleaching and waited for a few hours then applied the bleach right on top of my oily hair.</li>
            <li>This bleach does work quickly, but that no problem, as application time is significantly less than using Quick Blue or anything</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair naturally-</li>
            <li>Got my hair to the color that I wanted, very &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the Schwarzkopf Professional Blond Me 20 Volume developer.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a line about 3/4 of the way up, but there&#x27;s no indication for how much that is nor is it mentioned in the directions on the back.</li>
            <li>However, when I used it there were still golden piece especially in the back.</li>
            <li>usually takes me 2-3 processes using loreal magic blue to get me platinum...</li>
            <li>will say this: if fractions and ratios are not your thing, if you&#x27;re not a hair care professional, or not savvy with bleaching products in general, do not attempt to use this set of</li>
            <li>The scalp area with the new regrowth and the darkest red was the hardest part.</li>
            <li>Must be very careful to place on ends first then the roots.</li>
            <li>I was surprised too that it actually had a heating component when I had it on my head.</li>
            <li>It would also not dry as fast, it normal would take less than 30 minutes to dry</li>
            <li>after bleaching my hair twise with the sallys bleach, my hair was still like a brownish orange brassy looking color (my hair was perviously died black) but after trying this bleach and developer my hair went to a pale yellow which is exactly what i wanted!!!</li>
            <li>but I would say it lightened my dark brown hair to a slightly lighter shade of gold with one application than say, Quick Blue or 7th Stage but to someone with natural hair that is medium brown or lighter</li>
            <li>The creamier formula is.so, SO much easier to apply in general but especially helpful for tight spots like around the ears and at the hairline.</li>
            <li>My goal was going from dark hair to platinum blonde with out to much damage</li>
            <li>Really lifts dark hair color, follow the directions!</li>

            <li> This stuff gets super hot.</li>
            <li> I bought this for balayaging, but the texture of it isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> (I should really buy a full gown instead of using plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I should really buy a full gown instead of using plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By far the best bleach I&#x27;ve ever used,worth the money,gets my hair white blonde!!!!</li>
            <li> Its bot gonna make darker hair like mine which is dark brown to blond in one application but lighten it up pretty good.</li>
            <li> Blond me really does lift 9 levels of hair!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m blonde with no damage hair. :)</li>
            <li> Hot like simmering, steam boil like soup on the stove</li>
            <li> And be sure to buy the developer as well, because they truly are a dynamic duo.</li>
            <li> love the Schwarzkopf Blondme so much, that I bought the ice toner, ice brilliance shampoo and deep conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, you can really saturate the hair and it soaks in a bit to the hair underneath, you can feel confident that the product has been brushed onto all the hair.</li>
            <li> but it was more of a dark yellow (on the top).</li>
            <li> and I cannot stress enough that you have to quickly apply!</li>
            <li> The Blond Me product line that Schwarzkopf created works very well during the lifting stage</li>
            <li> The Blond Me product line that Schwarzkopf created works very well during the lifting stage</li>
            <li> Besides that, it came in really fast, maybe two days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> So i have no idea how much that is.</li>
            <li> That happened fast and i lost 2 extensions over processed them.</li>
            <li> So works fast.</li>
            <li> again for fast delivery</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and I accomplished that.</li>
            <li> The price may be more that the beauty supply options, but take into consideration that this is a professional brand that offers seriously professional quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfort: this stuff gets super hot and it will (very obviously) discolor your skin for weeks so plan to use a skin protector around your hairline and ears.</li>

            <li> This product arrived very fast and it was completely sealed.</li>
            <li> After 3 bleaching sessions (the last one not truly being a full session)</li>
            <li> not in the same day), then used the Schwarzkopf Ice toner to cool it out and achieve the &amp;#34;white platinum&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fully lift 9 levels for me but my hair is super stubborn and product I used to strip my previous dye out didn&#x27;t work that well leaving the tips full of dye...</li>
            <li> Starting from a medium/light brown auburn color I was able to bleach my hair in one session to go platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> Besides, it does provide more lift so while another brand of bleach might take two applications, you would only require one with the Blond Me-a big PLUS.</li>
            <li> but I gotta say that I appleid lots of coconut oil prior to bleaching and waited for a few hours then applied the bleach right on top of my oily hair.</li>
            <li> This bleach does work quickly, but that no problem, as application time is significantly less than using Quick Blue or anything</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair naturally-</li>
            <li> Got my hair to the color that I wanted, very &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the Schwarzkopf Professional Blond Me 20 Volume developer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a line about 3/4 of the way up, but there&#x27;s no indication for how much that is nor is it mentioned in the directions on the back.</li>
            <li> However, when I used it there were still golden piece especially in the back.</li>
            <li> usually takes me 2-3 processes using loreal magic blue to get me platinum...</li>
            <li> will say this: if fractions and ratios are not your thing, if you&#x27;re not a hair care professional, or not savvy with bleaching products in general, do not attempt to use this set of</li>
            <li> The scalp area with the new regrowth and the darkest red was the hardest part.</li>
            <li> Must be very careful to place on ends first then the roots.</li>
            <li> I was surprised too that it actually had a heating component when I had it on my head.</li>
            <li> It would also not dry as fast, it normal would take less than 30 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> after bleaching my hair twise with the sallys bleach, my hair was still like a brownish orange brassy looking color (my hair was perviously died black) but after trying this bleach and developer my hair went to a pale yellow which is exactly what i wanted!!!</li>
            <li> but I would say it lightened my dark brown hair to a slightly lighter shade of gold with one application than say, Quick Blue or 7th Stage but to someone with natural hair that is medium brown or lighter</li>
            <li> The creamier formula is.so, SO much easier to apply in general but especially helpful for tight spots like around the ears and at the hairline.</li>
            <li> My goal was going from dark hair to platinum blonde with out to much damage</li>
            <li> Really lifts dark hair color, follow the directions!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The can is vacuum foil sealed, weighs 450g/15.9oz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you add the powder to the developer it does not turn into this thick, chocolate mousse-like consistency which is the main thing I really hate about L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue and all the other popular bleach powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> because my hair felt super soft afterwards, and no real breakage; unlike other bleaching products can leave your hair feeling hard, dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 9 lifts of color so don&#x27;t leave on for to long</li>
            <li> The total time it took me to actually brush on the bleach was cut in half, literally.</li>
            <li> i also bought the developer from this same brand which is a bit pricey compared to the other bleaching products you can buy at sallys</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews and they recomend to start with a low volume developer.</li>
            <li> : I started with unwashed dry hair, I sprayed on lots and lots of the Schwarzkopf Pre Lift Kera Protector (also cheaper on ebay).</li>
            <li> I also had pink in my hair before this and it left a pastel pink in my hair.</li>
            <li> Damage factor in my opinion, is no better or worse than less pricey brands but the color result with this more pricey brand is reliable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about coloring my thick, 22&amp;#34; long hair (my hair grows super fast).</li>
            <li> The regrowth area did have some green (natural sandy black hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to dye my hair for the third time in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Result: from a burnt sienna ombre to a monochrome pale yellow blond.</li>
            <li> It did damage faster that other bleaches.</li>
            <li> Holy cow-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bleached with other products and had less lift</li>
            <li> only complaint for this product is that there are no measurements on the scoop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dark hair and wanted to go white/platinum.  </li>
            <li> was going from dyed black (level 10) to platinum (level 1).</li>
            <li> Ebay was half the price of Amazon...</li>

            <li> for half of the hair on my head)</li>
            <li> you want some serious blonde locks, this bleach is a must buy!</li>
            <li> over $300 wasted.</li>
            <li> so it turns green after 20 mins.</li>
            <li> so at the end of the day this product line becomes very expensive and very high maintenance if you&#x27;re looking to achieve a platinum blond.ct into the cuticle or the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I use the 12% / 40 developer in a 1:2.5 ratio with the bleach, for 30 minutes, so as not to damage my hair too badly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great and works good</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair with the BlondMe 12% Developer and love it! It didn&#x27;t fully lift 9 levels for me but my hair is super stubborn and product I used to strip my previous dye out didn&#x27;t work that well leaving the tips full of dye...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going from dyed black (level 10) to platinum (level 1). So it had to fight dye that was stuck in my hair and my stubborn hair, my hair is naturally light but hates being lighten. After 3 bleaching sessions (the last one not truly being a full session) it lifted it to a level 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was super healthy to start (frequent cuts and I stopped dying it a month or two before I planned on going blonde). This product did not damage my hair which is amazing! I did two full bleaching sessions in two days. I was nervous that my stubborn ends would be slightly damaged but beyond happy to see that they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> works fast and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Always great results.</li>
            <li> Blond me really does lift 9 levels of hair! It is actually does what it says. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product arrived very fast and it was completely sealed. The power lift works really quick! Must be very careful to place on ends first then the roots. The color lasts!</li>
            <li> So great for brunettes going blonde!!! Very gentle and easy to use. 9 lifts of color so don&#x27;t leave on for to long</li>
            <li> Best Bleach ever! Reminds me of Tigi Bleach which is usually hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> Ebay was half the price of Amazon...my mistake (just an fyi for the rest of you though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please go to Schwarzkopfs website for instructions on how to mix! and how to apply (this is very important because you could burn yourself) they have the instructions and tips you need if you&#x27;re not a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m NOT a pro but every $300 salon color visit leaves me in tears! I&#x27;m crazy about coloring my thick, 22&amp;#34; long hair (my hair grows super fast). I change the color every 2-3months and this is one of the better lighteners that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Redken, Up to 7 dust free lightener but the Schwarzkopf one gets out more orange than the Redken did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I bought Blond Me Premium Lift 9+; I wanted to try a beautiful Red to Blond ombre that I saw on Pinterest, I went into the salon (I made an appointment with their top level colorist) with my printed picture. She was very excited and confident....but she didn&#x27;t listen and my hair sucked up all the copper (even when I told her it would) and I was left with a burnt sienna ombre that looked nothing like the photo! and she used this special &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; oil based color that she had to &amp;#34;layer paint&amp;#34; on. UH! over $300 wasted. So I just wanted to get that crap salon job out and start with a blank canvas (Platinum Blond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used the Blond Me Premium Lift 9+: I started with unwashed dry hair, I sprayed on lots and lots of the Schwarzkopf Pre Lift Kera Protector (also cheaper on ebay). I&#x27;ve got a lot of hair so I had to mix 4 : 6 (30) for the length and 2 : 3 (20) for the scalp. I processed in saran wrap separated sections for 30mins - checking every 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: from a burnt sienna ombre to a monochrome pale yellow blond. The scalp area with the new regrowth and the darkest red was the hardest part. There was a tiny bit of orange but it was more of a dark yellow (on the top). There was some chemical cut but I a post color trim solved that. The regrowth area did have some green (natural sandy black hair). I don&#x27;t know how well this will work on my regrowth, it&#x27;s doubtful that I will use it in the future for that purpose. Instead I will use it off scalp to lift out reds and oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about the Blond Me Premium Lift:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on the package say that 1 scoop is equal to 35g and the suggested mixing ratio is 1 : 1.5 to 1 : 2.5.&lt;br /&gt;Use the Blond Me Premium Care Developer at 6 or 9% (20-30vol) Processing time 20-45 min, do not use heat. (Schwarzkopf website says only use 6%/20 vol for the scalp max).&lt;br /&gt;The can is vacuum foil sealed, weighs 450g/15.9oz.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients: Potassium Persulfate, Sodium Silicate, Magnesium Carbonate Hydroxide, Ammonium Persulfate, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Dimethicone, Acrylates Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, Silica, Polyquaternium-4, sodium Hexametaphosphate, Dimethiconol, Parfum 0(Fragrance), Potassium Sulfate, Ammonium Sulfate, Geraniol, Citronellol, CI 77007 (Ultamarines)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Blonde Me products I bought to use after lifting: Blond Me Blond Toning (steel blue for the orange, sand for neutral, and Ice for the yellow), Blond Me Blond Lifting, Crystal Developer and Premium Care Developer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Redken Products I bought specifically to use after lifting: Redken Chemistry System; Shot Phix 3.5 and Time Reset Filler Shot Phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I give it a 4 out of 5: Control and Comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Control: for a full head lift you have to premix your volumes (scalp and length) and I cannot stress enough that you have to quickly apply! make sure you section and use plastic! it&#x27;s $1 to buy saran wrap...but you&#x27;ll be so happy you precut four or more sheets of wrap to separate your sections and protect your shoulders. Do not scrunch and do not pile your hair! and don&#x27;t wrap the plastic around the hair, just lay it on top so the sections don&#x27;t touch and they get oxygen. I suggest downward brush strokes and don&#x27;t push the product into the cuticle or the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: this stuff gets super hot and it will (very obviously) discolor your skin for weeks so plan to use a skin protector around your hairline and ears. My skin had no color here my saturated hair touched my back (I should really buy a full gown instead of using plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Price was my fault, I should have shopped around)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a professional product line, I would recommend this product to someone experienced and willing to research how to use it. The Blond Me lifter banishes those unwanted reds and oranges with ease! and it&#x27;s very good at lifting out yellows. I&#x27;ve seen reviews of people getting dangerous burns from the Blond Me Premium Lift or even burning their client. You will have to tone after but I don&#x27;t find that the Blond Me product line works synergistically. I prefer to have a product line that delivers full power, 100% of the time. The reason being is that, the product line chemicals are formulated to work together and it seems that my hair doesn&#x27;t fully like this product line. The Blond Me product line that Schwarzkopf created works very well during the lifting stage but it falls short on the toning stage and toning every few days is excessive and expensive. The Blond Me toner is 1 ; 1 (and that&#x27;s 1 TUBE of toner....for half of the hair on my head)..so at the end of the day this product line becomes very expensive and very high maintenance if you&#x27;re looking to achieve a platinum blond.ct into the cuticle or the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: this stuff gets super hot and it will (very obviously) discolor your skin for weeks so plan to use a skin protector around your hairline and ears.

            <li> Best lightner EVER!  I don&#x27;t even have to use toner!!!</li>
            <li> Holy cow- this stuff is incredible! I have medium brown hair naturally- usually takes me 2-3 processes using loreal magic blue to get me platinum...it took 20 minutes using this with their 12% developer. Honestly I&#x27;ll probably go with the 6 or 9% next time...still can&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li> I bought this for balayaging, but the texture of it isn&#x27;t right. It&#x27;s good for an even application though.</li>
            <li> By far the best bleach I&#x27;ve ever used,worth the money,gets my hair white blonde!!!!</li>
            <li> one of the best bleaches on the market</li>
            <li> Do you have to use the same brand developer?</li>
            <li> Great bleach, higher lift than most other bleaches. However, when I used it there were still golden piece especially in the back. I also had pink in my hair before this and it left a pastel pink in my hair. I had to use a toner to finish getting the golden parts out. It did damage faster that other bleaches. My hair had lost some elasticity and moisture. It would also not dry as fast, it normal would take less than 30 minutes to dry and now it&#x27;s an hour or two. I was surprised too that it actually had a heating component when I had it on my head. I only had it on for 30 minutes out of the recommended 20 - 45 minutes. Besides that, it came in really fast, maybe two days after I ordered it. I recommend it to people who have really healthy hair and have experience/are professionals.</li>
            <li> Schwarzopf is fantastic. I love their products. This powder is fantastic, the smell is so good and not aggressive...I love it. Got my hair to the color that I wanted, very &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li> The best bleach I had try in my entire life. I&#x27;m so happy with the results!! Now I&#x27;m blonde with no damage hair. :)</li>
            <li> Happy with the product</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BLEACH!  I will never use anything else! First, I&#x27;d like to add that it just smells amazing, which was unexpected. It&#x27;s a very light and clean smell. It sort of reminds me of how a light rose perfume might smell like. It&#x27;s very pretty and fresh, I love it, I want my house to smell like this, it&#x27;s that good. Also, the powder is very fine and smooth. it&#x27;s not too dusty nor does it go airborne when scooping it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with the Schwarzkopf Professional Blond Me 20 Volume developer. Starting from a medium/light brown auburn color I was able to bleach my hair in one session to go platinum blonde. (using toner of course) and the application was great! Easy to use texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint for this product is that there are no measurements on the scoop. There&#x27;s a line about 3/4 of the way up, but there&#x27;s no indication for how much that is nor is it mentioned in the directions on the back. So i have no idea how much that is. But that&#x27;s just my personal preference, I&#x27;d like there to be indications on the scoop, so I still give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It works toooooo well. Did great lift but now dye won&#x27;t stay in. I&#x27;m about to dye my hair for the third time in a few weeks. Luckily it&#x27;s Pravana and not a processing dye or I&#x27;d have no hair left. I&#x27;ve bleached with other products and had less lift but I&#x27;ve never had problems dying over it like this and I&#x27;ve used this magenta Pravana many times over bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lift, but stays in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did a lot more damage than most bleach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to go blonde, I bet this is great. If you want to do dye a different color after listening I would pick a different bleach. This is a struggle!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job without being excessively harsh.  But I would definitely recommend using a protector (or coconut oil).  If you have light hair to begin with you don&#x27;t need anything stronger.</li>
            <li> Got this to bleach extensions. Used a 30% vol developer. I want to achieve white hair. Start color was #27 honey blonde and it did the job well. This stuff gets super hot. Hot like simmering, steam boil like soup on the stove so be careful. That happened fast and i lost 2 extensions over processed them. So works fast. Color starts out blue but it has anti brass compounds in it so it turns green after 20 mins. That is good cuz its cooling that out of it. With this bleach i will get the white silver hair i want. Damage factor in my opinion, is no better or worse than less pricey brands but the color result with this more pricey brand is reliable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works great on dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I would never use another bleach powder!!</li>
            <li> it is great product very easy to mix and works faster than others,i wood bay  again definitely,and am regretful i cud find et&lt;br /&gt;thanks again for fast delivery</li>
            <li> Use this with the corresponding developer and watch the results...amazing! Really lifts dark hair color, follow the directions!</li>
            <li> PERFECT BLOND. USE WITH 9% BLOND ME DEVELOPER ONLY.</li>
            <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good bleach and smells fine. Fast delivery. Did not damage my hair at all but I gotta say that I appleid lots of coconut oil prior to bleaching and waited for a few hours then applied the bleach right on top of my oily hair. Its bot gonna make darker hair like mine which is dark brown to blond in one application but lighten it up pretty good.</li>
            <li> I FRIGGIN LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I just wanted to get that out there... When I use this along with developer, the results are amazing! The price may be more that the beauty supply options, but take into consideration that this is a professional brand that offers seriously professional quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this: if fractions and ratios are not your thing, if you&#x27;re not a hair care professional, or not savvy with bleaching products in general, do not attempt to use this set of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture and consistency is super smooth, not dusty fallout when you scoop, etc.  This bleach does work quickly, but that no problem, as application time is significantly less than using Quick Blue or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dark hair and wanted to go white/platinum.  I use the 12% / 40 developer in a 1:2.5 ratio with the bleach, for 30 minutes, so as not to damage my hair too badly.  I did this three times (not in the same day), then used the Schwarzkopf Ice toner to cool it out and achieve the &amp;#34;white platinum&amp;#34; effect.  I think the synergy of the bleach powder and developer conditions the hair as you&#x27;re bleaching, because my hair felt super soft afterwards, and no real breakage; unlike other bleaching products can leave your hair feeling hard, dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Schwarzkopf Blondme so much, that I bought the ice toner, ice brilliance shampoo and deep conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want some serious blonde locks, this bleach is a must buy! And be sure to buy the developer as well, because they truly are a dynamic duo.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!!!!! i also bought the developer from this same brand which is a bit pricey compared to the other bleaching products you can buy at sallys but this one is way better!!! the condition it leaves your hair in after using this marvelous product is just unbelievable!! and it LIFTS LIKE MAGIC!!! after bleaching my hair twise with the sallys bleach, my hair was still like a brownish orange brassy looking color (my hair was perviously died black) but after trying this bleach and developer my hair went to a pale yellow which is exactly what i wanted!!! yeeey!!! :D</li>
            <li> My husband used this to bleach my hair.  People keep asking me where I got it done and I just point at my husband!  Great product thanks!</li>
            <li> Best bleach ever! Will never use another product.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST powdered bleach I have yet used, no exaggeration. I used it along with Schwarzkopf Professional Blond Me Premium Care Developer 6%/20 Vol and am very pleased with the ease of application and the results. The consistency is nice and creamy. When you add the powder to the developer it does not turn into this thick, chocolate mousse-like consistency which is the main thing I really hate about L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue and all the other popular bleach powders I&#x27;ve tried. The creamier formula is.so, SO much easier to apply in general but especially helpful for tight spots like around the ears and at the hairline. Plus, you can really saturate the hair and it soaks in a bit to the hair underneath, you can feel confident that the product has been brushed onto all the hair. The total time it took me to actually brush on the bleach was cut in half, literally. The lifting power is better than most, but not dramatically so. It says \\&quot;9 levels of lift\\&quot; on the tub but I would say it lightened my dark brown hair to a slightly lighter shade of gold with one application than say, Quick Blue or 7th Stage but to someone with natural hair that is medium brown or lighter, I would think probably it would lift all the way to level 10 the first time, it&#x27;s very good stuff. Another plus is the smell which is pleasant like a shampoo or conditioner and not harsh. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other powder bleaches which are sometimes so irritating they make my eyes tear and my nose run for hours after I&#x27;ve rinsed the bleach out. The only issue with this product is the price, about twice as much as most of the popular bleaching product but that alone, would not affect my decision to continue using it. Besides, it does provide more lift so while another brand of bleach might take two applications, you would only require one with the Blond Me-a big PLUS. Having bleached white hair requires constant maintenance and the product quality is key so this is definitely my go-to bleach from now on. I am very impressed with this product.on. I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! My goal was going from dark hair to platinum blonde with out to much damage and I accomplished that. I used  20% volume developer. I have read other reviews and they recomend to start with a low volume developer. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This bleach is amazing im in love 😍😍😍😍😍😍</li>
