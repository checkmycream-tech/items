            <li>fragance make me feel so good and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda spicy fragrance,Smells so good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it smell good</li>
            <li>It goes great with a suit as one of my friends wore it to a wedding and got more compliments than a bride:)</li>
            <li>my friend recommend me to buy it , to be honest</li>
            <li>Nice smells</li>
            <li>im glad it still smells as good as it did when i found it in a magazine</li>
            <li>Exellent as described, fast shipping , Best fragrance for men, My Husbands favorite</li>
            <li>A lot of people love the smell of the product whenever I wear it</li>
            <li>Really love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love it :3</li>
            <li>I love it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s slightly more akin to something you&#x27;d expect from Varvatos.</li>
            <li>Quite nice, but the original Aqva fragrance is still the flagship of the Bvlgari line, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This new Aqva really does id&#x27;s best to modernize the outdoorsman, woodsy, scent &amp; it excels.  </li>
            <li>More citrusy than either Aqva Marine or the original Aqva.</li>
            <li>I imagine the great Italian designers, creating better than what this is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when my favorite is the original Aqva scent, this new one is a nice variation into this line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product was as advertised with original packaging.</li>
            <li>the cologne itself, the scent is fairly unique and I&#x27;ve not smelled anything like it before.</li>
            <li>Not so sure if it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li>In closing, I&#x27;d call it a great new addition to the Aqva line, without overtaking the original in terms of overall desirability and longevity.</li>
            <li>It long lasting more than 5hours.it has all the factors of a good cologne.</li>
            <li>It is not for guys in twenties, it has a slightly more serious hint, it has a kind of mystical note that women cannot stop analyzing.</li>
            <li>, I also have the regular Aqva and love them both.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li>but I feel it wears off fast.</li>
            <li>The sent product was legitimate and real.</li>
            <li>would like tho thanks the seller &#x27;365 Beauty&#x27;, for such an extraordinary service.</li>
            <li>The same cologne is $90 at Sephora so not a bad deal if you wanna use it as an evening cologne for 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>I really like this new scent added to the Aqva line from Bvlgary.</li>
            <li>It was Legit but an older batch hence the fragrance won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an addition to the main Aqva fragrance, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>It is fresh but not sporty, vanilla tone after a few hours but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>Though I wouldn&#x27;t rate this the best of the colognes that I&#x27;ve used, given that I enjoy the scent and the scent has gotten me some compliments, I would rank this a solid purchase.</li>
            <li>A bit more of a spicy fragrance than you ordinarily find with a Bvlgari scent.</li>
            <li>In last few years I have tried many perfumes, mainly because I work on a cruise ship and I have a chance to test a lot of stuff as soon as it is out.</li>
            <li>It has a fairly rapid dry down that leaves the citrus behind, while the more exotic/woodsy notes remain.</li>
            <li>Long lasting staying power &amp; sweet &amp; spice wood scent makes this a keeper.</li>
            <li>Bvlgari does it yet again with this complex bend of spice, woodsy tones and smooth undernotes of musk.</li>
            <li>but I got a strong citrus note that dried down into an earthy smell.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A lot of people love the smell of the product whenever I wear it</li>
            <li> Best Cologne out today!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;The color on the bottle peels off. I imagine the great Italian designers, creating better than what this is.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift twice, and both times my friends got tons of compliments. It is not for guys in twenties, it has a slightly more serious hint, it has a kind of mystical note that women cannot stop analyzing. It is fresh but not sporty, vanilla tone after a few hours but not too sweet. It goes great with a suit as one of my friends wore it to a wedding and got more compliments than a bride:)</li>
            <li> Really love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;This fragance make me feel so good and the color so sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it :3</li>

            <li> Love this fragrance. Came in timely and priced perfect</li>
            <li> Last along time the scent!</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume! In last few years I have tried many perfumes, mainly because I work on a cruise ship and I have a chance to test a lot of stuff as soon as it is out. While I had my favorites, this one just blew them all out of the water. Absolutely great perfume and good for any occasion! Guys, trust me on this one - as cheesy as it sounds, it is true - you won&#x27;t leave ANY lady indifferent when she catches a whiff of this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering 2 this time as I just found out that current price on the ship I&#x27;m on is almost the twice of what it is on Amazon!</li>
            <li> my friend recommend me to buy it , to be honest I don&#x27;t feel that it smell good, I mean its very normal,</li>
            <li> Nice smells but I feel it wears off fast. Not so sure if it&#x27;s the real deal but it looks like it to me.</li>
            <li> too simple aroma and low duration and projection</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy anything else</li>
            <li> Exellent as described, fast shipping , Best fragrance for men, My Husbands favorite</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just in time for Christmas!</li>
            <li> A bit more of a spicy fragrance than you ordinarily find with a Bvlgari scent. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s slightly more akin to something you&#x27;d expect from Varvatos. It&#x27;s an addition to the main Aqva fragrance, which I prefer. More citrusy than either Aqva Marine or the original Aqva. It has a fairly rapid dry down that leaves the citrus behind, while the more exotic/woodsy notes remain. At least on my skin. Quite nice, but the original Aqva fragrance is still the flagship of the Bvlgari line, in my opinion. It&#x27;s been getting some attention as a possible unisex fragrance, even though it&#x27;s not marketed that way. In closing, I&#x27;d call it a great new addition to the Aqva line, without overtaking the original in terms of overall desirability and longevity.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Bvlgari cologne, I added this to my collection! I also recommend Bvlgari Agva, both are very great fragrances</li>
            <li> I really like this new scent added to the Aqva line from Bvlgary. Even when my favorite is the original Aqva scent, this new one is a nice variation into this line.&lt;br /&gt;I would like tho thanks the seller &#x27;365 Beauty&#x27;, for such an extraordinary service. My Order was placed last Friday, May 2nd, Shipped  in less than one hour (from a different state), and today Monday, May 5th, the package was (brand new sealed just as described) at my door in the afternoon. Fastest shipment EVER received...! Congratulations!</li>
            <li> An absolutely wonderful Spring/Summer scent. It lasts forever and has enough of a citrus kick to enegize me emotionally.</li>
            <li> Very nice, wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Just bought this for my husband, i absolutely love it!!!  im glad it still smells as good as it did when i found it in a magazine</li>
            <li> The seller of my purchase was DiscountPerfumes (and Fulfilled By Amazon). The sent product was legitimate and real. I wanted to point that out as reference for future customers who are looking to purchase the Aqva Amara cologne and are choosing between sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the cologne itself, the scent is fairly unique and I&#x27;ve not smelled anything like it before. I&#x27;m no expert on colognes but I got a strong citrus note that dried down into an earthy smell. Though I wouldn&#x27;t rate this the best of the colognes that I&#x27;ve used, given that I enjoy the scent and the scent has gotten me some compliments, I would rank this a solid purchase.</li>
