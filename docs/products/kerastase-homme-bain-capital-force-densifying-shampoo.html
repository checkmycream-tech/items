            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>I should have known with all the people mentioning the smell, but all of the reviews said the smell was good . . .</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>While it is great shampoo (my hair is noticeably thicker, softer, and just better)</li>
            <li>smelled great and seemed more dense.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling cleaned, light and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>(Not overpowering, just really nice.  </li>

            <li>Great stuff; worth it.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the you could find in Europe but pretty good too.</li>

            <li>love the way it makes my scalp feel, I love the way it smells, and I love the way it makes my hair feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 4 months now and my family has noticed thicker and fuller hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like opening a magazine to a cologne ad and wiping the page all over my head.  </li>
            <li>Hold fragile hair perfectly!</li>
            <li>Just somehow more volume.</li>
            <li>My hair looks fantastic with it!</li>
            <li>and I do love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Literally it feels thicker and more luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and clean every day, and the stuff smells awesome.</li>
            <li>husband has tried so many kinds of specially formulated shampoos for hair retention, recovering from hair loss, and hair thickening over the years</li>
            <li>If this buys me an extra month of hair, combined with how it makes my hair feel, I think it is a win.</li>
            <li>However after 1 month, it changed and now my hair looks more powerful and shiny.</li>
            <li>Has a good masculine smell too.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I knew this product was well worth it, when my barber told me that my hair appeared thicker.</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t it is worth the buy. . .</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>I really like it because it&#x27;s not only made him happy about his hair, but it smells fabulous-like a cedar-y high end fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Read a few reviews of how good the product was and it fits true to form.</li>
            <li>Very man-scented; my fiancee loves it!</li>
            <li>I only used it couple times and already helped the perception of more hair with increased \\&quot;volume\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Very high end</li>
            <li>I could tell within a couple days how much nicer my hair felt.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t justify spending this much money on any shampoo (unless it was a gallon...)</li>
            <li>It actually felt CLEAN</li>
            <li>While the price is quite high for shampoo, you really are paying for quality.</li>
            <li>From glancing at him, he has a full head of hair and has even noticed regrowth of tiny hairs around his forehead line.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The merchandise is highly recommendable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much in the way of improvement as far as hair thickness in that time,</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical of the product before my purchase, but it is very effective.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and cannot use &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; shampoos.  </li>
            <li>but I did notice that the labeling on the back does not include any GR (English) language and does not have the familiar Laurel USA logo.</li>
            <li>Also, as said by many to use only little of it, which doesn&#x27;t not suffice for wash...</li>
            <li>You actually don&#x27;t even need to use much for each application too.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell whether I get new hair growth or not; either way, this is a 5 star shampoo.</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference between this stuff and the common store-bought goop.</li>
            <li>The price is a little bit expensive but it works great</li>
            <li>though I know it&#x27;s probably not long enough to see if the claims are true.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.  Nice scent.  Pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about two years. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After years of trying shampoo/conditioners from the local drug store I was finally convinced by my hair stylist to \\&quot;quit using that crap and spend the money on something good for your hair/scalp\\&quot;.  I could tell within a couple days how much nicer my hair felt.  It actually felt CLEAN - like there was no residue or heavy moisturizing left over. I don&#x27;t even use conditioner now, just this shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling cleaned, light and smelling great.  You actually don&#x27;t even need to use much for each application too. About a quater doller size in the palm of your hand.  I&#x27;m not sure if it has any effect on thinning of hair but if it does then bonus.</li>
            <li> Read a few reviews of how good the product was and it fits true to form. Great smell, feels great and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a version for the USA of a very good shampoo to minimize hair loss. Not as good as the you could find in Europe but pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Great product.Leaves hair and scalp feeling great.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look thicker and feel like a million bucks. Only time will tell whether I get new hair growth or not; either way, this is a 5 star shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I was a bit skeptical of the product before my purchase, but it is very effective. While the price is quite high for shampoo, you really are paying for quality. I knew this product was well worth it, when my barber told me that my hair appeared thicker. I recommend it and have even purchased it as a gift for friends.</li>
            <li> this is a little expensive for a guy&#x27;s hair... While it is great shampoo (my hair is noticeably thicker, softer, and just better) this is not a big bottle. I can&#x27;t justify spending this much money on any shampoo (unless it was a gallon...) but if you have spare change, this is a great product. You will notice a gigantic difference between this and the $3 dollar bottle you get at the grocery store. Seriously, I have short hair and I could tell that it was healthier after using this product.</li>
            <li> Chegou perfeito... Recomendo</li>
            <li> LOTS BETTER THAN THE JUNK MY HUSBAND WAS USING.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculously expensive, takes forever to arrive, and the bottle is super small.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I will be buying it forever!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my scalp feel, I love the way it smells, and I love the way it makes my hair feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and my barber have mentioned that my hair feels fuller and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well it helps my hair grow or if it helps my receding hairline slow its inevitable retreat. Even if it doesn&#x27;t it is worth the buy. . . I am holding out for a cure for balding and thin hair before my line goes to far back. If this buys me an extra month of hair, combined with how it makes my hair feel, I think it is a win.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased Kerastase Captial Force for men from Angelas Beauty Supply. My wife buys this from salon all the time. I thought I would save some money. I still think I am but I did notice that the labeling on the back does not include any GR (English) language and does not have the familiar Laurel USA logo. It smells like my other and feels like it. Just wanted someone to know.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff every day. Nobody makes hair products like Kerastase. There is a huge difference between this stuff and the common store-bought goop. Totally worth the price. Hair feels soft and clean every day, and the stuff smells awesome. Very man-scented; my fiancee loves it! With short hair, one bottle of this will last months - you just need a small drop per use. Great stuff; worth it. Also recommend the green bottle (anti-oily) as well, for oilier hair. I think that one smells better too, but the densifying works best for my hair. Hope this helps - cheers!</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo. I have been using it for 4 months now and my family has noticed thicker and fuller hair on top of my head. My hair stopped falling also so to me it did what it is designed for. My wife likes the smell of it but I think it smells a little like medicine, not bad but not a great smelling shampoo either. A bottle lasts me a little two months and I wash my hair everyday so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I want to add is this: If you purchase from Lothmann-Paris, be advised the product will actually be coming from France and may take a while. It&#x27;s worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> Great men&#x27;s shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair fall out like a lot of other national brands. Has a good masculine smell too.</li>
            <li> I should have known with all the people mentioning the smell, but all of the reviews said the smell was good . . . to me it&#x27;s more like opening a magazine to a cologne ad and wiping the page all over my head.  I guess some people like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used this stuff for about 2 weeks before I had to give it up so my girlfriend wouldn&#x27;t grimace every time she smelled my hair.  I didn&#x27;t notice much in the way of improvement as far as hair thickness in that time, though I know it&#x27;s probably not long enough to see if the claims are true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, not for me.</li>
            <li> Hold fragile hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> I only used it couple times and already helped the perception of more hair with increased \\&quot;volume\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think the hair follicles was denser though.  Just somehow more volume.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo as a gift and it was touted as the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34;  I was skeptical, but now I have to have it!  It is great stuff.  My hair looks fantastic with it!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and cannot use &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; shampoos.  I think a lot of people who have dandruff are actually just having effects from shampoos with lots of strange chemicals.  If you have neither of those issues, then I suggest you pamper yourself with this product.  It is volumizing and the scent is terrific.  I have never gone wrong with  Kerastase product.</li>
            <li> The price is a little bit expensive but it works great and I do love it.&lt;br /&gt;The merchandise is highly recommendable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has tried so many kinds of specially formulated shampoos for hair retention, recovering from hair loss, and hair thickening over the years I can&#x27;t count all the half empty bottles in the cabinet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was different.  He had a little sample from a hotel on our recent trip to Canada in his travel bag and finally tried it a couple of weeks ago.  Instantly I noticed his hair was thicker looking, fluffier, smelled great and seemed more dense.  Literally in one use!  I got him to order a bottle and he&#x27;s been using it a few weeks now and I&#x27;m not sure what the actual formula is, but this shampoo makes his hair look like it did ten years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally it feels thicker and more luxurious.  From glancing at him, he has a full head of hair and has even noticed regrowth of tiny hairs around his forehead line.  I really like it because it&#x27;s not only made him happy about his hair, but it smells fabulous-like a cedar-y high end fragrance.  (Not overpowering, just really nice.  Not your usual &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; smell.  Very high end kinda good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His hair has never looked better and I&#x27;m so glad he tried it!</li>
            <li> You must be patient. When a few use, the product made my hair dry and dull. However after 1 month, it changed and now my hair looks more powerful and shiny. Good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo after looking at the comments but this shampoo makes the hair very very dry... Also, as said by many to use only little of it, which doesn&#x27;t not suffice for wash...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst shampoo till dateI have used....NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo. It conditions his unruly grey hair without making it greasy.  Easier to style afterwards without additional products.</li>
