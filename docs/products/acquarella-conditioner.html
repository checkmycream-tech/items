    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best nail polish and no odors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Acquarella.</li>
            <li>Great job Acquarella!</li>
            <li>To remove this conditioner, I use Acquarella&#x27;s remover which works best if you saturate the cotton + let it soak on the nail for about a minute before rubbing.    </li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>You do need to use Acquarella Remover; however, the remover is also an awesome product - no smell!!</li>
            <li>This product was great!</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful product and had a beautiful shine and could be used as a nail polish by itself.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is shiny, good for my nails, and best of all...vegan!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Went on great and nails felt great afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I bought this system because I was looking for an organic/natural nail polish product, and I am so happy with it</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and safe.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that it does not trigger contact dermatitis or cause nail pitting like the drug store stuff, so I&#x27;m excited about that!</li>
            <li>Like their nail polish I have used, this conditioner smells pleasant and there is no chemical smell at all.</li>
            <li>I have tried every product, and I loved the acquarella conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Had I known how good this stuff is</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and the results are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY love the conditioner!  </li>
            <li>This review is for the Acquarella Conditioner - I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Pretty great stuff, I just wish it was easier to get off!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks great.</li>
            <li>that after using the remover it helps to soak my nails in warm water and use an orange stick to scrape off the rest of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>After buffing nails it gave a nice finish when used alone and stayed on well.</li>
            <li>my pleasant surprise, it has been worth the money 100%.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the Acquarella polish because it is the most non-toxic polish on the market today.  </li>
            <li>This is what I wear most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Because it is water based, it lasts at most 2 weeks, but the safety factor overweighs that in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product.</li>
            <li>but nevertheless, I am still very happy with this product and am so glad that it hasn&#x27;t worn off though I have not been taking any extra precautions to keep it from chipping.</li>
            <li>Using their entire system from buffing to polishing, my nails look healthy and great!</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most nail polishes, NO reaction to this one.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li>it never seems to stay on for more than a couple days.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to have to take the time to file my fingernails more than once</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails, but the smell irritates me quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>The product conditions nails and gives nails a shiny healthy look.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Much more of the polish stayed on.</li>
            <li>It was okay for some of the polish to peel off, though, since I was about to remove it for reapplication</li>
            <li>I decided that it must be a pretty good product based on the reviews I was reading</li>
            <li>The colored one has been on my toes for three weeks without chipping and now I&#x27;m using the clear on my fingernails and it works great.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something free of chemicals and safe for her.  </li>
            <li>The polish dries very quickly and after a week of working in the yard and in the kitchen I had NO chips.  </li>
            <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t stay on your nails, it peels off easily.</li>
            <li>Ideal for dry or brittle nails, Acquarella Conditioner applies like any nail polish and creates an ultra chic sheen.</li>
            <li>water based and odor free.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.  </li>
            <li>Polish went on smoothly after I used this product.  </li>
            <li>There was no smell and it gave my nails a fabulous gloss.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner dries quickly, making it incredibly easy to use anywhere and anytime.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product, and it seems that water-based polishes create a smooth finish more easily than conventional polishes, which I</li>
            <li>Acquarella&#x27;s nail conditioner applies evenly, leaves a lovely shine and lasts pretty well</li>
            <li>Like almost a full month now, and it makes my nails feel soft and look healthy!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, very glossy and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>This clear polish is amazing though.</li>
            <li>I prefer traditional colors in the creme opaque and translucent colors, and all of these are gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I received them, I read the instructions on every product completely, followed all the instructions exactly, and I now always sport a gorgeous pedicure.  </li>
            <li>I very rarely write a review on a product, but this one is worth taking the time to do so.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t peel off it just wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors come off easily when using the remover exactly as directed, the polishes apply easily &amp; quickly because of the good brushes &amp; polish consistency, and dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>I wear the conditioner as polish sometimes; it&#x27;s a very pretty pinkinsh-clear color that never clashes with my clothes.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and shiny but even when applied according to instructions (pre-application of Acquarella remover, etc.)</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be returning for more purchases from Acquarella!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but the remover requirements make it more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It looked really nice and it lasted for several months</li>
            <li>Nice for those who are allergic to regular polish.  </li>
            <li>But Acquarella is a darn good compromise for someone like me who still wants to be somewhat glamorous but stay away from chemical exposure at the same time.  </li>
            <li>When I washed my hair, a lot of the polish peeled right off.</li>
            <li>This works fine for me, since many non-allergic polishes don&#x27;t stay on very long.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on as long, but it looks nice.  </li>
            <li>You can go through a lot of remover quickly to get this product off of your nails when you are ready to put on color.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is great to put on the naked nail for a pretty shine or over a different aquarella color to seal.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get nail polish to last; it often peels off w/in a day of application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy also Prissy and Brave.  </li>
            <li>Does not have the staying power of some more traditional nail polishes, but</li>
            <li>Still better than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking to cut out the chemicals and toxins from regular polish, this is a fantastic option!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I applied this conditioner, I wore it for about 12 hours before showering.</li>
            <li>As other reviews say there is almost no odor and nice looks.</li>
            <li>the most natural nail polish on the market (as natural as painting colors on your nails can be, hah).  </li>
            <li>I avoid certain oily products.</li>
            <li>The conditioner looks really nice when dry, like a shiny clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>I really like the Acquarella products.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>I did the whole routine, with the buffer and everything.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me, or my nails. . .</li>
            <li>Does what it says and works very well with added peace of mind that there are no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>If you have a reaction to acrylic nails you will not be able to use this product or any other nail polish on the market today.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I imagine residue from those other more toxic nail polishes offers some resistance to this nail polish&#x27;s adherence.</li>
            <li>This nail polish has minimal toxic smell, and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I love nail art and polish in general so this was a serious blow to my girl fun.  </li>
            <li>No smell, easy to apply, long lasting.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner puts a nice gloss on the nails with a very slight white tint.  </li>
            <li>I hope Acquarella improves its longevity or creates a clear polish that I can use instead!</li>
            <li>There is no odor, it is easy to apply, and it is strong, unlike other hypo-allergenic polishes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t usually use polish on my fingernails, I use a simple two-sided nail buffer &amp; shine block on my fingernails--anything more &amp; my nails grow too fast</li>
            <li>I started a stash envelope and saved up enough to get the conditioner, large remover, and &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; buffing kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This nail conditioner is shimmery, not a plain clear polish.</li>
            <li>It works as a clear polish, as well.    </li>
            <li>, clear polish makes them look healthier.</li>
            <li>The conditioner can be used as a clear polish by itself.  </li>
            <li>You can also use it as a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>This product is to be used as part of the Acquarella system, and also can be worn in lieu of the Acuarella nail polishes as a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>I often use the Conditioner alone, like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Can be used as a clear nail polish by itself.</li>
            <li>I also have Acquarella in color Prissy, and really love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a clear polish addict for years since acrylic nails ruined my natural nails</li>
            <li>I have been allergic to nailpolish since I was 18 years old.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for a natural polish, go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>But when I switched to a non-castile natural liquid soap, no problems in this area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only advice is to follow the instructions carefully, especially if you are switching immediately over from traditional polish.toxins from regular polish, this is a fantastic option!</li>
            <li>after a few weeks using the conditioner and only these nail polishes, the stay gets better.  </li>
            <li>I hope to encourage other ladies like me who are looking for safe nail polish alternatives due to health issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only other quirk that I&#x27;ve noticed is that natural castile bar soap will definitely take the shine off this polish quickly!</li>
            <li>It is so much better than any other nail polish products I have ever used, conventional or otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Works as a nice shiny gloss alone, or under the aquarella polishes as a smooth base.</li>
            <li>So far I have not experienced any chipping of the top coat for both my fingernails and toe nails.</li>
            <li>However, the little bit of work to get the polish off was totally worth how they held up</li>
            <li>This looks white in the bottle but dries on clear.  </li>
            <li>After finding out what&#x27;s in traditional polish I started looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li>The polishes dry quickly and wear extremely well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had one professional manicure last</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but after a few weeks, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nails any more, it peeled off almost as soon as it dried, and my nails got so brittle that they all broke off.</li>
            <li>think that waiting as long as possible before subjecting the nails to rough activities (like shampooing) is really helpful.</li>
            <li>And because it&#x27;s clear, it&#x27;s hard to tell if you really have gotten it all off.  </li>

            <li> I did the whole routine, with the buffer and everything.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me, or my nails. . .</li>
            <li> Does what it says and works very well with added peace of mind that there are no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> If you have a reaction to acrylic nails you will not be able to use this product or any other nail polish on the market today.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I imagine residue from those other more toxic nail polishes offers some resistance to this nail polish&#x27;s adherence.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has minimal toxic smell, and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I love nail art and polish in general so this was a serious blow to my girl fun.  </li>
            <li> No smell, easy to apply, long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner puts a nice gloss on the nails with a very slight white tint.  </li>
            <li> I hope Acquarella improves its longevity or creates a clear polish that I can use instead!</li>
            <li> There is no odor, it is easy to apply, and it is strong, unlike other hypo-allergenic polishes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t usually use polish on my fingernails, I use a simple two-sided nail buffer &amp; shine block on my fingernails--anything more &amp; my nails grow too fast</li>
            <li> I started a stash envelope and saved up enough to get the conditioner, large remover, and &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; buffing kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This nail conditioner is shimmery, not a plain clear polish.</li>
            <li> It works as a clear polish, as well.    </li>
            <li> , clear polish makes them look healthier.</li>
            <li> The conditioner can be used as a clear polish by itself.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it as a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> This product is to be used as part of the Acquarella system, and also can be worn in lieu of the Acuarella nail polishes as a clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> I often use the Conditioner alone, like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Can be used as a clear nail polish by itself.</li>
            <li> I also have Acquarella in color Prissy, and really love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a clear polish addict for years since acrylic nails ruined my natural nails</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to nailpolish since I was 18 years old.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for a natural polish, go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> But when I switched to a non-castile natural liquid soap, no problems in this area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only advice is to follow the instructions carefully, especially if you are switching immediately over from traditional polish.toxins from regular polish, this is a fantastic option!</li>
            <li> after a few weeks using the conditioner and only these nail polishes, the stay gets better.  </li>
            <li> I hope to encourage other ladies like me who are looking for safe nail polish alternatives due to health issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only other quirk that I&#x27;ve noticed is that natural castile bar soap will definitely take the shine off this polish quickly!</li>
            <li> It is so much better than any other nail polish products I have ever used, conventional or otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Works as a nice shiny gloss alone, or under the aquarella polishes as a smooth base.</li>
            <li> So far I have not experienced any chipping of the top coat for both my fingernails and toe nails.</li>
            <li> However, the little bit of work to get the polish off was totally worth how they held up</li>
            <li> This looks white in the bottle but dries on clear.  </li>
            <li> After finding out what&#x27;s in traditional polish I started looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> The polishes dry quickly and wear extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one professional manicure last</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but after a few weeks, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nails any more, it peeled off almost as soon as it dried, and my nails got so brittle that they all broke off.</li>
            <li> think that waiting as long as possible before subjecting the nails to rough activities (like shampooing) is really helpful.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s clear, it&#x27;s hard to tell if you really have gotten it all off.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that as your nails grow out or just from daily wear and tear, the conditioner/polish will start to chip and the \\&quot;remover\\&quot; will not completely remove it.  </li>
            <li> Another big plus: these products don&#x27;t seem to dry out my nails at all.</li>
            <li> It is clear and has a little shine----no color.  </li>
            <li> I had read prior reviews about not letting your nails get wet immediately after, so</li>
            <li> Then is takes sooooo long to remove!</li>
            <li> Then after it was dry, I used my water based acrylic art paint to do my design like I always do.</li>
            <li> I followed the included instructions and put on the first thin coat of conditioner.</li>
            <li> (takes about a minute) and then paint on two thin coats of the clear, let it dry, go to bed and it lasts as long as any traditional polish.</li>
            <li> It  is hard to see if it&#x27;s chipping because it&#x27;s clear, but the protection of the nails is gone in the chipped places.</li>
            <li> and I only have minor tip wear and a small chip on my ring finger as you can see in my photo.</li>
            <li> Lasts about a week, depending on how rough you are on your hands.</li>
            <li> I followed all directions, took of prior polish, buffed my nails, rinsed and dried thoroughly before applying.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I can apply another thin coat w/o much build up.    </li>
            <li> Regular polish is too harsh - makes my skin peel and my nails split.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base coat and top coat for my acquarella nail polish and decided to write a review only after a week of using it.</li>
            <li> It only has a very slight glue like smell when applying it.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that these products require quite a bit of Acquarella remover to remove the polish and these products are not easily found.</li>
            <li> I had read bad reviews on the Acquarella nail polish remover, so I purchased a different more natural brand and unfortunately that hasn&#x27;t arrived yet in the mail yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested in using any other nail polish product of any type, organic or otherwise.  </li>
            <li> have an autoimmune problem and found out that I&#x27;m allergic to benzenes and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> , I would have abandoned conventional nail polish years ago even before I started using all organic beauty &amp; household products.</li>
            <li> I used this as a base coat and top coat with \\&quot;plasma\\&quot; worked well for my toe nails.</li>
            <li> After about half an hour of scrubbing it still does not come off all the way.</li>
            <li> This is OK if you keep applying the base coat because it will hide the uneven nail surface to some degree,  but looks messy if you want to discontinue the products.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to get off though.  </li>
            <li> But again, I don&#x27;t want to buff my already thin and weak nails too much.</li>
            <li> I saw my nail being hydrated and shiny in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to fill in my nail ridges without exposing me to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> They had dulled a little but the polish did not come off!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint with Acquarella Conditioner is that it is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off + any wear or scratches are hard to see.</li>
            <li> Then after that dried, I repeated another thin layer of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> But the shimmer is fairly subtle.</li>
            <li> I think the solution would be is to invest in one of those little shots that they use to soak the fake nails off.</li>
            <li> This is worse than the polish.</li>
            <li> it was an expensive one.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems to have caused my nails to peel!</li>
            <li> I had to use the bad stuff (Acetone)</li>
            <li> Fail!!</li>
            <li> It conditions the nail, and provides a base for the nail polish.  </li>
            <li> When applying it per the directions it will build up a base coat on the nail so that the colored polish will adhere.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The best nail polish and no odors. The only product I can use because it&amp;#34;s water based and odor free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as recommended in conjunction with the Acquarella nail polish. It works as a clear polish, as well.    The best thing about it is that it does not trigger contact dermatitis or cause nail pitting like the drug store stuff, so I&#x27;m excited about that!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It conditions the nail, and provides a base for the nail polish.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the Acquarella polish because it is the most non-toxic polish on the market today.  The conditioner puts a nice gloss on the nails with a very slight white tint.  This is what I wear most of the time.  Because it is water based, it lasts at most 2 weeks, but the safety factor overweighs that in my opinion.  It is easy to apply and looks great.</li>
            <li> Like their nail polish I have used, this conditioner smells pleasant and there is no chemical smell at all. It protects &amp; nourishes my nail. I saw my nail being hydrated and shiny in just a few days. I use it as a coating on their nail polish as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, very glossy and easy to take off. Lasts about a week, depending on how rough you are on your hands.</li>
            <li> I bought Acquarella Conditioner to use to condition my nails before painting them with Acquarella Nail Polish. The conditioner looks really nice when dry, like a shiny clear nail polish. It only has a very slight glue like smell when applying it. I think the conditioning process helped to make the nail polish stay on my nails, since the colored polish lasted for a week on my fingernails. My only complaint with Acquarella Conditioner is that it is difficult to remove. I pre-soak all my nails with Acquarella Remover and then use lots of remover on each nail, so it gets bubbly. After about half an hour of scrubbing it still does not come off all the way. I finally figured out that after using the remover it helps to soak my nails in warm water and use an orange stick to scrape off the rest of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from a nail polish that contained none of the awful chemicals found in most nail polishes.  I ABSOLUTELY love the conditioner!  I followed all directions, took of prior polish, buffed my nails, rinsed and dried thoroughly before applying.  I had read prior reviews about not letting your nails get wet immediately after, so I polished at night.  I followed these instructions, however I did not read anything about this \\&quot;rule\\&quot; on the Conditioner container.  The polish dries very quickly and after a week of working in the yard and in the kitchen I had NO chips.  They had dulled a little but the polish did not come off!  It was a little tricky to get off though.  I had read bad reviews on the Acquarella nail polish remover, so I purchased a different more natural brand and unfortunately that hasn&#x27;t arrived yet in the mail yet.  I had to use the bad stuff (Acetone) and it took a bit of time to get it off.  However, the little bit of work to get the polish off was totally worth how they held up and I will definitely be returning for more purchases from Acquarella!  I think I have just found my exclusive nail polish brand!!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product. As other reviews say there is almost no odor and nice looks. However, the polish lasted about 5 days. It  is hard to see if it&#x27;s chipping because it&#x27;s clear, but the protection of the nails is gone in the chipped places. Then is takes sooooo long to remove! I think the solution would be is to invest in one of those little shots that they use to soak the fake nails off. I just still have no time to sit and soak and spend like 40 minutes trying to take it off. May be they want you to buff off the remains? But again, I don&#x27;t want to buff my already thin and weak nails too much. So if you have time and patience to spend about 40 min every 5 days, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also have Acquarella in color Prissy, and really love it. This clear polish is amazing though. I&#x27;ve been a clear polish addict for years since acrylic nails ruined my natural nails, clear polish makes them look healthier. After finding out what&#x27;s in traditional polish I started looking for a natural alternative. I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Acquarella. The colored one has been on my toes for three weeks without chipping and now I&#x27;m using the clear on my fingernails and it works great. I follow the directions and do the buffing and use the remover to prime my nails (takes about a minute) and then paint on two thin coats of the clear, let it dry, go to bed and it lasts as long as any traditional polish.</li>
            <li> Works as a nice shiny gloss alone, or under the aquarella polishes as a smooth base. I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I use this as a base coat and top coat for my acquarella nail polish and decided to write a review only after a week of using it. So far I have not experienced any chipping of the top coat for both my fingernails and toe nails. However, though my toe nails are still glossy looking, the shine has reduced on my fingernails. I attribute that to things like doing the dishes without gloves etc. but nevertheless, I am still very happy with this product and am so glad that it hasn&#x27;t worn off though I have not been taking any extra precautions to keep it from chipping. Will def. buy it again once I run out of my current bottle!</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to nailpolish since I was 18 years old.  I can wear it on my toes, but if I put it on my hands I will get a rash anyplace on my face that my hands touch.  I have tried every product, and I loved the acquarella conditioner.  It is clear and has a little shine----no color.  This works fine for me, since many non-allergic polishes don&#x27;t stay on very long.  I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is shiny, good for my nails, and best of all...vegan! I wear the conditioner as polish sometimes; it&#x27;s a very pretty pinkinsh-clear color that never clashes with my clothes. Great job Acquarella!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get nail polish to last; it often peels off w/in a day of application. I&#x27;ve only had one professional manicure last + it was an expensive one.    Acquarella&#x27;s nail conditioner applies evenly, leaves a lovely shine and lasts pretty well I avoid certain oily products. It doesn&#x27;t peel off + any wear or scratches are hard to see. Plus, I can apply another thin coat w/o much build up.    To remove this conditioner, I use Acquarella&#x27;s remover which works best if you saturate the cotton + let it soak on the nail for about a minute before rubbing.    Another big plus: these products don&#x27;t seem to dry out my nails at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.  No smell, easy to apply, long lasting.  Compliments colored polish well.</li>
            <li> This is worse than the polish. I threw out about $75 on these products and I had to have my manicure done twice in a nail salon.It deserves no stars.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Acquarella Conditioner - I LOVE it! Following their directions to apply, it stays on and on and on... I use the conditioner for my \\&quot;polish\\&quot; on my fingernails as I don&#x27;t like colored nails. Using their entire system from buffing to polishing, my nails look healthy and great! There is no odor, it is easy to apply, and it is strong, unlike other hypo-allergenic polishes I have used in the past. I am allergic to most nail polishes, NO reaction to this one.</li>
            <li> The conditioner can be used as a clear polish by itself.  When applying it per the directions it will build up a base coat on the nail so that the colored polish will adhere.  The problem is that as your nails grow out or just from daily wear and tear, the conditioner/polish will start to chip and the \\&quot;remover\\&quot; will not completely remove it.  This is OK if you keep applying the base coat because it will hide the uneven nail surface to some degree,  but looks messy if you want to discontinue the products. Regular nail polish remover won&#x27;t remove it either.  It has to grow out or wear off.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I cannot use regular polish because I react to it.  No problems with this whatsoever.  Goes on smooth and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful product and had a beautiful shine and could be used as a nail polish by itself.  The only problem; I was allergic to it.  I finally realized it is the acetate component in nail polish that I am allergic to.  If you have a reaction to acrylic nails you will not be able to use this product or any other nail polish on the market today.</li>
            <li> Went on great and nails felt great afterwards.  Polish went on smoothly after I used this product.  I really like the Acquarella products.  The only nail product line that I will use.</li>
            <li> It has stayed on my nails forever! Like almost a full month now, and it makes my nails feel soft and look healthy!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and shiny but even when applied according to instructions (pre-application of Acquarella remover, etc.) it never seems to stay on for more than a couple days. It doesn&#x27;t peel off it just wears off quickly. I hope Acquarella improves its longevity or creates a clear polish that I can use instead!</li>
            <li> I used this under a colored nail polish by Acquarella also. It worked really well. You can also use it as a clear nail polish. I bought this to use for a wedding. I don&#x27;t wear nail polish year-round, but I wanted to put it on my toenails because I was wearing sandals. It looked really nice and it lasted for several months and I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times.  I did the whole routine, with the buffer and everything. Very pleased with the results. And I feel safer knowing that it is water-based, and it doesn&#x27;t have all those toxic chemicals in it. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me, or my nails. . .</li>
            <li> This product is to be used as part of the Acquarella system, and also can be worn in lieu of the Acuarella nail polishes as a clear nail polish. I adore this nail polish system:  it&#x27;s easy and the results are beautiful.  As soon as I received them, I read the instructions on every product completely, followed all the instructions exactly, and I now always sport a gorgeous pedicure.  The polishes dry quickly and wear extremely well.  (I don&#x27;t usually use polish on my fingernails, I use a simple two-sided nail buffer &amp; shine block on my fingernails--anything more &amp; my nails grow too fast [I&#x27;m a pianist] and I don&#x27;t want to have to take the time to file my fingernails more than once a week.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire Acquarella system must be purchased and used in order for any &amp; all of the products to work:  1) Buffer Kit, 2) Remover, 3) Conditioner, 4) the nail polishes are optional &amp; you can use just the conditioner as your only polish.  I also bought four of the nail colors: French Kiss, Pink-a-Boo, Plasma, and Aristo--I prefer traditional colors in the creme opaque and translucent colors, and all of these are gorgeous.  I&#x27;m going to buy also Prissy and Brave.  Also, there are no obnoxious smell or fumes in any of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors come off easily when using the remover exactly as directed, the polishes apply easily &amp; quickly because of the good brushes &amp; polish consistency, and dry quickly.  I bought this system because I was looking for an organic/natural nail polish product, and I am so happy with it I&#x27;m not interested in using any other nail polish product of any type, organic or otherwise.  It is so much better than any other nail polish products I have ever used, conventional or otherwise.  Had I known how good this stuff is, I would have abandoned conventional nail polish years ago even before I started using all organic beauty &amp; household products.</li>
            <li> Ideal for dry or brittle nails, Acquarella Conditioner applies like any nail polish and creates an ultra chic sheen. Conditioner dries quickly, making it incredibly easy to use anywhere and anytime. [...].</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails, but the smell irritates me quite a bit.  This nail polish has minimal toxic smell, and goes on smoothly.  Does not have the staying power of some more traditional nail polishes, but after a few weeks using the conditioner and only these nail polishes, the stay gets better.  I imagine residue from those other more toxic nail polishes offers some resistance to this nail polish&#x27;s adherence.</li>
            <li> This looks white in the bottle but dries on clear.  After buffing nails it gave a nice finish when used alone and stayed on well.</li>
            <li> Does what it says and works very well with added peace of mind that there are no harmful chemicals. Love the product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product at all.  it took my manicurist FOREVER to take off my Aquarella nail polishes.  If you&#x27;re going for a natural polish, go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to fill in my nail ridges without exposing me to harsh chemicals. This does that. Unfortunately, it seems to have caused my nails to peel! Fail!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Acquarella since it&#x27;s (from what I know) the most natural nail polish on the market (as natural as painting colors on your nails can be, hah).  This conditioner is great to put on the naked nail for a pretty shine or over a different aquarella color to seal.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product for my granddaughter who loves having her nails done.  I was looking for something free of chemicals and safe for her.  She is five.  This product is excellent and safe.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice for those who are allergic to regular polish.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on as long, but it looks nice.  Regular polish is too harsh - makes my skin peel and my nails split.</li>
            <li> The product conditions nails and gives nails a shiny healthy look.  I often use the Conditioner alone, like clear nail polish.  You do need to use Acquarella Remover; however, the remover is also an awesome product - no smell!!</li>
            <li> I used this as a base coat and top coat with \\&quot;plasma\\&quot; worked well for my toe nails. Can be used as a clear nail polish by itself.</li>
            <li> Pretty great stuff, I just wish it was easier to get off! Still better than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product!! The polish doesn&#x27;t stay on your nails, it peels off easily. Not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely write a review on a product, but this one is worth taking the time to do so. I hope to encourage other ladies like me who are looking for safe nail polish alternatives due to health issues.&lt;br /&gt;I have an autoimmune problem and found out that I&#x27;m allergic to benzenes and other chemicals. I love nail art and polish in general so this was a serious blow to my girl fun.  I went without polish for several months, thinking that I would just have to suck it up and get used to the &amp;#34;au naturel&amp;#34; look.  After doing some online research, I came across Acquarella.  I decided that it must be a pretty good product based on the reviews I was reading BUT the price stopped me in my tracks... (a former $2 nail polish junkie is going to balk at 16 bucks a bottle initially..)  I started a stash envelope and saved up enough to get the conditioner, large remover, and &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; buffing kit.&lt;br /&gt;To my pleasant surprise, it has been worth the money 100%.  No it&#x27;s not indestructible, no it&#x27;s not gel polish, and no you cannot touch up a ding on your car with it. :)  But Acquarella is a darn good compromise for someone like me who still wants to be somewhat glamorous but stay away from chemical exposure at the same time.  I followed the included instructions and put on the first thin coat of conditioner. Then after it was dry, I used my water based acrylic art paint to do my design like I always do. Then after that dried, I repeated another thin layer of the conditioner.  I wore gloves while doing dishes/cleaning and gave my manicure a mid-week third layer of conditioner just to boost the shine. It&#x27;s been 7 days and I only have minor tip wear and a small chip on my ring finger as you can see in my photo. The only other quirk that I&#x27;ve noticed is that natural castile bar soap will definitely take the shine off this polish quickly! But when I switched to a non-castile natural liquid soap, no problems in this area.&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking to cut out the chemicals and toxins from regular polish, this is a fantastic option! My only advice is to follow the instructions carefully, especially if you are switching immediately over from traditional polish.toxins from regular polish, this is a fantastic option!

            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but after a few weeks, it wouldn&#x27;t stay on my nails any more, it peeled off almost as soon as it dried, and my nails got so brittle that they all broke off. I&#x27;ve had to leave polish off for several weeks while the brittle part grew out.</li>
            <li> This nail conditioner is shimmery, not a plain clear polish. But the shimmer is fairly subtle. I don&#x27;t mind it at all. I think this is a good product, and it seems that water-based polishes create a smooth finish more easily than conventional polishes, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied this conditioner, I wore it for about 12 hours before showering. When I washed my hair, a lot of the polish peeled right off. The second time I applied it, I wore it for almost 24 hours before shampooing my hair. Much more of the polish stayed on. It was okay for some of the polish to peel off, though, since I was about to remove it for reapplication anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that waiting as long as possible before subjecting the nails to rough activities (like shampooing) is really helpful. In addition, the polish is supposed to last longer as your nails adjust to the water-based polish.</li>
            <li> This product was great! There was no smell and it gave my nails a fabulous gloss.  The only problem is that these products require quite a bit of Acquarella remover to remove the polish and these products are not easily found. You can&#x27;t just pick them up at the local big drugstore or big box store. You can go through a lot of remover quickly to get this product off of your nails when you are ready to put on color.  And because it&#x27;s clear, it&#x27;s hard to tell if you really have gotten it all off.  It&#x27;s nice but the remover requirements make it more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
