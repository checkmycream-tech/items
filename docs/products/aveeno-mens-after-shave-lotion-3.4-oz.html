            <li>and it still looks fine)</li>
            <li>It makes one&#x27;s face feel smooth.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li>u will notice ur fingers will stop smoothly gliding over ur skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and need something more than your basic after-shave, this works out great!</li>
            <li>Aveeno makes good products at moderate prices.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive shin and this stuff works great with no burn, Leaves face soft.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, soothing, unscented, and as a plus it leaves no greasy residue!</li>
            <li>But, so far, this Aveeno stuff is doing fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely order again!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much in love with it because it the only stuff that works (without a prescription) for my dermatitis after I shave.</li>
            <li>I MUCH prefer to Triderma facial redness repair, Olay beauty cream/spf, and L&#x27;ORÃ‰AL ideal moisture (48 hr sensitive skin), which ALL left my face with an oily sheen.</li>
            <li>The price is ridiculous but the product is a so great that I had to have it.</li>
            <li>I love this aftershave so much that I also use it as a daily moisturizer and it works just as well.</li>
            <li>u will have better matteness and this even holds up in the gym (as long as when u sweat</li>
            <li>Pop a moistened, rolled-up wash cloth in there 5 minutes before I jump in the shower, and it is ready for me when I get out.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not need to put much on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and calming with no fragrance.</li>
            <li>My neck used to be really irritated after shaving, but since I&#x27;ve started using this product, the irritation has noticeably subsided.  </li>
            <li>The aveeno after shave works very well.</li>
            <li>I shave my face/head every other day and as such have a tendency to go through a fair amount of after shave.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t take it too long rubbing it in ur skin as it dries pretty quick and</li>
            <li>(My wifey has a cool washcloth steamer which I also use regularly.</li>
            <li>Of all the lotions I&#x27;ve used this one provides the most protection from post shave burn and seems to cut down on razor burn as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>u can do like me by Adult Acnomel (tinted 10% sulfur cream) and mix in a 1:1 ratio for a 1 pea size amount and apply this to ur whole face, just make sure you use a q-tip or cotton ball to get it out of ur hairline and eyebrows and redness will be hidden</li>
            <li>a little better</li>
            <li>lotion applies quickly and easily with very little &#x27;funk&#x27; left on your hands.</li>
            <li>You may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Humble aftershave that leaves your face smooth and soothed.  </li>
            <li>I like this stuff so far.</li>
            <li>I have no scientific understanding of how oatmeal relates to skin care, but I have been pleasantly surprised by how well this product has worked.  </li>
            <li>but the positives far outweigh it as the oatmeal is what produces the matte finish and acts like an all day oatmeal mask to soothes ur skin)</li>
            <li>And, so far, it hasn&#x27;t plugged up any pores--which is a real complaint I have about most lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>leaves my face, head, and neck, totally baby soft and non-sticky.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I suspect that after using it for a while longer (I&#x27;ve only used it now for just over a week), the irritation will be reduced even more dramatically as that vicious cycle of irritated skin being bumpier and therefore more prone to irritation is broken.  </li>
            <li> But some of us dunderheads have the skin type that gets little white pimples, or black ones from lotions and sun screens.  </li>

            <li> u blot with a paper towl when it starts to roll down ur forehead</li>
            <li> this stuff is thick and is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; after shave for winter, when my face gets really dried out and needs some extra healing and protection, and it does so without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It does leave a little oily type residue.  </li>
            <li> In summer, though, this just feels a little too heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past (e.g., Bump Patrol, etc.), but this one works at least as well as any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Give this product a try as an everyday moisturizer, use in moderation and u won&#x27;t be disappointed...and if u want a tip on hiding redness</li>
            <li> No strong scent so if you want to smell get a cologne to add on.</li>
            <li> I can say that this product settles in the quickest with the least residue.</li>
            <li> Sorry about the plain talk.  </li>
            <li> I not experienced ANY after shave discomfort when using this product.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, when I called Johnson and Johnson, the parent company, the consultant I talked to didn&#x27;t know whether this stuff is non-comedogenic, the fancy Latin words one often finds on tubes and cans of sunscreens.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased the item because of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my face and head outside of the shower, over my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also pre-warm my head and face with hot water before shaving, and apply a steamed wash cloth for approximately 30 to 60 seconds. (My wifey has a cool washcloth steamer which I also use regularly. Pop a moistened, rolled-up wash cloth in there 5 minutes before I jump in the shower, and it is ready for me when I get out.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno Aftershave Lotion is awesome. I use it on my face and head after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it is unscented...literally. No smell whatsoever. (Why purchase expensive cologne - and then use scented shampoos, aftershaves, deodorants, lotions, etc...)?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face, head, and neck, totally baby soft and non-sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it uses many organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price ($7.00 at my local Walgreens, and maybe cheaper at Target, etc...) it is a monster deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This boy is a happy camper, and the wifey loves the way I feel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, and go from there. It is only $7.00. You may be pleasantly surprised. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Humble aftershave that leaves your face smooth and soothed.  Do not need to put much on.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff so far. It makes one&#x27;s face feel smooth. And, so far, it hasn&#x27;t plugged up any pores--which is a real complaint I have about most lotions, etc. I have tried. Unfortunately, when I called Johnson and Johnson, the parent company, the consultant I talked to didn&#x27;t know whether this stuff is non-comedogenic, the fancy Latin words one often finds on tubes and cans of sunscreens. A comedo is a pore with a blackhead, etc. Sorry about the plain talk.  But some of us dunderheads have the skin type that gets little white pimples, or black ones from lotions and sun screens.  I bet more of you than most of us think suffer from this affliction.  But, so far, this Aveeno stuff is doing fine. And one plus: it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance free after shave I have found.  My face feels soothed and refreshed after shaving.  It does leave a little oily type residue.  It is easily washed off.</li>
            <li> Soothes my face very nicely.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I wanted something better then what I was usuing and I like it so when I order again I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Amazon did a great job delivering.</li>
            <li> I shave my face/head every other day and as such have a tendency to go through a fair amount of after shave. After using lotions from Gillette and Nivea I can say that this product settles in the quickest with the least residue. Aveeno after shave also has almost no fragrance which is great when you don&#x27;t want to have a scent. Of all the lotions I&#x27;ve used this one provides the most protection from post shave burn and seems to cut down on razor burn as well.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion applies quickly and easily with very little &#x27;funk&#x27; left on your hands.</li>
            <li> This a great skin freshener and aftershave.  I not experienced ANY after shave discomfort when using this product.  It leaves your face felling smooth and great.  The fact that it is unscented, allows you to apply your cologne fragrance of choice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product would buy again without hesitation</li>
            <li> A very nice aftershave lotion!</li>
            <li> Pretty good after shave... No fragrance and non greasy. Will know better in colder weather if it performs as a moisturizer. Aveeno makes good products at moderate prices.</li>
            <li> The aftershave is the best part of my shave. No irritation afterwards and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> I use before after shave splash. It&#x27;s very soothing and calming with no fragrance. Non-greasy, drys quickly, makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order. I&#x27;ll most likely order again!!!</li>
            <li> I have no scientific understanding of how oatmeal relates to skin care, but I have been pleasantly surprised by how well this product has worked.

I suspect that after using it for a while longer (I&#x27;ve only used it now for just over a week), the irritation will be reduced even more dramatically as that vicious cycle of irritated skin being bumpier and therefore more prone to irritation is broken.  I especially like that the product is fragrance-free because it enables you to use the cologne of your choice without interference from your aftershave.</li>
            <li> Nice light, unscented lotion.  Soothes the face after shaving.  I now prefer it over the other options for after shave lotion.</li>
            <li> The price is ridiculous but the product is a so great that I had to have it. I&#x27;m very much in love with it because it the only stuff that works (without a prescription) for my dermatitis after I shave. A joy to use!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Very gentle, soothing, unscented, and as a plus it leaves no greasy residue! I love this aftershave so much that I also use it as a daily moisturizer and it works just as well. The oatmeal in it calms redness and that, alone, makes it an ideal beauty product. Thank you, Aveeno.</li>
            <li> this is perfect, non oily, sent free and reconditions the skin after shaving.  Just a little dab does your whole face, great stuff and feels great!</li>
            <li> this stuff is thick and is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; after shave for winter, when my face gets really dried out and needs some extra healing and protection, and it does so without causing breakouts. In summer, though, this just feels a little too heavy.</li>
            <li> I am a male with oily skin and my the redness of moderate acne and irritation from shaving sticks out like a sore thumb so I require a lotion that can reduce redness and offer a matte finish without a makeup look (i mean I don&#x27;t want to look like a girl or metro!!! I&#x27;m a man and wanna look like a man just with good skin!!!)  This is very good lotion it reduces redness/ inflammation, dryness, and gives face a nice MATTE FINISH which I like A LOT!!!...I MUCH prefer to Triderma facial redness repair, Olay beauty cream/spf, and L&#x27;ORÃ‰AL ideal moisture (48 hr sensitive skin), which ALL left my face with an oily sheen. Try this product, but ONLY use a pea size amount as too much can feel heavy/cakey (this is due to the oatmeal which is the only negative but the positives far outweigh it as the oatmeal is what produces the matte finish and acts like an all day oatmeal mask to soothes ur skin) also don&#x27;t take it too long rubbing it in ur skin as it dries pretty quick and u will notice ur fingers will stop smoothly gliding over ur skin.  Give this product a try as an everyday moisturizer, use in moderation and u won&#x27;t be disappointed...and if u want a tip on hiding redness a little better u can do like me by Adult Acnomel (tinted 10% sulfur cream) and mix in a 1:1 ratio for a 1 pea size amount and apply this to ur whole face, just make sure you use a q-tip or cotton ball to get it out of ur hairline and eyebrows and redness will be hidden u will have better matteness and this even holds up in the gym (as long as when u sweat u blot with a paper towl when it starts to roll down ur forehead, heck I run on the treadmill for 30 min after lifting an hour and it still looks fine) hope this review helps people out there!!!</li>
            <li> The title says it all. I have sensitive shin and this stuff works great with no burn, Leaves face soft. No strong scent so if you want to smell get a cologne to add on.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!</li>
            <li> The aveeno after shave works very well. I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li> Love the product, but discovered it was $1.50 cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> As advertised, no razor burn!!  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Smells like play-dough, but it goes away once applied. Feels good, without any strong cologne/perfume smell. I have very dry skin and need something more than your basic after-shave, this works out great!</li>
            <li> Great product.Not at all greasy...perfect for any weather</li>
            <li> It works great to control razor burn when I shave my twig and giggle berries</li>
