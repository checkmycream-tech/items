            <li>Drys fast, I would buy again!</li>
            <li>My nail salon uses this brand which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>

            <li>Works really well and dries very fast.</li>
            <li>It is very shinny and dries very fast.</li>
            <li>Within 10-15 minutes of apppling it to my nails, they are pretty much smudge-proof.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the product was packed in a box and bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>Microcote really does dries your nails fast.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails grow so fast and strengthens them too.</li>

            <li>This is my new topcoat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s worth the price and goes a long way!</li>
            <li>My nail tech has been very surprised about the change in the condition of my nails.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve bought at least 5 at different places in past years.</li>
            <li> Duri also is very quick drying and the product is rock hard after only a few minutes, so no smudges.</li>
            <li> seems to last longer and dry faster.</li>
            <li> Usually nail polish stays for 5-7 days, but combined with this product lasts for 3 days only.</li>

            <li> Threw out all my other top &amp; base coats when I tried this.</li>
            <li> This one works so well that I can hardly keep my nails as short as I prefer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> No more hair print/patterns after 2-3 hours of drying before going to bed as with other products.  </li>
            <li> My polish lasts 2 weeks, would probably last longer, but I get bored with the color and like to change every week or two.</li>
            <li> a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I thought when I ordered it , it was for nails that were not healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now not sure what its used for.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because it has done nothing for my nails.  </li>
            <li> Start with the &amp;#34;Rejuvacote Nail Growth&amp;#34; for you base coat.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works really well and dries very fast.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. It actually help my polish from chipping for several days. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Threw out all my other top &amp; base coats when I tried this. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I used to blame my chipped nail polish on the polish, but it was my old top coat. My polish lasts 2 weeks, would probably last longer, but I get bored with the color and like to change every week or two.</li>
            <li> I usually do my own nails and prior to using Miracote I was lucky to have the polish look good for one full week.  After using Miracote, the polish looks good a week in, without any chipping.  Nail polish dries faster and makes smudges and sheet lines a thing of the past.  For the rare occasions that I go to the nail salon, I take this with me and ask the manicurist to use it--it&#x27;s far better than the top coat they use.  Highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s worth the price and goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It works! You have to be patient and diligent to apply the product as prescribed. Your nails WILL be stronger and grow longer. They are not a substitute for acrylic nails, but they will be strong, long, natural nails.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. My nails chipped in one day!</li>
            <li> This dry quick product works!!!! I love it.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my friend, however didn&#x27;t work on my nails. Usually nail polish stays for 5-7 days, but combined with this product lasts for 3 days only.</li>
            <li> Miracote is a fantastic topcoat.  Used in some salons - it&#x27;s that good.  Very durable and quick drying - great to use between maincures to keep your nail finish shiny and protected. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of products, trying to solve my split nails problem. This one works so well that I can hardly keep my nails as short as I prefer. They just keep growing!</li>
            <li> Love this product, fastest drying top coat ever!</li>
            <li> Miracote makes the best base and top coat. Keeps polish on longer and looks shinier</li>
            <li> Great shine and helps nail polish last longer.</li>
            <li> This is similar to the Duri - Brush N Go. It is very shinny and dries very fast. It does not allow my nail polish to chip for 5 - 6 days even with washing dishes and working around the garden. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the product was packed in a box and bubble wrap. The product does what it says. Dries quick and shiny. Like it much better than seche vite</li>
            <li> Microcote really does dries your nails fast. Within 10-15 minutes of apppling it to my nails, they are pretty much smudge-proof. No more hair print/patterns after 2-3 hours of drying before going to bed as with other products.  I&#x27;m going to recommend this product ot everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the rejuvecote by duri. This top coat dries really fast, then every day I put rejuvecote over it and my nail polish last a week or more!</li>
            <li> I thought when I ordered it , it was for nails that were not healthy.  I am disappointed because it has done nothing for my nails.  I&#x27;m now not sure what its used for.</li>
            <li> Not my cup of tea. This product actually peels a lot . Will not order again. Makes my nails dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry just not for me</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I used to use another quick dry top coat that has been well received but had to look for an alternative because it was &#x27;shrinking&#x27; my Manicure each time I used it. This product is very quick drying and it has very little order compared to the other I used to use with began with the letters Sech....  Duri also is very quick drying and the product is rock hard after only a few minutes, so no smudges. Will definitely buy again. This is my new topcoat.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my nails grow so fast and strengthens them too. Especially from winter peeling. I give it as stocking stuffers</li>
            <li> Wife swears by it.  I&#x27;m just a guy who orders what she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve bought at least 5 at different places in past years.</li>
            <li> Drys fast, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Good product, however I prefer Sally Hansens nail hardner ... seems to last longer and dry faster.</li>
            <li> I used to have beautiful nails, then I started getting ridges and the would crack and peel and looked horrible most of the time. I had tried many other solutions and nothing worked, then a co-worker told me about Duri and I gave it a try. Now I have back my beautiful nails, in fact I now have to trim them because they grow to long. Thank you Duri!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very brittle, weak nails, which splits and peels easily.  This product has made my nails stronger.  My nail tech has been very surprised about the change in the condition of my nails.  I love this product and have recommended it to others and bought a bottle for my mom and a girlfriend so they can have healthy nails as well.</li>
            <li> Top quality best on the market</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever!!!  I use it all the time.  Service was fast; have purchased before and will again.</li>
            <li> Love this. This is my second bottle. My nail salon uses this brand which is why I bought it in the first place. When I do my nail myself it days quickly and my polish lasts all week.  Start with the &amp;#34;Rejuvacote Nail Growth&amp;#34; for you base coat. You will not be sorry. Soon your nails will be great.</li>
            <li> Used the product before so knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and protects my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li> MY FIRST ORDER, BUT I&#x27;M SURE IT WON&#x27;T BE MY LAST. i WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH NAILS. i HAVE TOLD MY FRIENDS THEY NEED TO TRY IT!!!!</li>
