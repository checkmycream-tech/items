            <li>Love Love Love this brush!</li>
            <li>Finally the brush looks so nice and  the best price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Also the size of brush is handy, it easy to use and take along .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>the packaging for it did not look authentic either.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly love the way the mineral veil makes my skin look</li>
            <li>Love the way it evenly applies powder</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a bit too pricey and would not recommend paying more than $10 for it.  </li>
            <li>i love this brush.</li>
            <li>but i love how it looks,</li>
            <li>I love the softness of this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush and wish I had more.  </li>
            <li>Just perfect for the final step of the mineral veil.  </li>
            <li>I find that medium to low density at the tips-end of the head is best for mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>Hoping to buy more or them soon.</li>
            <li>Love it...soft and works well</li>
            <li>and I feel like it makes the hydrating mineral veil work better.</li>
            <li>and I like the results better with the intended brush.</li>
            <li>LOVEEEE this brush, more than the brush that can with my original bareminerals purchase!  </li>
            <li>The brush is beautiful but the brush is wayyyy too soft</li>
            <li>Beautifully silky soft,</li>
            <li>Really soft, goes great with my hydrating mineral veil</li>
            <li>Soft and effective - I use it to apply mineral veil from Bare Minerals - great brush!</li>
            <li>The brush also sustains the \\&quot;spiderweb\\&quot; scratches easily.</li>
            <li>Great for the newer Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue products.</li>
            <li>Super cheap at $3!</li>
            <li>best brush, so soft and applies powder seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t fall out, which is the sign of a cheaply made brush.</li>
            <li>good for foundation and the light reflecting Bare Minerals products too</li>
            <li>Nice soft brush!!</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s doing a good job of applying my bare mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>While this brush was designed to be used with the bareMinerals hydrating mineral veil, I use it with the original bareMinerals foundation.</li>
            <li>I bought one to use with the original foundation and another to use with the Radiance product.  </li>
            <li>This brush is used with the special hydrating mineral veil.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>I was using the BE full face brush to apply the veil but saw that this brush is made specifically for the veil.  </li>
            <li>But if you want a nice soft brush for powder, for the price you can not beat.</li>
            <li>Very soft and works well! :-)</li>
            <li>It picks up minimal amounts of powder making it perfect for the final light dusting.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this brush, it is much softer than the brushes sold in stores!</li>
            <li>Love the texture of the bristles - very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very light and fluffy so perfect for the light and fluffy mineral veil.</li>
            <li>It is so soft on your skin, not like so many brushes.</li>
            <li>Really love it its so soft and not only does it feel soft it does a great job as well</li>
            <li>Love this brush, SO soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for my blush and it picks up just the right amount and distributes it evenly over my face.  </li>
            <li>The bristles clean very well, pick up a controllable amount of finishing powder and work to blend well with no hand fatigue.</li>
            <li>Super soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you just powdered your face because it&#x27;s a light coverage brush(not</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li>I love anything Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an aesthetically lovely tool: the cream handle and white bristles are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly and seems like a very sturdy brush.  </li>
            <li>Got the same one on ebay for $6 and free shipping!</li>
            <li>Love it, would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li>I love the white bristles too for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>The strands on my other bare mineral brush were breaking, this is a great replacement.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;brush from Bare Escentuals for 8 years now and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>but I really like only a very light buff of veil and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to grab as much powder as a natural bristle brush does, but it works fine and it doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>The bristles have enough structure and bounce to withstand the buffing motion but are still amazingly silky and soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>I am still struggling with whether there is a point in the Bare Essential Vail...to be honest</li>
            <li>Super soft and silky feel....</li>
            <li>The original Flawless Face Brush was just to stiff and &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; on my sensitive skin and the foundation went on to heavily.  </li>
            <li>Its very soft , grabs right amount of product .</li>
            <li>I really like this brush for mineral veil.</li>
            <li>Really does seem to hydrate and brighten my face.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and reasonable price from the vendor.</li>
            <li>I found this brush on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>and it drys fast...</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t pick up the color very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Blends the tinted moisturizer really well.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>better than expected</li>
            <li>Nice quality would suggest to buy for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I am sure it could be used for the other mineral products also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush but seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to others as go to make up brush and shimmer duster.</li>
            <li>First of all it is very soft even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Brush has high quality bristles -no</li>
            <li>I have only had it a few weeks, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for anything other than a liquid foundation brush yet though, and it seems to work just fine for that.</li>
            <li>A very soft high quality brush.</li>
            <li>Live this brush I use it for my veil</li>
            <li>Nice enough brush, but not as firm as I was hoping it to be.  </li>
            <li>But overall its a good purchase,  but not totally amazing but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are very soft and can tell this is made of quality items.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are very soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the softest makeup brush I have ever felt.</li>
            <li>but its also really soft.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and sturdy in its make.  </li>
            <li>extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and is holding up well as of now.</li>
            <li>The bristols are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>After buffing foundation, blush and highlighter all over my face with my normal kabuki, this Hydrate &amp; Brighten Brush finishes everything without irritating or tiring my skin surface at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subtracted one star because it&#x27;s a shame that the paint used to finish the wood handle gets stained easily.</li>
            <li>Aesthetically pleasing yet small enough to fit into my travel cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>It is the softest of all the Bare Minerals brushes.</li>
            <li>It is eexcellent for the bare mineral make up.</li>
            <li>Recommended for use with Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>Another terrific brush by Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>, however,I am not sure if the product it was made for is worth the 25.00.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to grab as much powder as a natural bristle brush does, but it works fine and it doesn&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> The bristles have enough structure and bounce to withstand the buffing motion but are still amazingly silky and soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> I am still struggling with whether there is a point in the Bare Essential Vail...to be honest</li>
            <li> Super soft and silky feel....</li>
            <li> The original Flawless Face Brush was just to stiff and &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; on my sensitive skin and the foundation went on to heavily.  </li>
            <li> Its very soft , grabs right amount of product .</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for mineral veil.</li>
            <li> Really does seem to hydrate and brighten my face.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and reasonable price from the vendor.</li>
            <li> I found this brush on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> and it drys fast...</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t pick up the color very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Blends the tinted moisturizer really well.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> better than expected</li>
            <li> Nice quality would suggest to buy for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I am sure it could be used for the other mineral products also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush but seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to others as go to make up brush and shimmer duster.</li>
            <li> First of all it is very soft even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Brush has high quality bristles -no</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few weeks, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for anything other than a liquid foundation brush yet though, and it seems to work just fine for that.</li>
            <li> A very soft high quality brush.</li>
            <li> Live this brush I use it for my veil</li>
            <li> Nice enough brush, but not as firm as I was hoping it to be.  </li>
            <li> But overall its a good purchase,  but not totally amazing but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are very soft and can tell this is made of quality items.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are very soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the softest makeup brush I have ever felt.</li>
            <li> but its also really soft.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and sturdy in its make.  </li>
            <li> extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and is holding up well as of now.</li>
            <li> The bristols are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> After buffing foundation, blush and highlighter all over my face with my normal kabuki, this Hydrate &amp; Brighten Brush finishes everything without irritating or tiring my skin surface at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subtracted one star because it&#x27;s a shame that the paint used to finish the wood handle gets stained easily.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically pleasing yet small enough to fit into my travel cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> It is the softest of all the Bare Minerals brushes.</li>
            <li> It is eexcellent for the bare mineral make up.</li>
            <li> Recommended for use with Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> Another terrific brush by Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> , however,I am not sure if the product it was made for is worth the 25.00.</li>
            <li> and it can be used with other products (Not blush...too soft, but can be used for a powder)</li>
            <li> There brushes do last a really long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft, but makes it hard to apply makeup because it&#x27;s not firm.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect the function of the brush but aesthetically my brush looks 2 years old after less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> my other brushes are all from bare minerals, and this one is the softest one I have.</li>
            <li> i know that just shows how bad i am about washing my brushes, but its nice to know i can take my time with this one.</li>
            <li> The silky bristles are fixed strongly, so no any hairs from brush on your face</li>
            <li> the nicest blush brush I&#x27;ve owned in a long time!</li>
            <li> Almost too soft, hard to control.</li>
            <li> The brush is much smaller than I thought it would be, and the bristles aren&#x27;t as dense or fluffy as they are in the picture, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> but I just wish it was a tad bit bigger and fluffy.</li>
            <li> The brush handle has a soft matte texture and the length doesn&#x27;t make it awkward to use: not too short, not too long.</li>
            <li> This brush was just weird, bristles too long and soft</li>
            <li> Price is unbelievable as compared to other sites!</li>
            <li> It was hard to justify paying $18 for a brush.  </li>
            <li> however, once you use it, it fans out the brush, making it hard to apply the foundation.</li>
            <li> Not good for setting powder, blush, bronzer or contouring.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these sellers to other buyers you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The price is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> i know this is dumb</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the BE brushes!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this brush for mineral veil. It is the softest of all the Bare Minerals brushes. Very light and fluffy so perfect for the light and fluffy mineral veil. I am sure it could be used for the other mineral products also but I really like only a very light buff of veil and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Great product for price.  Bristles are very soft and can tell this is made of quality items.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great! Super soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> i ended up using this to apply blush and love it! Does a great job for blending.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush!  It is perfect with the hydrating mineral veil.  Price is unbelievable as compared to other sites!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller thank I thought</li>
            <li> Live this brush I use it for my veil and I love that it is anti microbial !! Wish it came in more sizes !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use for applying the BE mineral veil.  This brush is so soft and nice.  I love it!  Applies the mineral veil beautifully.  I was using the BE full face brush to apply the veil but saw that this brush is made specifically for the veil.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  Really does seem to hydrate and brighten my face.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the BE brushes!  Love them.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush, and I got it for $2...Darn...wish I had bought a dozen!!    It is so soft on your skin, not like so many brushes.</li>
            <li> I did not like this brush.  it did not feel like the brush sold in the stores, and the packaging for it did not look authentic either.  it also sheds.  i think this was a knockoff</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft. It picks up minimal amounts of powder making it perfect for the final light dusting.  It is the best brush I have ever owned, and I have had MANY others ! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are very soft.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to grab as much powder as a natural bristle brush does, but it works fine and it doesn&#x27;t shed.  Fast shipping and reasonable price from the vendor.</li>
            <li> Really love it its so soft and not only does it feel soft it does a great job as well</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush....I am still struggling with whether there is a point in the Bare Essential Vail...to be honest, I do not notice a difference with or without the vail over my make up, I do like this brush and it can be used with other products (Not blush...too soft, but can be used for a powder), however,I am not sure if the product it was made for is worth the 25.00. But if you want a nice soft brush for powder, for the price you can not beat.</li>
            <li> This brush is used with the special hydrating mineral veil. It feels really nice on your skin. I don&#x27;t particularly love the way the mineral veil makes my skin look (it makes it kind of shimmery) but I have nothing against the brush.</li>
            <li> Almost too soft, hard to control. Very soft on the skin and perfect for blending but thats about it. Not good for setting powder, blush, bronzer or contouring. The price is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the softest makeup brush I have ever felt. This hydrating brush was definitely a good investment! I loved it so</li>
            <li> It puts on my makeup flawlessly and evenly. Would highly recommend to others as go to make up brush and shimmer duster.</li>
            <li> Soft and effective - I use it to apply mineral veil from Bare Minerals - great brush!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this brush it was $2, great deal! I ordered 4. I love Bare Escentuals so I got this brush to add to my collection. I haven&#x27;t used it for anything other than a liquid foundation brush yet though, and it seems to work just fine for that. The brush is much smaller than I thought it would be, and the bristles aren&#x27;t as dense or fluffy as they are in the picture, but that&#x27;s alright. All in all I definitely like it for the price but I just wish it was a tad bit bigger and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Got on time and as stated</li>
            <li> Love the way it evenly applies powder</li>
            <li> I found this brush on Amazon for a reasonable price.  It was hard to justify paying $18 for a brush.  I think it&#x27;s a bit too pricey and would not recommend paying more than $10 for it.  It&#x27;s a good brush but seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing and affordable! My makeup is beautiful! Easy to clean and it drys fast... I wish I would have purchased two brushes!</li>
            <li> Great brush, smooth application of my Bareminerals makeup.</li>
            <li> A very soft high quality brush.</li>
            <li> This brush was just weird, bristles too long and soft I just don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s doing a good job of applying my bare mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> i love this brush. i know this is dumb but i love how it looks, the colors and everything. but its also really soft. my other brushes are all from bare minerals, and this one is the softest one I have. Plus, you know when brushes need to get washed they start feeling oily, this one never feels like that. i know that just shows how bad i am about washing my brushes, but its nice to know i can take my time with this one.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush! It is unbelievably soft and although I did have to do quite a bit of searching for it on amazon, it is priced perfectly! It arrived on time and I just love it!</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the bristles - very soft.  Was delivered quickly and seems like a very sturdy brush.  I have loved using it.</li>
            <li> Nice quality would suggest to buy for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Another terrific brush by Bare Minerals. I have purchased several of these and use them with hydrating mineral veil. Recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product &amp; item arrived very quickly. I would definitely recommend these sellers to other buyers you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the softness of this brush.  Very good for blending.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my blush and it picks up just the right amount and distributes it evenly over my face.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and sturdy in its make.  The bristles don&#x27;t fall out, which is the sign of a cheaply made brush. It feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and wish I had more.  good for foundation and the light reflecting Bare Minerals products too</li>
            <li> I have ordered this brush several times as gifts.  It is eexcellent for the bare mineral make up. extremely soft.  Just perfect for the final step of the mineral veil.  price is best I have fund.</li>
            <li> The brush is beautiful but the brush is wayyyy too soft so you can&#x27;t pick up the color very well. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is now the only brush i&#x27;ll be using for both hydrating/reg. mineral veil!!!  Super soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like you just powdered your face because it&#x27;s a light coverage brush(not made for foundation, so don&#x27;t even bother trying it for that).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush! First of all it is very soft even for sensitive skin. The silky bristles are fixed strongly, so no any hairs from brush on your face and  you can wash it so often as you need without loosing texture. Also the size of brush is handy, it easy to use and take along . Finally the brush looks so nice and  the best price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, SO soft. Super cheap at $3!</li>
            <li> I like the brush. It is soft and is holding up well as of now.</li>
            <li> I am hydrated and bright! This brush feels so smooth against your face and sets makeup flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Nice enough brush, but not as firm as I was hoping it to be.  It&#x27;s really soft, but makes it hard to apply makeup because it&#x27;s not firm.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It is very soft, works well - and was a great price! The strands on my other bare mineral brush were breaking, this is a great replacement. I use it for my foundation and mineral veil. I have only had it a few weeks, but so far so good. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very soft and works well! :-)</li>
            <li> The brush handle has a soft matte texture and the length doesn&#x27;t make it awkward to use: not too short, not too long. It&#x27;s an aesthetically lovely tool: the cream handle and white bristles are very pretty. The bristles have enough structure and bounce to withstand the buffing motion but are still amazingly silky and soft. I find that medium to low density at the tips-end of the head is best for mineral makeup. The bristles clean very well, pick up a controllable amount of finishing powder and work to blend well with no hand fatigue. After buffing foundation, blush and highlighter all over my face with my normal kabuki, this Hydrate &amp; Brighten Brush finishes everything without irritating or tiring my skin surface at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subtracted one star because it&#x27;s a shame that the paint used to finish the wood handle gets stained easily. I have stains from foundation and blush on the handle that can&#x27;t be removed. The brush also sustains the \\&quot;spiderweb\\&quot; scratches easily. It doesn&#x27;t affect the function of the brush but aesthetically my brush looks 2 years old after less than 2 months. Fortunately it only cost me $4.50 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This 1 star is for the price. Got the same one on ebay for $6 and free shipping! I use this brush for hydrating powder</li>
            <li> Really soft, goes great with my hydrating mineral veil</li>
            <li> This brings to mind you wouldnt put paint on  your wall with your fingers,would you. Perfect brush for what it is intended.</li>
            <li> Super soft and silky feel....Love Love Love this brush!</li>
            <li> LOVEEEE this brush, more than the brush that can with my original bareminerals purchase!  Hoping to buy more or them soon.</li>
            <li> best brush, so soft and applies powder seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Beautifully silky soft, the nicest blush brush I&#x27;ve owned in a long time! Aesthetically pleasing yet small enough to fit into my travel cosmetic bag. Love it, would definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I love anything Bare Escentuals. The bristols are extremely soft. Great brush to add to my set.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was simple but sturdy. There brushes do last a really long time. Ive had a kabuki&lt;br /&gt;brush from Bare Escentuals for 8 years now and its still going strong. Definitely a good splurge item.</li>
            <li> Great for the newer Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue products. Blends the tinted moisturizer really well. Very happy with this one..</li>
            <li> Brush has high quality bristles -no falling out.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles. Provides a nice finish to my makeup. Recommended for use with Bare Minerals foundation. I like to use this for the Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer.  thanks.</li>
            <li> I like it . Its very soft , grabs right amount of product . I havent washed it yer so we&#x27;ll see how that goes . But overall its a good purchase,  but not totally amazing but gets the job done.  I use it for blush.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this brush, it is much softer than the brushes sold in stores!</li>
            <li> Nice soft brush!! better than expected</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t shed yet, holds powder well, good size</li>
            <li> Love it...soft and works well</li>
            <li> Brush is nicer than what you get with the foundation, as it does not shed bristles..however, once you use it, it fans out the brush, making it hard to apply the foundation.</li>
            <li> While this brush was designed to be used with the bareMinerals hydrating mineral veil, I use it with the original bareMinerals foundation. The original Flawless Face Brush was just to stiff and &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; on my sensitive skin and the foundation went on to heavily.  This brush is perfect for those who want just a light to medium amount of foundation.  The brush also washes up very nicely.  I bought one to use with the original foundation and another to use with the Radiance product.  So far, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Brush feels amazing on my skin and I feel like it makes the hydrating mineral veil work better. I used a dual fiber brush before I got this one and I like the results better with the intended brush. I love the white bristles too for whatever reason.</li>
