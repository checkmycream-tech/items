            <li>It feels good on my belly and helps with the itchy pregnancy skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve figured out a good amount to use now</li>

            <li>Best while pregnant and working out</li>
            <li>This product is more like baby oil!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Cant really say either product worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>Nice oil.</li>
            <li>I can also say that I do not have any stretch marks and will proudly promote this product to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to make sure mommy and daddy bond over the baby belly.</li>
            <li>Great product -- helped me with my first son not get stretch marks &amp; makes your skin stretching not hurt.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I have very, very light stretch marks on the front on my stomach.  </li>
            <li>Very light</li>
            <li>So I have just found out my daughter in law is pregnant and I will be buying her Mothers Friend for her, still good reviews after 25 years....</li>
            <li>Product has a scent, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>and was so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I hope it yields the same wonderful results.</li>
            <li>Use liberally for no stretch marks :)</li>
            <li>And, I lotion myself on top of the Mother&#x27;s Friend.</li>
            <li>but it is more like a baby oil substance.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it helped the front of my stomach.</li>
            <li>but I was glad to see that it was and that I could order it for her to began using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t know any better).</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love this product and so does my niece.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely more of an oil-like consistency, not lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5 foot 2 inches and had a boy over 8 lbs, so that&#x27;s saying something.  :)</li>
            <li>my mom told me the cream is better</li>
            <li>Overall excellent product to have.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I love it now for my daughter in law.</li>
            <li>This product has been around for many, many years</li>
            <li>I plan to use this product post pregnancy in hope that it helps minimize the appearance of my baby love marks.</li>
            <li>I should have done more research before spending the money.</li>
            <li>But, what&#x27;s more important, smelling like cocoa butter or delivering stretch mark free?&lt;br /&gt;I used this &#x27;lotion&#x27; for 8 months on my belly and not at all on my hips</li>
            <li>which is the most important.</li>
            <li>its been great so far..</li>
            <li>My experience is that the lotion is much more effective on muscle pain than the cream; however, the lotion is not so much lotion as it is an oil.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I stuck with the cream that smells like powder and is easily applied.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I used it nearly every night, it makes you feel pampered, I have absoutely no stretch marks, I don&#x27;t know if it is just good skin or mother&#x27;s friend, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to be pregnant without it!</li>
            <li>A definite thumbs up on this great product.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The cream by mothers friend is smooth smells</li>
            <li>It is much more effective and &amp;#34;girlie soft&amp;#34; smelling than any other popular muscle cream found on the shelves today (Bengay, Tiger Balm, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Oil absorbs easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>+ years ago with my first pregnancy, now my sister is using it with her first pregnancy, we love Mothers Friend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did; however, I do not like the cream because I did not use it the first time</li>
            <li>I was astounded that they still make it and immediately bought the original and the cream.  </li>
            <li>Worth the search and cost!  </li>
            <li>Used this when I was pregnant and it was fabulous</li>
            <li>You can purchase this at any pharmacy through special order.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it was around any more</li>
            <li>I love using this stuff, I have used it almost my whole pregnacy</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, It does not stink.</li>
            <li>I used it when I was pregnant...</li>
            <li>10 years ago, my mother bought me bottles of Mother&#x27;s friend when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant again, 6 months, and I started ordering it at 6 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>when I became pregnant myself, she reminded me to get this - you CAN NOT find this in stores.  </li>
            <li>I used this skin lotion when I was pregnant in the year 1980</li>
            <li>slather on belly thighs &amp; boobs morning night &amp; after showers- while pregnant and you will have no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant 25 years ago and used Mothers Friend and used it over my stomach, breast and thighs.</li>
            <li>My mother used it when pregnant and got no stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant with twins.</li>
            <li>so I bought for my daughter whom is now pregnant</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I used this when i was pregnant with my 30 year old daughter and have NO stretch marks :)  </li>
            <li>It was not a lotion more like an old oil.</li>
            <li>I am now ordering this for a co-worker is who now pregnant (first).</li>
            <li>I loved borrowing &amp;#34;Momma&#x27;s Buddy&amp;#34; out of my parents&#x27; medicine cabinet and using it after a rough volleyball practice years ago!  </li>
            <li>I put it on right after I got out of the shower and sometimes at night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>so was very large.  </li>
            <li>Simple easy and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not very strong but smells good.</li>
            <li>And thanks, Mom!</li>
            <li>I think regular Vaseline lotion works just as well or better.</li>
            <li>works so much better than regular lotion!</li>
            <li>The only flaw it&#x27;s more of an oil not lotion.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a friend, so I used it for my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>my first pregnancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>I started using this product when I was pregnant with my first child after a 97 year old woman recommended it and lifted her shirt to show me her youthful looking stomach!</li>
            <li>This is more of a body oil than a lotion, which worried me at first, but it absorbs quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it rubbing off on my clothes or anything.  </li>
            <li>and I went from an A cup to a large C.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very small-boned and went into each pregnancy weighing 97 pounds, each time gaining 45 pounds.     </li>
            <li>Even given this caveat, I would highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>One bottle should get you through the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It has kept me from itching though and is very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care too much for the smell either.</li>
            <li>and she used Mother&#x27;s Friend her whole life.</li>
            <li>The smell is intense but it really keeps your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my mother and sister, this product kept my skin (tummy) even and glowing through my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m convinced Mother&#x27;s Friend really does work.</li>
            <li>Mother&#x27;s Friend really does work.  </li>
            <li>You do not need a whole lot.</li>
            <li>and it is still around for a reason, because IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>The tubs cost around $7 each and lasted about a month in early pregnancy, and 2 weeks in later pregnancy when applied more liberally.  </li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks, which is definitely the biggest reason I love it.</li>
            <li>I am going to attempt to order the cream at our local drug store for my daughter to start using right away!</li>
            <li>but thanks to mothers friend, my belly looks big and pregnant with no marks.</li>
            <li>watery mess very comfortable on any itchiness during my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I remember slathering it on my tummy, breasts, and especially around my hips, because that&#x27;s where most stretch marks will show up later.     </li>
            <li>I was told about this product by an older lady.</li>
            <li>I am 36 weeks pregnant and have used this with the lotion my entire pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant, not my entire pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I used it when pregnant 6 different times, got no stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone concerned about stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Came highly recommended from a friend at work.</li>
            <li>I did use it a little while until I found the lotion and like it alot better.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell the best (but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad) and it sort of clings to your clothes</li>
            <li>and she used it back in the early &#x27;70s when she was pregnant with me</li>
            <li>well I&#x27;m 24 week and have not seen any new marks</li>
            <li>No stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li>It has a slight minty smell that eventually dissipates while leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My mother told me that it&#x27;s an old remedy</li>
            <li>This should be marketed for skin sensitive people.</li>
            <li>She used it twice a day, early in the morning and just before bed.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>I think this product was OLD.</li>
            <li>Even when I used to much it never left any oil spots on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>and I would really like to prevent stretch marks if at all possible.  </li>
            <li>I now am having a hard time finding this item for my daughter who is now pregnant with her first child.</li>
            <li>My mother told me about this 30 years ago when she was pregnant with my little sister...</li>
            <li>I know some people say stretch marks are hereditary and you can&#x27;t avoid them, but my mom has major stretch marks</li>
            <li>It does leave a little odor on your clothes that even after washing does not come out, but worth it to not have stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>You can feel them, but you can barely see them.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but its my secret stash that I do not share with others.</li>
            <li>Not a single stretch mark!  </li>
            <li>My wife used this from her second week of pregnancy through to the recovery after birth and after going from a tiny size 2 up to near bursting and back to a size 2, after all that change there was not a single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended over other lotions</li>
            <li>If you use to much it leaves your belly a little greasy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did; however, I do not like the cream because I did not use it the first time</li>
            <li> I was astounded that they still make it and immediately bought the original and the cream.  </li>
            <li> Worth the search and cost!  </li>
            <li> Used this when I was pregnant and it was fabulous</li>
            <li> You can purchase this at any pharmacy through special order.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it was around any more</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff, I have used it almost my whole pregnacy</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, It does not stink.</li>
            <li> I used it when I was pregnant...</li>
            <li> 10 years ago, my mother bought me bottles of Mother&#x27;s friend when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant again, 6 months, and I started ordering it at 6 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> when I became pregnant myself, she reminded me to get this - you CAN NOT find this in stores.  </li>
            <li> I used this skin lotion when I was pregnant in the year 1980</li>
            <li> slather on belly thighs &amp; boobs morning night &amp; after showers- while pregnant and you will have no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant 25 years ago and used Mothers Friend and used it over my stomach, breast and thighs.</li>
            <li> My mother used it when pregnant and got no stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant with twins.</li>
            <li> so I bought for my daughter whom is now pregnant</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I used this when i was pregnant with my 30 year old daughter and have NO stretch marks :)  </li>
            <li> It was not a lotion more like an old oil.</li>
            <li> I am now ordering this for a co-worker is who now pregnant (first).</li>
            <li> I loved borrowing &amp;#34;Momma&#x27;s Buddy&amp;#34; out of my parents&#x27; medicine cabinet and using it after a rough volleyball practice years ago!  </li>
            <li> I put it on right after I got out of the shower and sometimes at night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> so was very large.  </li>
            <li> Simple easy and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not very strong but smells good.</li>
            <li> And thanks, Mom!</li>
            <li> I think regular Vaseline lotion works just as well or better.</li>
            <li> works so much better than regular lotion!</li>
            <li> The only flaw it&#x27;s more of an oil not lotion.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend, so I used it for my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> my first pregnancy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was pregnant with my first child after a 97 year old woman recommended it and lifted her shirt to show me her youthful looking stomach!</li>
            <li> This is more of a body oil than a lotion, which worried me at first, but it absorbs quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it rubbing off on my clothes or anything.  </li>
            <li> and I went from an A cup to a large C.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very small-boned and went into each pregnancy weighing 97 pounds, each time gaining 45 pounds.     </li>
            <li> Even given this caveat, I would highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> One bottle should get you through the whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It has kept me from itching though and is very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care too much for the smell either.</li>
            <li> and she used Mother&#x27;s Friend her whole life.</li>
            <li> The smell is intense but it really keeps your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my mother and sister, this product kept my skin (tummy) even and glowing through my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m convinced Mother&#x27;s Friend really does work.</li>
            <li> Mother&#x27;s Friend really does work.  </li>
            <li> You do not need a whole lot.</li>
            <li> and it is still around for a reason, because IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> The tubs cost around $7 each and lasted about a month in early pregnancy, and 2 weeks in later pregnancy when applied more liberally.  </li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks, which is definitely the biggest reason I love it.</li>
            <li> I am going to attempt to order the cream at our local drug store for my daughter to start using right away!</li>
            <li> but thanks to mothers friend, my belly looks big and pregnant with no marks.</li>
            <li> watery mess very comfortable on any itchiness during my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I remember slathering it on my tummy, breasts, and especially around my hips, because that&#x27;s where most stretch marks will show up later.     </li>
            <li> I was told about this product by an older lady.</li>
            <li> I am 36 weeks pregnant and have used this with the lotion my entire pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant, not my entire pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I used it when pregnant 6 different times, got no stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone concerned about stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came highly recommended from a friend at work.</li>
            <li> I did use it a little while until I found the lotion and like it alot better.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell the best (but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad) and it sort of clings to your clothes</li>
            <li> and she used it back in the early &#x27;70s when she was pregnant with me</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m 24 week and have not seen any new marks</li>
            <li> No stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li> It has a slight minty smell that eventually dissipates while leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My mother told me that it&#x27;s an old remedy</li>
            <li> This should be marketed for skin sensitive people.</li>
            <li> She used it twice a day, early in the morning and just before bed.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> I think this product was OLD.</li>
            <li> Even when I used to much it never left any oil spots on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> and I would really like to prevent stretch marks if at all possible.  </li>
            <li> I now am having a hard time finding this item for my daughter who is now pregnant with her first child.</li>
            <li> My mother told me about this 30 years ago when she was pregnant with my little sister...</li>
            <li> I know some people say stretch marks are hereditary and you can&#x27;t avoid them, but my mom has major stretch marks</li>
            <li> It does leave a little odor on your clothes that even after washing does not come out, but worth it to not have stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> You can feel them, but you can barely see them.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but its my secret stash that I do not share with others.</li>
            <li> Not a single stretch mark!  </li>
            <li> My wife used this from her second week of pregnancy through to the recovery after birth and after going from a tiny size 2 up to near bursting and back to a size 2, after all that change there was not a single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended over other lotions</li>
            <li> If you use to much it leaves your belly a little greasy</li>
            <li> I used it on my thighs, hips, breasts, behind and stomach from the time that I found-out that I was pregnant throughout the next year while nursing my baby.  </li>
            <li> It keeps away most of the stretch marks associated with pregnancy, and is the only thing that keeps her belly from itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long Mother&#x27;s Friend has been around, but my mother recommended it to me</li>
            <li> My skin never got dry or itchy either.</li>
            <li> We used it every single day on bellies, breasts, legs and buttocks.</li>
            <li> I used it every day on my belly and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how some people made one bottle last an entire pregnancy.</li>
            <li> When I got it and went to use it it was nothing but broken down oil and smelled funny.</li>
            <li> I expected a cream-based lotion and this is oil, which I thought was a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I looked like a water buffalo, and carried each of my sons straight out in front</li>
            <li> It was also very runny and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Was not expecting this to be so small and loose as compared to the cream.</li>
            <li> I have the cream also, but this was a mess.</li>
            <li> In a few words, it works.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your skin firm.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday with all four pregnancies and never once got any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I had very little stretch marks</li>
            <li> No more itching.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in my late 60s.  </li>
            <li> I want to say this product helped, but honestly, I do not know.  </li>
            <li> but I would just put it on at night really thick.  </li>
            <li> The product is very thin, almost like water so a very small amount goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I do remember the smell was not great</li>
            <li> If you have m/s the smell may make you nauseated.</li>
            <li> it had broken me out.</li>
            <li> The item was old and had a very bad odor.  </li>
            <li> Probably a bit of a bad smell for a few months is preferable to bearing stretch   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the bad reviews are from women who didn&#x27;t actually use the product because it&#x27;s &#x27;greasy&#x27; and &#x27;smells bad&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I didn&#x27;t have ANY stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she can&#x27;t find it in any stores in San Antonio.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for three pregnancies now on a random recommendation from a lady in the maternity shop.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember what it smelled like, after all these years, and notice some gals on here mention it stinks.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks, but this stuff really stinks</li>
            <li> It smells so bad and after about a week of use</li>
            <li> It is an oil base.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product has a scent, but not terrible. Oil absorbs easily and quickly. No stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!! And I do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long Mother&#x27;s Friend has been around, but my mother recommended it to me and I&#x27;m in my late 60s.  When I had my three sons around 40 years ago, I actually listened to her for once (!!) and was so glad I did.  I&#x27;m very small-boned and went into each pregnancy weighing 97 pounds, each time gaining 45 pounds.     Needless to say, I looked like a water buffalo, and carried each of my sons straight out in front so was very large.  I also had them close: all three within five years. So my skin was doing a lot of stretching and retracting.   HOWEVER... I never got any stretch marks and definitely attribute it to having used Mother&#x27;s Friend.     I remember slathering it on my tummy, breasts, and especially around my hips, because that&#x27;s where most stretch marks will show up later.     I don&#x27;t remember what it smelled like, after all these years, and notice some gals on here mention it stinks. But who  cares, if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to? Probably a bit of a bad smell for a few months is preferable to bearing stretch   marks the rest of your life!    A definite thumbs up on this great product. And thanks, Mom!</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff!!!  I used this 20 years ago with my pregnancy and I do not have a stretch mark on my body.  Highly recommend for anyone concerned about stretch marks.  I do remember the smell was not great, my daughter&#x27;s Father called it &amp;#34;Daddy&#x27;s Enemy&amp;#34; because of the &amp;#34;vicks like smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I used this 28 years ago during my pregnancy, it was a lifesaver. I&#x27;m hopeful it will work as well for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product by an older lady. I used it when I was pregnant...Needless to say I didn&#x27;t have ANY stretch marks. I am now ordering this for a co-worker is who now pregnant (first). I hope it yields the same wonderful results. It&#x27;s truly a WINNER.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only lotion that my wife loves.  It keeps away most of the stretch marks associated with pregnancy, and is the only thing that keeps her belly from itching like crazy.  She&#x27;s used it through 4 pregnancies now, and it has done its job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. I did use it a little while until I found the lotion and like it alot better. This product is more like baby oil!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a Friend....&amp; she loves it!</li>
            <li> I used this product 25+ years ago with my first pregnancy, now my sister is using it with her first pregnancy, we love Mothers Friend!</li>
            <li> Same formula as 20+ years ago when my mother used it. Hope it works for me like it did for her.</li>
            <li> My mom recommend this product for my first pregnancy and it works great! Use liberally for no stretch marks :)</li>
            <li> 10 years ago, my mother bought me bottles of Mother&#x27;s friend when I was pregnant.  I used it on my thighs, hips, breasts, behind and stomach from the time that I found-out that I was pregnant throughout the next year while nursing my baby.  10 years later, I still do not have stretch marks.  My mother told me that it&#x27;s an old remedy and she used it back in the early &#x27;70s when she was pregnant with me and no, she does not have any stretch marks either.  I am pregnant again, 6 months, and I started ordering it at 6 weeks pregnant.  I use it on the same areas as I did 10 years ago and to date, I do not have any stretch marks, nor do I have the constant pregnancy itching.  I highly recommend this product.  Some will tell you that stetch marks are genetic, but I took a chance and used it anyway.  I&#x27;m glad that I did; however, I do not like the cream because I did not use it the first time and it didn&#x27;t seem to have the same effect on my skin. I only the oily type of Mother&#x27;s Friend like mineral or baby oil.  And, I lotion myself on top of the Mother&#x27;s Friend. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I used this in 1981 before delivering my firstchild.I had zero stretch marks afterwards, and had my second child in 1981 which I also used the lotion. I now am having a hard time finding this item for my daughter who is now pregnant with her first child. I am going to attempt to order the cream at our local drug store for my daughter to start using right away!</li>
            <li> Delivered as described and in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it smells  at all. If you have m/s the smell may make you nauseated. I think regular Vaseline lotion works just as well or better.</li>
            <li> I used this product throughout my pregnancy.  I had heard from a my girlfriend that it was the best product because she did not have any stretch marks.  Stretch marks might be hereditary, however, I did find this lotion/ oil/ watery mess very comfortable on any itchiness during my pregnancy.  I can also say that I do not have any stretch marks and will proudly promote this product to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> Always a mommy&#x27;s best friend</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product -- helped me with my first son not get stretch marks &amp; makes your skin stretching not hurt.</li>
            <li> I am 36 weeks pregnant and have used this with the lotion my entire pregnancy. No stretch marks, but this stuff really stinks</li>
            <li> BEST thing ever invented for moms to be.  My mother told me about this 30 years ago when she was pregnant with my little sister...when I became pregnant myself, she reminded me to get this - you CAN NOT find this in stores.  I&#x27;m on my second pregnancy and NOT A STRETCH MARK in sight.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a lotion but it is more like a baby oil substance. It is a tiny bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product. This should be marketed for skin sensitive people. Helps rash do to water exposure when swimming. Light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I want to say this product helped, but honestly, I do not know.  I used for the entire summer I was pregnant, not my entire pregnancy.  I also used Biotin.  I noticed that I have very, very light stretch marks on the front on my stomach.  You can feel them, but you can barely see them.  However, I have stretch marks on my obliques that are a bit darker and noticeable.  Cant really say either product worked the best for me. but I am sure it helped the front of my stomach.</li>
            <li> I used this skin lotion when I was pregnant in the year 1980 and I suggested my daughter use it during her pregnancy now.  I had very little stretch marks and I contribute this to the use of Mothers Friend.  I really didn&#x27;t think it was around any more but I was glad to see that it was and that I could order it for her to began using it.</li>
            <li> I loved borrowing &amp;#34;Momma&#x27;s Buddy&amp;#34; out of my parents&#x27; medicine cabinet and using it after a rough volleyball practice years ago!  I was astounded that they still make it and immediately bought the original and the cream.  Don&#x27;t let the name fool you--Mother&#x27;s Friend is a good &amp;#34;all around&amp;#34; product for everyone and not just expecting Mothers!  It is great on pulled muscles, muscle aches and cramps and is a great, every day moisturizer/lotion.  My experience is that the lotion is much more effective on muscle pain than the cream; however, the lotion is not so much lotion as it is an oil.  Even given this caveat, I would highly recommend this product to everyone! It is much more effective and &amp;#34;girlie soft&amp;#34; smelling than any other popular muscle cream found on the shelves today (Bengay, Tiger Balm, etc.).  Worth the search and cost!  EXCELLENT--thrilled to find this product again!</li>
            <li> Best oil ever for pregnancy belly. I didn&#x27;t have the itching or stretch marks with both pregnancies. Highly recommended over other lotions</li>
            <li> The item was old and had a very bad odor.  I contacted the vendor, but received no response. I threw it away and will NEVER use this vendor again!  If I could have given zero stars I would have.</li>
            <li> slather on belly thighs &amp; boobs morning night &amp; after showers- while pregnant and you will have no stretch marks. It really works.</li>
            <li> Love this! It goes on like oil but isn&#x27;t greasy. Definitely helps with itchy skin. Highly recommend. It&#x27;s better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant 25 years ago and used Mothers Friend and used it over my stomach, breast and thighs. One bottle was enough, I would have gave it 5 stars but if I remember correctly I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but I believe it kept me from getting any stretch marks anywhere and I went from an A cup to a large C. So I have just found out my daughter in law is pregnant and I will be buying her Mothers Friend for her, still good reviews after 25 years....keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I used this all during my pregnancy because I had a friend who swore by it.  However, I used the tub of cream instead of the lotion.  You can purchase this at any pharmacy through special order.  The tubs cost around $7 each and lasted about a month in early pregnancy, and 2 weeks in later pregnancy when applied more liberally.  I tried the lotion once and thought it smelled like menthol.  It was also very runny and difficult to apply.  Therefore, I stuck with the cream that smells like powder and is easily applied.  It is a bit greasy, but this same greasy feeling is soothing later in pregnancy to itchy skin.  Stretch marks are supposed to be hereditary, but my mom has several and I don&#x27;t have any.  Of my friends who have used this throughout pregnancy, none have stretch marks.  However, those who used traditional cocoa butter creams do.</li>
            <li> My daughter said it was good and helped with controlling the itch she was experiencing. She has started purchasing it herself.</li>
            <li> This product is totally awesome. My mother used it when pregnant and got no stretchmarks. I used it when pregnant 6 different times, got no stretchmarks. My daughter is now using it during pregnancy and has no stretchmarks. I truly believe in this product. My sister used it with one pregnancy and got no stretchmarks, she could not find it with the next one and she did get stretchmarks. We used it every single day on bellies, breasts, legs and buttocks. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Nice oil. No stretch marks.  Apply nightly before bed.  It&#x27;s a nice way to make sure mommy and daddy bond over the baby belly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the bad reviews are from women who didn&#x27;t actually use the product because it&#x27;s &#x27;greasy&#x27; and &#x27;smells bad&#x27;. Yes it is an oil, not a lotion and no, it is not perfumed. But, what&#x27;s more important, smelling like cocoa butter or delivering stretch mark free?&lt;br /&gt;I used this &#x27;lotion&#x27; for 8 months on my belly and not at all on my hips (I didn&#x27;t know any better). I delivered with no stretch marks on my belly and my hips covered with them.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. One bottle should get you through the whole pregnancy. I&#x27;m buying a bottle for my current pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My wife was concerned with stretch marks forming during her pregnancy and this was recommended by a friend.  In a few words, it works.  My wife used this from her second week of pregnancy through to the recovery after birth and after going from a tiny size 2 up to near bursting and back to a size 2, after all that change there was not a single stretch mark.  The product is very thin, almost like water so a very small amount goes a very long way. She used it twice a day, early in the morning and just before bed.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting this to be so small and loose as compared to the cream. Should be called oil instead of lotion</li>
            <li> I finally found this on amazon, I am buying it for a friend&#x27;s daughter, I delivered 4 children and used this with each one, I loved how it made my belly feel! I used it nearly every night, it makes you feel pampered, I have absoutely no stretch marks, I don&#x27;t know if it is just good skin or mother&#x27;s friend, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to be pregnant without it! My oldest child is 19, I still have good memories when I see the bottle. I love&lt;br /&gt; it</li>
            <li> The best thing since sliced bread</li>
            <li> No stretch marks yet.  I&#x27;m pregnant with twins.</li>
            <li> Used this when I was pregnant and it was fabulous so I bought for my daughter whom is now pregnant</li>
            <li> I used this when i was pregnant with my 30 year old daughter and have NO stretch marks :)  I bought this for my niece for her 1st pregnancy and now again for her 2nd.  I love this product and so does my niece.  Unfortunately, she can&#x27;t find it in any stores in San Antonio.</li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my mother, I have been using this product during my pregnancy.  It is definitely more of an oil-like consistency, not lotion.  It has kept me from itching though and is very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works well I&#x27;m 24 week and have not seen any new marks</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working well. Came highly recommended from a friend at work.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! works so much better than regular lotion! I will deff recommend to friends who are prego</li>
            <li> I think this product was OLD. When I got it and went to use it it was nothing but broken down oil and smelled funny. I have the cream also, but this was a mess. I am getting rid of it because it is not a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; consistency. GROSS. And the oil messed up my shirt!!!</li>
            <li> Helped ward off stretch marks and kept my skin moisturizer during the winter! Will use again for baby #2!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for three pregnancies now on a random recommendation from a lady in the maternity shop.  Not a single stretch mark!  Wonderful stuff if that is your goal.  It does leave a little odor on your clothes that even after washing does not come out, but worth it to not have stretch marks.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! So far no stretch marks, which is definitely the biggest reason I love it. But it has a minty smell to it that&#x27;s not very strong but smells good. It feels good on my belly and helps with the itchy pregnancy skin. If you use to much it leaves your belly a little greasy but I&#x27;ve figured out a good amount to use now and it&#x27;s fine. Even when I used to much it never left any oil spots on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Im on my 2nd bottle and I&#x27;m 8 months along. I will likely have to order a 3rd because I&#x27;m almost out now. I&#x27;m not sure how some people made one bottle last an entire pregnancy. But I have used this on my sides, back, thighs, and breasts to prevent stretch marks all over. I would definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive had my baby now and no stretch marks! Loved this stuff!</li>
            <li> I expected a cream-based lotion and this is oil, which I thought was a little deceiving. I didn&#x27;t care too much for the smell either. I used the bottle once throughout my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I love this product but its my secret stash that I do not share with others. Keeps your skin firm.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daugther in law who loves it. It is non- irritaing in it&#x27;s smell which is the most important.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was pregnant with my first child after a 97 year old woman recommended it and lifted her shirt to show me her youthful looking stomach! NO JOKE! She had 7 children in her lifetime and she used Mother&#x27;s Friend her whole life. I&#x27;ve been using it since 2003 all over my body and I mix it with my face cream. It has a slight minty smell that eventually dissipates while leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Always was, Always will be the best for stretch marks</li>
            <li> best ever for tummy and legs.  it doesn&#x27;t smell the best (but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad) and it sort of clings to your clothes but I would just put it on at night really thick.  No stretch marks!  I&#x27;m 5 foot 2 inches and had a boy over 8 lbs, so that&#x27;s saying something.  :)</li>
            <li> its been great so far..my mom told me the cream is better so i ordered tht too..TEAMNOSTRETCHMARKS yaaaay..</li>
            <li> Most amazing stuff!! I love using this stuff, I have used it almost my whole pregnacy and it&#x27;s perfect to use for preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Bottle had been opened when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Very light and it&#x27;s not greasy. The only flaw it&#x27;s more of an oil not lotion. Overall excellent product to have. No more itching.</li>
            <li> Broke out.. But I like the smell. Smells like cotton seed</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. The cream by mothers friend is smooth smells okay and works so well. This \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; is an oil. It smells so bad and after about a week of use it had broken me out. Buy the cream!</li>
            <li> I have four children, they now range in ages from 10 to 16.  I used this everyday with all four pregnancies and never once got any stretch marks.  I just sported a two piece swim suit with my teenage daughters with no worries.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like it. The smell is intense but it really keeps your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied. It was not a lotion more like an old oil.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my mother and sister, this product kept my skin (tummy) even and glowing through my whole pregnancy. All women prego or not should use this</li>
            <li> Best while pregnant and working out</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend, so I used it for my first pregnancy. I used it every day on my belly and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark. My skin never got dry or itchy either. I put it on right after I got out of the shower and sometimes at night before going to bed.  I went through 3 bottles my first pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now 33 weeks along in my 2nd pregnancy and still no stretch marks. I will use up 2 bottles this time. I know some people say stretch marks are hereditary and you can&#x27;t avoid them, but my mom has major stretch marks and I do not have any. So I&#x27;m convinced Mother&#x27;s Friend really does work. That and I drink a LOT of water.</li>
            <li> I loved the product then and I love it now for my daughter in law. Simple easy and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have used this throughout my entire pregnancy. I am currently 34 weeks and have no stretch marks. I believe that this works because I am stretch mark prone everywhere but thanks to mothers friend, my belly looks big and pregnant with no marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after getting a recommendation from a friend who just had a baby.  This is my first pregnancy and I would really like to prevent stretch marks if at all possible.  This is more of a body oil than a lotion, which worried me at first, but it absorbs quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it rubbing off on my clothes or anything.  It has a mild scent.  The bottles are small so I plan on going through several before this baby is born.</li>
            <li> Mother&#x27;s Friend really does work.  I did not get ANY stretch marks during my pregnancy while using Mothers Friend daily.  You do not need a whole lot. The smell is not bad, It does not stink. It is an oil base.  I have given this as gifts to different friends and they were greatful.  This product has been around for many, many years and it is still around for a reason, because IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Did not help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. I plan to use this product post pregnancy in hope that it helps minimize the appearance of my baby love marks. Also, I believe you can find this at Walgreens or cvs to avoid paying shipping. I should have done more research before spending the money.</li>
