            <li>Works great for me.  </li>
            <li>lol..</li>
            <li>This is a great supplement as today&#x27;s water needs some treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I felt really good during a work day.</li>
            <li>I read so many stories about this product that this is good nutrtion for your body, I have notice when I use this</li>
            <li>I am very healthy and am warding off many grave illnesses including immune diseases that I never want to get.  </li>
            <li>Always easy to use!</li>
            <li>Coral cal is very likely to help you to make the best water you&#x27;ve ever consumed.</li>
            <li>Drink all day and more.  </li>
            <li>It is healthy anyway to keep fluids going into your body.  </li>
            <li>This forces you to drink more.  </li>
            <li>It is okay, but I did not reorder it.</li>
            <li>It does make water, tea, any beverage taste better.</li>
            <li>would recommend it for those healthy minded individuals.</li>
            <li>and I feel the sachets make my water taste better.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great product as it is easy to use, easy to carry and travel with, and provides proven ability to make your body fluid alkaline.  </li>

            <li>One of the most versatile and important health products I have ever used, it does so much!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure they are</li>
            <li>It says that you use one sachet on 1,5 to 2 litters of water but in reality it&#x27;s only good for like 2 cups.</li>
            <li>I drink Fiji water , and this comes in handy at work, I can drop a packet into my bottle in the morning and by the time I arrive at work, it&#x27;s permeated the entire bottle</li>
            <li>The saliva test should be done first thing upon awakening, three good saliva creations and swallows, then touch a pH paper strip to the saliva under your tongue, let dry for about 30 seconds and check the color against the chart.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use just put a tiny sachet in my water bottle.</li>
            <li>Eventually try tapering off and check your pH to ensure you are using enough to stay healthy.  </li>
            <li>Stay healthy by carrying around a water or juice bottle daily with one of these in it.  </li>
            <li>but this was my first time using this merchant</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for everyone walking!</li>
            <li>Do a simple saliva test with full spectrum pH paper (1-14) and find out for yourself how to change an acidic body into an alkaline one.  </li>
            <li>Since many diseases cannot survive in an alkaline environment, you ward off potential problems and illnesses by using this daily.  </li>
            <li>Good product, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a proper review.  </li>

            <li> I want to know how long to leave this product in my water?</li>
            <li> Try it in orange juice and after the sachet sits for a few minutes, give it a swirl or stir and notice how the taste is far less acidic.  </li>
            <li> but if you are ill, a higher usage is recommended.  </li>
            <li> Give the bottle a shake after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have used this ionic calcium product for years and rarely get sick with viruses or bacterial infections.  </li>
            <li> I have tried these in filtered tap water (both soft and hard water) as well as in water from the cooler at work and in every case these just make the water taste bad.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any health benefits, but in all fairness I imagine one would have to use it daily over a longer period of time before results cold be noticed or measured.  </li>

            <li> I wish I would have saved my money : (</li>

            <li> Coral cal is very likely to help you to make the best water you&#x27;ve ever consumed. Will improve your intake of minerals without even knowing it.</li>
            <li> I have ph  paper so I can check alkaline level in the water. It says that you use one sachet on 1,5 to 2 litters of water but in reality it&#x27;s only good for like 2 cups. Then it makes your water alkaline. I prefer coral llc and you can  buy it for $14.</li>
            <li> THe coral cal that I ordered arrived just as stated &amp; in a timely manner.  I was very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years to replace the minerals in my purified water. Always easy to use!</li>
            <li> I am following the HCG diet recommended by Kevin Trudeau and I use the Coral Calcium during Phase 1. It is very easy to use just put a tiny sachet in my water bottle. I use 1 a day.</li>
            <li> I read so many stories about this product that this is good nutrtion for your body, I have notice when I use this, I felt really good during a work day.</li>
            <li> great product, best water ever tasted</li>
            <li> This is a great product as it is easy to use, easy to carry and travel with, and provides proven ability to make your body fluid alkaline.  One sachet daily is a maintenance dose but if you are ill, a higher usage is recommended.  Do a simple saliva test with full spectrum pH paper (1-14) and find out for yourself how to change an acidic body into an alkaline one.  Since many diseases cannot survive in an alkaline environment, you ward off potential problems and illnesses by using this daily.  Up your dosage until you hit upon one that makes you alkaline and stay there.  Eventually try tapering off and check your pH to ensure you are using enough to stay healthy.  The saliva test should be done first thing upon awakening, three good saliva creations and swallows, then touch a pH paper strip to the saliva under your tongue, let dry for about 30 seconds and check the color against the chart.  If you are alkaline, great, if acidic you need this product.  Amazon or eBay carry the pH papers inexpensively.  Do not eat or drink anything, including water, prior to the pH saliva test as that will skew the results.  Stay healthy by carrying around a water or juice bottle daily with one of these in it.  Give the bottle a shake after a few minutes.  Drink all day and more.  It is healthy anyway to keep fluids going into your body.  This forces you to drink more.  Try it in orange juice and after the sachet sits for a few minutes, give it a swirl or stir and notice how the taste is far less acidic.  A great way to prove it does what it does too.  I have used this ionic calcium product for years and rarely get sick with viruses or bacterial infections.  I am very healthy and am warding off many grave illnesses including immune diseases that I never want to get.  I highly recommend this product for everyone walking!</li>
            <li> Been using Coral Calcium for over 20 years but this was my first time using this merchant and it is the same great imported product from Okinawa that I was hoping it would be.  One of the most versatile and important health products I have ever used, it does so much!</li>
            <li> I drink Fiji water , and this comes in handy at work, I can drop a packet into my bottle in the morning and by the time I arrive at work, it&#x27;s permeated the entire bottle and I can get my daily water intake and calcium all in one, will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I actually have a question about the product. I want to know how long to leave this product in my water? How often do I change them?</li>
            <li> It is okay, but I did not reorder it. I take a lot of suppliments, and this just did not get on my priority list. Maybe I am wrong!</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  Wouldn&#x27;t do without my coral calcium.  Makes water fullbodied with minerals and electrolytes.</li>
            <li> I used them all...and I&#x27;m pretty sure they are B/S lol..I wish I would have saved my money : (</li>
            <li> Good product, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a proper review.  It does make water, tea, any beverage taste better.</li>
            <li> This is a great supplement as today&#x27;s water needs some treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for those healthy minded individuals.</li>
            <li> I have been amazed by the coral sachets ability to improve the quality of my drinking water.  Easy to use. I am picky about the taste of water and I feel the sachets make my water taste better.</li>
            <li> I have tried these in filtered tap water (both soft and hard water) as well as in water from the cooler at work and in every case these just make the water taste bad.  I can&#x27;t make myself drink it anymore.  I have not noticed any health benefits, but in all fairness I imagine one would have to use it daily over a longer period of time before results cold be noticed or measured.  In any case, I give up.  Blech.</li>
