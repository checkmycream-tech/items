            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>As for lotion for lotion&#x27;s sake, I don&#x27;t dislike it, but I have a list of others I&#x27;d prefer over it if it weren&#x27;t for the magical disappearance of my mosquito bites.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep them away, it makes you smell nicer LOL!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream for its texture and its nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Applying strong lavender scented lotion prevented more bites..</li>
            <li>but it does make my skin smooth and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go for their specialized stuff, the original works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the classic scent of this lotion!  </li>
            <li>they terminated the original in picture and sent a blue bottle with jojoba oil, i think original was better and also kept noseeums off better</li>
            <li>And, I have found it really does seem to keep the mosquitos away, for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and how it makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li>I love to use skin so soft lotion,  </li>
            <li>While the notice that actual original SSS Lotion was not longer available arrived with my purchase, had it been in the ad I ordered from I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>She mainly likes it for moisturing and softening her legs after shaving.</li>
            <li>I HAVEN&#x27;T USED SKIN SO SOFT IN A LONG TIME AND WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPONTED THAT THE FRAGRANCE WASN&#x27;T AS STRONG</li>
            <li>I was expecting and specifically wanting the actual original formula of Avon Skin So Soft Lotion as that is how the ad presented it.  </li>
            <li>Delivery immediate from purveyor, but application of SKIN SO SOFT lotion did not prevent the fllea bites I purchased the product to prevent...</li>
            <li>My family&#x27;s been getting eaten alive by mosquitoes this summer; in fact, I think we&#x27;re actually breeding them in the bathroom of our rented NYC apartment.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, I get headaches from to poor blended fragrances.</li>

            <li> I have use so soft for a long time will not use any other produce!</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and recommend this to all people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> So Soft over the past month</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> Other advertisments on line included this information and I ordered from this ad because it appeared to not have it.</li>
            <li> I learned of using this down in NC where the national bird is the mosquito.  </li>
            <li> A little oily, smells like powder with a little floral hint.</li>
            <li> and if you are pestered by those little things, this is for you.</li>
            <li> and I would buy it again but locally because the delivery from this source was very slow.</li>
            <li> Much better than bug repellent.</li>
            <li> , I notice that I&#x27;m hardly bitten if at all, however, you do need to reapply it if you&#x27;re v. active or out all day, etc.  </li>
            <li> I take it camping in the summer and get very few bites!  </li>

            <li> A little oily, smells like powder with a little floral hint. Keeps mosquitos away! Put it on us and the baby and no bites. Much better than bug repellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband, he has eczema and sometimes it flares up when it does he uses this lotion to sooth his skin and it helps with the dryness it replenishes his skin with moisture. Great product</li>
            <li> You sent the wrong lotion which was OK but not what I had ordered.  I guess they don&#x27;t make &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34; body lotion anymore--which is why when I saw it on Amazon I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing, but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.  I only got one mosquito bite camping any my munchkins didn&#x27;t get any!</li>
            <li> I am unsure if it repels mosquitos but it does make my skin smooth and well moisturized. I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> they terminated the original in picture and sent a blue bottle with jojoba oil, i think original was better and also kept noseeums off better</li>
            <li> Delivery immediate from purveyor, but application of SKIN SO SOFT lotion did not prevent the fllea bites I purchased the product to prevent...however, it was just an experiment. Applying strong lavender scented lotion prevented more bites..</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I am looking for. Its great for getting rid of ants and great for my dogs sesitive skins.</li>
            <li> This is what I ordered but it is not what I received.&lt;br /&gt;If the company knows that they no longer sell this specific product,&lt;br /&gt;then they should remove the item and the PICTURE!!</li>
            <li> My wife buys this body lotion from her local Avon representative.  She mainly likes it for moisturing and softening her legs after shaving.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I apply this to my skin after every shower.  I received my order on time and recommend this to all people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T USED SKIN SO SOFT IN A LONG TIME AND WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPONTED THAT THE FRAGRANCE WASN&#x27;T AS STRONG AS I REMEBERED. HOWEVER, THIS WAS OF NO FAULT OF THE SELLER.  I GOT IT AT A GREAT PRICE AND TIMELY DELIVERY.</li>
            <li> I love this cream for its texture and its nice clean smell.  In the summer it is great as the mosquitoes hate it and if you are pestered by those little things, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I get headaches from to poor blended fragrances. It is really nice and I would buy it again but locally because the delivery from this source was very slow.</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s been getting eaten alive by mosquitoes this summer; in fact, I think we&#x27;re actually breeding them in the bathroom of our rented NYC apartment.  Since I started using the Skin So Soft over the past month, I notice that I&#x27;m hardly bitten if at all, however, you do need to reapply it if you&#x27;re v. active or out all day, etc.  As for lotion for lotion&#x27;s sake, I don&#x27;t dislike it, but I have a list of others I&#x27;d prefer over it if it weren&#x27;t for the magical disappearance of my mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> I love the classic scent of this lotion!  It mositurizes well- not greasy or anything.  And, I have found it really does seem to keep the mosquitos away, for the most part.  I take it camping in the summer and get very few bites!  Must be the scent.</li>
            <li> Smell has a lot to be desired but we use it during the peak of the mosquito season and it protects the whole family without harsh fumes or chemicals.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years as a lotion to help soften my skin and keep the bugs away!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love to use skin so soft lotion,  I like the scent and not greasy, absorbs well.  I have bought it may times and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting and specifically wanting the actual original formula of Avon Skin So Soft Lotion as that is how the ad presented it.  When it came it was the newer one with Jajoba in it.  Other advertisments on line included this information and I ordered from this ad because it appeared to not have it. While the notice that actual original SSS Lotion was not longer available arrived with my purchase, had it been in the ad I ordered from I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go for their specialized stuff, the original works just fine for me.  I learned of using this down in NC where the national bird is the mosquito.  Not only does it keep them away, it makes you smell nicer LOL!  Not to mention its good for your skin!</li>
            <li> I have use so soft for a long time will not use any other produce! leave skin soft and smell great!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and how it makes my skin soft! The added perk is that it is not overwhemling with fragrance and it still keeps gnats and mosquitos at bay.</li>
