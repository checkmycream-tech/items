            <li>Love the matte finish, I take this on all overnight stays.</li>
            <li>For the price, I can find a better mirror elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition (a day earlier than promised!), having been conscientiously wrapped and packaged.</li>
            <li>Love, love this mirror.  </li>

            <li>The view is great as far as the mirror goes.</li>

            <li>In the magnified image and the unmagnified image, mirror is far superior optically than others I have seen.  </li>
            <li>After many years of flossing difficulty and now spending a ton to fix my teeth I enjoy seeing what I am doing thanks to these Amazon items in the morning.</li>
            <li>awesome and hard to break</li>
            <li>The mirrors are good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>all not a bad mirror.</li>
            <li>The stand is nice and solid so the unit doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li>I will say that the reflection on both sides is perfectly clear, much better than those shaving mirrors I have come across in hotel</li>
            <li>The plain mirror is clear with a good reflection but the 7x magnified side is a bit impractical as I have to get very close to it to get a good image.</li>
            <li>I needed a small mirror that was stable and lightweight and this is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is small, which is great -</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed to fullfill the purpose for which I needed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And since it has a purely functional, non-frilly design and a matte black finish, it is a good \\&quot;guy\\&quot; mirror.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t swivel from left to right but does fine angling</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want a large mirror taking up counter space.</li>
            <li>I sit comfortably and privately in front of a desk listening to morning news or</li>
            <li>I use it every day, it stands very well.  </li>
            <li>I have it on my desk at work and it takes up too much room</li>
            <li>Very functional and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Wow very fast delivery .  </li>
            <li>the image is clear and crisp...</li>
            <li>The quality is such that you would expect it to cost several dollars more.</li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>The product is high quality</li>
            <li>I was looking for a larger mirror to set on my makeup vanity, and it just wasn&#x27;t the right size.  </li>
            <li>Need something decent sized for my 16 year old daughter who wears glasses so she could stop sitting on the bathroom counter to apply her make up.  </li>
            <li>Other than perhaps thinking it would be a bit bigger I love it.</li>
            <li>It is stable and clear.  </li>
            <li>This really works wonders when doing makeup and especially doing eye brows.</li>
            <li>The surfaces are clear and unblemished.</li>
            <li>The pivot points are on the long sides of the rectangle - so it&#x27;s more of an up and down view, than a side to side view.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror but a lot smaller than what was said it does look cheap for the price I paid too bad</li>
            <li>Solid little mirror, I use for guitar practice to watch my fingers, decent price, built very well.</li>
            <li>The matt black finish looks good, the base sits well on level surfaces, and the tilt mechanism is smooth and solid.</li>
            <li>The size is just right for a small location and the two sided mirror&#x27;s (one is magnified)</li>

            <li> kinda expensive</li>

            <li> Nice mirror but a lot smaller than what was said it does look cheap for the price I paid too bad</li>
            <li> Sturdy and good mirror. Silicone edges provide some protection. Overall happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> After many years of flossing difficulty and now spending a ton to fix my teeth I enjoy seeing what I am doing thanks to these Amazon items in the morning. I sit comfortably and privately in front of a desk listening to morning news or music.&lt;br /&gt;Why did this take me so long?!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product worth the price.  I use it every day, it stands very well.  Must buy if you are looking for a face mirror.</li>
            <li> I needed a small mirror that was stable and lightweight and this is great. It doesn&#x27;t swivel from left to right but does fine angling&lt;br /&gt;up or down and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li> I use the mirror to cut my own hair and trim my beard.  It is stable and clear.  Good mirror for the money.</li>
            <li> This is the  best mirror of it&#x27;s type that I have ever purchased.  I would definitely purchase it again. ok</li>
            <li> Love the matte finish, I take this on all overnight stays.</li>
            <li> This mirror didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was looking for a larger mirror to set on my makeup vanity, and it just wasn&#x27;t the right size.  It also was not made well, as the glass on the edges was showing around the corners etc. I sent this back.  For the price, I can find a better mirror elsewhere.</li>
            <li> awesome and hard to break</li>
            <li> perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> kinda expensive but is is made well</li>
            <li> Perfect for the bath, it never&lt;br /&gt;fogs!</li>
            <li> The size is just right for a small location and the two sided mirror&#x27;s (one is magnified) really help these tired eyes.  The stand is nice and solid so the unit doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> No distortion, great size, well made. Nice that you can store it in a drawer or keep it out. Some mirrors are too big to tuck away. This is great.</li>
            <li> Just the right shape and size, at a good price.</li>
            <li> Other than perhaps thinking it would be a bit bigger I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect mirror for makeup, portability, stability and the matte black finish doesn&#x27;t get marred by makeup.</li>
            <li> The magnification is excellent... 7x maginfication... the image is clear and crisp...&lt;br /&gt;Love this little mirror....would recommend this mirror anytime.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; sturdy. This one doesn&#x27;t tip over like some of the others like it do. The view is great as far as the mirror goes. Nothing I can do about the object in the mirror, lol!</li>
            <li> This is a well made, quality mirror. However note that the actual mirror size is only 5 inches wide and 7 inches high.&lt;br /&gt;The product description can be misleading: &amp;#34;Product Dimensions: 6.9 x 2 x 8.3 inches&amp;#34;.  Rating would have been 5 stars if the description hadn&#x27;t been confusing.</li>
            <li> Expensive for a mirror but it does the job.  Wish it were just a bit smaller. I have it on my desk at work and it takes up too much room</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a table mirror like this so I can&#x27;t compare it with other products. I will say that the reflection on both sides is perfectly clear, much better than those shaving mirrors I have come across in hotel bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small, which is great - I don&#x27;t want a large mirror taking up counter space. The reflective surface itself is 5\\&quot;x 7\\&quot;.  The base of the stand is 6 3/4\\&quot; across and the total height from the bottom of the stand to the top of the frame is 8 1/4\\&quot; inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a \\&quot;rubberized\\&quot; coating, which means it is less prone to being knocked off a wet counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since it has a purely functional, non-frilly design and a matte black finish, it is a good \\&quot;guy\\&quot; mirror.</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror which works so easy - whether putting on make-up or shaving (my husband).</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition (a day earlier than promised!), having been conscientiously wrapped and packaged. It is a handsome, sturdy mirror (ideal for men), with perfect refection on both sides. The quality is such that you would expect it to cost several dollars more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Quality materials and design.  Solid.  Very functional and sturdy.  Very happy.  Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Solid little mirror, I use for guitar practice to watch my fingers, decent price, built very well. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Nice mirror...I only wish it didn&#x27;t show all my facial flaws...but that isn&#x27;t the mirrors fault now it is?!  ;)</li>
            <li> I received the item that I ordered in \\&quot;perfect condition\\&quot;.  It was exactly what I needed to fullfill the purpose for which I needed.  The product is high quality and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pros: This mirror feels sturdy. It stays in place when you position it. The surfaces are clear and unblemished. It has a somewhat slip free feel to the surface. - Slightly rubberized.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Because of the way the magnifying side is shaped, it can be hard to find a focus point. Especially if you are trying to look at the side of your face (for example). It has no hole in the base for hanging on the wall, for  a hook or screw. The pivot points are on the long sides of the rectangle - so it&#x27;s more of an up and down view, than a side to side view. ( which I feel takes away from its usefulness ).&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement mirror. The mirror it replaced had a round magnifying side. I find the round preferable due to the even distortion around the sides. The magnification side on this mirror is rectangular, and the distortion is somewhat uneven.&lt;br /&gt;Over all not a bad mirror. Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Love, love this mirror.  Lightweight and perfect size for my needs.  Magnification is great.</li>
            <li> In the magnified image and the unmagnified image, mirror is far superior optically than others I have seen.  The stand does not scratch table surfaces.  It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The mirrors are good quality, especially for the price. The plain mirror is clear with a good reflection but the 7x magnified side is a bit impractical as I have to get very close to it to get a good image. The matt black finish looks good, the base sits well on level surfaces, and the tilt mechanism is smooth and solid.</li>
