            <li> Lately it&#x27;s been very difficult to find the deodorant in my area.  When I saw these packs on sale, the price was great and I bought as many as I could.  I love the deodorant.  It work the best for me.</li>
            <li> My husband has wore this deodorant for years and it is getting harder to find. Thanks to Amazon I don&#x27;t have to worry about going to 5 different stores trying to find it , they ship it to my door every six months. Very happy with this product and Amazons service.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. When RG came out with a new formula it caused chaffing so I could not use it.  There were only two stores that still carried the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; that did not cause me problems. We moved &amp; not one store carried this particular type of RG so Amazon auto ship is the place I turned to.  Great product!</li>
            <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> Good product. Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in 9 days.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves these and they have become hard to find in local stores.  The scent is very sporty and sexy.  Not overpowering.  I confess, sometimes I wear it too if it is looking like a very hot day out.</li>
            <li> My go to deodorant on very busy days where I know I&#x27;m going to be active/ have been very active.</li>
            <li> The only anti-perspirant that I can use.</li>
            <li> This is my preferred brand so the three pack was a great deal.  Clear application, clean smell, low key not over the top.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. It works great and, unlike the Fresh scent version, the smell is not overpowering. As others have said, the Active has gotten tough to find locally so I just ordered a dozen (lol) from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> All product are fantastic</li>
            <li> No stinky, no sweat&lt;br /&gt;Stock up on the Right Guard gel&lt;br /&gt;And you&#x27;ll be OK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right Guard Sport is a fresh, strong deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to protect you all day and the smell is not at all overpowering. I recommend it. On a related, but slightly tangential note: It is 2015 people. Why why why still use that white chalky deo that leaves its gross trail all over the place? Do yourself and the world a favor and GO WITH THE GEL!!</li>
            <li> I found this on sale on in a liquidation store. It wasn&#x27;t expired as most items in these store are. But this product was uncomfortable because it went on very sticky and clung to my tee-shirt. However, it didn&#x27;t leave a stain as some gels do. More importantly, it worked well. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy this product again, though. I think I would look for a solid.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and really like this deodorant, goes on smooth and works great! Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for many years, but am no longer able to find it in stores.  It is great to get it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Could not find this in any store anymore........This what I wanted and by using this site, I could still get it!</li>
            <li> ARRIVED ON TIME &amp; AS DESCRIBED, THANKS,  ART</li>
            <li> Finally in 3 oz size!</li>
