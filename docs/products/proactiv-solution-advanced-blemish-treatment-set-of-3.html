            <li> I love using it, because it works so effectively on my face. best thing ever invented for acne sufferers. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is very close to the expiration date. There is no way I will use all thre tubes before they expire.</li>
            <li> For a fourteen year old, so it seems to be working when he remembers to use it!  Kids love &#x27;em</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grad daughter who was having continuous  with acne.&lt;br /&gt;This Proactive advanced blemish cream cleared her face right- up.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered on time and packaged as shown on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this on the first signs of acne and it usually clears it up before it becomes a embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li> Best pimple medicine of all time. Received very quickly and packaged great. Put it on pimple at night again in the morning and pimple is gone. *only apply on clean skin!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to others to use for blemishes. I also recommend using honey for blemishes that is local natural honey. The honey will help with the scarring. The Proactiv product drys up the blemish.</li>
            <li> Proactive is a very good product for teenagers who tend to break out more with blemishes. This product is great for isolating treatment just where you want it.</li>
            <li> This product is use as needed when those emergency breakout occur ..the one here or there unexpected ones.  This product truly is effective  and I have tried several ones..THIS IS A KEEPER!...Thank you, Jodi</li>
            <li> When you can feel a blemish coming up from under your skin, put this on it immediately. Before you can even see the blemish on your face, it will decrease the pressure and stop it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. The packaging was perfect and so is the product. I appreciate this.I am extremely satisfied.Thank you:)</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product and she has gone through many products (and I don&#x27;t just mean acne treatment but I mean she tries EVERYTHING) over the years but she has always and consistently bought this for those pesky, want-them-gone-tomorrow, pimples.

            <li> It just made my face really dry and it didnt do anything for the blemishes..I&#x27;m really disappointed bc i thought it would be my saving grace.Hopefully it worked for someone else</li>
            <li> I bought these for the daughter of a friend and she loves it</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVED THE ITEM, GREAT PRODUCT, A+++</li>
            <li> After getting all gum ho about this product by their TV commercials, I was unhappy with the performance.  I gave a tube to my daughter and she gave it a similar review.  Too bad, I was hopping for something at least a little better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, very happy the product is as expected.  Buying in bulk definitely saves time and money.  I would love to do most of my shopping on Amazon and skip the stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream 2 weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve seen the best result so far. I wish I&#x27;d knew about this soon than purchasing Murad that did nothing for my acne.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got scammed by Guthy-Renker by signing up for Proactiv shipments, but I love their products.  I am thankful that they are all available on Amazon.  The spot treatment is better than plain old 6% benzoyl peroxide because there are moisturizing ingredients in it that keep your skin from getting irritated and peeling. I love this and use it on both large and small areas to keep cystic acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Purchased this a week ago and so far its working great. Seeing some progress on my face and my back. Highly recommend this product.</li>
