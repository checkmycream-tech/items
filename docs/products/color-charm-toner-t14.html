    <ol>
            <li>Happy Coloring!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I found an awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;Color</li>
            <li>It looks amazing!!</li>
            <li>Wella is a great company and has awesome products.</li>
            <li>Takes the brassiness out of bleached hair and leaves beautiful silver/blue tones.  </li>
            <li>but I am so happy with the results I had to-</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy I found it.</li>
            <li>It worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a darker silver, almost pewter, but it colored so evenly that the salt and pepper at the nape of my neck is now blended perfectly with the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it even made the darker brownish parts of my hair look better, happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Supplement this with the purple shampoos to keep it bright in between.</li>
            <li>I had never even done my own hair before, I just followed the directions and it came out great :)</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>Used with developer this week, &amp; love the tone adjustment in my hair!</li>
            <li>Charm Toner #T14 , really made my hair look awesome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled with Wella&#x27;s T14 toner, that I&#x27;m compelled to write a review to help others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well, I decided to take matters into my own hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BUT I figured I would try it on my own, that way</li>
            <li>, I was just hoping to add more silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely silver toner.</li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>Love the shade.</li>
            <li>this worked wonderfully on my brassy yellow hair!!</li>
            <li>And, yes, you can get Pravana on Amazon :-)</li>
            <li>but it is lovely</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I was very glad that I had not jumped right into doing it all over my head.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I found something fantastic!</li>
            <li>Thats when I knew I was gonna have to do another bleaching with 40developer, or a couple more light bleaches with a lower developer for it to turn all of my hair the color I want.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying two</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still some gold tints, but my hair looks fine.</li>
            <li>The placement of the color was great, but it was light orange, not beachy blonde.</li>
            <li>With some Shimmering Lights and a lot of conditioner I&#x27;ll be back to great in no time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t thrilled with my new colorist, who botched my ombre hair.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft with a touch of ash.  </li>
            <li>And I used this toner and loved how it toned blonde.</li>
            <li>Quick note to those who didn&#x27;t get the silver color they wanted.</li>
            <li>A little more \\&quot;shine\\&quot; would have been nice, maybe an additional product to get the shine.</li>
            <li>will come out a fairly ashy (not really silver but with hints) on bleached hair.</li>
            <li>This is similar to what I did for any years for some warm tan highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amaaazing at making yellow/somewhat orange hair a nice silver/grey/ashy blonde.</li>
            <li>It knocked the orange right out.</li>
            <li>Recently, i had stated doing my own roots and they came out pretty brassy</li>
            <li>my hair turned from blonde gray to white gray beautiful not brasy</li>
            <li>If you have some actual white hair you will most probably get a distinct blue on those parts which can be toned by washing with a little Dawn dish wash liquid, which isn&#x27;t all that great for your hair, so follow with a good hair mask or conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve written about a hair product</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to say that I was a hairdresser for 12 years, so I know what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>but maybe it would have even been better if i left it in longer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hairdressers tell me I will never be able to get to that white-ish blonde I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the Wella brand</li>
            <li>So, back to the real hairdresser who put in a bunch of highlights and a toner to try and break it up but still pretty gold and some orange (but better).</li>
            <li>Before doing this process, I tried to do as much research as possible, but I just couldn’t find many reviews for using this toner on brown hair.  </li>
            <li>Long story short(er), I LOVE the result.</li>
            <li>It takes the yellow blonde and turns it into beautiful ash blonde.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had my hair professionally done but even then always had a golden tone to my hair</li>
            <li>The results were... absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because you are missing this kind of toner in your bleach mix.</li>
            <li>needs to be a bit more blue to really tone out enough orange the first time though</li>
            <li>I have a subtle light ash brown ombre (level 5) with blond highlights (level 8) salon dye job that I did 6 months ago with about 2-3 inches of growth of virgin hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that my color finally came out to my liking!</li>
            <li>While I was happy at first with the color, as the weeks went by and the silver shimmer washed away due to shampooing, what I had left was a ash blond yellow color that I sought to get rid of...</li>
            <li>I used this on pre-lightened hair (bright yellow, slightly orange in areas).</li>
            <li>My naturalcolour is dark brown, but havebeen lightening my hair for many years.</li>
            <li>Anywho...I bleached twice with Quick Blue, then toned with Wella Color Charm T14.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this toner.</li>
            <li>then the longer parts of my hair (they were kinda white) and I highly recommend that you put this on the most yellow/brassy parts of your hair first for a few minutes before you add to the lightest parts</li>
            <li>However, the color did not last as long as I would have liked it to even though the product says &amp;#34;permanent.&amp;#34;  I will definitely be using this again!</li>
            <li>I started off bleaching my hair, then using the toner with 20 volume developer and stared doing my roots first (which were a pale yellow) because they were more yellow/brassy</li>
            <li>If your hair is dark to begin with,you&#x27;d obviously have to bleach it light first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share my story, since I have read many posts on the internet of other women hoping to achieve the same.  </li>
            <li>I followed instructions exactly, and left it in even longer than I was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Hair looked exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Actually I should say I HAD a light ash brown ombre – about a couple months after my salon visit, my hair was getting brassier and brassier and purple toning shampoo wasn’t doing much to help, so I wanted to do a little more heavy toning.</li>
            <li>(More of a dark blonde then orange).</li>
            <li>I decided with very little planning to go from a faded out red to blonde again, and after bleaching it out, Manic Panic&#x27;s Virgin Snow did not get rid of the gold and orange left over (Virgin Snow is great if you&#x27;re doing your roots, but not for hiding orange.)</li>
            <li>Luckily I had two bottles of T14 left from my previously blonde days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me several months to grow the highlights out of my hair, just so I could see how much gray I have now.  </li>
            <li>Read my review on the Pravana ChromaSilk Vivids (Silver).&lt;br /&gt;After living with brassy tones in my natural silver hair</li>
            <li>(Can be fixed with a purple toning shampoo)</li>
            <li>Might as well buy pure grey hair color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so anxious for my hair to turn silver, so my thought was to pull some hair through a frosting cap and bleach it as light as I could.  </li>
            <li>The result was just a light ash blonde, and I mean blonde - not silver like the swatch that is shown</li>

            <li> The result was just a light ash blonde, and I mean blonde - not silver like the swatch that is shown</li>
            <li> My natural color is dark brown (the pepper).</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dark brown (level 3).</li>
            <li> Used mixed with cooling violet 050 additive to achieve grey hair, works well.</li>
            <li> I wish i would of bought two or three of these as one tiny bottle doesint do all my hair so if i have long hair ur gunna wanna buy six of these trust me</li>
            <li> I wanted grey hair not yellow</li>
            <li> It is also AMAZING for getting rid of orange and gold tones from a bad bleach job.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t leave it in too long because it can start turning muddy/green.</li>
            <li> When you use t14 this will make you hair a grey purple color.</li>
            <li> (Depending on how long you leave it in).</li>
            <li> if you know what i mean haha.</li>
            <li> It will soften the pale color and remove the brassy yellow (remember to do your roots correctly and let it process long enough).</li>
            <li> Then wash the bleach out (without removing the cap), and dry the strands to apply the toner.  </li>
            <li> But seriously didn&#x27;t do much for toning.</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t turn out, not a lot of money wasted on expensive hairdressers :)</li>
            <li> I left mine on slightly shorter than the time suggested.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, makes slightly silvery blonde hair.</li>
            <li> this product does what&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have this I&#x27;d be in big trouble.</li>
            <li> I had cherry pink hair had to take that out</li>
            <li> Then I used a few drops as I had to dye the rest of my hair which had turned orange back to dark brown....</li>
            <li> I read the other customer reviews and decided to do it myself.</li>
            <li> This wouldn’t be so bad if my light ash brown/blond toned well, but unfortunately it didn’t get much of the brassiness out there either.  </li>
            <li> I have avg thick shoulder length hair and to achieve white hair post</li>
            <li> I told her I was unhappy and went back a few days later, and SAME THING.</li>
            <li> black</li>
            <li> I think my haiwould have been slightly bluish</li>
            <li> So this is a followup to the review written previously.</li>
            <li> (Little less damaging)</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dark brown.</li>
            <li> just a few drops and no orange at all.</li>
            <li> I waited a couple days/a few weeks in between my bleaches.</li>
            <li> If you are having problems reaching your pale champagne or</li>
            <li> then after a few add the Toner to the lighter parts of your hair and wait a few minutes!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on different conditioners, most recent one was this hideous smelling stuff by Davines Alchemic Silver Conditioner, (I really, really hate this stuff, but it does work, it just smells horrible!).</li>
            <li> I got a little nervous when my hair turned bluish/purple!</li>
            <li> My sister, who is also a hairdresser, told me that it is impossible to achieve a natural silver on my hair</li>
            <li> I always hated yellow blonde</li>
            <li> Add half of one of these bottles to your next bleach, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in your results.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my blonde hair goingbrassy, due to the base tones.</li>
            <li> It completely cancels out that awful orange you sometimes get with bleaching.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I did not want to start coloring it again</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my virgin hair lightened to a yucky reddish orange.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the silver tones shown in the hair sample.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> This stuff saved my butt today. I decided with very little planning to go from a faded out red to blonde again, and after bleaching it out, Manic Panic&#x27;s Virgin Snow did not get rid of the gold and orange left over (Virgin Snow is great if you&#x27;re doing your roots, but not for hiding orange.) Luckily I had two bottles of T14 left from my previously blonde days. It knocked the orange right out. There&#x27;s still some gold tints, but my hair looks fine. With some Shimmering Lights and a lot of conditioner I&#x27;ll be back to great in no time.&lt;br /&gt;This will come out a fairly ashy (not really silver but with hints) on bleached hair. It is also AMAZING for getting rid of orange and gold tones from a bad bleach job.</li>
            <li> I have avg thick shoulder length hair and to achieve white hair post black I strongly recommend buying two</li>
            <li> Quick note to those who didn&#x27;t get the silver color they wanted. Use Wella Color Charm  50 and mix in T14 together with volume 20 developer. This will get rid of orange/ brassy tones and give you the actual silver color you want. If your hair is dark to begin with,you&#x27;d obviously have to bleach it light first. If you have some actual white hair you will most probably get a distinct blue on those parts which can be toned by washing with a little Dawn dish wash liquid, which isn&#x27;t all that great for your hair, so follow with a good hair mask or conditioner. After doing all this you can use a cellophane treatment on your hair which helps to hold the color and protect the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written about a hair product but I am so happy with the results I had to- I&#x27;ve always had my hair professionally done but even then always had a golden tone to my hair I didn&#x27;t like.  Recently, i had stated doing my own roots and they came out pretty brassy orange- then I started playing hairdresser and tried doing boxed highlights- it was a yellows orange brassy disaster.  So, back to the real hairdresser who put in a bunch of highlights and a toner to try and break it up but still pretty gold and some orange (but better). After reading online and a trip to Sallys I used the T14 with 20 developer for about 15 minutes.  It looks amazing!! It&#x27;s the blonde I&#x27;ve always been trying to get!! Nice and soft with a touch of ash.  I&#x27;m a believer in this product!!</li>
            <li> My naturalcolour is dark brown, but havebeen lightening my hair for many years. I was tired of my blonde hair goingbrassy, due to the base tones. Tl4 made my hair the ash colour I have beentrying to achieve for years. I left mine on slightly shorter than the time suggested. I think my haiwould have been slightly bluish lf I left it on longer. This is the colour I will stick with.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that I was a hairdresser for 12 years, so I know what I&#x27;m doing.  I bought this product with the hopes that I could add some silver highlights to my salt and pepper hair; 50% of it is now silver.  My natural color is dark brown (the pepper). I&#x27;m so anxious for my hair to turn silver, so my thought was to pull some hair through a frosting cap and bleach it as light as I could.  Then wash the bleach out (without removing the cap), and dry the strands to apply the toner.  This is similar to what I did for any years for some warm tan highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me several months to grow the highlights out of my hair, just so I could see how much gray I have now.  Needless to say, I did not want to start coloring it again, I was just hoping to add more silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what I decided to do.  I cut a swatch of my hair and did the steps I outlined above.  I was very glad that I had not jumped right into doing it all over my head.  The result was just a light ash blonde, and I mean blonde - not silver like the swatch that is shown here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share my story, since I have read many posts on the internet of other women hoping to achieve the same.  My sister, who is also a hairdresser, told me that it is impossible to achieve a natural silver on my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll just have to wait it out. : (</li>
            <li> my hair turned from blonde gray to white gray beautiful not brasy</li>
            <li> needs to be a bit more blue to really tone out enough orange the first time though</li>
            <li> Takes the brassiness out of bleached hair and leaves beautiful silver/blue tones.  It completely cancels out that awful orange you sometimes get with bleaching.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the silver tones shown in the hair sample.</li>
            <li> Did not work well to tone the Orange brassy color out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Add half of one of these bottles to your next bleach, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in your results. It will soften the pale color and remove the brassy yellow (remember to do your roots correctly and let it process long enough). If you are having problems reaching your pale champagne or platinum blonde look it&#x27;s because you are missing this kind of toner in your bleach mix. Supplement this with the purple shampoos to keep it bright in between. Happy Coloring!</li>
            <li> Lovely silver toner. Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come out like the picture shows, but did get rid of some of the brasiness in my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Wella is a great company and has awesome products.</li>
            <li> Used mixed with cooling violet 050 additive to achieve grey hair, works well.</li>
            <li> So this is a followup to the review written previously. While I was happy at first with the color, as the weeks went by and the silver shimmer washed away due to shampooing, what I had left was a ash blond yellow color that I sought to get rid of...Fortunately I found something fantastic! Read my review on the Pravana ChromaSilk Vivids (Silver).&lt;br /&gt;After living with brassy tones in my natural silver hair I found an awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;Color Charm Toner #T14 , really made my hair look awesome! Sure it&#x27;s more of a darker silver, almost pewter, but it colored so evenly that the salt and pepper at the nape of my neck is now blended perfectly with the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used numerous purple shampoos designed to remove the yellowing in silver/white/grey hair. I have spent hundreds of dollars on different conditioners, most recent one was this hideous smelling stuff by Davines Alchemic Silver Conditioner, (I really, really hate this stuff, but it does work, it just smells horrible!).</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, makes slightly silvery blonde hair. But don&#x27;t leave it in too long because it can start turning muddy/green. (Can be fixed with a purple toning shampoo) I used this with a mixture of 10+20 volume developer to make 15vol. (Little less damaging)</li>
            <li> Love this color! I been asked before how I get my hair to be  ash blonde. I always hated yellow blonde this product does what&#x27;s expected. It takes the yellow blonde and turns it into beautiful ash blonde. I&#x27;ll have to stock up!</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly, several days before it was tried out, but did conceal the yellow in gray hair and came out silver.  A little more \\&quot;shine\\&quot; would have been nice, maybe an additional product to get the shine.</li>
            <li> I wish i would of bought two or three of these as one tiny bottle doesint do all my hair so if i have long hair ur gunna wanna buy six of these trust me they are veryyy tiny</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have this I&#x27;d be in big trouble. I had cherry pink hair had to take that out go back to white yellow. I wanted grey hair not yellow so used this product. Love the shade. Then I used a few drops as I had to dye the rest of my hair which had turned orange back to dark brown....just a few drops and no orange at all. Great product.</li>
            <li> thank you I am from SaudiArabia</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to do another dye. But seriously didn&#x27;t do much for toning. Might as well buy pure grey hair color. I think that&#x27;s what I will do next.</li>
            <li> I used this on pre-lightened hair (bright yellow, slightly orange in areas). I followed instructions exactly, and left it in even longer than I was supposed to. The results were... absolutely nothing. Hair looked exactly the same. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Amaaazing at making yellow/somewhat orange hair a nice silver/grey/ashy blonde.</li>
            <li> this worked wonderfully on my brassy yellow hair!! it definitely worked, i left it in for 30 mins but maybe it would have even been better if i left it in longer! i now have greyish ashy blondish hair... if you know what i mean haha. it even made the darker brownish parts of my hair look better, happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that will get my hair to the tone I&#x27;ve been wanting.  Yay</li>
            <li> I have a subtle light ash brown ombre (level 5) with blond highlights (level 8) salon dye job that I did 6 months ago with about 2-3 inches of growth of virgin hair. My natural hair color is dark brown (level 3). Actually I should say I HAD a light ash brown ombre – about a couple months after my salon visit, my hair was getting brassier and brassier and purple toning shampoo wasn’t doing much to help, so I wanted to do a little more heavy toning. I went to Sally’s initially intending on getting 10 volume developer with the Wella T14 toner.  The Sally’s staff member recommended that I get the 20 volume developer, even after I emphasized I didn’t want to go any lighter, because she was concerned the toner wouldn’t do anything so that’s what I ended up with.  I put the toner &amp; 20 vol developer in my hair, as per Wella’s instructions, and left it in for 20 minutes.  Unfortunately, my virgin hair lightened to a yucky reddish orange.  This wouldn’t be so bad if my light ash brown/blond toned well, but unfortunately it didn’t get much of the brassiness out there either.  Before doing this process, I tried to do as much research as possible, but I just couldn’t find many reviews for using this toner on brown hair.  So to you brunettes – take caution!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled with Wella&#x27;s T14 toner, that I&#x27;m compelled to write a review to help others.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with my new colorist, who botched my ombre hair. Basically, she took all the color away. I told her I was unhappy and went back a few days later, and SAME THING. Well, I decided to take matters into my own hands.&lt;br /&gt;I bought an old-school frosting kit and I applied to my ends and after 15 minutes, rinsed. The placement of the color was great, but it was light orange, not beachy blonde. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some online research, I semi-impulsively bought Wella&#x27;s T14 toner (formerly Silver Lady) and 20 developer. I poured 1 oz. of toner into bowl with 2 ounces of developer and mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned blue, which is what neutralizes orange tones. Long story short(er), I LOVE the result. It&#x27;s cool-toned blonde that&#x27;s not brassy. I left the formula on about 15-20 minutes. I think this stuff definitely delivers if you&#x27;re looking to remove orange/brass/warmth from brown hair that was lightened with permanent color. I&#x27;m SO happy I found it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this color as I&#x27;m always looking for something that would give me silvery highlights. I read the other customer reviews and decided to do it myself. I was so excited that my color finally came out to my liking! In the future, I will leave it on longer - about 25-30 minutes. I got a little nervous when my hair turned bluish/purple! However, the color did not last as long as I would have liked it to even though the product says &amp;#34;permanent.&amp;#34;  I will definitely be using this again! BTW, after the color faded, I went back to using Pravana shampoo to keep the silvery glow!! And, yes, you can get Pravana on Amazon :-)</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dark brown. I&#x27;ve had hairdressers tell me I will never be able to get to that white-ish blonde I wanted. BUT I figured I would try it on my own, that way if it doesn&#x27;t turn out, not a lot of money wasted on expensive hairdressers :) Anywho...I bleached twice with Quick Blue, then toned with Wella Color Charm T14. I left the toner on about 25 minutes. It worked GREAT. My hair is white/grayish blonde, just what I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this toner. I had never even done my own hair before, I just followed the directions and it came out great :)</li>
            <li> Does NOT come with developer!!! but it is lovely</li>
            <li> Used with developer this week, &amp; love the tone adjustment in my hair! Took 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> When you use t14 this will make you hair a grey purple color. (Depending on how long you leave it in). You wont see changes if your hair is orange. I had two bleach my hair 5 different times. (Using both 40&amp;20 developer). I waited a couple days/a few weeks in between my bleaches. HoweverI used the wella t14 on my hair while the ends on my hair was orange/red/strawberry blonde. My white roots turned purple/grey (the color I wanted), while the darker parts of my hair turned a darker blonde/orange. (More of a dark blonde then orange). Thats when I knew I was gonna have to do another bleaching with 40developer, or a couple more light bleaches with a lower developer for it to turn all of my hair the color I want.</li>
            <li> I started off bleaching my hair, then using the toner with 20 volume developer and stared doing my roots first (which were a pale yellow) because they were more yellow/brassy then the longer parts of my hair (they were kinda white) and I highly recommend that you put this on the most yellow/brassy parts of your hair first for a few minutes before you add to the lightest parts then after a few add the Toner to the lighter parts of your hair and wait a few minutes! I ended up with a silver/blonde color on my longer parts of my hair but had to go back to touch up my roots because they were still yellowish. This is my first time using the Wella brand and I like it. I posted a picture of my end results. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a prof. Hair Designer and a Goldwell Master Colorist. And I used this toner and loved how it toned blonde.</li>
