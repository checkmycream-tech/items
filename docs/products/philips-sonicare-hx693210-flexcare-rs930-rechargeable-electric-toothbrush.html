    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This system with the Sanitizer is the best one yet.   </li>
            <li>Flex care is the best.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend users couple the FlexCare along with the Waterpick Ultra Jet (another excellent product).</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes excellent mouthwashes that do not include alcohol or saccharin.</li>
            <li>I have perfect gums and perfect heart health, inspite of being overweight and sedentary.    </li>
            <li>And I want really excellent crud removal from between teeth, which I find inadequate with this unit.    </li>
            <li>Using a Sonicare twice a day preceeded by flossing, has resulted in perfect or near-perfect gum checks every dental visit.     </li>
            <li>PS, use the chat tool on philips website when you need your replacement, it is great!</li>
            <li>She said I was doing an excellent job.</li>

            <li>Best option for healthcare thats been released yet.  </li>
            <li>This is the best oral hygiene you can buy without going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Brushing your teeth with this thing is like going in for a routine cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>

            <li>Great product, the Dentist likes my teeth and asked me what toothbrush I was using.  </li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>great toothbrush</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>I think it is great.  </li>
            <li>The design of the handle and the way the head/brush attach is greatly improved over the Elite.  </li>
            <li>so this works great for 2 people.  </li>
            <li>Sharing works out great, and there are 2 spots in the UV holder</li>
            <li>: I think this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Still happy with the product, and would still buy it again.</li>
            <li>Still working great.</li>
            <li>I did some research online and found a great deal at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase for our family</li>
            <li>Have heard about all the germs that are on your toothbrush so the sanitizer is a great feature.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the look of the product is great.</li>
            <li>the mail\\&quot; (lol).</li>
            <li>Still happy I have it though.</li>
            <li>The massage function on the brush is a great gum stimulator.</li>
            <li>It works great and the sanitizer is a great addition.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>BTW, great when it worked.</li>
            <li>Great.      </li>
            <li>Make Philips care about keeping their customers happy.</li>
            <li>Product was recieved on time &amp; in great condition.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is still in great condition and I have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>It was a great product.    </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>it is pricey but is a great value.  </li>
            <li>If the product just works great, however, if you receive a product that doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t bother calling their customer service, just immediately return the product.  </li>
            <li>be warned, it seems like a great product when it works, but if you have a problem there will be no support from the company.</li>
            <li>: Hello Jennifer, welcome to Philips Consumer Lifestyle.</li>
            <li>PLUS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am writing this review not just because it does a great job ..</li>
            <li>This is a great brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great, but there is an issue where the motor dies after a year or so.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is great, almost 2 weeks between charges.</li>
            <li>Has been great for my gums.</li>
            <li>Great investment for your money and teeth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for $40 from craigslist a couple months ago after hearing from friends how great electronic toothbrushes were.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to have this item in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Packing was great.</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports and ADA rating are great testimony....</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The UV Sanitizer is a great feature also.</li>
            <li>This works great and my dentist wanted me to buy an electric model from them until I told them I had purchased the Philips Sonicare</li>
            <li>The sanitizer also works great too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, this toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>And your mouth feels great.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Flexcare gives you that \\&quot;dental cleaning\\&quot; great feel.  </li>
            <li>However, whoever is manufacturing these units are not doing a great job of quality control.  </li>
            <li>And, even without the UV, it&#x27;s great to have a place to stick your brushhead so that it&#x27;s not sitting out on the bathroom counter all day collecting flying bacteria from the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the one hand, it&#x27;s incredibly effective and, in my opinion, the best powered toothbrush out there.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade for an Elite Sonicare I happily owned for a year.</li>
            <li>Great Li-Ion battery: can recharge the toothbrush anytime without worrying about breaking the battery.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>great to take anywhere.</li>
            <li>cheaper brush replacements and the UV sanitizer are welcome additions.</li>
            <li>The design is great.</li>
            <li>A great buy to encourage thorough brushing.</li>
            <li>The variable settings are a great feature.  </li>
            <li>It is definetely a great buy.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was great until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>It was a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Otherwise everything is great.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning results are great while there&#x27;s no harm to the gums.</li>
            <li>Great service, great 2-year warranty.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great product.  </li>
            <li>Either way, this is a great toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush...when it works.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>I agree it&#x27;s a great toothbrush</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>All of us seem to agree that this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I bought it;</li>
            <li>Great buy...</li>
            <li>However, this product is great</li>
            <li>The truth is this piece is great.</li>
            <li>I wish we could avoid buying these toothbrushes but they are so great for your teeth.</li>
            <li>The product works great</li>
            <li>and now the fact that it is, makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>The two-week startup mode is a great feature, because this brush takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>The UV Sanitizer is great.</li>
            <li>and I am sooo happy I did.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a great investment</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the front of the teeth</li>
            <li>The sanitizer works great</li>
            <li>The pro brush head is also designed well and it cleans great.  </li>
            <li>The pro brush head is also designed well and it cleans great.  </li>

            <li>this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>Great thing is that it has the travel charger for up to 220V.</li>
            <li>Greatly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I knew that dentists recommended them, but just couldn&#x27;t imagine what was so great about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The charging station is great, looks sleek and compact and there is a travel charger as well.</li>
            <li>: Performance is great.</li>
            <li>This is also great for my kids.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonci care is really great.</li>
            <li>but here the prices are GREAT.</li>
            <li>This works great with no complaints.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Easily recommended, great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>BTW, the item worked great for 2 years.</li>
            <li>I continue to get great feedback from my dentist and the Sonicare</li>
            <li>The timer is great for kids...</li>

            <li>Great buy for the health of your teeth and for convenience and brushing options.</li>
            <li>and I get great use out of the Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>But you get used to it, and my teeth look and feel great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I think it&#x27;s a great product when it works.</li>
            <li>It is great for my gums too.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still buy one every year for $80 a pop because they work so great.</li>
            <li>The max care mode which includes brushing and massage works great.  </li>
            <li>I have not been happy with the 9400</li>
            <li>is great for travel.</li>
            <li>all is great.</li>
            <li>Dental checkups have been shorter too as the toothbrush does a great job of removing any buildup before it can become plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>Brush still works great though</li>
            <li>The sonicare was delievered as ordered and works great.  </li>
            <li>and I end up drooling and getting toothpaste spatter all over the bathroom lol.</li>
            <li>this item has made my teeth so happy.</li>
            <li>ifferent colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush-</li>
            <li>My dentist will be so happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The GO mode is great for when you just need to freshen up after a meal.  </li>

            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, probably could do without the sanitizer part.</li>
            <li>Automatic timing and a reminder to \\&quot;switch\\&quot; locations is great.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Also the cleaning apparatus is a great addition.  </li>
            <li>Great product and a great price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel and look great.</li>
            <li>I get especially important.</li>
            <li>Great results from this toothbrush.  </li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s been great,</li>
            <li>, just great</li>

            <li>This is a very nice toothbrush system.</li>

            <li>Awesome investment!  : )</li>
            <li>This is the latest in that chain and continues to improve this excellent product.     </li>
            <li>The one we just tossed away was a replacement we received 6 months ago and it literally had a mind of its own - - it would turn on and off by itself when not in use and would wake us like an alarm clock!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Started spontaneously turning on sometimes to, like it&#x27;s possessed!    </li>
            <li>While all models have done their job better than anything else, this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li>love it as i get a thorough brush with the best results.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I loved this toothbrush, works great.</li>
            <li>The best of all: the feeling of \\&quot;dentist cleaned\\&quot; teeth makes brushing enjoyable.</li>
            <li>You will pay more for this product, but will be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It is really awesome being able to sanitize my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was good and I am quite happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Toothbrush with Sanitizer is an outstanding product and excellent value.</li>
            <li>For the time that it worked, it worked perfectly; my hygienist was always pleased.</li>
            <li>Even better still is the UV sanitizer - it&#x27;s WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li>Great brush, brushes my teeth good, massages my gums.</li>
            <li>You honestly cant beat a Sonicare!</li>
            <li>in all, I think it is the MOST WONDERFUL ITEM I&#x27;VE PURCHASED.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt wonderful, very clean.</li>
            <li>great brushes fit my handle well and are in perfect order.  </li>
            <li>That was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>I needed to call the company to set up the brush but customer service was pleasant and helpful.</li>
            <li>, it is well worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li>IS RICH LIKE THE CEO OF Sonicare!!!  </li>
            <li>Currently I am very satisfied with the system and feel my teeth and gums get a great workout</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does a great job cleaning my teeth while stimulating my gums!</li>
            <li>UV sanitizer is an excellent idea and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with my experience in purchasing it from the Amazon website too because the process was easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it sounds like a great tool :)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years with very good results as asserted by my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>The LED&#x27;s are bright and show up well in a lit bathroom allowing you to choose your desired settings with ease.</li>
            <li>Good equipment</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, everyone I know has a sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if I had gum disease, or some disease spread by oral contamination, I&#x27;d think it was a good idea, but frankly?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.    </li>
            <li>Good as new.er I hope.</li>
            <li>Good reports from my hygienist since using this electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to but seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>it does good job</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is much superior to the Oral-B we phased out.  </li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be a good sign.</li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be a good sign.</li>
            <li>The charging station is fairly compact and interfaces well with</li>
            <li>cause I just don&#x27;t tend to give things superior</li>
            <li>Works really good</li>
            <li>but it seems to do a good job.....</li>
            <li>One reviewer here said this item is teeth licking good</li>
            <li>One reviewer here said this item is teeth licking good</li>
            <li>I bought the FlexCare to replace my Elite, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>My much loved Braun NEVER worked this well.</li>
            <li>Battery life it really good also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that I like the Flexcare fairly well.  </li>
            <li>and I get a good even brushing on all parts of my mouth.     </li>
            <li>but since dentist recommended, thought it would be a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I took good care of the toothbrush, never dropping it, abusing, etc.</li>
            <li>so I guess this is a good indicator to let one know its been in use.    </li>
            <li>For years I used an Oral B product that I thought did a good job.</li>
            <li>Good product and a good value.</li>
            <li>I loved this brush before it died.</li>
            <li>looks good,   </li>
            <li>I have not had an electric toothbrush for years but this one seems to do a good job and our dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li>my dentist told me that I was doing so good that he was going to change my cleanings to every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I ended up making my decision based on aesthetics and good price for this product.  </li>
            <li>SUPERIOR CLEANING.</li>
            <li>She believes the FlexCare does a superior job of cleaning.    </li>
            <li>The good again</li>
            <li>This is a good product that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Genetically I&#x27;ve been blessed with good teeth</li>
            <li>, she told me things looked really good.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads fit perfectly, and do not seem to get any gunk underneath where they attach to the unit.</li>
            <li>Might be good if you shared the brush AND the brush head.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this toothbrush, it gave me the cleanest brush I ever had without going to the dentist office.  </li>
            <li>I hope the results are as good as she(the dentist) expects.</li>
            <li>I chose the Sonicare Ultra Flex since it was fully featured, and amazon had a good price and rebate on it.     </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; mode is supposed to be the easiest on the gums but not as good with the cleaning</li>
            <li>but I have no idea if it is doing any good.    </li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I am a sonicare customer for life, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>It feels good on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>and I loved that it came with 2 brush heads rather then just one size.</li>
            <li>She said that they looked really good</li>
            <li>and I figured I could do just as good a job myself.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that this toothbrush does come with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>It arrived in time and was in good shape, just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Was good while it worked though.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
            <li>Good points:  </li>
            <li>The Sonic Flexcare product is superior to another electric toothbrush we used for years.  </li>
            <li>For a fair while, I just didn&#x27;t want to take this with me when traveling.  </li>
            <li>given it 5 stars because the quality and performance are so good, but you have to decide if you want to spend all that money on what, when all is said and done, is just a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Reeve.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved every Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned,</li>
            <li>The battery holds a good charge (2wks from one charge) and I sanitize it once</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 stars because it was a good brush while it lasted.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Good day.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush for</li>
            <li>A good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>I know there are others out there, but why change a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good to have a travel charger, also.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare is good, but don&#x27;t bother with the UV sterilizer...  </li>
            <li>Makes mouth and gums feel good.</li>
            <li>I have always believed there are good things to spend money on and</li>
            <li>the grandkids both have braces, and they loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved that toothbrush and never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with it because it cleans all of my teeth so well.    </li>
            <li>this was a superior product.  </li>
            <li>B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] cleans just as good</li>
            <li>The cylindrical shape of the toothbrush would be perfect to use with two high-powered (and widely available and inexpensive) 2700mAh</li>
            <li>The cylindrical shape of the toothbrush would be perfect to use with two high-powered (and widely available and inexpensive) 2700mAh</li>
            <li>but they claimed it wasnt good for that product.  </li>
            <li>Good investment.  </li>
            <li>Combined with good flossing and mouth wash</li>
            <li>Good product that all should be using.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never looked or felt this good.  </li>
            <li>I also like the idea of the timer so that you are getting a thorough cleaning..........almost as good as going to the dentist.....and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I just plop um on the peg, facing any direction and they fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>Loved it while it worked</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s doing a good job, and I like it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my teeth feel and look as good as if I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>The cleanness of your teeth and the massage in your gums are much superior.  </li>
            <li>All the information I found on  Philips Sonicare was good</li>
            <li>The number of options available with this toothbrush is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I almost gave up on this manufacturer even though I found it superior to the Oral brand brush.</li>
            <li>Good tooth brush</li>
            <li>It is the best I have found at keeping my teeth so amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush does an excellent job of leaving your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought another one because I found it at a great price, so hopefully I&#x27;m more successful with this one.</li>
            <li>This however, is an exceptional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy because I&#x27;ve had already a couple of oral surgeries and sure don&#x27;t want to go through it again.</li>
            <li>Great product, much better than the Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>My wife and I both use the Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes We are very pleased with how well the toothbrush cleans  our teeth.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Then the hygienist whipped out a demo brush, a lighted model of teeth and gums and gave me a very interesting presentation.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It also is great for building healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My sanitizer is still working, and I am still very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>you have a great product...please make a more reliable product.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best one ever and totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the service from Sonic.</li>
            <li>I think it was a great buy for the price &amp; the fact that I am taking much better care of my teeth by using it.</li>
            <li>Very elegant design, battery lasts about 1 month for brushing 2 min twice per day</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade to a Flexcare model and am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love the massaging settings, the cleaning settings are great.</li>
            <li>I also love the UV cleaner because it makes a great storage place for the brush head</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this toothbrush greatly</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better than getting a great review from your dentist and this toothbrush will give you that satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very healthy because of them.  </li>
            <li>That, of course, is the quickest road to the dentist&#x27;s, a place we all know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after trying this toothbrush, I&#x27;m very pleased to know that the number of trips I will be taking to the dentist will soon rapidly diminish.</li>
            <li>LOL I am sure with time</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the switch.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be keeping his teeth very healthy and gums.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, thoroughly cleans your teeth and there are a couple of additions that make it just that much better.  </li>
            <li>Great dental checkups as well :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare FlexCare has a mind / programing of it&#x27;s own which for me is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good toothbrush with easily accessible features.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the best brushing habits or the cleaniest teeth, but my dentist was amazed at how clean my teeth where after using this for 3 months! &amp;#34;Your teeth or extremely clean!</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I felt around my teeth and the gums felt great and very clean, even between the teeth without flossing.</li>
            <li>free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.used to holding the brush at the required angle, it cleaned my teeth wonderfully, but more of that in a moment.</li>
            <li>The original toothbrush lasted form many years and provided excellent checkups.</li>
            <li>I love the attached sanitizer, as I am somewhat of a germaphobe!</li>
            <li>The first one was great!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love these electric brushes!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Add all that into the price, and it&#x27;s a winning combination!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>:) Cheers!</li>
            <li>Use the toothbrush for 4 minutes top and bottom and you will not have placque!</li>
            <li>Well I bought and tried and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using a Sonicare e-series for about a year before switching to the FlexCare model and I love it!  </li>
            <li>We just replaced them a month ago with this newer version and really LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush!  </li>

            <li>My husband and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the ability to change modes, and to have a longer brush time if you want!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love brushing my teeth with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>And yes, sure does make my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Top notch product!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re so glad that we did!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!    </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing it has the UV Sanitizing feature which kills 99% of germs on the brush head!      </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!  </li>
            <li>Great product, helps keep teeth and gums clean and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>so you will know how to use it, how you use it and make sure you get the best clean for your teeth.      </li>
            <li>Product is easy to use and the sanitizer is a great addition.  </li>
            <li>After brushing, the gums have a pleasant healthy tingling.</li>
            <li>two heads have been defective and they replaced the first but claim that there is no warranty on the heads!!!!  </li>
            <li>The Flexcare looked so great,   all was fine during the slower break in time,   but as soon as it was over, and it began going faster,  Now each time I use it, while brushing the brushhead keeps falling off ,  over and over again.   </li>
            <li>It reminds me of an Apple computer--almost a work of art; easy to use; very effective.</li>
            <li>Very nice feature and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel great after brushing (I like the massage setting), and I am very satisfied with the how clean my teeth</li>
            <li>life is amazing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s downright amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I just wish Sonicare would provide more brightly colored rings.  </li>
            <li>This is an Amazing toothbrush, with 40,000 strokes a minute</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing thing.  </li>
            <li>Plus the UV light to keep the germs at bay is a great thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this is an amazing gadget.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel amazing after I use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it for a week, I have to say the results are amazing</li>
            <li>This was amazing product i used.</li>
            <li>And if you are an Advanced user and want a simpler experience, the FlexCare models are great.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare support is also amazing-</li>
            <li>importantly, it does a great brushing job.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare Toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>but these things always break at some point and Philips Customer Care is amazing.</li>
            <li>toothbrush itself cleans amazingly well.</li>
            <li>which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I do wish this model came with two handles, but instead my wife and I just take turns and switch out our own heads.</li>
            <li>(but it&#x27;s nice to have one</li>
            <li>I think they best Option really is the Quad-placer</li>
            <li>and I both were looking for our own head but extras aren&#x27;t too pricey on amazon.  </li>
            <li>They do work excellently, however is Philips really making an outrageious profit on them?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably never use the 1-minute \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; option, but it&#x27;s nice to have if you&#x27;re strict about brushing after meals and take the brush with you on the go.  </li>
            <li>And a 2-year warranty is nice.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are slimmer, too, and the unit just has a nice, futuristic look to it.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a travel charger and a nice carry case, including plastic covers for the brushes.    </li>
            <li>When I want to use the massage setting, though, it is nice to have.</li>
            <li>you honest.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>(They liked the idea of the UV Sanitizer).</li>
            <li>Also provided is a handy travel kit with separate portable charger.    </li>
            <li>And the \\&quot;Go\\&quot; is really nice for between meals</li>
            <li>After rave reviews from family and friends that own one, I decided to purchase a Sonicare for myself.  </li>
            <li>The sanitizer is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>-UV Santizer helps to &#x27;warm the brush&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I was also very impressed with how fast the toothbrush showed up in my mailbox.</li>
            <li>Have a nice day.rse</li>
            <li>Have a nice day.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But, everyone has there own sense of perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes when I travel, we both need our own unit.</li>
            <li>I see some nice improvements over that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I each own the Sonicare</li>
            <li>I just made sure I&#x27;d check the reputation of the seller which was good and ask them if the box was sealed.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of having my toothbrush sanitized evertime I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 times using it before I liked how it felt on my teeth.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of pricey</li>
            <li>The best part is probably the ease of cleaning, since the FlexCare model has much fewer crevices to trap the gunk.  </li>
            <li>The addition of the UV Sanitizer is quite nice.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is nice too, keeps the brush heads out of the way as well as sanitizing them.    </li>
            <li>Definitely better than manual brushing and surprisingly superior to the electric rotary toothbrush I had been using.  </li>
            <li>features on this unit all work as advertised, and are actually handy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>If the sanitizer does what it claims, it&#x27;s a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Nice to rotate them on usage.</li>
            <li>I really liked the sonic toothbrush until yesterday when it would no longer charge.  </li>
            <li>Ignore these reviews at you own risk.</li>
            <li>If you are not using it, it&#x27;s still nice storage for the 2 brush heads.</li>
            <li>In under 15 minutes the courteous and helpful representative walked me through a series of diagnostic problems attempting to pinpoint the source of the malfunction.  </li>
            <li>It kind of froze up...</li>
            <li>No biggie, actually a nice feature.</li>
            <li>Best price on line and and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>So, from time to time, I find the toothbrush spontaneously changing to an unwanted setting while brushing.  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]I have owned Philips Sonciare toothbrushes before and always liked them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on co-workers comments and I have to be honest</li>
            <li>He is thrilled with its performance and the results.   </li>
            <li>Nice compact design for the bathroom and even a travel charger is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, I am amazed how effective the system is at getting rid of food between teeth that flossing didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>They basically told me to find my own source.</li>
            <li>I like almost everything about this product:&lt;br /&gt;Choice of settings: 1 minute setting is nice</li>
            <li>It seems twice as effective.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is excellent, but it is very noisy.  </li>
            <li>The biggest drawback is that it has its own timer on when to shutoff</li>
            <li>It is compact and the cord storage and travel charger are really handy.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the battery were replaceable.</li>
            <li>Draw your own conclusions on why Sonicare does not offer that technology.</li>
            <li>The travel charge is nice</li>
            <li>it is just as effective  in cleaning</li>
            <li>I researched this tooth brush and have been an enthusiastic fan for the 10 months since purchase.  </li>
            <li>Your Dentist is like your Mom and Dad:  really, they just want what&#x27;s best for you.  </li>
            <li>Battery life depends on how you use it, and the nice thing about the Sonicare is that you can change your mind any time:  </li>
            <li>The variable brushing speeds are a nice touch</li>
            <li>Then I realized I was the one suffering for my own pride here.</li>
            <li>so that is a nice option to have.  </li>
            <li>இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice sleek look to its design - this is the toothbrush that George Jetson would be using before he starts his 3-hours-a-day workdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always use its MaxCare setting, a nice mixture of teeth cleaning and gum massage.  </li>
            <li>But along with the $8 replacement brush heads, I image that Philips is making a tidy profit from their premium Sonicare model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is a nice addition as well.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t had a cavity since....</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Flexcare rechargable sonic toothbrush and sanitizer is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>You still need to do bi annual cleanings with us, but I&#x27;m impressed at how much they have improved!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for two years now</li>
            <li>I really liked the Oral B</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t ask what kind of tooth brush I was using, and wasn&#x27;t offered a tooth brush after the visit.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush comes with a handy gauge that indicates its charge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to scraping my own teeth every couple of weeks.     </li>
            <li>I would have liked to receive a docking station that would hold 2 brush heads, as my husband and I both use one Sonicare and switch out the brush heads.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to be a good toothbrush, better than the Sonicare of 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>UV sanitizer is nice.</li>
            <li>I had a cheaper Sonicare before this, the kind that use the twist on brush heads.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a great unit, well made, and totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!!!  </li>
            <li>The end result is a squeakly clean, refreshed mouth that feels great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s always taken pretty good care of my teeth, and am proud of a life-long record of (almost) no cavities.</li>
            <li>The ultraviolet brush head sanitizer is great for knowing that your brush head is clean every time you use it.</li>
            <li>Currently, I&#x27;m a happy owner of a diamond clean, which I purchased after this model stopped working.</li>
            <li>replaced an older model, was really impressed by the updates and options.</li>
            <li>My friend uses this and said her dentist said her teeth were basically clean of plaque and gums in great shape</li>
            <li>so I knew what I was getting: an exceptional toothbrush that cleans your teeth way better than a manual one does.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I always thought I was brushing good and that my teeth were clean until I tried this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>The customer service crew couldn&#x27;t be friendlier or more helpful - very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I wanted something more hygienic, and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The problem I experienced with this newer unit is the battery says full charge and it is running</li>
            <li>I did you have the perfect clean mouth and no bad breath.</li>
            <li>This is very handy for those of us who don&#x27;t always keep up as easily with the printed manuals, or who prefer to be able to text search the manual for the information</li>
            <li>Also, the new toothbrush sanitizer is awesome.</li>
            <li>Best part of the new design?</li>
            <li>The new one works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>: In this situation, my best suggestion would be to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Awesome brush, but honestly i don&#x27;t use the &#x27;sensitive&#x27;, &#x27;massage&#x27; or &#x27;Max Care&#x27; options</li>
            <li>I was back on the internet searching for my beloved Philips Sonic toothbrush, and found the best ever yet, yes the Sonic flexcare with UV sanitizer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good-looking, easy to use, does the job, and feels good.  </li>
            <li>It makes perfect sense to proactively take good care of your teeth/gums in order to prevent future issues.  </li>
            <li>Going with this system was a great choice, and I quickly grew accustomed to the feel.  </li>
            <li>Having the portable brushes made it easy for us and kept us in a good dental hygiene situation.</li>
            <li>The mode selection button presses very easily and you will wind up changing brushing modes while you are brushing.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the stand that recharges the toothbrush works well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>But this also makes it very easy to accidentally turn off when you are moving the toothbrush around and twisting your wrist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use and comes with an informative instruction manual.</li>
            <li>Very strong, my teeth are already noticeably whiter  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li>The sanitizer is great since it means I always have a clean brush, and it also keeps the cat from chewing on it when I&#x27;m not home :-)</li>
            <li>Anyway, after a lot of work, my teeth are finally nice and healthy, and I bought this toothbrush - Philips Sonicare</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you love this warped and amazing logic?    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall definitely worth the great cleaning you get.  </li>
            <li>far as a toothbrush goes they are the best.  </li>
            <li>The best product by far.</li>
            <li>I liked the option to be able to set it on max care to get the teeth done and the gums massaged.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with how my teeth feel after using this plus the brush is so much better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping this will allow me to drop one of the visits if the home cleaning is more effective than before.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping this will allow me to drop one of the visits if the home cleaning is more effective than before.</li>
            <li>The unit comes with 3 color-coded rings for households with more than one user, and a nice travel bag and travel charger.</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s cost, when you think of how many in a family it can be utilized by, the cost is greatly effective.  </li>
            <li>It is clear that this is the best on the market and my dentist will attest to that statement.</li>
            <li>If this continues to perform the way it has so far I will be very happy.</li>
            <li>The best one so far.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Customer service was excellent and sent me a replacement with a postage paid return for the old brush</li>
            <li>It is by far the best toothbrush my wife and I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>This one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good to know that there is something in my bathroom that is 99% germ free.  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizing system seems like a good idea, just put the brush head in, push a button and UV light cleans any bacteria on the brush head.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months and never had to use the sanitizer feature, so if you want to save the money, you can buy the lower model and still get most of the benefits.  </li>
            <li>The Flexcare was the best of all of them so far, both in streamlined design, charger size, dual-voltage capability and brush head design.    </li>
            <li>I have gone through everything from the old manual ones to the so called best electric ones from Oral B and Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was, by far, the best deal out there.</li>
            <li>When dealing with oral hygiene, I wanted the best and all the research pointed towards the Philips Sonicare for all the features it offers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have wanted one for 10 years but never knew how important it was till I read the reviews of others that had bought one and are now getting good checkups.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li>The first year it worked great; all the features were nice and dandy.</li>
            <li>This is truly a wonderful product if you want to keep  your teeth strong and healthy, and to give you a smile that&#x27;ll light up a room!</li>
            <li>has a toothbrush type for strong or gentle, a massager, and best of all</li>
            <li>but even without knowing how to use those features, right out of the box (and after a charge) it works great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy!  </li>
            <li>Called customer care and after making me take the bulb out (not that easy!) and replace it</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!</li>
            <li>UPDATE: Still going strong!</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love them!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I bought their original electric toothbrush and loved it.  </li>
            <li>So definitely a good replacement for the original.</li>
            <li>Took the handle and brush on a 9 day vacation, no chance to recharge...and it worked flawlessly and powerfully the whole time!!  </li>
            <li>The good: Great cleaning, comfortable grip, the brush timer is very handy (although I think it should be programmed with times for chewing surfaces instead of just front and back tooth surfaces)</li>
            <li>It gives a real &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling, very smooth teeths to the tongue.  </li>
            <li>it has to be the most powerful sonicare Ive ever experienced with all the options as well ?</li>
            <li>Bought for my 12 year old son for him to brush better and has worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I knew this was a great selling prodeuct but wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works exceptionally well and is light weight.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job, my teeth feel as clean as when they are cleaned by the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Its amazing, you can get the clean that you get at the dentist at home with this product!</li>
            <li>This is our first automatic toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but a great improvement over manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>It is great at first, but then breaks.</li>
            <li>Pretty neat stuff and my teeth feel great.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is just as good as the other one - which means EXCELLENT.  </li>
            <li>is the best solution for brushing because it apparently does everything by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my First Electronic brush and i am happy that i had made the decision to buy this.</li>
            <li>Having used this product for a month now and gotten over the intense tickling it originally caused I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>work great for the first month.</li>
            <li>And the more i use, the more i enjoy brushing my teeth cause the sensation from the vibration seems like a good message.     </li>
            <li>It keeps my teeth bright and clean and I love the sanitizing ability.  </li>
            <li>And I find it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>dental and gum care are so very important.  </li>
            <li>I had delivery issues from the post office loosing my order and the replacement order went very smooth from Amazon though I had to call as the e-mail customer service needs some work.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; travel case is a joke, being that it is made from canvas and very cheap, I give it two stars.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; travel case is a joke, being that it is made from canvas and very cheap, I give it two stars.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and after each brushing session my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It is an exceptional product, my dental hygenist always remarks how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li>The brushes do stand up on their own on the counter, although they&#x27;re fairly easy to knock over.</li>
            <li>Brushing with the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush is a positive joy.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel as smooth as glass after using it, like you have just gotten out of the dentist, or better!</li>
            <li>The santizer is nice, very easy to use, and gives some confidence you&#x27;re keeping your brush head clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the new, slim, snap-on heads as a great improvement over those gunk-collecting screw top types.  </li>
            <li>The handle is also slimmer and more comfortable to hold, the design couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything is real easy to maintain and clean or replace parts from the diagrams provided.</li>
            <li>It has worked just fine and the automatic timer feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Talk about a HUGE difference!  </li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>Replacement love this product.</li>
            <li>If I can get 5 year usage, I will be pleased.     </li>
            <li>should I be going somewhere for more than a week).</li>
            <li>to help keep my teeth in top shape.  </li>
            <li>2 1/2 years later and this toothbrush system is still working flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they kept that on there.</li>
            <li>So, I have to floss more diligently than I have in years now.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!nt.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but the Sonicare is much better.</li>
            <li>(it is more efficient to use the Sonic).</li>
            <li>The newer ones even more so IMHO.  </li>
            <li>Even the best of products occasionally have a quality issue, i.e. the proverbial \\&quot;Lemon\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush and the options it has.</li>
            <li>The one I have now is a HX6932 with the sealed top to keep the crud out.</li>
            <li>Did marketing do this on purpose to sell more units? ?</li>
            <li>I have owned four Sonicare toothbrushes over many years.  </li>
            <li>Love the benefits of using the Sonicare</li>
            <li>but I still love Sonicare toothbrushes, so I settled on four stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly glad I switched.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love the timer on it</li>
            <li>I love the UV sanitizer as well...</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s just a ploy to sell more brushes</li>
            <li>I doubt they cost more than a dollar to manufacture.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the most awesome toothbrush ever invented!  </li>
            <li>will be much better.</li>
            <li>They are as smooth as they are when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office!    </li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>The FlexCare multiple cleaning choices, the sealed brush/unit connection and brush cleaning system are  excellent feature improvements.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare brushes for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>We both love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Just sputtered on and off, no matter how many buttons I pushed, or curse words I called it.  </li>
            <li>Love it, need I say more?</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and my kids like to use it too.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I do love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>But then I read the review &amp;#34;Pay more for the better design&amp;#34; by College Jane</li>
            <li>I love the thinness and how light it is!</li>
            <li>My favorite?</li>
            <li>Love these electric brushes!just in case).</li>
            <li>i love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A bit over the top?</li>
            <li>I wholeheartedly believe if everyone brushed with a toothbrush like this, dentists would lose a great deal of business!</li>
            <li>I wholeheartedly believe if everyone brushed with a toothbrush like this, dentists would lose a great deal of business!</li>
            <li>Overall, awesome purchase.</li>
            <li>Somehow the seals around the top must have leaked.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has the UV sanitizer to kill off germs</li>
            <li>As to does it work, I think so, although my gums don&#x27;t feel that much better.  </li>
            <li>I really love the Sonicare toothbrushes and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU!! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Flexcare model now for 2 months and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely pleased with Amazon</li>
            <li>The additional colour rings to differentiate cleaning heads are perfect (the colours are pastel and not garish at all, in keeping with the overall design).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to take the more bulky UV sanitizer unit with</li>
            <li>I had not been to the dentist for many years so 6 months ago when I did go, I had a lot of dental work to be done.</li>
            <li>My old-school Elite was more reliable than this dog.    </li>
            <li>I Love Love</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare FlexCare is an outstanding purchase.</li>
            <li>My roommate was so impressed with my love of this toothbrush she purchased one for herself last week.  </li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m getting a better cleaning;</li>
            <li>This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>I would of had one many years ago</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that they just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this product performs and the results.</li>
            <li>I like to hear from some more users of this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought 5 of these tooth brushes in November of 2010, kept one for myself, and gifted the others to my brothers and sisters.</li>
            <li>My teeth are cleaner and more polished, and my mouth feels cleaner along the gumline and in-between teeth.</li>
            <li>it would not die but thought I should get something more up to date.  </li>
            <li>more like 7 months and has ceased to function in the fashion already described.  </li>
            <li>This is the best possible way to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the UV sanitizer and travel case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be able to see the results.</li>
            <li>, I guess I won&#x27;t be purchasing another sonicare unless I know they can make a better unit.</li>
            <li>Better for me with receeding gum problems.     </li>
            <li>It has a timer built-in, so you always brush for the appropriate time.  </li>
            <li>They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better.</li>
            <li>I still bought more of their products, because it&#x27;s just mo[[ASIN</li>
            <li>But, I won&#x27;t buy any more of Sonicare if their product ruin my teeth like their latest one.</li>
            <li>What a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>The two settings I use most often are the \\&quot;Go</li>
            <li>The sanatation devise is appealing, but think twice.</li>
            <li>the Sonicare is so much better.</li>
            <li>I recently had my teeth cleaned, and my dentist commented on how great my gums are doing!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better about this product is the UV storage container.</li>
            <li>We had a Sonicare before but after 4 years of using it, it gave up, so we ordered the latest model.</li>
            <li>: We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.&lt;br /&gt;Harry :</li>
            <li>but when the FlexCare came out it was recommended as even better as a stain remover ..</li>
            <li>Because I have had so many of the products over the years ..</li>
            <li>I should have known better that to buy anything from Philips.  </li>
            <li>and we love it.</li>
            <li>She is well pleased with it;.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I should have known better, but I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>After 45 seconds of \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;massage\\&quot;, the Quadpacer signal indicated it was time for a change of location, as it did faithfully three more</li>
            <li>According to the booklet, the power will increase after this for 13 more brushings, by which time I will have grown to love the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let the charging process continue and play with it some more</li>
            <li>I agree with all of the reviews here, but there is one thing more</li>
            <li>I notice this when I am able to increase the power of my \\&quot;waterpik dental water</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly one of the best thing I have for my personal use!</li>
            <li>I was going to the dentist to do a cleaning every 3 months for many years</li>
            <li>Just like Phillips, their sonicare is an extremely most valuable product.  </li>
            <li>It does cost more, but this is not about price but about the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>So what was $150.00 is more like $30.00 per person.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>This is simply the best toothbrush ever!  </li>
            <li>Thought it was all okay</li>
            <li>I am going to try and check in with Sonicare and will update if things get better.</li>
            <li>I love every feature of this product.</li>
            <li>Better maneuverability in your mouth means better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaped/Curved bristles allow for better cleaning.</li>
            <li>I feel that the curved bristles here also give me better coverage on my teeth.</li>
            <li>am very happy with the 3 improvements above.</li>
            <li>We love the sanitizer, and although I could be giving it undo credit, there have been no colds or sore throats since we have been using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the slimmer profile and the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I love the way my mouth and teeth feel after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and we both love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the Sonicare by Phillips.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare does a better job for me than any of the competing products.  </li>
            <li>and I love the UV sanitizer-</li>
            <li>The toothbrush holds an ample charge, the brushing settings are okay they get the job done.</li>
            <li>My gums love the message setting.</li>
            <li>Since I am so used to buying on Ebay, I continued my search with them and finally ordered the one I was sure was a best buy.</li>
            <li>, they were pleased with my choice as well as I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>My 3 children (ages 11, 10 &amp; 6) also use it, they love it as well.  </li>
            <li>And I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a lot of money for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Buying it is a better investment than any tooth-whitening product.</li>
            <li>I have been a very happy Oral-B (Braun) user for about the last 4 years.  </li>
            <li>These accessories will make traveling with my brush much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never understood why more electric toothbrush makers don&#x27;t include or even make these</li>
            <li>Although, removing and attaching the brush head on the Flexcare wand requires a lot more force, which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope that you have better luck.  </li>
            <li>I hope that you have better luck.  </li>
            <li>and/or throwing away so many toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>, one would think they would have better addressed the durability issue by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And I must say, this product has everything I missed from the last one: it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I believe it is better for the battery to \\&quot;cycle\\</li>
            <li>I am extreemly glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I also am as always, pleased with Amazon&#x27;s pricing as well as the prompt service.    </li>
            <li>It is so much better</li>
            <li>in that it cleans my teeth better and it has a charge indicator</li>
            <li>The blue indicator is excellent for someone like me who forgets when to change out the head.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my decision and can&#x27;t imagine going back to handbrushing.</li>
            <li>Having the sanitizer makes me feel better about my toothbrush and its cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s probably mostly me just needing to change my grip on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li>My latest purchase was this FlexCare with sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>Like most places, your warranty date doesn&#x27;t reset when you get a warranty replacement.      </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Not terrible</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several versions of Sonicare, and this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>everything is better.</li>
            <li>I may be glad it has a 2 year warranty.      </li>
            <li>Assuming it turns out to be reliable, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I called Philips and had to wait many months for a replacement handle.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve love the sonicare products and have used them for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush now that I am used to it.</li>
            <li>As someone else noted the beep between quadrants is more of a pause</li>
            <li>Love  the Sonicare Rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Guess I won&#x27;t be buying any more $30 replacement brushes for this $130 unit.</li>
            <li>UV Cleanser is an OK gimmick, not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the dentist will say brushing twice a day would make life even better.</li>
            <li>was the best and the only one they sold and told me to switch to oral B.</li>
            <li>The Philips sonicare flexcare heads are better shaped</li>
            <li>I have a mold allergy &amp; this downside prevents me from giving it any more than 1 star.</li>
            <li>I love the UV sanitation and always worried that my toothbrush was in an environment that would collect germs.</li>
            <li>If something can be done about it, pls contact me at hibridr@me.com , would love to change my view on this service.</li>
            <li>If you are a gadget junkie and want the lastest OK, if not just get the value priced unit.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush because of so many 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>It gathered a lot of distgusting gunk under the top so when newer models came out with the snap/slide on brush head, we traded up.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It really tickeled, and I LOL.</li>
            <li>I tell you, your whole day, no matter what you eat, afterward, your teeth will feel great.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a superb electric toothbrush, my mouth feels like it does after a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>The ultraviolet cleaning is a thoughtful addition and maybe especially useful for families.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re paying a lot more up front, and you get to keep paying more every time you buy replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>make sure you register it when you buy, so you can get the replacement if it breaks within 2 years.</li>
            <li>I did not do this thinking it will be OK.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I love the sanitize uv feature.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I follow the directions and seem to do a much better job of it.</li>
            <li>I orderded my sonicare here two weeks ago, and I ve been enjoying brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even take the UV recharger on most trips.  </li>
            <li>I love it otherwise</li>
            <li>During this time, we&#x27;ve owned many models.</li>
            <li>After purchasing one, I purchased two more for my mother and sister.</li>
            <li>Okay I love, love, love this sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush with Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a wedding present &amp; one of the best ones I received I might add.</li>
            <li>Give it to yourself as a healthy treat!price tag, but if you can get it</li>
            <li>I love the soniccare toothbrush with sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gumshave never felt better.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I  made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>the design is sleek and I love the UV sanitizer for the heads..</li>
            <li>I made the move and glad I did it.</li>
            <li>and I love how I can take the toothbrush with the included travel charger and throw it in my bag knowing</li>
            <li>ok, so i NEVER</li>
            <li>i just make sure to change into my day clothes AFTER brushing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s slightly more cumbersome to travel with.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure will cost more than the 2 buck ones at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I would expect something that works for more then 1.5 years.  </li>
            <li>I love using the massage feature at night</li>
            <li>Also, at Amazon I was able to get this model with the UV brush sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>That can get pricey if more than two people use it.</li>
            <li>but this toothbrush does a better job than I ever did.</li>
            <li>What surprizes me most is that I&#x27;ve even noticed a decrease in \\&quot;morning breath.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the more I think about it</li>
            <li>I love that the sanitizer cleans the brushhead after each brush.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended I try a sonicare brush for an even better cleaning.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Oral \\&quot;B\\</li>
            <li>I have to admit I love this toothbrush for all of the reasons listed in these comments.</li>
            <li>I even replaced the toothbrush head thinking this might make it work better.</li>
            <li>We have noticed better reports each time we go in for cleaning.</li>
            <li>love the Sanitizer feature and the thinner size of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>and I saw this model and thought I might like it better.  </li>
            <li>but the brush helps to keep my gums in better shape.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
            <li>I am brushing my teeth more often and for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>although this comes with 2 brush heads, i imagine most people will end up using the compact one all the time.</li>
            <li>We are really enjoying this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is my favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help of think it might be better for PR and the bottom line to up the engineering or construction.</li>
            <li>I love being sure that my toothbrush is clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>mounted to the more stationary charger.  </li>
            <li>I got the FlexCare and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I used to have the AA battery operated e3000 which is a sure \\&quot;self-destructor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I also find myself flossing a lot more too...</li>
            <li>I used to use an Oral B battery operated but this is so much better.</li>
            <li>I hope it continues to perform well for many yrs.</li>
            <li>I tried more threadlocker, but it didn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the money this cost, it should have been better designed and lasted a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a sonicare for several years now, and I have always been impressed with the level of performance.</li>
            <li>so it dries out better.</li>
            <li>I almost would have preferred a beep, but this works ok.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting addition to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(I am an efficient brusher manually, but it just does a better job.</li>
            <li>I will be a lifetime user unless someone else makes something even better...</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice 3 light battery level monitor.</li>
            <li>love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shawn: I aapologize for the inconvenience and will be glad to assist you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shawn: I do understand your concern Ryan, I wish I could help you more on this</li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my cleaning visits to the dentist alot shorter.</li>
            <li>Love the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>I have been using some version of the Sonicare toothbrush for many years...</li>
            <li>One more point:  </li>
            <li>I love the built in sanitizer.</li>
            <li>If you use it your gums and teeth will love you.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I was told about 2 weeks ago I had to get a better toothrbush or else by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I make sure I take care of them too.</li>
            <li>They are, in my opinion, top notch</li>
            <li>This newer model is not recessed, and as per the manual&#x27;s recommendation, you should wash out the bottom of the brush and the top of the handle (where you attach the brush).</li>
            <li>I just heard the newer models were better and opted to upgrade.</li>
            <li>I was also pleased to see it comes with two charging cords.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I bit the bullet and bought it.</li>
            <li>Cleans better than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve every had.</li>
            <li>I love to brush my teeth with this tooth brush....</li>
            <li>I also love all the features it has.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read research that this may be more of a gimmick than anything else, but nonetheless I like the ability to \\&quot;quarantine\\</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with this Sonicare</li>
            <li>and my teeth are already whiter, and they feel fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically more no-nonsense than that</li>
            <li>I get better ratings on my dental cleanings and checkups</li>
            <li>My dental check-ups have been much better since I began using this toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a travel case and sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Assuming that the newer model must be better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>As it is, all they respect is your wallet and want you to buy more when it dies.</li>
            <li>LOVE the timer feature</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the multiple programs that let you know when to change sections in your mouth and then automatically turns off it is awesome.</li>
            <li>I also love that I know my toothbrush is sterilized after every use.</li>
            <li>My teeth have felt cleaner and my dentist is a lot more complementary of my teeth these days.</li>
            <li>Better performance, love the sanitizer unit to use, and the battery does not want to die.  </li>
            <li>much better job than manual brushing</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>I always need more than the 2 minute timer allows-</li>
            <li>I love gadgets</li>
            <li>And I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better it reminds you how to brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt better after a brushing, even with the Oral B electric brushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the sanitizer feature too.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is timed and shuts itself off once you are done.  </li>
            <li>I think I do a better job of brushing with that feature.    </li>
            <li>love how this thing cleans!&lt;br</li>
            <li>In this age where too many people throw too many things away, and where our nation&#x27;s landfills are increasingly cluttered with plastic grocery bags and plastic water bottles being thrown away, this is a disposable product that could have been designed to not be disposable.  </li>

            <li>I have to admit that yes the sonic power &amp; sound kind of scared me.</li>
            <li>I purchased the sonicare as a replacement to a Braun product which has seen better years.  </li>
            <li>It takes some time to get used to, about a week or so, but after that you will love it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are much more joyous with this.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush but found out a couple of things along the way.  </li>
            <li>I really love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>:) Now I&#x27;m purchasing one for my nephew and parents.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s because of the Sonicare, but I&#x27;m sure it helped.</li>
            <li>It does need occasional cleaning, but it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>and I love that it comes with a travel charger.</li>
            <li>6 months later I got the best checkup I have had in years!!  </li>
            <li>My teeth have been cleaner by using this magical device for a year.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has a place to store the heads when not in use.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it</li>
            <li>Then the inside breaks along with the timer - well, that happened to me, then I googled the problem and found it happen to many folks who purchase this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would like you replace the toothbrush or even better refund my purchase (</li>
            <li>and I was confident that The Phillips name would assure quality.</li>
            <li>Dental check-ups have been much better over 4 yrs without need for scraping with the hook.  </li>
            <li>A nuisance but love the toothbrush otherwise.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice compact charger and a light to let you know when it is almost time to recharge it.</li>
            <li>Overall, she thinks it is great and of good quality.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free!</li>
            <li>One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This will fit in my luggage nicely and the weight is negligible.</li>
            <li>I replaced my Oral B toothbrush with this one after many years.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Sonicare user for many years.</li>
            <li>I really love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I am impressed that a corporation the size of Philips actually listened to its customers.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anything more for a toothbrush ...</li>
            <li>I love the idea of it, and I hope that it is truly keeping my toothbrush germ-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>particularly love the massaging function on the toothbrush, designed to prevent gingivitis by massaging the gums.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many times</li>
            <li>course, I&#x27;ll be better able to report on this area in a year, but the product seems sturdy and built for long-term use, unlike some hardware which feels more like</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush, and find myself extremely satisfied with all of its parts and features, as well as the results of brushing with it diligently for almost three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I think that is a question better answered by looking at your own budget and how important your dental health is to you.  </li>
            <li>I think that is a question better answered by looking at your own budget and how important your dental health is to you.  </li>
            <li>most people, this unit is overkill - but it is well thought out and works well for its intended function.</li>
            <li>Customer service is top notch.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many reviewers, aside from the cosmetic durability, I had no problem with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>- I would love if Philips would launch a simplified model.</li>
            <li>It also has a softer cover for better grip.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dentist and I am glad they did.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The FlexCare has so many positives.</li>
            <li>more streamlined and not prone to gunking up.    </li>
            <li>There is more functionality and the battery life after each charge is longer.</li>
            <li>Purchased this toothbrush about one month ago here on Amazon and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for about a month now and love the results.  </li>
            <li>, there are color coded rings for each brush so more than one family&lt;br /&gt;member</li>
            <li>Their cleaning capabilities is second to none and they are an excellent choice for teeth and gum health.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I charge it once a week, otherwise it lays on my vanity counter top with the brush covered.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with its performance in those areas.    </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning this toothbrush provided when it worked.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it one more try</li>
            <li>When you pay $125 for a toothbrush you expect to get more than just 2-3 years out of it.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Sonicare from my dentist, many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Used appropriately during that time...never dropped or abused.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, but at this cost, I expect a longer life.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sonicare electric toothbrush for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had Sonicare toothbrushes for years - but I really love this one.  </li>
            <li>I bought the newer model in July 2011 and liked it very much and especially liked the new design which keeps gunk from accumulating in the head.  </li>
            <li>The switch to change the brushing options is right where anyone with a good sized hand is going to hold the thing.  </li>
            <li>so much I went for this model as it has the massage feature for the gums (love this!!).</li>
            <li>The best part of the FlexCare are its 5 timed brushing options: 2 minute clean, sensitive, massage,</li>
            <li>It is also nice to know that your toothbrush is clean every time with the UV cleaner.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice to have a way to clean the gunk that collects in the spaces in these brushes&#x27; handles and to sanitize them.  </li>
            <li>The UV cleaning system is good too, I have seen too many TV shows that tell us how much bacteria are on our toothbrush!</li>
            <li>each use and are nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made well, comes well-equipped, has a lot of settings to choose from, and most important, it seems certain to do a great job keeping your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>The regular mode gives you plenty of time for each quadrant and the quick clean is perfect for that hurried morning, it still gives a good and still has quadrant timer</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it because it makes my teeth feel so squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>I love how clean your mouth feels after you use it!  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this; and after a follow-up I was told my teeth were very clean +</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after brushing -</li>
            <li>After every brushing, your mouth feels very clean...</li>
            <li>&quot; but I am conscientious about getting my teeth very clean, and with a manual toothbrush, I was damaging my gums because I could not refrain from brushing too vigorously.</li>
            <li>gets very clean if used correctly,   *  sanitizer,   </li>
            <li>However, I found my teeth never felt very clean</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean almost like a dentist has cleaned them.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Very clean and neat.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very light and easy to manipulate in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, Philips customer support is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Braun electric toothbrush for many years and was recently convinced to buy a Sonicare based on an article I read and my sister-in-law&#x27;s assertion that it is the best home cleaning devise available.</li>
            <li>All in all, the Philips FlexCare is a remarkable product, very well-built and well-thought out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush, and look forward to using it for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>but still kind of cool</li>
            <li>I had my first Sonicare for 6 years..and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The timer function is nice because it forces you to break up your mouth into 4 quadrants and brush every area for a full 2 min which is what is recommended.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone interested in getting good checkups and saving your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>is probably the first thing you&#x27;ll notice if you&#x27;re coming from an older Sonicare handle, and it is a very welcome improvement.  </li>
            <li>so I gave my dad the original one, which he still uses today!  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was to replace our original Sonicare that lasted for 14 years!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been getting perfect check-ups from the dentist within months of using it so long ago!</li>
            <li>GREAT NEW PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because it really is a great toothbrush when new.  </li>
            <li>Great are also the features on this new brush.</li>
            <li>The new one featured here handles both 120 and 220V. Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I upgraded to the flexcare I found the new features to be great.  </li>
            <li>new heads are great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UV Sanitizers for toothbrushes are relatively new to the market, and a great idea.  </li>
            <li>The quick 1 minute choice is nice at times, but others times I take advantage of the longer 4 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li>I find myself using it more times throughout the day because it is so easy</li>
            <li>so its easy to travel with  Sanitizer makes sure you&#x27;re not spreading filth on your mouth  </li>
            <li>one is much more sleek and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Philips could make any number of paths to improve the consumer experience here, including: inclusion of better batteries with longer lifespans, and/or a longer warranty of the battery, and/or redesign to allow a consumer easy replacement of the battery.  </li>
            <li>The Flexcare model is not advertised by Sonicare as \\&quot;Healthy whitening\\&quot;, but I have a strong feel that eventually my teeth will soon become a shade or two brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the three settings and the carrying case makes it easy to take with me when I travel.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean the teeth better and the multiple brushing modes are great!  </li>
            <li>Having used the toothbrush for a while now, I find it refreshing, stimulating, and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]This is absolutely the best of all-bar none and was very affordable.</li>
            <li>Also, and perhaps most important, is that it feels like it cleans my teeth better than my Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>Unit is easy to clean too and the Sanitizer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I could get by with one setting, as the great sonic action seems to be the most needed feature.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use - like that everything can stay clean with the toothbrush covers and the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re okay with buying a new sonicare every two years, go for it, it&#x27;s an absolute awesome brush when it works.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as they do when the dentist does them!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel incredibly clean!</li>
            <li>It give you that \\&quot;clean from the dentist\\&quot; feeling at home!</li>
            <li>It leave my teeth feeling so so clean!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using and the machine does all the work!</li>
            <li>Each brusshing feels like dentist clean!    </li>
            <li>We are clean people, I swear!</li>
            <li>When it came time to use it, I felt like the Oral-B didn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all!</li>
            <li>At first, I was unsure how much better it could be than the normal frayed sassafras branch I had been using, but now that I own it I can say its pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>As a physician I&#x27;m very aware that healthy gums are one of the most important things for HEART health, too!  </li>
            <li>This model has a great design and really gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is great when it works and really gets your teeth and mount clean.  </li>
            <li>but it really does do a great job in getting his teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I think five plus years of daily use is very good.</li>
            <li>Carefully crafted to give you best qualitity instrument.</li>
            <li>The thing looked great, felt good in my hand and seemed powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Speed feature great for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Alternatively, the Triumph is Oral-B&#x27;s \\&quot;Most technologically advanced toothbrush.\\</li>
            <li>and I can already see my teeth becoming whiter from its use.</li>
            <li>Brushes enter comfortably between teeth, and the 30-second intervals are well fit for the the cleaning!</li>
            <li>The rear of the handle is rubber backed which is perfect when you&#x27;ve wet hands after your cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.  </li>
            <li>I think that Sonicare did a great thing to upgrade the systems, but they are not as durable and practical as the old ones.    </li>
            <li>ok, so i lucked out and got to try this out free as a bzzz reviewer.  </li>
            <li>my old Sonicare and the gum massage setting makes my mouth feel great when I have a minute extra.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is clearly an evolved product (or is that intelligently designed?)    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Electric toothbrushes are fantastic, but technology must exist to manufacture more reliable motors and mechanisms.</li>
            <li>In my opinion UV light is not sufficient to kill as many microorganisms as they seem to claim.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more secure.</li>
            <li>got this for christmas and so far seems to work great.</li>
            <li>and I liked that even more that the first one that I had.  </li>
            <li>I primarily kept it in the shower mostly out of the water&#x27;s reach</li>
            <li>I really wonder if these are good for your gums.</li>
            <li>I also used a Crest Spinbrush, and didn&#x27;t really find it to be nearly as good as the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>I loved the Braun and I loved that it lasted so long with no problems at all.</li>
            <li>As soon as I turned it on, I couldn&#x27;t believe that I loved it so much, it felt like, and sounded like an antique in comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush plus UV Sanitizer whole system looks good on the shelf when it is charging.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth price and also looks nice on the counter.</li>
            <li>gums\\&quot;, and \\&quot;I&#x27;m really in the mood for a good gum massage\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This product exceeds my expectations and really does a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, it would be pretty easy to share this toothbrush with someone else, assuming you have your own brush head :)    </li>
            <li>The best part is that I spend less time brushing and get a much better result.</li>
            <li>the best of my previous purchases because it is slimmer, has more brushing options and has a disinfecting process.</li>
            <li>However, the toothbrush is excellent and a lot better than my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The full size is much too large for me, but works perfectly for my husband.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and very clean.  </li>
            <li>This model builds on their Philips&#x27; expertise, and works even better than the original models.      </li>
            <li>I had the original sonicare which served me well for many years till the electronics quit.    </li>
            <li>Sweet!)  </li>
            <li>The mode button is actually more readily accessible than the on/off.  </li>
            <li>We have had other Sonicare products and this is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare electric brush and I must say I love it!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Beyond the excellent reviews, this brush has a small head perfect for my mouth, and it is smaller and lighter.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the compact brush and the other is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>for over 6 months, I am now a true believer!</li>
            <li>This is the best money I have ever spent on any household product!</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have also mentioned that the brush heads need to be perfectly aligned in the sanitizer for the door to close, but I have never had an issue of them not being \\&quot;aligned\\&quot; correctly.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, really leaves our teeth clean and the dentist has noticed a significant difference as well.</li>
            <li>It can easily go a week between charging (even now), and I&#x27;ve never needed the travel charger that it comes with</li>
            <li>It gives you more time to massage your gums or clean additional places, I guess.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed how easy this toothbrush is to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>A great product that actually has us brushing more than ever.</li>
            <li>BUT the control buttons are too easy to press accidentally.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel so clean, and you get better dental visits.</li>
            <li>Made to resist toothpaste build-up, it is easily removed for cleaning/sanitizing.</li>
            <li>It is truely one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put a lot of toothpaste on your brush, and make sure you have it in your mouth before you turn it on (otherwise expect to clean up toothpaste on your walls or wherever).</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare for about 6 years and love how clean it gets my teeth and gums</li>
            <li>I bought this about a month ago and love the just from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Then I started reading the reviews, and some people said that the Healthy white tooth brush is a defective model and the flexcare plus is a great one to get.</li>
            <li>The on/off and mode buttons are easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li>I use my brush, then easily remove the brush head from the brush and put it in the sanitizer, close the door and hit the on/off button.</li>
            <li>The brush easily pops on and off the handle without any difficulty.</li>
            <li>And she said they can simply get your teeth cleaner than even the most experienced and dedicated manual brushing.    </li>
            <li>I have used various Sonicare products for many years and been happy with them ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set up and easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to charge, easy to keep track of which brush</li>
            <li>WELL-MADE, EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to share.</li>
            <li>I have found NONE of these flaws and, if used correctly, the unit is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have found NONE of these flaws and, if used correctly, the unit is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This brush has a easy to wash handle that doesn&#x27;t have any crevices to collect junk.</li>
            <li>But if it can help save me from dental work, which could easily run into the hundreds or thousands even with insurance, then so be it.</li>
            <li>He said it will clean my teeth much better than a manual toothbrush and prevent my gums from receding.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is a lot better with this design as well.  </li>
            <li>The brushheads are easy to remove and install.</li>
            <li>then the units before it which made the clean feeling even better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, despite being packed with features.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>As far as cleaning teeth, it does an amazing job and the UV sanitizer is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>i think the dual brush unit from costco is a better deal for the same money, but this is a great brush.  </li>
            <li>it was an easy fix to slide the guts out, put superglue on the post hole and then re-install the head piece.  </li>
            <li>though there are bells and whistles associated with this toothbrush, the instructions are easy to read and inderstandable to the electonically challenged, of whom I am one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also a UV sanitizer for sanitizing the brush head after each brushing that is easy to use and also a carrying case for the toothbrush when you travel.</li>
            <li>I find it too easy to press the button that changes the cleaning mode while holding the brush.    </li>
            <li>Brush seems to clean better than manual brushing</li>
            <li>Recoment this product, easy to take with you to Europe and use in 230 outlets.  </li>
            <li>It also is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love how clean sonic brushing is for the teeth.  </li>

            <li>It was easy to feel the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Electric Toothbrush is easy to use and thorough.</li>
            <li>As many reviews mentioned, this cleans great and the regular toothbrush is no match for this one.</li>
            <li>keeps my teeth and gums healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>If I hold the device the way that I&#x27;d like to, my index finger too easily brushes against the mode button and the mode changes.  </li>
            <li>it easy to use?  </li>
            <li>Easy on the mouth.  </li>

            <li>My teeth felt much more clean with this newer one.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is easy to use and I like the UV sanitizer unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived, the packaging was surprisingly easy to break through, and I set about to charging it for 18 hours...</li>
            <li>The Oral-B brush I used before just vibrated, this tooth brush seems to be a much more precise and advanced movement that vibrates with purpose.</li>
            <li>Clean&#x27; is the 2 minute option, that I use most often. &#x27;</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t change it as easily as I can now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can rest easy now</li>
            <li>to use - I adapted easily to the button functions on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Durable</li>
            <li>I adapted easily to the button functions on the unit.  </li>
            <li>- I would love a battery (double AA) operated model since I travel a lot, and it&#x27;s great not to have to worry about voltage and outlet compatibility (and not carrying a charger).  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s easy to accidentally press the power button while brushing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that the brush heads stay inside the UV cleaner when not in use, which keeps them clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves mouth feeling more clean and</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using electric toothbrushes for years as I feel they are far superior to manual ones.</li>
            <li>This is a really good model and compared to the older Elite:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>Had mine for about two years now and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it is still running strong.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very STRONG and something to get used to at</li>
            <li>As I get older I find the superior dental care</li>
            <li>And if you can get the Special Edition with 2 handles, even better.  </li>
            <li>It was the best deal since I would&#x27;ve had to get extra replacement heads right away with the Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>The brush works great, Phillips will stand behind it for two years and the service reps are good: after that you are on your own.</li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush now for 2 weeks, it is true what most people are saying.</li>
            <li>I switched to the compact brush head and it fits my mouth much better than the full sized one.</li>
            <li>you are using this kind of toothbrush for the first time, it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Since this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, I have nothing to compare the Philips Sonic Toothbrush to excecpt the old-fashioned kind of toothbrush and a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>It was rather interesting feeling but not painful.</li>
            <li>but this time let it charge for a full day hoping that it needed more juice.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush, is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>I must say that sonicare has to  be the best toothbrush out there hands down.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this new sonicare, I loved it!  </li>
            <li>But really, nothing beats the felling of nice clean teeth!</li>
            <li>Product just as described... does a fantastic cleaning job &amp; the UV sanitizer is so cool!</li>
            <li>It seems to me that this unit cleans tooth surfaces just fine, but that is not what I use an electric toothbrush for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to use, my teeth and gums feel cleaner, stains are gone and it is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is fine.  </li>
            <li>Then this instrument will work just fine for you.</li>
            <li>All seem to work just fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine...</li>
            <li>When the unit I purchased arrived I found that one of the two brushes was fine</li>
            <li>On top of all that, the small UV chamber in which you store your brush-head during the day is an excellent idea.</li>
            <li>The brushes are light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The battery works just fine</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve had my electric toothbrush for 10 years and it still works fine&#x27;.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts even one half of that time, I would feel I got an excellent deal.</li>
            <li>Sanitizer and battery both still fine.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; cycle is fine for some gum stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery is charged and it sounds like it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare FlexCare rechargeable toothbrush is lightweight, comfortable to hold, and comes with a variety of functions:  Just press a button to set it for a thorough Cleaning (too much vibration and tickling for me and it shakes the toothpaste off), Sensitive (perfect for me) and Gum Massage, which is great when you have extra time.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine until about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>Let me just say, the first couple times wasn&#x27;t all that enjoyable and like many others</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>fine-</li>
            <li>Even brushing with just water seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>The battery life is fine.</li>
            <li>The brush is contoured, the unit is easy to grip and light, and there is no moldy gunk buildup anymore because the brush head snaps onto the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it did fine up until now.</li>
            <li>and it would be fine.</li>
            <li>Care\\&quot; for a quick yet thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li>Luckily I had bought it at Costco and was able to return it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like a sonic toothbrush, but I got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand the \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; on the roof of my mouth but quickly got used to it</li>
            <li>This product does a good job -- my mouth feels fresh and clean after using it, and I can never go back to a manual toothbrush after getting used to the superior cleaning of an electric toothbrush, but I would recommend buying an Oral-B instead.  </li>
            <li>I absolute love it!</li>
            <li>second one has been going strong for a couple of months now, and still doing great.</li>
            <li>My teeth are more than clean, they seem to be squeaky clean after using this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only dinging it one star for all this because their support was great, I was able to get though quickly, and got my warranty claim approved in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Now the brush works fine, I enjoy cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>A little bit pricey, but you can find the best deals here on Amazon and Phillips will extend the warranty for two and one-half years.  </li>
            <li>I do agree that its kind of noisy &amp; I sure did make a mess the first time I used it, but that being said, if you want great feeling and clean teeth, take the plunge!</li>
            <li>The ultraviolet sanitizer is cool and keeps them clean and off of the counter!  </li>
            <li>The little sanitizer is nice to have when you have an OCD moment about brush cleanliness, however this would still be a great toothbrush without the feature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than happy to pay a little more for the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>No Bulky holder for the toothbrush that gets filled with...and has to be   cleaned weekly, and the compact brush heads are great for smaller mouths  and control when brushing.  </li>
            <li>but I am a huge germ-a-phobe.</li>
            <li>It was huge for one thing, like holding a tree limb.</li>
            <li>This one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>I had liked that significantly more than my old Crest Sprinbrush.  </li>
            <li>though if you have something like a pedestal you might need a shelf or something because it wont fit.</li>
            <li>felt like a light bulb exploded in my head.</li>
            <li>I wish I still had my cheap Sonicare.</li>
            <li>They confirmed it&#x27;s still under warranty,</li>
            <li>Cory confirmed that \\&quot;080828\\&quot; means that this replacement unit came from a production batch of hundreds of brushes made on Aug. 28, 2008.    </li>
            <li>Regardless I&#x27;m a customer for life, it&#x27;s a cheap luxury.</li>
            <li>None of the cheap made-in-China-construction.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering the easy clean for $60 soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how happy this has made me.</li>
            <li>so I like having the toothbrush head locked away in the sanitizer with the UV light blasting away the germs.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter weight and extra modes were great.  </li>
            <li>use I feel like my teeth are smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>plaque free.</li>
            <li>UV sanitizer is a fantastic breakthrough idea for the toothbrush as well.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fantastic toothbrush and</li>
            <li>of Use:&lt;br /&gt;Pressing the mode select button will move through all available brush modes.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer that comes with this product is just a added bonus that I enjoy having because I have always worried about the bacteria build up on brush heads.</li>
            <li>Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</li>
            <li>Everybody likes the smooth feeling that brushing your teeth with the Sonicare creates.</li>
            <li>The dental assistant recommended this specific tooth brush with sanitizer as a great way to maintain my teeth.</li>
            <li>Likes: Easy brush head clean up.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, but will change to \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; about one a week.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally invested in one.  </li>
            <li>, the cheap components break too often.  </li>
            <li>be ay why for lower price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>This uses a replaceable ultraviolet light bulb.  </li>
            <li>I know my tooth brush is free from bacteria with the Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable in my mouth too.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush when it&#x27;s working, but fast-forward to two months out of the warranty and this one stops working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li>But my thinking is perhaps they build these to be a commodity rather than a solid great product.</li>
            <li>-Sanitizing box have this translucent area where light will be emitted when the box is in use.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product in January and the light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>That one quit working in August 2009 and SonicCare sent out a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li>We purchased a Philips Sonicare Flex Care with the Ultra Violet light.</li>
            <li>We like the Ultra Violet light sanitizer.</li>
            <li>The different settings that change the duration and pulse of the vibrations are a great feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please wait while we find an available agent</li>
            <li>Does the light come on when the handle is on charging base?&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: just tried it</li>
            <li>We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
            <li>We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC FOR REMOVING TEA STAINS ..</li>
            <li>.. noticed that people said Phillips Sonicare was great about standing in back of their products .. called their customer service at  1-800-682-7664 ..</li>
            <li>Replacements for the compact brush aren&#x27;t yet available for sale, and heads need to be changed</li>
            <li>So, I waited and finally I was blessed with this great Sonicare Flexcare.</li>
            <li>With six people in our family, we have tried every toothbrush/system available on the market.  </li>
            <li>the trouble and am using it the best</li>
            <li>I can fit two brush heads in at once and it makes me feel healthier every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I think Phillips is really on to something with an electric toothbrush that works as effectively as this one does.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it does a great job.      </li>
            <li>Philips also sent me one free one as a purchase bonus for signing up online with them.</li>
            <li>I called the company and asked if there should be a sound coming from that unit, and they said no.  </li>
            <li>UV light isn&#x27;t like antibiotics</li>
            <li>Light weight also helps.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth after using it and</li>
            <li>It took me about a week or so to get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>My UV light charger died within a couple of months.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is also a lot more powerful than the cheaper toothbrushes I had before.     </li>
            <li>Philips replaced it free of charge.</li>
            <li>In short, great product and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>The sensitivity settings on this are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Advice: get the basic model and be happy.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great toothbrush</li>
            <li>I enjoy ever morning and evening that I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It took about 6 months for me to convert to this as my primary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That includes by the way disinfecting the heads, using the built-in UV light that it comes with on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>admit I was one of these people who would buy the cheap electric ones for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel smooth after each time you use it -</li>
            <li>I thought the toothbrush was a bit more powerful</li>
            <li>It works great but with a short life.  </li>
            <li>enjoy my Sonicare and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a $5 coupon for these in the FlexCare box, and your dentist probably has the coupons available.   </li>
            <li>Amazon shipped it within 24 hours too even though I selected the free shipping method.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the way my teeth and gums feel after I use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Well, the UV sanitizer was a great deal for me because I have always used one with my regular toothbrushes</li>
            <li>and I would have had to get one to fit whatever brush I got.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several rechargeable toothbrushes for years and have been happy.  </li>
            <li>It took several days to get use to it, but then it was great.</li>
            <li>I would think it would be great for children as it would do a great job of keeping their teeth brushed properly.</li>
            <li>thing is fantastic, and I love the feeling of my super clean teeth</li>
            <li>You can only get it from your dentist office and I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with it</li>
            <li>These are handy additions, but the real value is the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re that important.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but i find it to be louder than before but one will get used  to the sound over time</li>
            <li>: The HX6921/02 is on Amazon for $119.95 free shipping.</li>
            <li>Even with your discount and free shipping, it is still cheaper to buy it off Amazon.</li>
            <li>: The HX6921/02 is on Amazon for $119.95 free shipping.</li>
            <li>Even with your discount and free shipping, it is still cheaper to buy it off Amazon.</li>
            <li>An ultraviolet light cleans the brush heads after each use or when you choose to do so (two at a time).</li>
            <li>The UV sterilizer seemed like a gimmick, but I had a coupon for this one, so it basically was a free add-in.  </li>
            <li>Had the last model, think called elite, and it worked great for 3 or 4 years until it died in India.  </li>
            <li>the multiple options are great.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com had such a great deal on this brush</li>
            <li>The Sanitizer is fantastic and helps to eliminate germs.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t use the UV light.</li>
            <li>My Sonicare toothbrush did a great but the internal battery lasted (3) months.</li>
            <li>if you love your smile please buy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The best brush I have ever used and still using it everyday.</li>
            <li>steroids\\&quot; sound of it.  </li>
            <li>They have fewer places for crud to collect, and the UV sanitizer light is keeping bacteria growth away.  </li>
            <li>After using only 6 weeks our teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel great everytime you brush.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor leaves the teeth feeling polished and super clean, and the UV light is nice peace of mind for anyone with mysophobia.</li>
            <li>It was free at no cost to me because it played out before the two year warranty had expired.</li>
            <li>my UV light went out.  </li>
            <li>and I can offer you a coupon code for 15% off and free shipping on purchase of the unit through our Philips online store.</li>
            <li>The brush is no longer securely locked to handle.  </li>
            <li>Prior to being a proud Sonicare owner, I used the Oral-B electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Philips Sonicare Advanced cleaning  which has 3 Modes and 2 routines for custom cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable, the on/off button is conveniently located, and there is a travel charger if you want to take the brush with you on the road.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the toothbrush daily since September 21, 2007 and am happy to report that this product performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li>use the sanitizer faithfully each time I brush my teeth, but to be perfectly honest, I don&#x27;t know how to judge whether the sanitizer is really making any difference or not.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, it is worth to pay more for this model than the Elite.   </li>
            <li>We used the sanitizer for both toothbrushes prior to leaving for the Carribean, using the portable toothbrushes while on vacation, which was great, and then sanitized the brushes when we got home.</li>
            <li>With the Advance, they&#x27;d be smooth and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>The charger also has a UV cleaner which is great for making the replicable heads last longer.</li>
            <li>My toothbrush was great initially but then started turning itself on and off throughout the day without provocation.</li>
            <li>After using this for a few months, the dentist found a great improvement - no need to scrape!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has greatly improved my oral care and has made a big difference in my gum health.  </li>
            <li>Performance of the toothbrush is far superior as well.</li>
            <li>but this time was told that the warranty is only good for two years and that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to send a replacement.</li>
            <li>I was able to maneuver the compact head a lot better, and not so much toothpaste escaped.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for such a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Not having experienced any product of this kind before, I&#x27;m in no position to make such comparisons, but IMO the level of noise and vibration is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>, I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li>, I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li>WOW, I wish all my interactions with customer service department were this good.</li>
            <li>So far they have been good about replacing it, but it is a hassle.  </li>
            <li>My old Oral b brush used to keep running after the two minutes which I liked if I wanted to do more brushing.  </li>
            <li>Good for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>With so many models to choose from with or without the UV light anyone can improve their smile at a price within your budget.    </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend that anyone should buy this brush and it will make your mouth care routine much more rewarding and guided.</li>
            <li>* Light weight, easier to held thus more useful    </li>
            <li>In short, these are the absolute best toothbrushes for dental care.</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>most of which were very positive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, compact and sleek, and very powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used successive generations of Sonicare electronic toothbrushes for a number of years now and every generation has been better than the last -- and they have all been great, right from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to wait months to achieve that super clean feeling that comes from a dentist visit!</li>
            <li>Is a very good product and it seems to do better than my older one, I&#x27;ll find out at my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of using the Sonicare Toothbrush right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>The varying modes are nice; although, I find that I use the 3-minute mode most often to ensure a complete clean in all quadrants of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Overall a great brush and company, Sonicare makes brushing fun!</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed my time using Sonicare, I feel at this point it is a luxury and doesn&#x27;t offer me anything more than a standard, albeit special kind, of toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVES IT!!!  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel very calm about the cleanliness of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am buying more and more from Amazon as I find out how professional they are; so far I never had any kind of problems purchasing from its site and I am amazed at their efficiency!</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is very nice, but not essential, so you may want to get the brush by itself if cost is an issue.</li>
            <li>The timer function is very useful.  </li>
            <li>All in All, a very nice product that will vastly improve</li>
            <li>I also knew I wasn&#x27;t happy with OralB - because my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and I knew that it was definitely not getting into all the contours of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so happy I splurged on this purchase--I replaced an older sonicare toothbrush I had, and the technolgy of the FlexCare has been much improved.  </li>
            <li>i m glad i have one it makes my mouth feel really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Love how fresh and clean Philips Sonicare Flexcare Toothbrush makes my mouth, teeth and breath feel.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to keep clean, does a great job cleaning teeth, and you can sanitize the different heads too.</li>
            <li>They work great and give your mouth that clean feeling like you just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought it because it had the UV light...</li>
            <li>I smile more, I&#x27;m more comfortable about my smile, and I know I&#x27;m finally taking good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I smile more, I&#x27;m more comfortable about my smile, and I know I&#x27;m finally taking good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>One handle for me, one for my girlfriend, and a super cool UV sanitization chamber to play with!</li>
            <li>: As your unit&#x27;s 2 year warrenty is expired, at this point of time, the best option that I can suggest to you is to purchase a new unit and to help offset some of the cost, we can offer you 15% off your total Sonicare purchase along with free shipping at our online store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, and I also like the onboard sanitizer to keep the brush clean and germ free.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and clean just like after a dental visit &amp; are noticably whiter.  </li>
            <li>It is much more convenient and easy to use than a manual toothbrush and provides far better results.      </li>
            <li>I too find myself licking my teeth after a clean and find they stay smooth and shiny for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>I too find myself licking my teeth after a clean and find they stay smooth and shiny for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>That is the sound of clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing.</li>
            <li>But now, I&#x27;m hooked again and enjoy brushing my teeth and the clean feeling that I get with it.  </li>
            <li>I picked this unit because of the UV light to use on to clean the  brushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The included UV light completes the package, helping make this toothbrush consistently clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not noisy at all.  </li>
            <li>I can choose from several modes (including GoCare, for when you&#x27;re on the run, or MaxCare, when you have more time); I can even choose a nice, easy gum massage mode.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use</li>
            <li>I received one of these for Christmas from my best friend, and I swear I will never go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Super easy.</li>
            <li>Super easy.</li>
            <li>However, this toothbrush quickly and easily gets my teeth cleaner than I could do with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My husband and I had the older version of the Sonic Care toothbrush and liked it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve own an older model Sonicare and its battery begin to wean and the brush heads always stayed junky.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works perfectly, holds an extremely long charge, saves toothpaste and is very sanitary.</li>
            <li>my trips to the dentist are quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush also comes with a travel charger and a travel bag which makes it super easy to take with you on vacation or on work</li>
            <li>This is my first time using electrical toothbrush, so far I am happy.</li>
            <li>QUICK RECAP - PROS &amp; CONS  Easy to use -</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!!!!!</li>
            <li>teeth feel the cleanest with this new toothbrush and it better for the price!  </li>
            <li>and I enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>All-in-all a product well worth using if you want to keep your teeth really clean!</li>
            <li>and I look forward to the fresh clean teeth every time I use it!</li>
            <li>I noticed that performance with new brushheads are much better, so it&#x27;s better change it</li>
            <li>Now, after 3 weeks, I press a little more because I am acclimated to it, and pressing more feels good.  </li>
            <li>Love Sonicare since my mom bought me my first one for Xmas after I had moved away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the upgrade!)    </li>
            <li>So I Bought the 900+ flex-care after the first time I&#x27;m glad I did...</li>
            <li>Various modes are convenient and effective!</li>
            <li>If you want a straightforward toothbrush without all of the settings or cleaner</li>
            <li>He said he could send me a $15 rebate coupon ifI could send him the original purchase receipt.  </li>
            <li>Treat yourself--and SMILE!</li>
            <li>I had the original Sonicare</li>
            <li>Worked ok first year, then I have had to replace it  </li>
            <li>The UV light is interesting, if it actually works to sterilize--very nice.  </li>
            <li>The original broke after 9 months, and the replacement just broke as well.  </li>
            <li>From the first time, I felt like I got a better cleaning than I got even from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>(I had the original packaging by chance.)  </li>
            <li>It worth every penny!</li>
            <li>After registering the product the manufacturer offered a year&#x27;s worth of replacement heads at no cost too!  </li>
            <li>Since the original product was purchased Dec 2009 Phillips would not replace the handle.  </li>
            <li>This models battery lasts for a long time and makes it great when traveling.</li>
            <li>There is a fairly significant buzz that occurs when you fire it up.</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews, I finally gave in and I&#x27;m thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>So far we are very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Most everyone has gone over the benefits pretty well</li>
            <li>(it works great cleaning teeth, charge lasts a long time, etc)</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was recommended by my dentist, and although pricey, it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am familiar with the seller.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Your teeth are worth it, buy this product!    </li>
            <li>I have owned it for about a month and am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush handle is lighter and easier to handle than the original Sonicare style.      </li>
            <li>At first I thought I was accidentally touching the selection button by mistake while brushing.  </li>
            <li>My original Sonicare was still working</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a significant</li>
            <li>Great product, shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to purchase.  </li>
            <li>So worth it!    </li>
            <li>My original Sonicare toothbrush just gave up the ghost after just under a decade of use.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Philips&#x27; customer service department was friendly, efficient, and apologetic.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and after two weeks can already tell that it was worth the money!</li>
            <li>but there is no doubt its a night and day improvement over the original Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and works great!  </li>
            <li>I can remember four different dentists telling me that I should be brushing more and flossing more and coming more often.  </li>
            <li>Since then, we have had the original and two replacement units, but all three we have had died.  </li>
            <li>but so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an investment in your smile - and that lasts a lifetime!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and all you have to do is stand there and let the brush do all the work!</li>
            <li>I originally bought the model with the sanitizer but that never worked well</li>
            <li>This is worth it!</li>
            <li>so I kind of tear up my mouth with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to happen again.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the value!</li>
            <li>My teeth haven&#x27;t been this happy with me for a long time.y at all.  </li>
            <li>My teeth haven&#x27;t been this happy with me for a long time.</li>
            <li>If you are a person that has always used a manual toothbrush and are contemplating getting an electric toothbrush for the first time, I know the Sonicare costs more</li>
            <li>I bought my first one about 13 years ago (maybe more) after having a gum infection and surgery.</li>
            <li>Plus the customer service rep was so friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li>with 2 years of manufacturer warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Shalom: OK&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Shalom, the warranty on the replacement handle is based on your original product&#x27;s date of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: I&#x27;ve checked the entitlement and the unit is not within warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Please note that the Sonicare toothbrushes are non-repairable</li>
            <li>The original one worked for a while, then it would just make noise (sounded like it was working), but the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t vibrate.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is excellent (so far about 2 weeks on its initial charge), the slimmer design is easier to hold and maneuver, and the 3 selectable &#x27;speeds&#x27; are very useful.</li>
            <li>I have a quadrant in my mouth that the brush just won&#x27;t clean, and as a result I have significant plaque buildup in that quadrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had oral surgery the week prior to ordering and I was excited to try their Sensitive mode (it&#x27;s great by the way!).</li>
            <li>clean feel.  </li>
            <li>but there is no denying the exceptionally clean feeling after the 2 minute timer cuts the power cycle.</li>
            <li>It is the closest clean to the \\&quot;6</li>
            <li>Each time I clean my teeth the brush end shoots off into my mouth</li>
            <li>I also like the sanitizing attachment, instead of just shoving it in a drawer and hoping it stays clean.  </li>
            <li>(timer, max clean, go clean, etc</li>
            <li>How really clean your mouth feels?</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic brushing cleans everything clean.</li>
            <li>I had a different electric toothbrush before this is by far the best one i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so clean feeling and shiney.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to really clean between there at all, as it doesn&#x27;t need it.    </li>
            <li>when I didn&#x27;t UV clean my brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is a pleasure not to have to clean the olds.  </li>
            <li>The wife and kid had a backup toothbrush, but I&#x27;d used mine to clean my rims.</li>
            <li>I am always told how clean my teeth are..</li>
            <li>they always feel dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>The Flexcare Sonicare has been a pleasure to use and to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>How clean it stays, and the sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I notice the difference in how clean my teeth feel after each use</li>
            <li>The Phillips FlexCare Toothbrush with Sanitizer is an excellent product offering several teeth cleaning options that provide a near Dentist cleaning experience.</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth and gums are really clean now.  </li>
            <li>squeaky clean</li>
            <li>The charging light is bright, but if you turn the power head to face the rear it takes the glare away and the unit still charges the same.</li>
            <li>clean everytime</li>
            <li>u are getting a &#x27;100% clean&#x27; set.</li>
            <li>teeth never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>And the clean?</li>
            <li>But you DO get a feeling of clean</li>
            <li>The brush handle seems to stay clean.  </li>
            <li>Must hold the brush on each tooth for an extended period of time (have to brush this way to get really clean)    </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>and it helps to keep my teeth squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>But if you use this gizmo as instructed you won&#x27;t have to do anything else to keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The brush head needs to be aligned perfectly in the sanitizer and the door closed and snapped gently.  </li>
            <li>It literally cleans your teeth so well that when you floss it feels as though you&#x27;ve already flossed because your teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li>I started using UltraSonics consistantly when my Dentist asked how I was keeping my teeth so clean between checkups.</li>
            <li>But I always feel, after I brush, that my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>have now been using the Sonicare Flexcare for more than 90 days, and I have to say I am extremely pleased at its performance so far.  </li>
            <li>I do take the brush head off and clean the mounting post about once every 8-10 days.  </li>
            <li>It is much more compact and more wieldy than than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as if I had just visited the dentist</li>
            <li>My mouth doesn&#x27;t even feel this clean after leaving the dentist.  </li>
            <li>So I clean it once a week</li>
            <li>and I find I can reach all my teeth, and there is no toothbrush on this planet that will leave your teeth and mouth as clean as this brush will.  </li>
            <li>After brushing with this toothbrush, you teeth feel dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>now they look whiter and brighter, and they FEEL SO CLEAN.  </li>

            <li>I have them both, turn them on and press the heads lightly on my skin, the Advance seems to provide as much as 40% more torques than the Flexcare.</li>
            <li>I will still get the Sonic clean feeling while I&#x27;m away from home and don&#x27;t have to use the crappy manual stuff.  </li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s a clean toothbrush head during every brush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have NEVER felt so clean.</li>

            <li>Gets my teeth sparkling clean every day.</li>
            <li>this clean is the day for my cleanning appt every six months.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the Advance.</li>
            <li>a clean cloth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel extremely clean after use and</li>
            <li>and my dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are (this was after I started using this toothbrush)  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that you have to be sure to clean the thing every once in a while because it gets kind of gunky, and that gunk is nothing but bacteria.</li>
            <li>something that is actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>something that is actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>U.V. sanitizer is a nice gadget, but who knows how useful it really is?  </li>
            <li>The price is big but it was worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these new brushes and loved it for the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>But on the other hand, if you are fine with the reliability issues, it is a great toothbrush and made my teeth feel incredibly clean when it worked so</li>
            <li>My all family asked for one as the most desired present and they all love it!!!Perfect for the busy people who take time to clean their teeth and forget to clean their toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li>I expect a much more positive six month check-up.  </li>
            <li>The original was always louder and had more vibration than this replacement but the replacement cleans just as good as the other ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like nothing else you&#x27;ve experienced, except possibly the feeling you get right after you leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>Very simply it worked great in all respects right up until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for selling such great items at such great prices.  </li>
            <li>The head pops off the toothbrush easily and slips right in the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>Though there are some good combo packages on the Elite through Costco (with extra handles and bases), for us it is worth staying with the newer model for the additional modes and features, and the gunk-free head replacements!</li>
            <li>Most significantly, I had to get the whole thing replaced just now.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that allows you to clean those \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Before I start reviewing, I should mention that I bought the Special Edition package from Costco with 2 Sonicare brushes for about $170.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highest recommendations if you want good, clean teeth and lesser visits to the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>However this model has a max clean that adds 15 seconds to each interval with a more intense vibration.  </li>
            <li>If you look through the reviews, you will see others have experienced my exact same problem.</li>
            <li>I started using it on a regular basis and at first it was great.</li>
            <li>This brush is not nearly as loud as the Oral B was, but it seems to brush even more effectively.</li>
            <li>I really hesitated before spending so much but am very satisfied that I did.  </li>
            <li>Let me start this review by saying that I am very happy with Sonicare in general and the replacement toothbrush I purchased was the same make and model.    </li>
            <li>I cannot believe the difference in the amount of gunk that remains between my teeth after using the unit the full cleaning program.  </li>
            <li>Now don&#x27;t you think two full cycles with a Sonicare should get that out???  </li>
            <li>Phillips is good about sending a replacement but the second time I got it replaced</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just beginning to use it more than once a day because it almost tickles your mouth TOO much.  </li>
            <li>It was good enough for generations before us!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I can feel the difference this toothbrush made versus my old (non sonic) electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>His solution was that we each need our own FlexCare toothbrushes and not remove the heads so frequently.  </li>
            <li>Quick clean mode for brushing on the go.</li>
            <li>my teeth are so super clean, even my dentist said they were the cleanest teeth he&#x27;s seen in a while.  </li>
            <li>Max-care is the full works.</li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth and shiny and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>Max-care is the full works.</li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth and shiny and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>Tomorrow I am going to contact the Sonicare customer service and give them a ear full.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.    </li>
            <li>Makes the teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>You may need to go buy another full size bush.  </li>
            <li>Hope that isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just an overall good feeling.</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel so clean after every brush and our gums never bleed anymore, not even when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I brush the full two minutes and hold the brush on my tooth at the gumline...</li>
            <li>Hope you fall in love with this toothbrush as much as I did.</li>
            <li>Good pricing compared against the big retailers.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m probably back with Sonicare for good.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but my dentists repeatedly told me about how good these things are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to bad-mouth Sonicare, because it&#x27;s a good brush, but I just preferred the smaller size of the Oral-B, along with the pop-off brush heads.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of money to put out every two years for a product that should really have greater durability.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Plenty of brushing programs: I specially love the GoCare for when I&#x27;m in real hurry.</li>
            <li>Finally the most important part; it does an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Of course I did start with a pair of very thorough periodontal cleanings 3 months apart, but my periodontist and hygienists agree than the Sonicare is an outstanding dental home-care maintenance</li>
            <li>It is more gentle to the gum and I can feel the cleanness inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li>they give 2 full years from date of purchase.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner and my dentist visit have gone better.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush keeps me brushing my teeth for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li>Try number 3 back on \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; and all was good, though it will still take a bit getting use to.</li>
            <li>In as much as I want to love this toothbrush, I can&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This button is to change the way the brush head vibrates, so you can get a kind of massage action.  </li>
            <li>Overall it really is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It looks like the Cybersonic 2 is similar to and superior to the Sonicare:</li>
            <li>I agree that it does a good job of cleaning; however, the UV bulb in the sanitizer  did not last the year</li>
            <li>It keeps the brush head clean and dry and is much more effective than just rinsing.</li>
            <li>The FlexCare comes with a soft travel case and a separate travel charger--that&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I always brush my teeth now for the full two minutes.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to hear the \\&quot;beep\\&quot; of the \\&quot;Quadpacer\\&quot;, (the timer that does 15 seconds per quadrant in Quick Clean mode, or 30 seconds in \\&quot;Max Clean\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>I knew it would be better, but not this much.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has a complimentary  hole in the bottom for the peg to fit into.</li>
            <li>1min quick clean feature for after lunch or before outings.</li>
            <li>and I prefer the full sized brush head.  </li>
            <li>I also bought one for my father recently and he has nothing to say but good things as well.      </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot;, which will run the brush for a minute, and \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot;, which will give you a full 2 minutes of time.  </li>
            <li>Even with \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; settings, I don&#x27;t have that achy, itchy gums feeling that a Water Pik turned on full can do.  </li>
            <li>Even with \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; settings, I don&#x27;t have that achy, itchy gums feeling that a Water Pik turned on full can do.  </li>
            <li>I hope my next purchase would be equally good.</li>
            <li>The brush has a 14 use warm-up to get to full</li>
            <li>I used to own an electric toothbrush model that was 5 years old or so.</li>
            <li>Also want to mention that I&#x27;m a true bargain shopper...</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a good, worhwhile electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this product &amp; the manufacturer....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been a week, and now I can make the full three minutes of the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; setting and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this tooth brush for about 3 years and love it as much today as I did 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush also comes with a travel case, and brush head covers, which is really cool.</li>
            <li>I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd phillips sonicare i have had and have loved this product.  </li>
            <li>Also included is two toothbrush heads, a compact size and a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By chance I found it has a feature that gradually builds up to full power while you get used to it.</li>
            <li>I did like this product, the brush heads were a good size and the battery kept a charge for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>It was an awesome product, just sucks</li>
            <li>Based on this and current reviews of Oral B being superior in almost every way, we will be switching.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth feel fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>its not a bad deal at all i guess for the toothbrush with uv sanitizer, which alone sells for around 50 bucks</li>
            <li>I would like to know how many senior citizens were upset when they attempted to buy new heads and they weren&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li>The new Sonic toothbrush that I purchased is as I expected it to be, Great!</li>
            <li>I loved the Braun so much I recommended it to my roommate who was searching for a new rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found the Flexcare model on sale on Amazon.com at a much more reasonable price than the retail price in stores, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try the Sonic to see if I could avoid having to use two different brushes and especially because of the UV sanitizer which the Rotodent doesn&#x27;t have and is a wonderful addition.</li>
            <li>AMAZON had the best prices too, as usual!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re pretty easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li>The different settings are great, and when I&#x27;m in a rush I can set the toothbrush to clean in a fast amount of time.    </li>
            <li>brush looks like Phillips did some thorough research to see what you and I want in a hi-tech toothbrush (easy to read indicators, multiple settings, sanitizer build into to charger) and what dentists want (better breakup of plaque film, fluid driving between teeth for more effective</li>

            <li>I purchased this product after one of my other family members told me how great it was.  </li>
            <li>I have had the original Philips rechargeable toothbrush for many years and when it came time to get a new one, I went again with my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and selected this FlexCare model.</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon and used Google to get the low down on the best at home cleaning options and mostly all pointed to Sonicare products.     </li>
            <li>It is quiet and does not vibrate, has great features, and has a very high quality feel and appearance.  </li>
            <li>I love my new electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Love my new Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>I love my new Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new Phillips rechargeable toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I love our new Sonicare - my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentists!</li>
            <li>I had an older version of the Sonicare Toothbrush years ago, and this new version is vastly superior.</li>
            <li>This new model is much better because it is easier to clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>Exceptional cleaning, my mouth is a whole new place.</li>
            <li>The first two years it worked fine,</li>
            <li>For the first three months it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money for me, my teeth feel really clean all day.</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re OCD-obsessive about teeth and gums or you just want to have clean teeth without a lot of effort, this is definitely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re OCD-obsessive about teeth and gums or you just want to have clean teeth without a lot of effort, this is definitely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>and I always feel fresh and clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>Obviously proper oral health and regular dental visits are the best method.</li>
            <li>I like the quick 1 minute cycle for a quick brush.  </li>
            <li>and this is better than the 2 older models I had because it has a slimmer brush wand and also has speeds settings to chose from.  </li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t enough power to really get a great cleaning from it.    </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I get a sonic toothbrush since I have mild gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant to spend this much on another toothbrush, but being that I loved my old Sonicare</li>
            <li>My last brush lasted way many more years</li>
            <li>My last brush lasted way many more years</li>
            <li>I found that really helpful - my husband doesn&#x27;t really pay attention to it and does his own thing.    </li>
            <li>And, as always, Amazon provided a quick delivery, and took care of the import taxes to Brazil.</li>
            <li>but you will quickly get use to it.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I was sedated and the work was completed in one visit.</li>
            <li>The unit, overall, is really quite attractive.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to replace an older model (Sonic Care Elite) and it&#x27;s much better.  </li>
            <li>The best part about the toothbrush is that it has a timer built into the device, and when it is done with working on one side of an individual&#x27;s mouth, it will beep letting that individual know that it is time to switch sides.</li>
            <li>Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; settings; with these, the brush actually times you, allowing you to brush one each of four areas of your teeth (top front, top inside, bottom front and bottom inside) at a time.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was still under warranty</li>
            <li>but I was moving the head around way too quickly, and as a result, my dentist says the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; effect was not working.  </li>
            <li>But boy was I lucky, they didnt have any at that time in their office.</li>
            <li>I owned an Oral B rechargeable brush for about 5 years and was happy with it; it was only after purchasing the Sonicare Flexcare that I realised how much the technolgy had improved.</li>
            <li>Maybe, if I get lucky, it has NOT been used.</li>
            <li>It cleans nicely but the light for the sanitizer burned out after one year of use (and we only used it maximum of once a week.)  </li>
            <li>(as compared to sonicare&#x27;s old screw on heads) are fantastic and much better than the Oral-B pop-off ones.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare brushes for the better part of a decade and never had a problem with any of the older \\&quot;first-generation\\&quot; units.  </li>
            <li>I have been using philips sonic toothbrushes many many years, during that entire time I never needed any dental work or fillings, infact I did not even need to visit the dentist.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Sonicare fan for years.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace the older model I have had for many years.  </li>
            <li>i have really enjoyed using this since it arrived, my older model did not have any of the features on the handle</li>
            <li>(I only wish that the UV Sanitizer would have some kind of music / sound to let you know when the process is all done.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I had read reviews on many different \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrushes and am SOOO glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>and I use the quick care when I&#x27;m rushing out the door.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I got mine through my dentist</li>
            <li>Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>This means that you have to find your setting, move the brush quickly to your mouth, and turn it on, all within 3 seconds.  </li>
            <li>This means that you have to find your setting, move the brush quickly to your mouth, and turn it on, all within 3 seconds.  </li>
            <li>One reason for getting a brush like this is that it might encourage your gadget-crazy kids to brush their teeth more, so many people will require those extra brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a quality, easy to use toothbrush that really does seem to get your teeth almost as clean as they are after a visit to the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>It resets to default \\&quot;Quick Clean\\&quot; 1 minute setting every time.    </li>
            <li>The smaller brush head is perfect for my younger son while my teenager</li>
            <li>The Go Care provides a quick 1 minute freshen up.</li>
            <li>But we prefer to just leave the brushes out in the air most of the time and also not have the charger (most likely)</li>
            <li>it sounds like you&#x27;re gargling with a lightsaber, but the feeling amounts to a mild vibration that leaves your gums tingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Oral-B. Then a while later I upgraded to the Oral-B Triumph because it had the lcd, but it just looks better than the 8850, the 8850 is a way better brush than the 9400.</li>
            <li>This product was great while it worked, but for as much as this product costs, it should last longer.</li>
            <li>What I also like better about this model is the simplicity of the actual head design--no more nooks and areas for gunk and residue build up as a result of brushing.  </li>
            <li>it just seemed like a worthy plus for Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I quickly learned is to not turn the toothbrush &#x27;on&#x27; with toothpaste before putting it in your mouth - doing so</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been more than two years with the Sonicare Flexcare for me and more than 10 years using Sonicare toothbrushes exclusively, save for trips where I took a non-electric standard toothbrush with me.  </li>
            <li>In the older e-Series units, the connection was performed via a screw top connection to the handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it cleans my teeth like no other toothbrush has been able to before.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this Phillips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush if you want really clean, professional results every time you brush!!!</li>
            <li>Going from the Elite to the Flexcare, the Flexcare has a much improved design with narrow handle, very attractive blue and silver trim, ridges on back for better gripping, and most significantly a head which easily pops off for santizing</li>
            <li>much as I love this brush, I do realize that the price Sonicare has marketed it at is exceedingly high.  </li>
            <li>As much as I love this brush, I do realize that the price Sonicare has marketed it at is exceedingly high.  </li>
            <li>:) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It felt extremely comfortable and after a few minor teeth chatters as I got used to holding the brush at the required angle, it cleaned my teeth wonderfully, but more of that in a moment.</li>
            <li>really makes your mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how smooth my teeth felt the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I am sorta dissatisfied with the carrying case, it looks pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>On the first one I received the UV light wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>With this product I really don&#x27;t miss a thing, it&#x27;s the perfect tooth cleaning solution next to a professional inside your mouth.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, it seems to do a lot better job than my old sonicare toothbrush and is much lighter and easier to hold.</li>
            <li>They were very willing to send me another</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I saw a store exhibit of the Philips Sonicare Flexcare and was very interested.</li>
            <li>takes some time to get used to using this coming from a normal toothbrush, but it works way way better.</li>
            <li>my regular morning routine, and by the time I am ready to brush, my heads are nice and sanitized &#x3D;).  </li>
            <li>When I finally followed through, I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I cannot think of any good excuse for the folks at Philips designing it this way, unless it is a money-making scheme.</li>
            <li>However, I wish that the developers have been more thoughtful when they come up with some certain simple but important parts to make life easy for users.     </li>
            <li>I had the older &#x27;e&#x27; series of sonicare toothbrushes, and this is a great update in respect to the charging and the yellow stuff that grows in the head area.</li>
            <li>And once I&#x27;m done, I pop the brush head into the sanitizer for a nice, clean brush the next time I use it.    </li>
            <li>The handle comes set by default to the two-minute clean cycle, the 30-second beep cycle, and the startup mode--this uses a slower brush rate to start, and gradually increases over the first two weeks to the full speed.</li>
            <li>I really liked that extra clean feeling every time I brush my teeth now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Flexcare brushes as a great upgrade to any toothbrush, electric or manual, that you&#x27;re currently using.</li>
            <li>So, thanks to my dental hygienist for introducing me to Sonicare, and thanks to Philips for keeping a healthy smile on my face!</li>
            <li>It is a good product as long as it is WORKING, if it works!  </li>
            <li>I love my new Sonicare FlexCare.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li>But his favorite things about this new toothbrush?</li>
            <li>Took my brushing to a new and better level.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the sanitizer feature, its like using a new toothbrush head every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear&#x27;s top load models in efficiency and economics.t.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear&#x27;s top load models in efficiency and economics.</li>
            <li>Thank you and hopefully this new one work better.    </li>
            <li>New heads are so much more sanitary and easier to use    Cons:  </li>
            <li>I was GREATLY pleased with the new Sonicare with sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying my new Sonicare Flexcare with the Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I love to brush my teeth with this new model.  </li>
            <li>I previously used an Oral-B automatic and thought that one was great</li>
            <li>Really great improvement over previous models.  </li>
            <li>The battery seems as good today as it was when I first opened it -- wish I could say the same for my laptop and cordless tools.</li>
            <li>It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush, and look forward to using it for a long time to come.    </li>
            <li>Has 3 different modes: clean, sensitive, and massage (which greatly assists when cleaning/flushing gums).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, your teeth are really going to feel clean, but it has a very short life.  </li>
            <li>With the whole timing helper settings it makes it so easy to brush sufficiently.</li>
            <li>a manual toothbrush is as effective, if not more effective, than an electric, but I preferred the electric.    </li>
            <li>The kit includes a handy, small travel recharger and a nice travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>One drawback is that the battery is not replaceable, so I&#x27;m not sure how many charges the Sonicare is good for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first brush with the Sonicare was an interesting experience because I wasn&#x27;t expecting the feeling of a hypercharged, intensely vibrating bristles--I used the MaxCare setting.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve been good about keeping it dry</li>
            <li>There are plenty of features to utilize like the \\&quot;quadrant timer\\&quot; which alows you to break down the 2 minute timer into 4 sections for the most effective and even brushing.</li>
            <li>I hope the noise means more effective vibrations that break down the plaque.</li>
            <li>You really can feel a significant difference in how clean your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used one, you will be amazed at the huge positive difference they make in your tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li>First of all it is not as vigorous a vibration as the original</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Philips Sonicare fan since I got my first electric tooth brush for aprx $100 (on sale!)</li>
            <li>I bought a set of 3 extra brush-heads, and plan to have/use this unit for many years to come!</li>
            <li>I bought this 9 months ago and love it so far!  </li>
            <li>My whole mouth in general feels a lot more healthy.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, I was not too excited about the gift at first.</li>
            <li>This is the first Sonicare brush I have ever tried and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not trying them sooner!</li>
            <li>After using the Sonicare toothbrush twice daily (okay!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I actually wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to be able to handle it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading my manual, I also learned that my first time wasn&#x27;t even as powerful as it could have been!</li>
            <li>the end, this is no doubt a luxury item for most, more likely to end up under the Christmas tree for those who are interested in a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end, this is no doubt a luxury item for most, more likely to end up under the Christmas tree for those who are interested in a sonic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>- the new design is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Quadtimer is great, new head design is terrific</li>
            <li>The new one is lighter and smaller, and the performance is great</li>
            <li>The buttons are easy to press and feel sure and solid in the case.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the on-off button is positioned so it is easy to press, so you have to keep turning the thing back on.</li>
            <li>The smaller, more rounded brush head on the flexcare makes it so easy to reach all of the teeth in my mouth.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare really leaves my teeth CLEAN; like just after a dental cleaning clean</li>
            <li>, the multiple modes is fantastic new touch to an already good item.     </li>
            <li>I arrived at this one after at least 20 hours of reading reviews online and comparing models, so I&#x27;m positive that I got the best one on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course you still have to floss, but you won&#x27;t believe how clean your teeth are after the first time and</li>
            <li>The brush head is great, I like the different cycles, and the sanitizer is an extra bonus and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>far as performance goes, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been more or less happy with this toothbrush than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li>I have to say I don&#x27;t use with any regularity the side attachment to where the toothbrush is stored; there&#x27;s no particular good reason for my NOT using it.  </li>
            <li>and I think I would have been fine with a cheaper model like the Healthy White.</li>
            <li>The first was an older model with the screw on top.  </li>
            <li>Now, the charging station is clever; not only can you keep the unit at full charge (recommended for effective use) but the sanitizer holds two brushes and it&#x27;s right there so that after you brush, you can pop the head into the unit and press a button to activate the UV light.</li>
            <li>It felt great when it worked and now it was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li>We both were BLOWN AWAY by the quality, functionality, and price point for such and amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness of the sanitizer, but I guess it gives you some peace of mind knowing your toothbrush is germ free.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel very cleaned and smooth.</li>
            <li>Once I got used to the feeling though, I really started to enjoy the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin with, there is no gross slime getting stuck in these heads, and the UV sanitizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>The size of the head is huge and the bristles much softer than the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I liked all the different settings this one offered.  </li>
            <li>Plus having the U.V. Sanitizer on board is nice only takes 10mins to run a cycle.</li>
            <li>People have noticed my smile is brighter and ask what I&#x27;m doing to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 2 week charge (great for vacations in Europe when charging is an issue - my old one only charged for 48hours</li>
            <li>Lasted for many years, actually cracked on the threads in 1996 and was replaced for free</li>
            <li>It is worth</li>
            <li>it was worth it</li>
            <li>For this reason alone, the brush is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I find this product 100% worth my dollar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush, the &#x27;soniccare&#x27; experience is far above any brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>probably worth the additional price to you.  </li>
            <li>The different modes are nice, too.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 2014:  </li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>When I pointed out that Philips PAID for the the return shipping and therefore would have its own proof of return, I was told that was a different department and that it was MY RESPONSIBILITY to provide Philips with the return tracking ID.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t decided yet how useful the sanitizer is, since it kills invisible stuff</li>
            <li>The newer ergonomic design that this electronic toothbrush has feels much more natural in holding while brushing.</li>
            <li>Pro: Terrific slimline design, Longer time between battery recharging, More functionality, Virtually maintenance free.</li>
            <li>We considered buying another one - we liked the brushing features, the overall design and size plus the sanitizer - but have opted to go for an Oral B this time instead.</li>
            <li>thing is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This thing is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  </li>
            <li>Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  </li>
            <li>and my mouth felt so fresh.</li>
            <li>It is much more dependable, although my husband really prefered the Sonicare, which didn&#x27;t vibrate as much</li>
            <li>and he thinks has a smaller head more comfortable for his mouth.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh from the dentist</li>
            <li>Within one day, it started going off on its own, sometimes in the middle of the night, even though no one pressed any buttons.</li>
            <li>and they recommend Oral-B, which they claim has great customer service and is better at getting behind the teeth.</li>
            <li>The rubber material coating is far more than the 9500 series i guess</li>
            <li>I owned an old Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like)</li>
            <li>All three of the settings work well, although I use mostly the Sensitive and Massge settings when working on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>but I will have to say it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall Philips did a nice job on the upgrade.</li>
            <li>This alone is already worth the value.     </li>
            <li>Once I was young and foolish too like many of u out there.</li>
            <li>I dont know if they have done something about this or not, but I didnt have fun removing the collection .</li>
            <li>But after using it for a while now, I think it was worth price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the brushing options, the auto shutoff sanitizer, and the ease of use, is well worth buying.</li>
            <li>so far okay...</li>
            <li>Or at least my most recent one didn&#x27;t, and that was the dentist who really impressed me</li>
            <li>I questioned the cost when I purchased, but now I believe it is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>This brush actually seems 20 years more advanced, and that is not an exaggeration.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter, quieter, much better brushhead design and the battery lasts and lasts (so far).</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it for an appliance used this often.</li>
            <li>When I finally purchased and started using the Sonicare FlexCare RS930, I honestly wondered why I had not used the product before.  </li>
            <li>We honestly thought the price tag was worth it and were planning on buying a second one</li>
            <li>It has more features which the old model did not have and the sanitzer is a plus.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>love it so far</li>
            <li>I bought this Sonicare because I liked the idea of different settings and the UV sanitizing feature.</li>
            <li>but I assume it is doing a better job than the old Braun.</li>
            <li>the UV sanitizer is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>really worth the money...</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product so far though.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase/gift</li>
            <li>he said my teeth were in far better condition</li>
            <li>, I agree it is noisier, and for me I have to use the compact head, however the different modes for cleaning is really great for those with sensitive gums, and find the oral b too abrasive, I cannot stand the heads on the oral b either.  </li>
            <li>I am fortunate enough to be able to replace it, but don&#x27;t get hooked if you can&#x27;t....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here to tell you it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>My gum feels very loose now, probally because of the toothbrush being so powerful, and I don&#x27;t think that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning by itself and in the evening combined with a Braun/Oral B which is better at scrubbing off the plack on my molars near the gums.  </li>
            <li>I think this toothbrush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go back to the Sonicare and really liked the idea of the sanitizer (if you have ever researched all of the germs and bacteria in the bathroom, you&#x27;ll know why), but I felt the added cost was prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>the 2 week \\&quot;ramp-up\\&quot; program that gradually increases the power for the 1st 2 weeks you use it is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad that they have a sensitive setting too as sometimes my teeth and gums need that as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to keep it in the charger all the time anyway, as it&#x27;s usually better to completely drain a rechargeable battery before recharging.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled enough with the results to take the time to post this review.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is so worth the money.</li>
            <li>the added feature of the uv sterilizer is nice especially after you have had an illness.  </li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is fancy, but I have no medical-base opinion whether it&#x27;s really useful.</li>
            <li>I always get the fresh out of a dentist chair feeling, but you get use to that feeling after a while.</li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive but I have been OK with this product.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the rather hefty price?  </li>
            <li>I use the UV cleaning but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really useful.  </li>
            <li>and I love the litle blue light that shines through the sanitizer (yes, I&#x27;m a dork.  </li>
            <li>who knew!?!?brush head, so I&#x27;m ordering the compact because I think it will be more comfortable for my smaller mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I love the litle blue light that shines through the sanitizer (yes, I&#x27;m a dork.  </li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>and I feel the investment was so worth it.</li>
            <li>this being my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion that I&#x27;ve been without my Sonicare</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Although pricey, it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth all of the pennies you paid and will pay for replacement heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Really liked this brush, but a week ago it died in the middle of the night..</li>
            <li>and by January 2013 it was no longer effective (It does not vibrate properly making cleaning ineffective).  </li>
            <li>I bought one for myself several months ago and loved it so much i bought one for my husband for Fathers Day.</li>
            <li>The FlexCare replaces my old Philips Sonicare Advanced model, which lasted me over 8 years!  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t get a stockpile of replacement brush heads since you probably won&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Sonicare toothbrushes and have used them for nearly 10 years, always getting rave reviews at semi-annual dentist checkups.</li>
            <li>I used to think electric toothbrushes were a huge waste of money because I never had any problems brushing my teeth without one, but I finally decided to try one out after hearing so many great things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend everyone gets this toothbrush, it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The induction charging technology is worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+The old brushes were bulkier too, the newer brushes are better.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the older brushes had exposed magnets, which would easily detach.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if Sonicare passed some of the materials savings onto the consumer, but the replacement heads seem to be about the same cost from what I remember.    </li>
            <li>and this one by far blows it away in so many ways.</li>
            <li>I like having the choice of what kind of brushing I would like, rather than no choice brushing like the regular Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>so well, I guess it is worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Decided to see if their upgraded technology was worth the money..</li>
            <li>Well..it was worth every penny I can say.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>it makes the bristles brittle so I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>much worth buying.  </li>
            <li>Very much worth buying.  </li>
            <li>can carry far more germs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, one could reason that it is worth the dental health benefits.  </li>
            <li>However it does not affect the cleaning power obviously, which is the most important part of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money and</li>
            <li>:) I think the UV light that sanitizes the brush head is the key.  </li>
            <li>This thing is powerful.</li>
            <li>Healthy/clean teeth are worth it.</li>
            <li>it is about $100 buck&#x27;s, But it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s an investment, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely use the infrared receptacle (sanitizer).</li>
            <li>It is a much more vigorous action than my rotating head brush.</li>
            <li>It claims that you will see a whiter smile in one week</li>
            <li>Teeth are worth the investment in these specialized tools.  </li>
            <li>The first charge lasted 2 weeks, not bad</li>
            <li>We purchased this product right on time for vacation, little did we know it would be great ,since it was portable.</li>
            <li>In fact, it can be a bit intimidating the first time you put it inside your mouth, because the motor is so much more powerful than what you were probably expecting if you&#x27;ve previously used the kind of \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one, my teeth are cleaner, dentist visits shorter, and I have had this one for over 2 years and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>This problem is normal for batteries, and normally easy to fix.   </li>
            <li>If you get this toothbrush, you may experience some tingling around your gums when you first start out, but you&#x27;ll quickly get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Twelve years ago I used to pooh pooh electric toothbrushes, but my first Sonicare quickly made a convert of me.  </li>
            <li>First the noise and vibration alerted me tremendously.</li>
            <li>so i looked at all the new models and chose this one because i thought the new UV cleaner is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Flexcare brushes as a great upgrade to any toothbrush, electric or manual, that you&#x27;re currently using.has been reduced in exchange, but the noise can be too much for some.  </li>
            <li>My old electronic brush made my gums bleed - this one seems to be more powerful but is very gentle to my gums.</li>
            <li>the only thing it needs is a brush that can clean the teeth better in the curves.</li>
            <li>It broke, the button caved in but I love how clean my mouth/teeth feel after using it (compared to a regular manual brush).</li>
            <li>you can make sure your brushes are clean and sanitized and will not transfer germs back into your mouth.</li>
            <li>but I definitely feel like my mouth is more clean</li>
            <li>In the last 2 month I feel my teeth clean and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>The battery seems excellent: the instructions say a full charge takes 24 hours, so when the battery indicator has been on one green bar (out of three) for a couple days, I put the unit on the charger after my evening usage, and leave it there for 24 hours, using a manual brush the next morning.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s always good to check in other areas too.</li>
            <li>- This model is so superior to the other Sonicare toothbrushes, that I would suggest Philips stopping making them, and reduce the price of this one.</li>
            <li>A 3 pack of the new heads is the same price as a 2 pack of the old heads, making them actually a better deal for a superior</li>
            <li>Price is high, but then again you can&#x27;t really put a price on healthy teeth and</li>
            <li>so I know I&#x27;m doing the right amount.</li>
            <li>, I know I am brushing my teeth, every time, for the right amount of time (per quadrant).  </li>
            <li>The mode selection button is right below the on/off button.  </li>
            <li>Man, was she right.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand one reviewer who said the brush doesn&#x27;t sit right or balance well on the stand.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand one reviewer who said the brush doesn&#x27;t sit right or balance well on the stand.  </li>
            <li>that right</li>
            <li>This is it, priced just right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right where my thumb is when I use it.</li>
            <li>The compact head is also the right size for the hard-to-reach teeth areas.</li>
            <li>All the reviews I had read on this product were right on.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s right folks, I can feel my plaque with my tounge because it is so hardened on).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers are right...</li>
            <li>&quot; know that until 2 weeks ago, I was right there with you.</li>
            <li>&quot; know that until 2 weeks ago, I was right there with you.</li>
            <li>The difference is that the head pulses and emits sonic waves that shake the microscopic ick that you&#x27;ve accumulated right off your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Should have used the right parts.  </li>
            <li>:rolleyes:  I like the new style brush heads -- easy to snap on/off (2 of us share the brush)</li>
            <li>This new one is even more fantastic than the old model.  </li>
            <li>I opted for the regular and it felt fine and fitted between my gums and cheeks easily,</li>
            <li>I tend to use the quick care (one minute) cycle in the mornings and in the evening I switch off between the normal clean cycle (two minutes) and the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; cycle (three minutes).&lt;br /&gt;-Newly designed head.</li>
            <li>It really gets you the clean feeling just like you have gotten out of a dental visit.</li>
            <li>My teeth really feel clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>it really does clean</li>
            <li>find the feature that makes the toothbrush \\&quot;burp\\&quot;, a tiny pause and beep after each of the first three segments of a cycle, to be also extremely handy.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am VERY pleased with this product, and recommend it unconditionally to anyone seeking to maintain and augment their professional dental</li>
            <li>So far, I am VERY pleased with this product, and recommend it unconditionally to anyone seeking to maintain and augment their professional dental</li>
            <li>Leaves my whole mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does clean better than my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so my brush is always clean and enclosed when I get ready to use it.</li>
            <li>and I really missed that clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth &amp; gums feel really refreshed &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>The different cleaning modes are a nice touch (the Massage mode is quite effective), but I find the standard cleaning method to be more than enough.  </li>
            <li>Performance-wise, I honestly find them exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>, I gently swabbed it with alcohol to clean the filth that had accumulated where the brush mounts.  </li>
            <li>(15 seconds each - good if you want to do a brief brushing after a meal or something), MaxCare (3 minutes, 45 seconds each - 30 seconds normal,</li>
            <li>Now it is much easier to change and keep the brush head / inter-connect area clean.</li>
            <li>Who wants to put slime in their mouth when they are trying to CLEAN their teeth?</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and will repurchase for other family members! :)</li>
            <li>I really liked it over the Oral B because the Brush heads looked more like a traditional toothbrush and seemed to feel better in my mouth vs the round heads of the Oral B.    </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ridiculous when they don&#x27;t have any type of support for out of warranty, I would be more than willing to pay for a repair or refurb unit at a fair price.</li>
            <li>GumCare&#x27; takes 3 minutes, the first 2 minutes of this mode are just like clean, and the last minute is more of the &#x27;massage&#x27; feature, which is a bit softer and is meant to use for brushing your gums.</li>
            <li>(To be fair, I doubt Philips is the only one who has done this -- Arm &amp; Hammer does it on their baking soda boxes as well, now you&#x27;re supposed to put a new box in the fridge every 30 days -- used to be every 90 days.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my new Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The FlexCare has some nice new features (e.g., massage and sensitive settings and sanitizer)</li>
            <li>SINCE I RECEIVED MY NEW SONICARE FLEXCARE LAST MONTH, I AM DELIGHTED WITH HOW MY DENTAL HEALTH HAS IMPROVED.</li>
            <li>I weighed the cost of this new Sonicare toothbrush against the cost of going to the dentist and decided it was a good investment in my overall health.  </li>
            <li>Good day.n only suggest you to buy new Toothbrush with the 15% discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I can say its a very SMART toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped very promptly and the price was right!    </li>
            <li>LiOn powered model easily lasts 3 or more weeks of daily brushing, is thinner and the new head style (vs the old vibrating magnet style) feels like a more focused brushing.  </li>
            <li>I used to have some cigarette tar underneath my teeth and the only way to get rid is to go to a dentist, but after using this for about 1 month, I am very happy that 80% of those black stains are gone.</li>
            <li>The next best part of the timer is the quadpacer which gives a slight pause to help break up the time brushing into 4 sections.</li>
            <li>This brush has less vibration, and the battery is many times better.  </li>
            <li>Brushing was easy, unobtrusive, and fairly comfortable overall.</li>
            <li>Works fine, brand new.</li>
            <li>As I said I can&#x27;t comment on the durability or long term quality but the performance is amazing.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are nice, although I prefer the larger one (standard vs. compact) to cover more tooth area.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is exactly what I was looking for; the customer reviews are accurate--the Philips Sonicare Flexcare is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The plaque is smooth normally, so I don&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li>First of all I know it sounds pricey but worth every dime..</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable considering the full 2-year warranty.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is because of the sonic fast pulsing of the brush head and timer that allows me to brush for the full recommended time.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have invested the money in my oral care when this first came out because it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare brushes in general.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested the one-minute GoCare routine and found it acceptable for a rush job, but I much prefer to perform the full MaxCare routine, which runs through a 4-quadrant brush and massage cycle in three minutes.  </li>
            <li>The smaller toothbrush head makes it easy to clean those hard-to-reach places - leaving my teeth and gums shiny and my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Good excuse to buy a new one!    </li>
            <li>It has appeared in previous models (not my 5300 though), and is nice if you&#x27;ll use it, but I tend to go at my own pace as I focus more on problem areas in my mouth and less on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I turned it off and pressed the head down and took a good look at it.  </li>
            <li>So good that now two other people I know have one from me!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare has a very vigorous, and seemingly very effective, brushing action (the next visit to the dental hygienist will tell the tale).  </li>
            <li>The timer is great because we know we&#x27;ve brushed long enough to keep our teeth clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>My recommendation to you is that if you are looking for a new toothbrush, and I know you are because you clicked on this product, then buy this toothbrush and enjoy all the oral health benefits that come with owning a sonicare.</li>
            <li>Called Philips and they are sending out a brand new one free of charge.</li>
            <li>Our unit stopped charging after a year, so I chatted online (available 24 hours) with a Phillips rep who said I&#x27;ll get a new unit within 10 days....</li>
            <li>Philips took him at his word and shipped him a brand new brush for free-</li>
            <li>Thi particular model comes able to setup for a new person to Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Wow, when I&#x27;m done brushing with the Sonicare, my whole mouth feels intensely clean and my teeth are as smoothly polished as they get after a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>A few more days went by, my teeth stayed with that smooth clean feeling.</li>
            <li>However, set it to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; as the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode was far too strong and may get your gum to bleed.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is perhaps a bit more useful but still not necessary.    </li>
            <li>Including: quick care, max care, massage, clean, and sensitive.</li>
            <li>The Old Sonicares we had are still going strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s positioned to easily turn on the tooth brush since it&#x27;s where your thumb would naturally rest.</li>
            <li>I returned to Sonicare after my Oral B Professional died (after several years of good service).</li>
            <li>Friends of ours had the same toothbrush and experienced the SAME thing!  </li>
            <li>I almost threw it away expecting the typical customer service nightmare when I tried to make good on the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I used the UV Sanitizer once, and the brushheads appear \\&quot;dry and nicely warmed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product that should make your next dental appointment for teeth cleaning much easier.    </li>
            <li>The toothbrush not only cleans my teeth a lot better, but keeps them clean for much longer as well, when I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li>My old one wasn&#x27;t charging as easily anymore</li>
            <li>The settings allow you to clean your teeth with  regular and easy settings and massage your gums.  </li>
            <li>Seeing HUGE results with my 8 year old in just one week of brushing - SO worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I have this odd sensation that this is what good brushing should feel</li>
            <li>Instead, I have this odd sensation that this is what good brushing should feel like.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally sold on daily use of a Sonicare (along with flossing of course), as the dental hygienist has almost never found plaque in the years since I began using one, and my gum health has been great.  </li>
            <li>It also has a 1 minute cycle that uses the intense vibration for a quick brush.  </li>
            <li>Being a dentist I have used just about every toothbrush out there for free or next to free.  </li>
            <li>Newer head design eliminates having to clean inside the head like in the older designs.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the money, and I&#x27;m glad I finally upgraded to newer cleaning tech!</li>
            <li>It does take a full 10 minutes to complete a full sanitization session, but I just turn on the sanitation while I am showering and/or flossing-</li>
            <li>so he did not have much incentive to steer me to this unless it works), and I have seen my mild gingivitis begin to go away since I started using it.</li>
            <li>The new handle I received in 8/10 JUST DIED OUT AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li>Simple design and very easy to use, you can feel it instantly working easier and better than the cheaper rotating brushes.</li>
            <li>The included heads are also very soft and extremely comfortable to brush with&lt;br /&gt;-Battery</li>
            <li>On the regular setting the brush has a bit of a high pitched whine so since then, I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; teeth setting and that works just great.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really massages your gums and cleans your teeth better than any other cheaper battery powered brushes out there and it leaves your mouth with a clean fresh feeling that I have never felt in my life!</li>
            <li>Today I decided to call Philips to see if it would be possible to buy just a new wand (since the UV sanitizer and charging station still works fine) and they are sending us a NEW ONE FOR FREE!!  </li>
            <li>The tingling feeling on teeth and gums is unusual, but not unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li>I have done the right thing to make sure my teeth are not just pearly white...</li>
            <li>The per head price is still several times what it would cost to buy a new manual brush; but for me the superior cleaningis worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise&lt;br /&gt;-Flexcare models are louder than older models.  </li>
            <li>No problem, the remedy was immediate and very much to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>It is a very comfortable brushing experience overall.</li>
            <li>On my Oral-B I had to remove the brush head to wash out the gunk after brushing, but because the Sonicare brush heads are longer, very, very litle gunk gets in them.  </li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush very much.  </li>
            <li>I like my Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer very much.</li>
            <li>and they also like it very much.  </li>
            <li>its on, so you only have to exert very light pressure when using it against the&lt;br /&gt;teeth.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes this very much.</li>
            <li>very powerful and cleans good, hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>However, last time I went to the dentist, which was the first time in 3 years, I got a very clean bill of health, for this first time in my life!</li>
            <li>The selection of the various programs which vary in both length and intensity is very easy and the dividing of all these into four quarters, marked by a slight interruption, is a great help in ensuring an all-round cleaning.</li>
            <li>The pop-off heads are a huge improvement over the screw-ons, as many other reviewers have said.     </li>
            <li>but the max care sets the toothbrush for a normal 2 minute clean as well as a 1 minute gum massage setting.    </li>
            <li>They also include a set of three alternate snap-on color rings so multiple family members can easily identify their own brush tip.</li>
            <li>That stopped working just after the warranty for the original handset expired (they don&#x27;t reset the warranty after they send you a new defective handset)</li>
            <li>The UV ray cleaner is a key feature that provides peace of mind that you are using a clean brushing tool free of germs and molecules.</li>
            <li>I had an older version with a battery that finally gave out, so this was a nice upgrade.  </li>
            <li>I particularly feel good about the sanitizer feature, as I can only imagine what types and quantities of germs normally cultivate on the head of a used toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>If you already have one, I would say you&#x27;ll be fine with the one you have, and suggest perhaps waiting until the price comes down more.</li>
            <li>the flex-care from Sonic-care is even better than our orginal Sonic-care toothbrush, the vibration is very intense and soothing at the same time</li>
            <li>This thing oscilated very fast, If you can get over the feeling of the first time, the way your teeth feel after makes up every time for that first.</li>
            <li>However, as far as the brushing part goes -- my teeth did not restain with coffee and wine as they usually do after the dentist visit, so it does a very good job brushing.</li>
            <li>The little travel charger, which we used on a recent trip, is handy, but it would be nice if it had a couple of pegs to store the brushes on.</li>
            <li>It also has push on brush heads, which is a huge improvement over the old locknut design.</li>
            <li>Plus being able to have two brush heads in the sanitizing unit allowed for me to use different brushes during the morning and evening...</li>
            <li>Considering the higher price, most cannot afford to have this even though it should be attainable and because of that, overall I would rate 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li>The first decision I had to make was a rotating head (Oral B) or back-and-forth</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, been using it for a year now</li>
            <li>first use with my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes since they were first introduced.</li>
            <li>i NEVER thought i would pay this much for a toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>No longer using Sonicare in Houston ;-)</li>
            <li>An innovative and terrific design and product.</li>
            <li>The first one to suffer this fate I had stored on the charger every day.</li>
            <li>The most recent one I decided maybe that was the problem</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush - boy</li>
            <li>how well this brush would work until I first tried it.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, not thinking I was going to have problems with a $100 toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t keep it.  </li>
            <li>At least those won&#x27;t fly off into your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast!</li>
            <li>My teeth have felt cleaner and looked whiter consistently since I began using this brush.</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare was the IntelliClean model.</li>
            <li>Made it to the house faster than the first one.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a couple of days after that Amazon had found problems with the first shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love brushing with this so much, I regularly use the \\&quot;pro-clean\\&quot; timer, and still could keep brushing!</li>
            <li>You have to know why your gum is bleeding first, if it&#x27;s plaque, check that you eat healthy diet, that&#x27;s also another reason to get plaque growing and is not told in the commercial advertisements.</li>
            <li>This is my first high-end toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare was a 4000 series Advance model.</li>
            <li>I realized the next evolution of the product was out, and expecting to use the toothbrush for many years to come, decided to pay the extra money for the top of the line version.  </li>
            <li>I love the multiple settings!</li>
            <li>How much whiter my teeth are!</li>
            <li>It really made my day!</li>
            <li>It really made my day!</li>
            <li>At my last cleaning I was told my brushing could not have been better.</li>
            <li>A lot of features if your willing to take the time to remember, so</li>
            <li>I received this for for my birthday last year, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a wedding gift for some friends, and they&#x27;ve told me that it&#x27;s worked out very well for them!</li>
            <li>However, the cost is well worth it if it keeps my teeth and gums in the shape that the product appears to be capable of.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that the next time I go in for a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office, I am going to be able to maintain that cleanliness for a LOT longer with my FlexCare than I ever could with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>At first, the brush vibrations were tickling my gums.</li>
            <li>I insisted for some days and soon became used to the vibe feeling - not a big deal any more.</li>
            <li>My first one had the on/off button wear through and stop working.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before it feels a bit funny at first</li>
            <li>But make sure you read the brief instruction manual BEFORE you use it</li>
            <li>This is not my first Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Not sorry about purchase, I can see it&#x27;s effects in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I am heartily impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products overall!!</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working at all after 6 months.  </li>
            <li>This is my first battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the amount of build up this sonic brush removed in the first use.</li>
            <li>Areas that build up tartar are feeling as smooth as if I just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>feeling twice a day is pretty luxurious.</li>
            <li>feeling twice a day is pretty luxurious.</li>
            <li>face cleaner first.</li>
            <li>first one worked for 8 months and the replacement worked for 5 months.</li>
            <li>I am sure Philips is going to replace my unit because it is well within the warranty period (2 years) but it is such a hastle</li>
            <li>Even with the two of us using the power head it has more than enough stored power.</li>
            <li>Overall, a outstanding product.</li>
            <li>When I first saw and held the Flexcare, I thought it was going to turn out to be too flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I know I like to get more toothpaste in the middle of my brushing</li>
            <li>the pause part allows me to take a second to spit and reload my toothbrush with more paste, etc.</li>
            <li>They are better than a regular store.</li>
            <li>I have convinced my whole family to buy one!</li>
            <li>It helps me to make sure I&#x27;m taking enough time with all four sections of my mouth.</li>
            <li>used for first time this morning</li>
            <li>I first bought my Flexcare in Nov.2008 after using a Sensonic brush for 9 years</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could tell feel the difference it made.</li>
            <li>It has started turning on in the middle of the night or day by itself and giving us almost a heart attack each time because we can never figure out what the sound is!  </li>
            <li>: Thank you for providing request information.&lt;br /&gt;Harry : What is the exact issue with your toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: it keeps turning on by itself and you can&#x27;t turn it off</li>
            <li>When I changed how I brushed, the results were night and day better.    </li>
            <li>First use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had just begun to enjoy myself, so I started it again, this time switching to Sensitive mode and Massage mode.  </li>
            <li>One of my kids had a dentist visit last week, and his teeth were much better than they used to be.    </li>
            <li>I bought one for my husband first</li>
            <li>So I searched around Amazon for info on the various models and read many reviews,</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for years, ever since the first model.</li>
            <li>This is my third Sonicare toothbrush and I&#x27;m pleased to say it&#x27;s even better than the first or second.  </li>
            <li>The conclusion: I am considering replacing the FlexCare with the Healthy White version, saving about $30.  </li>
            <li>I love Sonicare-but this model seems to have not been tested enough.</li>
            <li>Works much better than a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>First time I have purchaed an electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the reason that the brush handle is now smaller which makes it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the reason that the brush handle is now smaller which makes it more manageable.    </li>
            <li>HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The first ones got cracks in them (their support people told me toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide caused them).  </li>
            <li>The more recent models I had (including the one that dispenses toothpaste) collected saliva in the heads and in a cavity in the handle.  </li>
            <li>Since getting this Sonicares, my gum checkups have been stellar.  </li>
            <li>and I love the santizer that assures me that I am not putting germs back into my mouth</li>
            <li>(Yuck-o!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to buy extra brush heads for about $8.50 apiece for a 3-pack, cheaper than retail.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Sonicare toothbrush I have owned.  </li>
            <li>It has not failed me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted over 4 years and this one just crapped out in almost a year.</li>
            <li>I will say that this is the first model I&#x27;ve had problems with.  </li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush but can&#x27;t rationalize buying a third one...</li>
            <li>and I would have to scrub it out with brushes and hot vinegar or rubbing alcohol, it was a pain.</li>
            <li>I had to have the first toothbrush replaced after about 6 months.</li>
            <li>When it worked it was terrific, but I have to think many people are having this problem with the toothbrush dying out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electrical toothbrush</li>
            <li>At first the vibrating almost made my head hurt</li>
            <li>My first unit was replaced through the warranty.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>The second time around I use the \\&quot;Sesitive\\&quot; setting which was more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one of these toothbrushes about two years ago based on a recommendation from my dental hygienist, and I didn&#x27;t know they even existed in this price range until I saw this one.  </li>
            <li>I had a friend tell me I would throw it out after the first use...</li>
            <li>going a hundred times a second, and vibrating the top of your mouth...</li>
            <li>I think its the first try that will make or brake it for you.</li>
            <li>I think that this problem is abetted by the slimmer design of the latest generation, which makes gripping it a tad more difficult.  </li>
            <li>The first sonic lasted 4 years.  </li>
            <li>This product, bought exactly one year ago, worked well for a couple months.</li>
            <li>We bought this newer version of the same brush and continue to be equally pleased with it after 6 months.</li>
            <li>it cycles at a higher speed and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>And the Interplak is similar to and superior to the Braun/Oral B brushes: each tuft rotates, rechargeable batteries are apparently replaceable and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li>so i am not too sure how to use them, or rather - what the differences are in the actual brushing...</li>
            <li>Our first electric toothbrush lasted 10 years.    </li>
            <li>However, the design can be improved to prevent it from happening in the first place.  </li>
            <li>The first two just stopped working.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this one will last more than a year.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my teeth felt like they had been professionaly cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I visited my dentist a week later, and he remarked at how healthy my gums looked.  </li>
            <li>Something to be aware of before you invest in this product.</li>
            <li>It was my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I felt like I just had a cleaning, I couldnt stop running my tongue over my teeth..</li>
            <li>maybe because this is my first brush.</li>
            <li>My first lasted for almost 10 years before the battery gave out.  </li>
            <li>and I first bought the Oral B version because it was cheaper</li>
            <li>it looks pretty.  </li>
            <li>but did i mention my toothbrush is now pretty?</li>
            <li>and glad I purchased on with multiple options/settings.</li>
            <li>Phillips, I will make deviled eggs for your next company picnic; I love you.</li>
            <li>The shorter one has a concave bristle surface; the longer one has a double-concave surface and has a larger set of bristles, and is supposed to do a more through cleaning job.</li>
            <li>I use that one; the smaller one seems better suited for a child.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever purchased and used an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and they were each better than their earlier versions so this is not a surprise.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still on the first charge.  </li>
            <li>Although I balked at the price of the toothbrush, when I made up my mind to attack my dental problems the Sonicare Toothbrush was the first to come to mind.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Philips Sonicare Flexcare w/ Sanitizer for exactly three days now.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my recent upgrade from my old model to this one.</li>
            <li>Although the brush heads are still pretty spendy.</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ll ignore the fact that I found the two pack with an extra handle at Costco for $[...] more than I paid for this just three weeks after I got it for the purposes of this review</li>
            <li>first brush:  </li>
            <li>(I guess I should have listened to the person who said to turn it on only once it is touching your teeth)</li>
            <li>Ok, back to my story.  </li>
            <li>BUT Philips has been nothing short of FANTASTIC in replacing these under warranty!</li>
            <li>Philips replaced the first two, but we received the third one more than a year ago so if we want another one, we have to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I also like being able to have different modes of cleaning, for thorough versus on-the-run toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li>Of course, you&#x27;ll be able to buy extra brushes, but there&#x27;s no holder for them.  </li>
            <li>It will feel like an overpowered rocket in your mouth the first time or two</li>
            <li>I use the sanitizer every time I brush not because i&#x27;m a germaphobe, but because I&#x27;m drawn to things that are shiny and pretty</li>
            <li>I use the sanitizer every time I brush not because i&#x27;m a germaphobe, but because I&#x27;m drawn to things that are shiny and pretty</li>
            <li>My teeth also look much whiter and that is another reason to smile.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has kept me out of the dentist office for repairs since I bought the first one 4 or 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>were cleaner for those first couple weeks than they had been in weeks.  </li>
            <li>The soft travel case is just a cheap fabric bag to throw the brush in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Denmark and here we have 2 years warranty on all electronics, so i&#x27;m pretty pissed that it choose to die 2 month out of warranty.</li>
            <li>I know this is a problem your company is aware of because there are hundreds of reviews out there about this issue.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to share our entire conversation today with the Amazon community.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to share our entire conversation today with the Amazon community.</li>
            <li>The compact head is much better than the standard.</li>
            <li>First of all, there&#x27;s a battery meter.</li>
            <li>It lights up pretty.</li>
            <li>I purchased the flexCare with the sanitizer as a replacement for an old Sonic Care A model:  Advanced.  </li>
            <li>When I discovered the loss, the first thing I did was to go online and immediately purchase another.</li>
            <li>I had:&lt;br /&gt;+This brush is much smaller and the rubber is more ergonomic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonicare brushing system seems to work very well!    </li>
            <li>Then the whole cycle starts over!  </li>
            <li>This is the second electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned and mostly love it.</li>
            <li>I have only had this toothbrush for two days now and I have to say that I am in love already.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips, I am sold for life!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty vigorous and with the three speeds</li>
            <li>This toothbrush takes some getting used to at first.  </li>
            <li>You sort of get a tickling sensation when you first use this brush if you are not use to sonic-type toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>It was almost unbearable at first</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled I even spent $62 and got my daughter the kid one.</li>
            <li>I had heard of this toothbrush first from a friend of mine and then from the dentist who cares for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush, it comes with a sterilizing home for your brushes, with enough room for two heads.</li>
            <li>It has many different features for brushing.</li>
            <li>After trying the first time - she said it literally shakes her brain.  </li>
            <li>I love this Sonicare Toothbrush for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>I really love that you can get two different size brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Exactly one month out of the 2 year warranty, the toothbrush died on me.</li>
            <li>Being a dental care professional, when I called the Philips service center to address my concerns, their reply was perfunctory at best and only emphasized the fact that my warranty had expired.  </li>
            <li>first got us on Sonicare about 6 years</li>
            <li>I expect a top of the line, Flexcare to last longer than 2 years and 5 months - this company has perfected planned obsolesence - beware!</li>
            <li>my dad never used the one I bought him so after my first one burnt out in 2 years</li>
            <li>I wish I would of kept track of the first 2 I bought but out</li>
            <li>It worked well for the first year.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping that just that fact might be enough to get me to pay more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the most standard setting is default.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be easier to use or to use exactly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Of course I purchased it because it was my first electric brush</li>
            <li>that is why I first purchased the Oral-Bs</li>
            <li>The product is great, Sonicare as a company sucks.  </li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth much better than a regular toothbrush, based on research I did on the effects of brushing with a 31,000 movements per minute toothbrush.</li>
            <li>had this most recent one now over 6 months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, this is my first electric toothbrush that cost over 20$.</li>
            <li>just kidding, that&#x27;s what the package says but I ended up charging mine for about 6 hours before using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Simple operation, made even more simple by reading the manual</li>
            <li>Our entire family uses Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes and love them.</li>
            <li>it felt funny in the mouth</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips!</li>
            <li>The sanitizer activates with a simple push of the button on top of the unit and shuts off automatically when it completes the sanitizing cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, but after several weeks, I love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t life be easier first thing in the morning??).   </li>
            <li>The first symptom after just 45 days of use was the the brush head would no longer seat properly...causing the brush head to vibrate off.  </li>
            <li>let alone in the first 90 days.      </li>
            <li>Not only do me and my wife love this product our Dentist loves it and</li>
            <li>exactly what they wanted</li>
            <li>The vibration was generated internally in the handle and transmitted to the brush head by means of metal feet in the brush head, resting on the top of the interior of the brush handle.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush and especially use the massage mode of brushing often.</li>
            <li>This appliance works exactly as they state.  </li>
            <li>Thought at first</li>
            <li>The timer helps make sure you take enough time in all quadrants.</li>
            <li>The first one stoped working after 6 months, and I thongh that my son broke it.</li>
            <li>and my dentist said that an electric toothbrush would help (along with more regular flossing and rinsing).  </li>
            <li>Do not purchase this product if you want something to last more than 2 year or so.  </li>
            <li>Even though I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s cleaning or protecting from bacteria, it definitely makes me feel that it&#x27;s sanitized.</li>
            <li>Noticed my teeth were whiter after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>The battery is not holding charge as it was when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I love sonic, have owned several of them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this last July and love the toothbrush, however, I&#x27;ve had issues with the sanitizer not working.  </li>
            <li>It worked at first and then stopped.  </li>
            <li>All round good feeling.</li>
            <li>So I got a replacement from Philips and it was all good for a few months until it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a quick clean cycle and a gentle setting for those with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>The brushing action also feels more powerful than the old design.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few months, my dentist noticed that my teeth were as good as when I was using the Sonicare - plus</li>
            <li>I already got a good checkup from&lt;br /&gt;my dentist after using it a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>They sent me a new one that also worked great for a little over a year</li>
            <li>I had a dry run at cleaning this unit and changing the bulb and it is all very easy to disassemble and reassemble so</li>
            <li>done brushing with the Sonic (other than when the dentist cleans them), so if you&#x27;re looking for clean and healthy teeth and gums</li>
            <li>Philips expects you to remove the battery for special disposal and toss the rest of the brush away, then buy a new one.   </li>
            <li>/DOCUMENTATION&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to find that not only does this product come with very informative, concise written instructions, but the manuals can also be easily downloaded from the Philips&#x27; website in PDF format.  </li>
            <li>Never before has a toothbrush made my teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning!    </li>
            <li>It was very hard to clean, but this toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li>This new brush has far more power than the version I had, which was the version before the Elites (and Phillips&#x27; purchase of Sonicare).  </li>
            <li>Go Care Routine shortines the standard 2 minute clean mode to 1 minute, while Max Care is a longer, 3 minute cycle that includes both clean and massage mode.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and the sanitizer keeps the brush clean and dry.</li>
            <li>This model is quite a bit lighter than some of the previous ones which makes it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>My teeth just feel cleaner and my biannual cleanings seem to go more smoothly (my hygienist seems to have way less scraping to do).</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit in 2009, it became very loud and didn&#x27;t vibrate as effectively a year later.</li>
            <li>Now however, Sonicare has changed that with their new model, the Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this model because it was recommended by a dentist who said that the new Flexcare is not just a new style of brush, but that it actually has a greatly improved brushing technology.  </li>
            <li>First the original I picked up in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>If you are a regular flosser/good brusher, or you own an older Sonicare, you probably don&#x27;t want 14 days of gentle ramping up.</li>
            <li>Turning the toothbrush on for the first time didn&#x27;t alleviate my nervousness much, as the device certainly SOUNDS powerful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different, but it works very well and my most recent checkups have been much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I went with this instead of the Oral B Braun one I used to own that last only a few years</li>
            <li>Really gets to the back teeth very comfortably and the pulsation of the brush head against the teeth is just like the one you feel at your dentists.  </li>
            <li>Try the regular clean for a full cycle and then use the massage setting.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricy but appears to be well built so it will pay for itself; I was really surprised at how clean my teeth felt after the first use.    </li>
            <li>Now my teeth feel smooth and clean all day long.</li>
            <li>I no longer need to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; back and forth (thus reducing gum irritation), but still get very clean teeth after each sonic</li>
            <li>and they just sent me a brand new replacement (actually an upgraded model) free of charge after a quick webchat!</li>
            <li>I definitely like this product so far since it is far better and seems to clean better than my old toothbrush did.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to note whether it&#x27;s a lot better, but it is a lot more invigorating</li>
            <li>Some advice from other reviewers here came in handy</li>
            <li>My original Sonicare was over 12 years old and still doing well.   </li>
            <li>I tried two other battery toothbrushes and liked the process but knew I needed a rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth which I consider to be sensitive (It wasn&#x27;t until the age of 31 that I had my first filling).  </li>
            <li>It broke due to my own clumsiness.</li>
            <li>In fact, I kind of have to laugh a little at those who complain about the noise it makes.</li>
            <li>I specially love the UV clean option, and it&#x27;s much quieter than other brands.</li>
            <li>My previous brush came with a hard plastic case that fit the brush head and handle perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable grip and long (1-2 weeks) battery life.</li>
            <li>The actual cleaning is better than any other toothbrush I have used, and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The best feature, other than the thorough cleaning itself,  is that the program ensures you brush for the proper length of time and that you spend an equal amount of time in each of the four quadrants of your mouth (top inside, top outside, bottom inside, bottom outside.)         </li>
            <li>/&gt;Successfully meeting my 2 requirements for being happy with my new tooth brush, the Sonicare went above and beyond when it comes to the actual brushing.</li>
            <li>All of these options have an amazing slight pause every 30 seconds, that you use to make sure you are spending equal time in each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing much easier and pleasant, especially when you have stitches in your mouth and can barely open your mouth.</li>
            <li>Unlike the old screw on type, the brush pulls off and is easier to manage (and keep clean).  </li>
            <li>It also has three settings on it: Clean, Massage, and Sensitive.</li>
            <li>While brushing in the clean mode, it would switch to the \\&quot;massage mode\\&quot; or the \\&quot;sensitive mode\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>However, even knowing it will not last forever, I consider the price a worthy investment for the time I do get to use it and am happy to replace it every few years.</li>
            <li>Philips has not taken the design responsibility to put a soft rubber/plastic on the back of the brush head, so you will have to take care on your own.  </li>
            <li>Got it because my dentist said the oscillating action this model has was good to not only brush the teeth, but that it would scrub away plaque from between teeth and along gum lines better than my old &#x27;up-and-down&#x27; electric or regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and really like the different brushing cycles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  </li>
            <li>The removable, replaceable brush heads themselves come with bristles which are actually nice and soft - just like your dentist would likely recommend.</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;d like to be able to do is to \\&quot;program\\&quot; the brush to do the 3-minute brushing mode every time by default (this mode does the brushing action and also the massage action.)  </li>
            <li>It will be of no suprise to hear that for the first time in that period of use I needed a filling for the first time in 17 years, and another filling came out all together, my gums became very sore from the oral b</li>
            <li>More Crud in the Handle!&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with my old brush was that old toothpaste/drool/water tended to collected in the space where the handle connects to the brush head.  </li>
            <li>First, I love the timer that tell you how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>it is expensive, but it really does the best job without hurting your gums.  </li>
            <li>Also, I could have done without the UV Sanitizer, but I do use it at least once a week, especially when I have a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, customer service is really excellent.  </li>
            <li>Of course, there are major flaws and if another brand comes out with something better I will be quick to switch, so they really need to put in some more R&amp;D to improve these few flaws before someone else comes out with a product that does...</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>And what a big difference it makes to the feeling of a clean mouth!</li>
            <li>I have braces and since day one, I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush for better cleaning, less flossing (sensitive gums;bleed easily), and overall better care of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>PS, the free shipping came three days earlier, only took one day shipped to my city, that was a Huge surprise!</li>
            <li>I think this is the best toothbrush I have ever had so far and have had a few of the earlier models</li>
            <li>My teeth look much whiter, even after the first time (I&#x27;m a coffee, tea, and cola</li>
            <li>However, I may change my mind about this when I find out how much it saves me in dental bills ... not to mention how much &amp;#34;chair time&amp;#34; it may save me when I&#x27;m AT the dentist&#x27;s office!  </li>
            <li>, the battery is lasting over 2 weeks before needing recharge, comes with two different sized brush heads so you can choose which is more comfortable for you.      </li>
            <li>I am grateful for having the toothbrush for so long as I sincerely enjoyed this product</li>
            <li>Apparently Biology labs use UV light to sanitize their workspace</li>
            <li>With my first, according to the dentist there was much improvement in the health of my gums...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The default setting of \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; was too intense the first time around.</li>
            <li>The design of this brush is smaller than my last model, which makes it more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer was an added plus, even though I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s useful (other than making me THINK I&#x27;m using a cleaner toothbrush as a result).</li>
            <li>My teeth feel noticeably cleaner and smoother after brushing with the FlexCare, pretty much like when you get them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>The power button is logically placed just under your thumb, and all you really need to do is turn it on and brush.</li>
            <li>I first read the reviews, I didn&#x27;t really believe that the flexcare would make a difference whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love that it holds charge for so long.</li>
            <li>the higher end models have a much longer battery life.</li>
            <li>I also believe that the UV sanitizes is a big marketing scam, its nothing more than a fancy brush head holder that can give you a blue light show when you push the button.  </li>
            <li>It may not be cheap but its a sound investment in your mouth and is alot cheaper than what you will pay for dental work due to decay.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pressing, really. ;)</li>
            <li>It was an OralB product and I was quite satisfied with it as long as it worked.</li>
            <li>- it comes with one full size brush and one \\&quot;compact\\&quot; brush which is designed for a two year old.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it has a basic clean, sensitive, massage, quick clean (15 seconds for section) and  max care that is like the usual clean but adds in 15 seconds of massaging at the end of each section (i use this one all the time).</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, but the clean feel and the obvious whiter appearance makes this product well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My teeth are definitely whiter after a month of steady use and my mouth has never felt better.    </li>
            <li>11/13/09 - I had older Sonicare and after years of use/abuse it finally died when it hit the floor one too many times.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased my Flexcare in September 2009, I&#x27;d owned three Sonicares before (two Advances over a several-year period, each lasting 3-4 years, which in my mind is OK, and one of the battery-operated ones for extended travel, since the older models didn&#x27;t have dual-voltage chargers).    </li>
            <li>Typically I am pretty frugal and don&#x27;t like to spend that much money on something that seems so trivial, but Sonicare really makes you feel like it&#x27;s worth the high price.</li>
            <li>So an economical and logical person would find out how much it would cost to buy a replacement battery and replace it instead of dropping another $120 on a brand new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>have never used an electric toothbrush of any kind before, and although I&#x27;ve been intrigued by the idea for some time, I was a little nervous to use this one at first.  </li>
            <li>- smaller toothbrush head is more comfortable  - easier to clean and to keep clean (no more gunky buildup inside the brush!)    </li>
            <li>The different modes are a great feature as stupid as they may seem, but I love using the timer function depending on what kind of brushing session I am looking for.</li>
            <li>It is at first a bit hard and surprising to use for people not accustom to it /</li>
            <li>I only use one- full power baby!  </li>
            <li>When the new one began spontaneously turning itself on recently I contacted Phillips and they agreed to promptly send me a new one at no charge -- covered by the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>because Phillips took the &amp;#34;high road&amp;#34; and actually did something very rare now a days and treated the customer fairly, I would definitely buy this same brush again and will recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do?&lt;br /&gt;Harry : All the Sonicare toothbrush are electrically welded and non-repairable unit.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: is it normal for a 150 dollar toothbrush to break right over 2 years?&lt;br /&gt;Harry :</li>
            <li>do?&lt;br /&gt;Harry : All the Sonicare toothbrush are electrically welded and non-repairable unit.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: is it normal for a 150 dollar toothbrush to break right over 2 years?&lt;br /&gt;Harry :</li>
            <li>That being said, this one is by far my favorite for one VERY important reason - NO MORE GUNK in the brush heads.      </li>
            <li>However, for those of us thatfeel off track, you first two steps is to get this toothbrush (and don&#x27;t look back) and find a dentist you feel comfortable with and create a plan to regain optimal oral health.     </li>
            <li>Several of the comments have said that the buttons on the front get bumped too easily and you find yourself changing brushing modes even when you don&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li>I do use the clean mode most of the time, but I have also used the massage mode occasionally at night to get the extra gum stimulation.</li>
            <li>A longer timed session, made easy to time with the above mention</li>
            <li>A longer timed session, made easy to time with the above mention quadpacing feature.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about my oral hygiene, flossing every day too.</li>
            <li>At first, you may not even bat an eye at this price and assume that the price is somehow justified by the technology in the toothbrush head, but when you take a close look at the toothbrush head you&#x27;ll see that the head has no moving parts and that it&#x27;s the handle that simply vibrates.</li>
            <li>It does take a few uses to get completely accustomed to the experience, but the end result is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the extra button is too easy to press accidentally while holding the brush.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush handle is light-weighted overall, slim and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and are more white than when I used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It comes with a very stylish and functional travel case and a tiny travel charger (though you won&#x27;t need it for a short stay, since it holds a charge for 2wks).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has several modes.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the two brush head holders in the sanitizer make it easy for two people to share the Sonicare and have their individual brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The brush handle is smaller and the brush heads are easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>, the white plastic tends to stain easily.</li>
            <li>had purchased two of these (one with the sanitizer) because I was unaware how easy it was to change brush heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Replacement parts - Brush heads are easily ordered through [...], but I am uncertain if they can be purchased in local stores.  </li>
            <li>Replacement parts - Brush heads are easily ordered through [...], but I am uncertain if they can be purchased in local stores.  </li>
            <li>device itself was easy to install (you&#x27;ll have to wait two hours after initially charging the unit before you can use it).</li>
            <li>Using the Sonicare was extremely easy - there&#x27;s a button on the back of the toothbrush unit that you have to press in order to activate the brush.</li>
            <li>All I know is, a pretty blue light comes on when you hit the button.</li>
            <li>If you do get one, realize the first time you use it, your gums will freak out; it kind of tickles, but it is not a comfortable feeling.  </li>
            <li>Although my lips didn&#x27;t appreciate the tingle for a few days, that has now gone away and I am able to benefit from the full cycle.</li>
            <li>Apparently for the first 15 uses it doesn&#x27;t vibrate at full power in an attempt to get you used to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a bit larger and bulkier but its going strong after 2 or 3 years.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t feel like a good person returning a toothbrush for no other reason than my own disbelief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I certainly didn&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li>I use the UV sanitizer about once a week; I have no problem getting the two brush heads (both large) in place.  </li>
            <li>But it certainly can&#x27;t hurt, and if nothing else, the chamber provides a dust-free environment for the brush head, instead of just sitting in the medicine cabinet or in a toothbrush holder where it gathers dust all day.     </li>
            <li>It certainly gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It certainly operates as intended mechanically.</li>
            <li>and even if i did, i could just bring a regular toothbrush and leave my new treasured toothbrush safely at home.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with new smaller brush and UV cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Most recently I purchased a new model from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have a new toothbrush, same model, and I still love it.</li>
            <li>The top where you attach the brush head was loose and no longer vibrated.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s unlike anything you&#x27;ve likely experienced previously.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three main programmes to use, Clean, Sensitive and Massage..</li>
            <li>Using the sanitizer is easy, just pop the brush head(s) in, press the green button, and wait for the UV light to kill the germs.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never owned a Sonicare, you will probably find this toothbrush to be really noisy and much heavier than a normal toothbrush, but that&#x27;s because it actually cleans significantly better than a toothbrush, leaving you with that</li>
            <li>I love the brush, the small piece to travel with, the fresh feeling after brushing, the timer to make sure I spend enough time everywhere.</li>
            <li>The third replacement unit I got has been working fine for over a year.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is loaded with features that really make sense for someone with an active lifestyle and does a fantastic job--easy to use, efficient, and clean.  </li>
            <li>It did exactly the same thing my original brush did.</li>
            <li>My teeth are slicker after one use, I&#x27;m now brushing the recommended length of time, I use far less toothpaste per year, and my gum health showed incredible improvement after only two weeks of use!  </li>
            <li>My last couple of SonicCare&#x27;s withstood my toothpaste fine.  </li>
            <li>The regular \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; cycle (30 seconds of cleaning per quadrant) is fine for the morning brushing.  </li>
            <li>I brushed for about 60 seconds (using a clock with a second hand to make sure I did 15 seconds in each quarter of my mouth) just to be sure I was following the recommended useage for this first time.  </li>
            <li>replacement price for the exact same toothbrush without the charging station and UV Sanitizer (which I originally purchased as a package) is $149.</li>
            <li>While I have been satisfied with the OralB toothbrushes I have been using for years, the dual voltage recharger on the Sonicare got me interested as I do alot of foreign travelling.  </li>
            <li>I must say initially the Sonicare was more powerful than realized and it took a few times before being able to use it at the normal speed.  </li>
            <li>Junk (original toothbrush), junk (first replacement), junk (second replacement), junked.</li>
            <li>For four years my dentist was amazed at how clean my teeth were (and I barely flossed).     </li>
            <li>As you get older, you need to purchase this to avoid any gum recession or to improve the gums, as I have found!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular model for over 4 years!</li>
            <li>, I imagine the margins are *very* high on the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>You can set it to either the normal &#x27;clean&#x27; setting, &#x27;sensitive&#x27;, or &#x27;massage&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might just be the first time, but every time since then i get the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I thought I might have gotten him something a little more exciting</li>
            <li>It was a little more expesive, but definetly well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This little unit works great and is a terrific value.</li>
            <li>We wanted the ability to \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the brush heads in the little capsule but honestly, I have no idea if that makes much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week because, as people have stated before, being TOO clean can lead to your body being unable to fight off bacteria, or bacteria becoming more resistant.  </li>
            <li>I could hardly wait for it to charge overnight to get a good and thorough cleaning.     </li>
            <li>One feature she touted was that the brush will stop if you push too hard, which is good for me and my brushing style.  </li>
            <li>The colored rings certainly come in handy when two people living in the same household use the same model</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;GoCare\\&quot; cycle (15 seconds of cleaning per quadrant) is fine if you&#x27;re in a hurry, or just want to touch up The \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; cycle will probably come in handy as I ease back into brushing following any future dental work or periodontal surgery.</li>
            <li>My original Sonicare toothbrush stopped working after one and a half years, and philips sent a free replacement.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to add to what others have said, but go into any store that sells Sonicare toothbrushes and you will immediately see that this model is much slimmer and more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The new handle design is much easier to clean than my old brush.  </li>
            <li>I have not changed my toothpaste, yet I am convinced that my teeth are at least twice as bright as they were before I started using the FlexCare.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is quite attractive; brushed chrome front with all kinds of lights to show the setting (chosen with an oblong button below the on/off button) and a green charging indicator--three full-on lights indicating that the brush is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work great, just frustrating to have to plow so much money into it.  </li>
            <li>If the tooth brush does indeed last for two years, it&#x27;s still a huge expense.</li>
            <li>Using this toothbrush has made such a huge difference in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>So, after research, the reviews really spoked for themselves.</li>
            <li>I recomment this product for it&#x27;s ability, design and features although I am unsure what difference the \\&quot;UV light\\&quot; sanitizer really makes.</li>
            <li>The brush IS very pricey but consider this product if you really care about your dental upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I really have valued my Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very noticeable difference when using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>A very well thought out toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great for Philips bottom line, not great for the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I was really brushing my teeth until I used this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my dentist for having one of these in his waiting room for his patients to play around with.    </li>
            <li>Honestly, I am very please with it at this point.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t made too much use of all of the cleaning modes.  </li>
            <li>I tried out the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; mode, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>How can that be if they only fit on one way?   </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried an electric or sonic toothbrush before, you really have to try this.  </li>
            <li>This model is lighter in weight,sleek works very well</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s fantastic and I can&#x27;t write enough superlatives about it.</li>
            <li>You can hold it at the very end and not have this problem</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of the UV cleaner too.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and none of the headaches.    </li>
            <li>On the downside, it is a bit noisey and tickles a bit too much at firstl.  </li>
            <li>Should toothbrushing really cost this much?</li>
            <li>; didn&#x27;t really care that I got a sanitizer</li>
            <li>Aside from the two handles (handle is really just Sonicare lingo for toothbrush)</li>
            <li>really triggered me to write this review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used manual or cheap battery powered toothbrush my entire life so</li>
            <li>I really like how the brush works (when it&#x27;s working).  </li>
            <li>The travel charger doesn&#x27;t fit into the travel case; only the toothbrush itself fits.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably pricedas</li>
            <li>The 2-minutes always end too fast for me.  </li>
            <li>The one issue with this toothbrush is that it isn&#x27;t very reliable long-term.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself cleans very well</li>
            <li>My gums don&#x27;t bleed, yet my teeth feel so much cleaner than with the manual</li>
            <li>I opted for massage where the brush cleans for thirty seconds and then massages for fifteen seconds of each part of the cycle (there being fours parts in total, outside top teeth, inside top teeth, outside bottom teeth and inside bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>&quot; brushing at the end then stop it yourself because it will just go through the whole 2 minutes again.  </li>
            <li>I use the UV about once a week to really combat the germs.  </li>
            <li>So, after much research, I settled on the Phillips Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li>I can say that she absolutely loves hers as much as I do mine.       </li>
            <li>It is a shame that Philips is getting these product manufactured in the cheap chinese factories instead of in Germany which is renowned for the quality and reliability of its products.</li>
            <li>The charger with UV sanitizer is also quite slim and fits onto my sink/countertop without taking up much room at all.</li>
            <li>It would have made brushing much easier.</li>
            <li>The three speeds are a much improvement over the Elite (one speed) and the sanitizer is an added feature that exemplifies itself.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can just stand there and hold it against my teeth with a gentle touch and it does all of the work for me.</li>
            <li>This one also came with the UV sanitizer which I really like.     </li>
            <li>The article I purchased is working very well and it is what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I called customer service and all they could do was say \\&quot;sorry.\\&quot; Thanks that helps.</li>
            <li>whole package (plastic) is fully sealed up.</li>
            <li>really know when to charge it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>So, after one month of gentle use the sanitizer broke and won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the motor action which is powerful.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels and is  so much cleaner, my gums are healthier</li>
            <li>it really does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The sanitizer hasn&#x27;t been of much use, neither has all the settings.</li>
            <li>I did have the old sonicare model and it died after just a few months, but these have worked great so far.</li>
            <li>My wife is very concerned about keeping her teeth cleand and flossed.  </li>
            <li>For some reason I don&#x27;t really trust it.  </li>
            <li>I am living proof that it really works.</li>
            <li>Amazon customer service were very understanding and helped a lot.</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush is a real value.  </li>
            <li>Our teeth feel and look so much cleaner since using this</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner than they did with a brush.  </li>
            <li>It applies pressure yet feels gentle to the teeth.</li>
            <li>The difference here is also very noticeable.</li>
            <li>The Flexcare bristles are like a modern toothbrush with contours to match my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The vibration is intense, but I started with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting and within 1-2 weeks I was using the \\&quot;maxcare\\&quot; setting.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perplexed by the people who give this brush a low rating.  </li>
            <li>After researching and pricing the different Sonicare products available, I chose to get him this Flexcare system.  </li>
            <li>We give it five stars and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel like we just came from the denist&#x27;s office and our gums are much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I did some research and read some reviews that I thought were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>This really is the evolution of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You really do feel the difference.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a high-pitch to it which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but the real story is in the vibration.  </li>
            <li>If you brush twice a day, it becomes too much of a bother to remove the brush head every time and put it in the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>Especially after he handed me a manual toothbrush for free in my sample packet.</li>
            <li>but this is very neat for storing our brush heads anyway.</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is also a neat and very convenient attachment---</li>
            <li>I had read one review where someone mentioned that they don&#x27;t use the sanitizer because they fear that it&#x27;ll just leave the UV resistant bacteria like when antibiotics are used to much.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s really nothing that is UV resistant just because of how UV affects DNA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much to pay for so-so quality.</li>
            <li>It really delivers on what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li>i am very statisfied with it...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t comment on the longevity yet, but it seems to be a very well made product</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is powerful, but just push dirt up to near and under the gum.  </li>
            <li>This is comfortable to use, has preprogrammed cycles for different types of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The replacement brushes are a bit pricey but this brush really performs.  </li>
            <li>is really making your teeth and gums look better.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>After using the toothbrush, I was convinced that my teeth felt much cleaner and smoother than they ever had when using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(Amazon.com&#x27;s shipping is also very prompt.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a very thrifty person like me to write this 5-star review for this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it really does the job..</li>
            <li>but I did it because I HAVE to (no one wants stinky breath).  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing much.  </li>
            <li>I was really worried because I have rather tender gums with some receeding gum lines; I was surprized that this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt me anywhere.</li>
            <li>The UV sanitizer is one of those things you really didn&#x27;t know you needed</li>
            <li>and you will be much happier.</li>
            <li>I actually received this toothbrush free as a product test over a year ago</li>
            <li>However, I waited for years to purchase one because I thought the price was too much</li>
            <li>The sonicare brush also made it easy to get the teeth further back in my mouth really clean.  </li>
            <li>Now I see the same type of cheap rubber is being used for the Sonicare FlexCare model.</li>
            <li>Much lighter.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I really like the three brushing cycles 1-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>brushes are the only ones available.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like paying so much for a tooth brush</li>
            <li>2 years in it is very sturdy and still cranking.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much cleaner and brighter</li>
            <li>, that has really pissed me off...</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if this device could take tar off a roof with how fast it vibrates.  </li>
            <li>Well, for two weeks my mouth felt numb after each use, which would have dropped my rating to two stars when balanced with the excellent results.  </li>
            <li>However, for short trips I&#x27;m going to bring a cheap disposable electric in a travel sanitizer</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li>However, for short trips I&#x27;m going to bring a cheap disposable electric in a travel sanitizer</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li>(Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
            <li>so I was very happy to have the sanitizer to help kill any germs if I did get his cold.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it is much easier to use than my old one - this is much lighter and easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that much of a difference in models.</li>
            <li>Is that really of any use to anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can adjust the type and strength of vibration, you have a timer that encourages you to keep brushing, a travel charger and a very neat UV</li>
            <li>Also, the whole thing is designed as if for one person, with just two, different-sized brushes.  </li>
            <li>Still, over 5 years, the price of this model isn&#x27;t too much to spend on your teeth.</li>
            <li>not something I really focused on...</li>
            <li>I also like that it is very compact, making it quite convenient for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like that it is very compact, making it quite convenient for travel.    </li>
            <li>Amazon shipped this so fast</li>
            <li>The UV cleaner is fairly fast</li>
            <li>it really is just a pause.    </li>
            <li>I know, I know, that much for a toothbrush?</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Compared to the advance, the design is much improved.</li>
            <li>With the screw on models, gunk and grime would build up underneath the threads which made me very queasy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a sonicare, don&#x27;t worry too much.</li>
            <li>The features are fantastic - I especially like the GoCare</li>
            <li>who knows what it really does but it makes me think \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Two things I really like about these model.  </li>
            <li>if you want it you might as well pay extra for shipping because it will take 3 weeks to get to you with the free ship.</li>
            <li>They were courtious and very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I noted in another review that the reviewer was concerned about too much sanitizing and use of anti-bacterials.  </li>
            <li>Who knows if it makes much of a difference.    </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is enough, but all of the included accessories are of fantastic quality as well.</li>
            <li>It really changed me</li>
            <li>and I never use a manual toothbrush anymore unless I absolutely have to and without my sonicare.</li>
            <li>Normally, the brushes are evidently meant to be stored within the sanitizer, and the sanitizer run every time the brushes are used.</li>
            <li>Battery charge meter is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>So much for buying Philips products from now on.    </li>
            <li>and it looks like Sonicare really worked to improve their quality.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the addition of the UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>When I thought about the price--and complete lack of fun--involved in getting my head drilled, I decided a hundred bucks was worth the investment to avoid a cavity.  </li>
            <li>When the commercials say \\&quot;straight from the dentist clean\\&quot;, its no joke.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I wonder about how much whiter my teeth could be.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely does.  </li>
            <li>Used with a whitener in toothpaste, works really well.</li>
            <li>UV Sanitizer adds a high-tech functionality to the whole package, even though I cannot vouch for its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>The unit&#x27;s design makes it easy to clean off toothpaste residue, there is not much vibration in the handle, and given the vigor of the brushhead&#x27;s action, I do not mind the \\&quot;bumblebee on</li>
            <li>NiMH AA rechargeable batteries that one could insert into the barrel of the body, without too much added bulk added to the handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>NiMH AA rechargeable batteries that one could insert into the barrel of the body, without too much added bulk added to the handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes attach to the handle much easier now.  </li>
            <li>soak the heads in Listerine if you are that much of a germ a phobe.  </li>
            <li>out the sanitizer for nearly as much money</li>
            <li>The battery life is also excellent, I have only charged it three times in the last three months, brushing twice daily for the regular advised time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought this one and really like it...hoping it lasts....</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter, my gums are healthier and my whole mouth just feels cleaner.  </li>
            <li>This brush really does leave my mouth with a cleaner feeling than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a manual brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, your dentist can prescribe you a rinse with chlorhexidine that will really help to reduce frequency and/or length of irritation by the cancer sores*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent product I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if I really need this much teeth cleaning power.</li>
            <li>I am very thorough when it comes to cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>I am really bummed out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very reliable toothbrush</li>
            <li>I was going to buy an Oral B Pro 5000, but these were on sale for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Since I lived a toothbrush sanitizer free life before, I can only assume my lot has improved.ust 1).  </li>
            <li>Since I lived a toothbrush sanitizer free life before, I can only assume my lot has improved.</li>
            <li>toothbrush itself vibrated too much</li>
            <li>I solved both of these issues with this Sonicare, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s where they really make their money</li>
            <li>I saw the much lower price on Amazon, I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I purchase the Soniccare about a month ago,It really does feel like you just had your teeth cleaned by a dentist,</li>
            <li>Keep in mind it will take about a week to really feel the diffence,But for the parents out there&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks, Karen</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothbrush is packaged with a number of items, including a travel case and a travel charger which packs in a toiletry bag much easier than the countertop charger with the built in sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t spare my teeth that extra two minutes, and my dental health is important.  </li>
            <li>area is the real kicker.  </li>
            <li>I personally enjoy using mine and would recommend it without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my Philips Sonicare died last week.</li>
            <li>and I really do not regret it:-)    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The ability to customize the way you brush without compromising the quality of the cleaning is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s charge very well.  </li>
            <li>Another gift for my son and he really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>I was taking care of it more carefully than my car.</li>
            <li>It is very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, it turns on by itself like very five minutes.  </li>
            <li>Much improved gum health and teeth appearance with the help of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I used an Oral-B electric toothbrush, and I liked it quite a bit when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>I had settled on the Sonic Elite, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled to hear about the messy part</li>
            <li>At my recent check up, I was told my brushing has been effective because I had no cavities or extensive plaque build up.</li>
            <li>It is never to late to start good hygene start today.  </li>
            <li>The brush body is smaller and much more ergonomic than my old model, and angled for easier use.</li>
            <li>I found out that they have a 30 day money back deal direct from the manufacturer (check to make sure it still applies before buying)</li>
            <li>That is the only thing about this toothbrush that bothers me, but clearly I liked it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush makes it possible for me to reach all my teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li>We could not turn it off, but it went off eventually on its own, only to go back on.  </li>
            <li>I started with the sensitive program which found out later by reading more of the manual</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still very satisfied and will definitely purchase a new one when mine ultimately dies.  </li>
            <li>a little high for most - more likely a luxury expense or gift item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pricing a little high for most - more likely a luxury expense or gift item.  </li>
            <li>The battery charge lasts twice as long as the previous ones and the sanitizer is a great addition.</li>
            <li>(Apparently these replacement heads cost less, so that&#x27;s good.)    </li>
            <li>Its a very nice brush, and my teeth have never felt cleaner (I can tell my 10 year old model had apparently slowed down a bit).    </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, heads for Flexcare units are actually a cheaper than the older models; you get 3 Flexcare heads for the same price as 2 of the old heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shawn: If you are interested to buy the new Toothrush, should I go ahead and help you with the 15% discount code?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed the unit very much I have to give it a low rating as I believe that for items that cost as much as this should last longer than 45 days.  </li>
            <li>It thoroughly cleans my teeth, is easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>The handle is also long, slim and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and has a long battery life.  </li>
            <li>I had two minor issues and they were ironed out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Finally, use the small brush: I was tempted to use the largest one being accustom to standard tooth brush but the smaller one is best fit for electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a nice package with two brush heads, one smaller and more compact than the other, several easy-to-understand manuals and a travel case and a travel charger, plus the main charger which houses a UV sanitizing unit.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel healthier and I really like that I can clean  my toothbrush regularly in the sanitizer.</li>
            <li>And the simplified charger connection makes keeping the charger clean that much easier, and allows for a much smaller travel charger.      </li>
            <li>I really like the extra clean feeling on my teeth after using it</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very easy to maintain for what little maintenance there is for it.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush back in 2007.  </li>
            <li>Definitely is an significant improvement vs. a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than a convential toothbrush or other electric burshes.</li>
            <li>I had recently undergone significant periodontal work, including lots of laser treatment, significant enough to have the procedure done under anesthesia.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would complain about is that the original unit was made in the USA, but replacement unit was not and there is a noticeable difference the replacement being weaker.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats the &#x27;original&#x27; human parts.</li>
            <li>Better than any other electronic toothbrush on the market.  </li>
            <li>You will feel a significant difference in cleanliness when you use this compared to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had to go back to the original toothbrush...</li>
            <li>They will not replace the handle again because they only honor the warranty of the original purchase, not the replacement.</li>
            <li>Sonicare could be a great product but just doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for the price.  </li>
            <li>My only recommendation is to become familiar with the owner&#x27;s manual.  </li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t get a better result from any other product on the market.</li>
            <li>this is a very big improvement over the original Sonicare</li>
            <li>i moved up from an other brand power toothbrush to this model which was recommended by my dentist for better plaque removal.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every type of high-end electric toothbrush, going back to the original InterPlak.</li>
            <li>Read many of the other reviews &amp; decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I spent the money on it!</li>
            <li>However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my other ones were no longer able to be charged.</li>
            <li>replacement unit&#x27;s operation was noticeably different from the original.  </li>
            <li>I can say that it&#x27;s time for me to move on and move back to the world of non-electric toothbrushes, and hence lower my original score of a 4 to a 3.  </li>
            <li>I just use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, and sometimes I accidentally touch the button and change to other modes (boy, even to brush my teeth I need so many options??</li>
            <li>Sonicare toothbrushes has had its internal mounts snap, causing a significant loss of vibration and cleaning power, with a simultaneous increase in noise.  </li>
            <li>Almost half a decade and still going strong!</li>
            <li>I think that I could live without the sanitizer but for the little extra it&#x27;s a great bonus.  </li>
            <li>The dark blue is great, but the gray, light blue and light green look too similar to easily differentiate the heads.</li>
            <li>this does not rank high on my list of necessary attributes of my toothbrush, but i just had to say it.  </li>
            <li>The massaging action and different brush heads insure my teeth feel \\&quot;just out of the dentist\\&quot; clean!  </li>
            <li>In one minute this has done more than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned, more than flossing, more than a full hour of horrible deep cleaning by a dental hygenist, more than four different dentists (and perhaps more when I was younger) could do.  </li>
            <li>I always thought that the old Sonicare was a solid electric toothbrush but after using the flexcare for about a month I&#x27;m so glad I got the new one.</li>
            <li>You may not think that some simple vibration will clean well.  </li>
            <li>, PHILLIPS HAS ADDRESSED PROBLEM WITH EARLIER MODELS THAT IS KEEPING IT CLEAN.</li>
            <li>The power behind the brush on the normal setting and the massage setting is really great.</li>
            <li>but I really like the variety offered, particularly the massage mode.</li>
            <li>I set mt brush on the MAX CLEAN and it beeps when I am supposed to move to the next section of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I bought it immediately after my last cleaning to see if it would keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t get the same clean feeling with that.</li>
            <li>Deep clean, massage etc.</li>
            <li>It comes with two different heads and has a sanitizing cycle with UV for keeping the heads clean.  </li>
            <li>The manual says you should only clean Sonicare ProResults brush heads in the sanitizer, but the Sonicare website lists four types of brushes that can be cleaned.</li>
            <li>is much louder and raspier than the older unit.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for only 3 weeks and my teeth and gums never have felt and so clean.  </li>
            <li>, my teeth feel extra clean after I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I had to use a dental tool to clean around my crowns and around my back teeth.  </li>
            <li>They are actually squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It seems this brush is simply easier to keep clean as well.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s lighter and smaller and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>The brush has a couple different settings to fit your different moods, but the normal clean mode turns the brush on for two minutes, which is divided into 30 seconds for each quadrant.</li>
            <li>There are several modes, which may be selected to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>And the Max Care provides a deep 3 minute session with alternating massage and clean modes.  </li>
            <li>The different modes are great, but I usually use maximum care.</li>
            <li>The bristles clean deep.</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t feel like her teeth are as clean with this as they were with the regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>alot better than a manual toothbrush, having a Sonicare now makes Oral-B barely a step above a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>said\\&quot; wow your teeth are really clean\\&quot;, it won&#x27;t be much for her to do today since I was there for a cleaning! ^^</li>
            <li>The UV clean kills any residue germs that might be left on the bristles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to see that Sonicare has FINALLY ditched the NiCad batteries and went to Li-ion batteries; what took so long?  </li>
            <li>I think the consumer should know they are spending that kind of money on a product that only lasts so long.</li>
            <li>Liked using it but didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Rest at ease, your oddarid having a trouble free products are very good since I am the one who received the rare troubled Flexcare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I like to use the 3 minutes when I can and cut down to the 1 minute for a quick clean when I have to run out of the house in a hurry.</li>
            <li>For example, there is a Clean Mode, described as \\&quot;standard mode for sueprior teeth ceaning; a Sensitive Mode for a more gentle cleaning for sensitive gums and teeth; and finally, a Massage Mode for \\&quot;gum</li>
            <li>My Series E toothbrush is still going strong and I have never had a single problem with it.</li>
            <li>The unit does not allow battery replacement, and the high breakage rate (motor to brush head coupling) indicate a very problematic design.</li>
            <li>My model only came with a standard brush head, so I&#x27;m ordering the compact because I think it will be more comfortable for my smaller mouth.  </li>
            <li>The brush head does move in a very energetic way, and it is made of hard plastic.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell much difference with my gums, but given its speed when it&#x27;s operating, it obviously does as advertised--forces the toothpaste/water solution between your teeth and under your gum line to completely clean all the places you can&#x27;t get with a normal brush.  </li>
            <li>As with any new product, the FlexCare took a little bit of getting used to, but now it is quite comfortable and our teeth feel extraordinarily clean.  </li>
            <li>No, actually I want you to send me a new one for free.</li>
            <li>No, actually I want you to send me a new one for free.</li>
            <li>It really takes the brushing experience to a whole new level</li>
            <li>And this toothbrush does have some nifty special features including the sanitizer, travel charger, timer and three different speeds.</li>
            <li>I just simply cant get it right!</li>
            <li>Another nice thing is that you use very little toothpaste and will save money on that purchase.</li>
            <li>The new brush head design is what really makes this brush better than their other offerings.</li>
            <li>works just as well, or better, with less guilt for having paid too much</li>
            <li>The Flexcare will get your teeth clean just as well as the older and larger Sonicare toothbrushes do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brushing in half the time I did manually, and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush is doing twice as good a job as I ever did with a standard</li>
            <li>Make sure to  hold the brush straight out or slightly up</li>
            <li>The handle is less bulky than others making it very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>You can see how Sensonic went out of business selling one brush every 10 years, but you have to wonder how long Phillips can keep sending out free warranty replacements.</li>
            <li>It also comes with two brush-heads a standard for everyday cleaning, and a compact head to use in order to help clear food from the rear of the oral cavity and greatly assist in localized stain removal.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty clear which each do and why a person would use them.  </li>
            <li>For those used to small toothbrushes (size 30), the compact head works nicely.</li>
            <li>the full size heads are not too big for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts for days before recharging which makes it nice for traveling; but, also included, is a small recharger to take on longer trips.     </li>
            <li>But the overall appearance of my toothbrush was... kind of old, and gross.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner than using a normal brush.</li>
            <li>But it is nice that Philips decided to give you a small charge adapter that you can bring on a trip.    </li>
            <li>Within a week or so, you don&#x27;t really notice the vibrations and the larger standard brush is OK.    </li>
            <li>Philips replaced the brush very promptly (the service was great) but unfortunately, after about 4 months, the replacement seems to have gone the same way as the original brush.</li>
            <li>This is not only cool, it also means no metal to corrode in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>For the first 14 brush cycles, this unit ramps up on the intensity of the brush action.</li>
            <li>it got exactly 2 years and 2 month old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another really cool thing about this brush is that it comes with 2 different chargers!</li>
            <li>Again, only time will tell here if that is wishful thinking on my part or a true benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, only time will tell here if that is wishful thinking on my part or a true benefit.    </li>
            <li>First, let me preface this review by stating that since the early 2000&#x27;s I have been a user of the Sonicare line of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I use the brush twice daily, in the morning and before the bedtime on full 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li>Some people comment on price, but if you consider one visit for cleaning at the average of $95.00 per visit, it is really OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure just how much \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; would be on a regular toothbrush after a month or two of use, so I can&#x27;t give a measurable opinion as to how good a job the UV light is doing at killing potential bacteria.</li>
            <li>Starting using this one and not a bad check up since.</li>
            <li>I have no hard data that this the Sonic system  is better than other pricey electric ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a real professional toothbrush that makes your mouth feel extremely clean just like you came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>&quot; all the way up and most of the way down, rather than</li>
            <li>l charger down or you wont be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>After having more than one come off while brushing and causing toothpaste to splash out and down my shirt.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that it would be nice if there was a special head for the gum massage instead of using the toothbrush but that really isn&#x27;t a deal breaker or anything.</li>
            <li>i usually don&#x27;t use all the modes that this toothbrush comes with, but i was comfortable even with the default settings right from the first time.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this toothbrush cleans, but I&#x27;m don&#x27;t like that it broke a little more</li>
            <li>So you have to shell out $100 for a new one !    </li>
            <li>I credit this tooth brush for my new found tooth health!</li>
            <li>they STILL are mailing me out a BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT!  </li>
            <li>as soon as the warranty is over, time to buy a new one!</li>
            <li>I told her that all I had done was buy a new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Since then we have a new dentist and he is selling it for $77 - with the Sanitizer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the manual, and it is true that the battery cannot be replaced once dead, but I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be able to get at least another year before that happens.</li>
            <li>The brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package, and I use the large ones and have still never had any issue with them fitting in the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot reiterate enough that with the power the FlexCare provides, I cannot imagine any other brush really doing an effective job at cleaning.</li>
            <li>I know that the other reviewers are going to say that I should stop whining and go back to a manual brush, but, I loved my old 7300 series units.  </li>
            <li>Cleans teeth very well, but expect to buy a new unit once every 18 months.  </li>
            <li>We were very relived as our new Flex Care came in</li>
            <li>It breaks you in gently to the new sensation</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to change the brushhead every 90 days, but you can probably go 4-6 months between new heads without diminishing brushing effectiveness too much.  </li>
            <li>Might have to get one.\\&quot;head every 90 days, but you can probably go 4-6 months between new heads without diminishing brushing effectiveness too much.  </li>
            <li>I talked it over with my husband and we immediately agreed we would buy a new one, because we like this one so much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the options of cleaning times on this new one - but have to confess</li>
            <li>This model comes with some new settings, basically a quick version and a rather intense deep cleaning version that massages your gums.  </li>
            <li>sleeker design than my previous Sonicare and so much better having the sanitizer attached and not a separate device.</li>
            <li>Gum disease is more serious than first thought--it can be associated with heart disease so it pays to take care of your gums and teeth, not just for a pretty smile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I immediately enjoyed healthier gums but in less than two years, the handle broke.</li>
            <li>The brush seems to work exponentially better with 80% less vibration; it&#x27;s a dream to use.  </li>
            <li>Cleans better than the Oral B I previously used.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased when the oral B broke (after less than 2 years of use).  </li>
            <li>you want to experiment with different brushing modes, there is a standard \\&quot;clean mode,\\&quot; a \\&quot;sensitive mode\\&quot; for a more gentle feel, and a \\&quot;massage mode\\&quot; for extra gum stimulation.  </li>
            <li>and I like it even more than my previous Sonicares.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was one of the better, yet slightly cheaper electric tootbrushes on the market.  </li>
            <li>whatever I think it was mainly because they wanted people to upgrade....</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t build up all the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; of the older version.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and that tingly feeling in your lips and gums is kinda weird at first, but you&#x27;ll learn to love it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I went back 2 months later she said that things were looking better.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li>The stem of the brush is \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; that its older model.  </li>
            <li>I needed to replace my older, well-used Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This particular brush was recommended by our dentist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush that left my teeth with that smooth feeling you get after a professional cleaning at your dentists office until using this product.</li>
            <li>My dentist and hygienist are very vigilant about gum disease; each visit they give plenty of ideas for better flossing and brushing based on where you might have trouble spots.</li>
            <li>A quick search online suggests otherwise, there are tons of people complaining about the same problem.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants a whiter smile and healthier teeth.</li>
            <li>It should be held lightly but firmly, not clenched in one&#x27;s fist, taking care to keep your fingers off the various buttons on the front.  </li>
            <li>It should be held lightly but firmly, not clenched in one&#x27;s fist, taking care to keep your fingers off the various buttons on the front.  </li>
            <li>This Sonicare replaced an older version.  </li>
            <li>Love the slimmer design.....fits well in my hand and best of all, the disgusting build-up in the handle and under the brush is gone.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it was only a year old and still under warranty.  </li>
            <li>It has an LCD panel and selector to chose several modes, including a shorter brushing cycle for quick freshen ups, and a gum massage mode.</li>
            <li>I purchsed this product in January 2008 as a replacement to a much older version of a Sonicare product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an older Sonicare model, the \\&quot;Essence 5300\\&quot; on which the switch was beginning to go out.  </li>
            <li>I like the 30 second timer to make sure I get all of my teeth cleaned the same.  </li>
            <li>They are sending another replacement to their credit, but it seems like 6 months is about the lifespan of this particular model.  </li>
            <li>I had the older sonic care but burned it out when I plugged it into a 220 line in another country.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know about the older models, but the Flexcare model (I got it with the Sanitizer intergrated) works so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a regular toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>Since then mine started buzzing in the middle of the night and luckily was covered under warranty.</li>
            <li>I find it cleans my teeth outstandingly and even gets around my back teeth and especially my crowns.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version and needed to upgrade.  </li>
            <li>a great checkup after using it, including improvement in my gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;Since no one has complained about the durability of this brush, I&#x27;m hoping it will last longer than some of the others that have had complaints about battery life and on/off button quality.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I had an older version</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had various Sonicare toothbrush models over the last 10 years or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more noticeable the next morning after brushing with a regular brush instead of the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It works harder, faster and better than your old school</li>
            <li>I needed to use manual brush to do the main job.</li>
            <li>It produced such fantastic results that even my dentist was surprised.  </li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry,</li>
            <li>like older models, there&#x27;s no removeable battery.</li>
            <li>The product has a 2 year warranty but because mine is older than 2 years they cannot help me.</li>
            <li>After using 3+ times daily for 1.5 years, I have not noticed any wear on the buttons and am confident this will last.      </li>
            <li>is the main reason.  </li>
            <li>My older brand never had this issue and kept everything off the body of the device.</li>
            <li>About 30% of the time even after owning it a few years I still end up accidentally triggering the quick brush mode because that button is way too soft and easy to hit.</li>
            <li>I like being able to check different vendors and to read the feedback provided before actually purchasing a product.  </li>
            <li>Had the older model before this one.  </li>
            <li>This could be just a flaw in this particular toothbrush, or it could be the TSA for smashing my bag and damaging the motor.</li>
            <li>of the best things about the Toothbrush is that not only does it come with a &#x27;home&#x27; base station, it also conveniently includes a travel station as well, something many companies do not include, but it extremely useful for constant travelers who want to minimize their baggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist has been promoting the great benefits of using a Sonicare toothbrush regularly for at least 4 years.</li>
            <li>One thing I like in particular with the Sonicare is that you do not have to apply any force while brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an older model (Elite)</li>
            <li>They provide the same level of cleaning power, but with the added benefit of much more reliability over multiple years of use.e value of the purchase decrease dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They provide the same level of cleaning power, but with the added benefit of much more reliability over multiple years of use.</li>
            <li>but I had on older Sonicare that lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li>Purchase the older model if you still want a Sonicare after reading our reviews.</li>
            <li>No issues with this particular product per se</li>
            <li>I have loved my Sonicare tooth brushes and was very relieved that they stood behind their product and service.</li>
            <li>In short I highly recommend this brush to all my patients, especially those with many fillings and crowns/bridges.  </li>
            <li>The first toothbrush to come down with the problem got replaced free of charge by Philips.  </li>
            <li>something I was very conscious of when the unit was vibrating against my teeth!</li>
            <li>I have had a problem with the units failing due to the handle vibration becoming decoupled from the brush head.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare toothbrush is good, but THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS !    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been good up till yesterday when it ran weakly for about 10 seconds and stopped and won&#x27;t run now.  </li>
            <li>I have never walked away from a dental cleaning (even a \\&quot;full mouth debridement\\&quot; that I had a few years back which took an hour) without being able to still feel ridges at the edge of my teeth where there was still plaque built up</li>
            <li>I have only used this brush a hand full of times since it is brand new</li>
            <li>The bristles seem to be more stiff and really gives you the \\&quot;just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist\\&quot; feeling every time you brush.  </li>
            <li>Kinda high.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this brush to anyone.</li>

            <li>All in all, highly recommend the Sonicare Flexcare 9630.</li>
            <li>If we all collectively stop buying their products then I can assure you they&#x27;ll start to listen and begin producing the types of high quality products that we demand.</li>
            <li>I rarely use the Sanitizer which is not a particularly useful addition; a quick swill under the tap serves me fine.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had my FlexCare for a little more than four months</li>
            <li>I have to say I am in love with this little guy.</li>
            <li>Having owned the original Sonicare for about 4 years now I was impressed and then disappointed when my battery finally gave out, then I found the Sonicare RS930!    </li>
            <li>However, the need for the sanitizer is real due to the nature of the type of bacteria floating around most bathrooms.    </li>
            <li>I decided to sink my teeth into something a little bit more helpful.  </li>
            <li>It is a little more powerful than my older one from a different brand and</li>
            <li>A natural whiteness appeared, my teeth FELT clean, and my gums and tongue have actually benefit from usage.</li>
            <li>I NEVER get through a brushing without changing the setting from clean to sensitive (which my teeth definitely aren&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>EVerything is sealed up and much easier to clean up in the wet world of the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>mainly because I really see the benefits this brush offers and figure</li>
            <li>I am an adult with braces and the only thing that makes my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li>not least, I love the little things on this brush.  </li>
            <li>Yes its a little pricey as most point out, but what is your only set of teeth really worth to you?  </li>
            <li>I did a side by side comparison using my older elite 7300 and the new flexcare model</li>
            <li>The brushes (as of right now) are actually cheaper for this brush than the older ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the massage setting much, and never use the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to hold than my old Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This model is great until it fails.</li>
            <li>I paid a very hefty price, even with the \\&quot;professional discount,\\&quot; because my dentist raved about the results.</li>
            <li>-Light bulb might be damaged and have to get it from service center.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had this brush for a little over a year, so I&#x27;m very familiar with it&#x27;s pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the sleek look and minimal heft and the UV sanitation option.</li>
            <li>It was no worse than what happens with a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than the old a-series.  </li>
            <li>But why is it that companies nearly always tack on a bunch of bells and whistles and don&#x27;t quite design for the way people really use the product?</li>
            <li>Our dentist recomended this brush for our 9 year old that was building up plaque fast.</li>
            <li>I have actually been able to switch to regular toothpaste instead of sensitive toothpaste.    </li>
            <li>The unit is pricey, and having to change out the heads every three months means another $30 or so per person a year, but for us the benefits have been worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>so in an effort to be more GREEN</li>
            <li>He said they normally don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Using Google and Amazon, I was quickly able to determine that the heavy hitters in the power toothbrush playing field were the Sonicare Flexcare and the Oral-B Triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No plaque, no tartar, and most importantly, no cavities.</li>
            <li>A+rtar, and most importantly, no cavities.</li>
            <li>The brush came with the Sanitizer for a few more dollars than my dentist tried to sell it for without.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it was definitely worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li>It has a massage feature which helps my teeth move faster after getting my braces tightened, a sensitive and clean feature for regular brushing (personal preference - sensitive), a go-care feature for when youre in a rush and just need a quick brush, and max care if you have some time.</li>
            <li>But while it worked, I have no complaint, it cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li>I can tell you for sure that I wasnt brushing long enough before.</li>
            <li>After brushing with the Sonicare my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with normal home brushing.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for quite awhile, not too sure how long; but I know I use it twice a day and have recharged only 2 or 3 times since purchasing a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li>I hope that wasted time is used to make the brush better in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she really appreciated it more than the usual gifts I get her.</li>
            <li>Makes oral hygiene fun, ranks next to godliness.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE using it everyday.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE using it everyday.  </li>
            <li>But, if you have the gum problems I potentially could have (because of the plaque build up), it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a normal six month rotation and the brush</li>
            <li>I normally use the \\&quot;MaxCare\\&quot; cycle, 30 seconds of cleaning plus 15 seconds of massage on each quadrant.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a sonicare toothbrush and stopped using it because it was such a hassel to use and did not feel like it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>and it still runs normally.</li>
            <li>When my old one from many years ago finally gave out, I tried to just use a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>, I definitely believe it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Overall, the FlexCare is worth the money--especially at Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having bought two of these, and known another purchaser, none of our top end models has lasted long enough to engender confidence in the durability of the motors or mechanisms of Sonicare electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>And as I&#x27;m famous for leaving electric toothbrushes in hotel rooms, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>FlexCare is an outstanding product, but did not last as long as it should have, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself is great, much smaller and easier to attach to the base, and the kit includes a travel charger which is handy as well.  </li>
            <li>The feel of the brush takes some getting used to the first time (only because the vibration really tickles)</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t an &#x27;electric toothbrush&#x27; - I still work it across my teeth and gums like a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Fired it up for the first time and although it was a strange sensation at first, when i was done, my mouth felt cleaner than when I go to the dentist.     </li>
            <li>I would tell any friend or stranger that it is well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>a few more days, and I would have been out a lot of money paid for this thing....</li>
            <li>Is it worth the initial investment?  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the initial investment?  </li>
            <li>A $150 toothbrush should not look like this with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more and see what happens.</li>
            <li>I love the UV sanitizer, and use it every few days or week.</li>
            <li>so much that when my first one suddenly stopped working after about 2 years, I had to get another one.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot to like about this unit&#x27;s ergonomics, but two glaring fault&#x27;s make all the good things about it unimportant.</li>
            <li>Good to see a company stand behind their product</li>
            <li>So I was on my own trying to winnow down the wide array of models and features available online and at local retail stores.  </li>
            <li>It says it leaves you with a Dentist office clean which I agree whole heartedly and in my case without any of the pain that I would typically be in from keeping my mouth open and having them clean my sensitive teeth!    </li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking but now that I have finally broken down and bought one, it is the best thing ever</li>
            <li>In fact, I use it three times as much as I did the other toothbrush, because it makes my mouth feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Technology has come a long way since we bought the earlier model - love the new features.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have and with the sanitizer i feel more comfortable about using it even though I have a cold right now.    </li>
            <li>not hard enough?\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>I am NOT hard on my things.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending $150 every 2 years to buy a completely new system, it&#x27;s great just REALLY expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my new sonic toothbrush a few weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li>The nice large brush area on the Advance just BLASTED my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Having used it, I am now confident that it is worth the price, and am looking forward to fewer dental visits, other than the general check-ups necessary.  </li>
            <li>Having used it, I am now confident that it is worth the price, and am looking forward to fewer dental visits, other than the general check-ups necessary.  </li>
            <li>It vibrates and has a buzzing sound, but it is MUCH quieter than our previous toothbrush (rotating head model).</li>
            <li>; nothing beats it, but be prepared to replace it frequently, as its lifespan is less than one year, if you intend to use it between/among more than one family member.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, just kind of an odd sensation if you are not used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a tad loud compared to my previous one, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning routine I prefer, the &#x60;MaxCare&#x27;, includes massage in the routine for each tooth quadrant, making it easy to incorporate into your daily brush habit without extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This newer SonicCare was a similar design, with the simple and MUCH cheaper brush replacements than the original SonicCare, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have tried other electric tooth toothbrushes and this one by far is the most professional to use.  </li>
            <li>the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sanitizer is also a major plus as I feel like I&#x27;m always using a clean brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the mode/routine button is right where I have been used to holding the handle with my thumb.</li>
            <li>It cleaned better than a plain toothbrush, and did a lot of the work for me.  </li>
            <li>I am finally brushing correctly after years of trying to get it right by myself.  </li>
            <li>One big mistake that Sonicare made is putting the mode selection button right where your thumb goes when you are holding the Sonicare and brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>You can also push the off button at any time (say, for instance, if you have to spit or speak with someone), and when you push on again, the brush will pick up right where it left off.    </li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: that they are likely to break right after warranty&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: and</li>
            <li>It cleans the yellow right out of your teeth.</li>
            <li>(Customer Service has been very good about replacing the failed toothbrushes!)</li>
            <li>brush lasts a long time after recharging and charges quickly    </li>
            <li>the rate of failure these Sonicare toothbrushes have shown over three purchases (around 16-24 months), the cost of operation to own this toothbrush, along with the ongoing brush head replacements, is well over $10.00-$13.00 every month.</li>
            <li>The vibrating became louder and sure enough, the head was loose again.  </li>
            <li>This is still working great, the battery does last as long (New-the battery lasted a little over two weeks.  </li>
            <li>However, the design of the brush is only good for brushing along the gumline outside and reaching the last back teeth.</li>
            <li>and they were all difficult to keep clean and sometimes more trouble to take apart and clean than worth the time.</li>
            <li>The first one I had was an older model but gave similar results.  </li>
            <li>When handled properly, the end result is a definite fresh and crisp feel: your teeth feel super-smooth and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with the sound or vibration, unlike some other reviewers.</li>
            <li>The price was also fantastic compared to other sites.</li>
            <li>The brush stopped charging properly, and started sounding some kind of error code (2 short buzzes and one long one, \\&quot;dot dot dash\\&quot;, over and over again).  </li>
            <li>The design is wonderful, the gunk is 95% reduced, the charger base is nice and small.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a high whine than anything else and not that excessive.</li>

            <li>so I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>We didnt notice any lessening of brushing quality, but did start thinking of buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Picked up a another new one around 2006.  </li>
            <li>This continued until battery was fully discharged and then will not accept a new charge.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new one.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without this Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but I bought it new on Ebay for $109 after shipping.</li>
            <li>I like the new cleaning compartment.</li>
            <li>I guess I will make another support plea and see if they keep sending a new unit.</li>
            <li>When I needed a new toothbrush for our cabin, I decided against the FlexCare and just purchased an Elite.</li>
            <li>However, once I sent the intent to return, in hours a new one was on</li>
            <li>My brush head looks brand new after three months of use.  </li>
            <li>and they sent me a new handle (with a new brush head and travel charger included).</li>
            <li>and I hope this new replacement will go the distance for another 3-5 years before I have to buy a new one.</li>

            <li>The new one lasted 13 months.</li>
            <li>Feb. 9, 2011: Still working like new.</li>
            <li>They shipped me a brand new unit in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the new unit.  </li>
            <li>The new toothbrush just snaps on and you don&#x27;t have to unscrew the brush head.</li>
            <li>and they are going to send me a new one.</li>
            <li>I have a new dentist now</li>
            <li>Maybe the new lithinum battery means it can be charged anytime</li>
            <li>After five years, I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>One of the instructions ruined my brand new travel brush handle.  </li>
            <li>It must have a new design as my husband&#x27;s comes apart and collects dirt under the handle - not so with this model.</li>
            <li>So I went on line to research purchasing a new one.  </li>
            <li>but the new ones are rated at 3 months.  </li>

            <li>My dentist suggested I try the new Sonicare Flexcare tootbrush that he sells for retail.</li>
            <li>I contacted Philips Sonicare using their \\&quot;Live Chat\\&quot;.  </li>

            <li>Hello,     Today, my dental hygienist, Jennifer, told me that I was a new person since I started caring for my teeth using the Sonicare sonic toothbrush 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>new model has some improvements.  </li>
            <li>Everyone has listed them here, and I can&#x27;t add anything new.</li>
            <li>so I was in the market for a new toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>I bougth a new one becouse</li>
            <li>The agent said: \\&quot;Since, you do not have the reciept I will suggest you to purchase a new unit.\\</li>
            <li>The brushes for the new one do a beter job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I just purchased seven new brushes for this toothbrush and now have to either buy another one at Target, Walmart or Amazon or throw my money out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; I purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>then I know it&#x27;s time to switch it out for a new one.</li>
            <li>I buy new ones at Costco or on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After receiving a new replacement bulb from Philips, the sanitizer worked for a period of time and then stopped again.  </li>
            <li>You just place the brush head inside and turn it on and after a ten minute cycle, where a small window glows magically, the brush head comes out clean and ready for the next use.</li>
            <li>I got this a couple of weeks ago and it is hands down better than my old oralb sonic complete.  </li>
            <li>Clean--a 2 minute clean with three beeps to tell you to move from quadrant (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right)</li>
            <li>After every use, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned, and it&#x27;s actually a lot of fun using the thing.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping it would come with more than one normal head and one small one since my gf</li>
            <li>Yes, I was  out shipping (the old unit back), but it was worth it.   </li>
            <li>After using the toothbrush for a week, I found my teeth are much cleaner, those places in the back of the mouth are much easier to reach and with the customization</li>
            <li>While others in my family are using earlier models without problem, I finally made this purchase because of redesign and upgraded options which are detailed in the products description.    </li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to, particularly if you have sensitive teeth&lt;</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums really do feel much like they do following a checkup at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed an appreciable increase in the overall \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; of my smile, an unexpected benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also noticed an appreciable increase in the overall \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; of my smile, an unexpected benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the older models, the toothbrush would fit into the charger, so about an inch of the toothbrush was hidden while on the charger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also owned Oral B ProCare, SonicCare Classic and Elite, and the Oral B Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li>At night I typically turn it to MaxCare for a solid 3 minute clean, whereas after lunch I just go for the quick 1 minute GoClean.</li>
            <li>All my teeth remain smooth only until the next meal.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a recharchable lithiom ion battery I expected better longevity, especially for an investment of over $100.  </li>
            <li>This is a very powerful cleaning tool, unlike anything I have ever felt, other than at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>The one and only small ergonomic foible with this latest generation is that it&#x27;s far too easy to bump the control switch on the handle when I&#x27;m changing quadrants or moving from the inside to the outside of the teeth, or vice versa.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine until 12/15/11  (5 months), and then broke down.</li>
            <li>My last cleaning was very intense at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes of various kinds have been around for a long time now - at least since the sixties - and manufacturers are having to get more inventive about adding features to keep consumer interest.  </li>
            <li>- I think that button is just very soft.      </li>
            <li>It is much lighter and feels a little more powerful than the previous models.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips sent a replacement handle right out (they do send a prepaid label and ask you to mail back the old one) and we got to keep the $130 we were about to shell</li>
            <li>so to speak, the first several times you use it (I highly recommend taking advantage of the &#x27;ease in&#x27; functions it offers</li>
            <li>The sonic action really does leave my teeth and gumline feeling cleaner than I was EVER able to get them by manual brushing, and I have even seen slight improvement in my periodontal situation (some moderately deep pockets).  </li>
            <li>The new brushes are easier to keep clean and sanitary due to their design and the Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>The new flexcare is smaller and lighter, but the vibrator mechanism is build-in the handle and doesn&#x27;t provide as much torque as the older model like the Advance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this model in particular and Sonicare in general.</li>
            <li>-Sensitive mode that is much gentle than the previous generation and Clean function.</li>
            <li>The first two brushes were noticeable but by the third day, I handled all settings with no problems.     </li>
            <li>The design is different and the brush is a different shape, more like a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It simply ceased to work on 2 occasions within the first 18 months.  </li>
            <li>I have some pretty deep pockets</li>
            <li>When I first purchased my Sonicare elite several years ago, they said to replace the heads every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;ll last much longer than that!    </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The brush feels like you are in control of it, more so than the bulkier versions I&#x27;ve had in the past.    </li>
            <li>The smaller brush size (sold separately) works better, especially for the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re most likely to run into this same problem with your recent purchase.</li>
            <li>He started sharing my old one over a year ago and his oral health improved immediately!</li>
            <li>is how pleased I have been with this toothbrush over the past six months.</li>
            <li>It is my first electric toothbush, and now I can never go back to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>They both had the exact same issue; they stopped charging/working altogether.</li>
            <li>I have been lazy and have not registered this latest one when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get the same exact model ..</li>
            <li>The vibration might bother you the first couple uses, but after that you&#x27;ll never want to use a regular brush again.  </li>
            <li>the extra noise I first encountered has gone away.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted about 13 months, and the second lasted 16-17 months.  </li>
            <li>With the 2-year warranty, the first was replaced, but not the second.  </li>
            <li>the brush was larger and a bit cumbersome to maneuver around in your mouth to brush exactly the way you were supposed to.</li>
            <li>My teeth were pretty yellow...</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this is my second purchase, and an upgrade from the first model.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I bought our first SoniCare toothbrush in 2000 and each used it daily for 11 years before it died.</li>
            <li>The first one was replaced by Philips, but the third one, they said, was not covered, so we had to purchase it.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>During the first 4 months I used it only once a day, then went to get my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>It is obvious that Sonic did not place the same emphasis on reliability that they placed on such an elegant design.</li>
            <li>for the two complaints that I have aside from my initial reaction of numbness:  First, the battery is one of those that you have to use up before you charge.  </li>
            <li>Now for the two complaints that I have aside from my initial reaction of numbness:  First, the battery is one of those that you have to use up before you charge.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time one actually pulled out.</li>
            <li>and I did not have any problems with my gums hurting after first several uses.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so pleased with a product in my entire life.</li>
            <li>recently my hygienist told me to try this one and at first I was put off by the price.</li>
            <li>However, this was before I mine died 9months, and I replaced the first one and the second one died under 3 months.</li>
            <li>This is the second set of this exact model I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>sonicare replaced first defective one, within one year same thing happened again.  </li>
            <li>It is just like getting your teeth professionally cleaned every day and night!  </li>
            <li>My original Sonicare with NiCad battery finally couldn&#x27;t give me enough charge for one brushing so</li>
            <li>On the first use it was obvious</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through 2 of these exact same models-</li>
            <li>wow this thing rocks!</li>
            <li>I first received this item last year before Xmas</li>
            <li>This was my first but not last Amazon purchase.  </li>
            <li>The warranty has run out and just yesterday it started making funny noises and seems like it&#x27;s not working properly anymore.  </li>
            <li>I know some people might want to set it for the one they like and have it always use that option, but me personally, I like to use different modes at different times, so it would annoy me more if it was set to one</li>
            <li>Sonicare replaced the first toothbrush, but will not replace the second.  </li>
            <li>$25 for only three - really?!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush required no complicated setup, simply removing the items from the packaging and plugging it</li>
            <li>The product inspires confidence in me that Philips truly means this unit to last the consumer for many years, only needed to replace consumable parts such as the toothbrush heads periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VALUE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Durability: this is an issue that bothers me because the handle with the soft rubber began peeling/coming off after just a year of normal use.  </li>
            <li>I doubt Philips would back their product even if you have all the supporting evidence.</li>
            <li>The first started running in the middle of the night, within a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use the standard \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, which is good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I will credit the company for customer service (they provided me with free replacements when the first and second models broke down during the year-long warranty)</li>
            <li>\\&quot;just got a dental cleaning\\&quot; feeling -- versus those other vibrating/rotating brushes that are basically designed for the lazy brusher and don&#x27;t really clean any better.</li>
            <li>The buttons are all sealed, easy to press, and the head slides on and off with little effort.</li>
            <li>It would get all moldy and gross if you didn&#x27;t clean it out regularly.  </li>
            <li>i had to take it apart about 3 years in when the post for the head unit seemed to have come disconnected from the main unit internally, making the brush head very wobbly.  </li>
            <li>and considering a second clean with the regular brush.  </li>
            <li>I like the Go Clean with four 15 second intervals in the AM and the regular 2 minutes in the PM.</li>
            <li>Unlike the older Sonicare models, this one has a cheap rubber green button that disintegrates after 6 months of usage.</li>
            <li>However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li>However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li>I set the brush on clean mode and tend not to use the other options, but some may find them useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to me to be a way of making people buy new replacement brushes when their old ones get worn.  </li>
            <li>So when you go to replace the battery in the toothbrush you would think you just unscrew the bottom, pop out the old battery and pop in the new one.</li>
            <li>I attempted to buy new heads for the old model and they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  </li>
            <li>I bought this new one to replace an 8-year old model.</li>
            <li>The new model is easier to hold, has soft brush for gums as well as teeth.  </li>
            <li>but it breaks about once a year, so i get a new one under warranty and send the old one in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We bought this new one because our old one just got funky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just purchased this new model, and &#x27;wow&#x27;</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this new model because the battery in my old one is wearing out.  </li>
            <li>New motor is a bit quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li>This is a much neater and easier toothbrush to keep clean compared to the plain Sonicare sets.</li>
            <li>and they confirmed that the flexcare model is louder, but has less vibrations in the hand.  </li>
            <li>The replacement lasted less than a week, at which point the power button fell off, the toothbrush filled with water, and that one ceased working.  </li>
            <li>These features may not be important but together, despite recommendations I can brush in 30 seconds or less if pushed.  </li>
            <li>buy the over the counter oral b or whatever is available, that costs less.  </li>
            <li>The head has been completely redesigned (even though the brush portion itself is basically the same) and no longer requires daily \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>BUT this particular series is a complete waste even though the positives are light weight</li>
            <li>different brushing modes on the Flexcare are really nice, but there is a small problem with all your options.  </li>
            <li>The FlexCare handle is small and feels much better in the hand than my old bulky 5300 handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time switched to sonicare and chose this model, all I can say is it&#x27;s DIFFERENT, and your teeth is going to be cleaned completely.</li>
            <li>I was pretty bummed as it was only 1 year old.</li>
            <li>I had purchased another one a few years ago but the the vibration was too strong.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it came with one large brush head and an addititonal small one that I can reach the backs of my back teeth with.</li>
            <li>Love the UV Sanitizer and the smaller brush head makes it easier to clean hard to reach area in back of mouth.</li>
            <li>This means that they will intentionally produce products that are specifically designed to break down or be unusable/incompatible within a specific time frame so that you buy their products over and over again thereby taking more of your money and increasing their profits.</li>
            <li>There are too many reviews that indicate a high failure rate.  </li>
            <li>I settled on this unit based on several positive reviews, its feature set, and the fact that for $5 more than the next model down, it came with the UV sanitizer feature.  </li>
            <li>HUGE MESS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly loud, but it&#x27;s loud enough that you probably won&#x27;t want to use it around a light sleeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this last checkup, my dentist spotted a problem area where brushing just can&#x27;t reach:  the very pits of my molars are pretty deep.  </li>
            <li>I went looking for a new brush for two reasons: one, the Oral-B brush heads always accumulated a gross slime inside of them, that really grossed me out.</li>
            <li>The second reason I went looking for a new toothbrush, is that I really wanted a UV sanitizer for the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>Its slimmer, less vibration and the toothbrush head is much smaller and just slips easily on top of a metal rod.    </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more is that the head uses probably 30-40% less material and plastic than a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>It is smaller, lighter and quieter while cleaning even better than the previous models.</li>
            <li>I will never use a regular toothbrush again (except to clean the toilet).</li>
            <li>It took 2 years in the previous unit, and 1 year in the most recently purchased unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much smaller and lighter than my previous brush, which makes it much better to use.  </li>
            <li>I could never get it to calm down, even the lowest setting was out of control, but the good thing about that model is that it had a pressure sensor, if you brushed too hard it would stop.</li>
            <li>it is going to die within a few days because exactly the same thing happened with my Sonicare Healthy white brush (dual brush) a year ago.</li>
            <li>This is mostly my fault due to a fear of dentist for a variety of reasons (including the time when the dentist inadvertently stuck me in the arm with a novocaine needle) which kept me from the dentist&#x27;s office for a long time.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unwilling to spend the big bucks for this model, and I certainly understand, I would suggest getting the flexcare without the sanitizer or go for the elite model.</li>
            <li>but with a different model, the one that has the large bottom to the brush head that you screw on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s a fantastic product but a little noisier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use the sanitizer about once a week, putting the brush head in the little compartment after the evening brushing, firing up the UV light, and then wiping off the unit&#x27;s mounting post.</li>
            <li>The little traveling case is fantastic, I can go on trips for days and it fits snugly in my bag and does not need a charge for days.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the cheaper models clean your teeth as well as this expensive model, which has bells and whistles that most people will never use.</li>
            <li>Retightening it will only buy you a little more time before it loosens again.</li>
            <li>Oral B&#x27;s products are much more reliable, but their brushes are way too hard compared to the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>But as for other of these types of brushes, this one is super.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gripping it particularly hard</li>
            <li>as I feel I get into hard to reach places better.</li>
            <li>This is one way you can offset the high cost (relative to a normal toothbrush).    </li>
            <li>If you call or Live Chat Philips saying you have a problem, the first thing they ALWAYS ask me is if the shaft is loose.</li>
            <li>Also, the heads have a little plastic circle on it that comes in a few different colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush-</li>
            <li>I called the number above and after a little troubleshooting they were kind enough to offer a replacement even though the warranty was expired by 3 years - just as a one time courtesy!</li>
            <li>I called the number above and after a little troubleshooting they were kind enough to offer a replacement even though the warranty was expired by 3 years - just as a one time courtesy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the UV sanitizer very often since it seems a little gimmicky but it&#x27;s nice piece of mind and someplace enclosed to store the brush head.    </li>
            <li>This little machine cleans my teeth far better than a regular, manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I liked this toothbrush a lot but the 2 that I bought for my family both stopped working - one 2 and a half years after purchase and the other 3 years after purchase.</li>
            <li>Not yet sure if this makes a difference  - soft carrying case rather than hard plastic case    </li>
            <li>- my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as clean since I last visited the dentist, which was too long ago!</li>
            <li>The sanitizer has worked great during the cold season.  </li>
            <li>I was all excited to purchase this one and to disappointment I paid such a huge amount for a used product and that too a toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>Well, the brush is clearly five stars.  </li>
            <li>It uses less toothpaste and after brushing you teeth seem really clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to go back to my old reliable Oral B toothbrush, but I&#x27;m gonna really miss the softness of the Flexcare brushes.</li>
            <li>this thing lasts for at least a few years then I will be happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get the feeling that Philips wants me to buy and replace bristles far too often simply for profit.</li>
            <li>Into my second year the battery died fast; the metal part where the brush attachments stick on completely BROKE OFF.  </li>
            <li>LED for power is clear and bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;s be clear on this: a Sonicare toothbrush is a luxury product.  </li>
            <li>clear whenever you stop using it or if you don&#x27;t turn it on for three seconds.  </li>
            <li>clear whenever you stop using it or if you don&#x27;t turn it on for three seconds.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t see any real need for the massage and sensitive settings and just use the standard one.</li>
            <li>I used the previous model for almost 2 years while I had braces and for each of my semi-annual checkups at the dentist, the dental hygienist was amazed at how clean my teeth were even with braces.  </li>
            <li>This product is clearly defective and sonciare knows it.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare FlexCare has a clear and thorough instruction booklet explaining each feature.  </li>
            <li>: that said, the cost of the brusheads is just too much, cosmetically the toothbrush is done, and I&#x27;ve come to the point where I feel that this toothbrush offers nothing over standard toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded to this model after my old elite bit the dust, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I have tried various brands; you know, the ones when you purchase another toothbrush when the battery dies because its too much of a hassle to get to the battery.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and was worried about agitating my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really hope Sonicare plans on keeping this one around longer then 4 years unlike my last one.</li>
            <li>I guarantee my old one would have.      </li>
            <li>I keep accidentally turning the toothbrush on and off while brushing, even when I make a conscious effort to avoid the switch.  </li>
            <li>With the Sonicare, it oscillates back and forth, mimicking real tooth brushing motion.</li>
            <li>I received this product faster than anticipated and so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li>At least it sure looks like their work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Sensitive mode&lt;br</li>
            <li>these toothbrushes don&#x27;t seem to last much beyond 2 years anymore&lt;</li>
            <li>Used it a few times but noticed it increases bristle wear and they aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>so he assured me that with my sensitive teeth I would have no problems.</li>
            <li>I could always use the sensitive setting or even the massage one.      </li>
            <li>Battery seems to last much, much longer.  </li>
            <li>I replaced another Sonicare with this one because the old one was dying.  </li>
            <li>Now I know how much battery I have left.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a soft travel case for keeping the brush and heads in, and a includes compact charger for travel that doesn&#x27;t have the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>So I bought replacement heads (for way too much money)and the same happened with those three.  </li>
            <li>I never use the additional settings that the brush offers either.  </li>
            <li>Really, I can&#x27;t recommend this brush highly enough.</li>
            <li>So today I call, and they tell me that the problem is MY fault -- that this toothbrush is not built to withstand frequent head changing.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>It is a low-toned buzz, far quieter than an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>This one, by far, beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m storing the old one just in case).</li>
            <li>and it really leaves you with the same feeling as when you come out of the hygienist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>You will know the end is near when you start hearing a loud rattling noise during brushing.</li>
            <li>models offered top-of-the-line features and each had earned near 5-star reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I M E S  so far in 2010.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush in early 2009.  </li>
            <li>I am so far, anyway.  </li>
            <li>Nor do I visit my dentist nearly as often as I should.</li>
            <li>It has worked really well, and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use extra whiteners, since my teeth are whiter also.</li>
            <li>It requires entirely too much pressure to turn it off.</li>
            <li>It REALLY feels like you just left the dentist after brushing.</li>
            <li>I dont have plaque on my teeth through out the whole day, even through multiple meals.</li>
            <li>and I can completely agree.</li>
            <li>and I can completely agree.</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  </li>
            <li>My husband has now switched to the Oral B Professional Series.</li>
            <li>Within another couple of days, the thing just died completely-</li>
            <li>I asked about having it fixed for a fee and was told that they don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>That can&#x27;t be fixed?</li>
            <li>These models are not as hardy as the old design.  </li>
            <li>As a result, the brush makes a loud noise and eventually falls off the shaft.  </li>
            <li>In fact they feel near as sparkly as they do when stepping out of the dentist&#x27;s office.     </li>
            <li>I started using electric toothbrushes long before Sonicare came up with their first product - like 20 years ago, and might have been an Oral B.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping it continues to work like it has so far.  </li>
            <li>so I should not have been surprised.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t find them to be too loud.</li>
            <li>It has performed without flaw so far.  </li>
            <li>it is confusing which head you want (customer service says they should say \\&quot;Pro Results\\&quot; on them, but many websites show a pic with Sonicare on them (with matching model #),   </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fearlessly, I pushed the shiny button until a green light appeared beside the Max Care routine.</li>
            <li>and nearly jumped out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks professional</li>
            <li>I also realize that my gums are not as sensitive as before or rather my gum has become stronger.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this style brush because it has various timed settings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bye Bye Sensitive Teeth.</li>
            <li>My old sonicare literally died after about 20 years of recharging.  </li>
            <li>The old Sonicare Advance one had all of the bristles lined up.</li>
            <li>FEELS LIKE PROFESSIONAL TOOL IN DENTIST&#x27;S OFFICE.</li>
            <li>If I do buy the Healthy White, it is with my eyes open to the fact that it may only last 2 - 3 years, but hopefully provides comparable results to the FlexCare.</li>
            <li>The young man adviced me to get it through Amazon, since they honor the warranty b/c they have no way of knowing who sells them on Ebay or where they get their toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>had I listened to the young guy at Philips.    </li>
            <li>Even though I am not big on spending that much on a tooth brush, I went with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for around 3 months now and the biggest con so far is the noise.</li>
            <li>Even on old stains it will take a bit but you can see the difference.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this works.</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive teeth and use a sensitive toothpaste, and the brushes&#x27; actions have not bothered me at all.  </li>
            <li>By the way, my old old Braun brush that I talk about in this review?  </li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive teeth and use a sensitive toothpaste, and the brushes&#x27; actions have not bothered me at all.  </li>
            <li>By the way, my old old Braun brush that I talk about in this review?  </li>
            <li>Anyway this brush completely turned around my dental health.  </li>
            <li>I have had no problems so far with the flexcare, and I would recommend this brush to any person of any age.</li>
            <li>Sensitive teeth:  </li>
            <li>Having extremely sensitive teeth, I had my doubts when my hygienist recommended Sonicare, but was relieved to find it to be gentler than a manual toothbrush with extra-soft bristles.      </li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner than they have ever felt, and seem to stay that way between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner than they have ever felt, and seem to stay that way between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li>so you can tell how much charge is left.  </li>
            <li>However, 8 months after purchasing this wonder brush, it has developed a mind of</li>
            <li>It extremely loud and distracting when it is in use, don&#x27;t bother trying to listen to anyone talk to you unless they&#x27;re yelling.  </li>
            <li>I feel as if my teeth are much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I still have my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>because the old one will die.</li>
            <li>One concern was that the brush started out very quiet, but became very noisy in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I could always turn it back on if I really wanted to and do another cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes it is pricey, but dental hygiene is extremely important and for me I did not hesitate to pay the price as it is something I use everyday twice a day and</li>
            <li>This never happened on my old model.</li>
            <li>the extra cost for the sanitizer is a bit much considering it is about a $15.00 value for the UV bulb.  </li>
            <li>It starts gentle, and after the next 14 cycles it will gradually step up the frequency...</li>
            <li>They prepaid a package to return the old unit to them.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this problem is completely gone with the Flexcare</li>
            <li>In addition, it reaches all of the areas in my mouth, where my old brush needed to be supplemented with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>Our dental hygienist really believes in these brushes, especially for gum health.</li>
            <li>MY OLD SONICARE WAS ACCIDENTALLY DISPOSED OF BY AN ORDERLY WHEN I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR A SURGERY</li>
            <li>was backing out completely.    </li>
            <li>I gave this to my adult son as a gift.  </li>
            <li>His dentist had recommended this because of his sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>Plus + for GUM Gums Professional Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth like a professional cleaning and leaves them so shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about different mechanical toothbrushes</li>
            <li>i totally agree with the whole messiness issue.  </li>
            <li>My old style tooth brushes and hand could never give me the cleaning that I get each time I use this.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smaller size of both the handle and brush head</li>
            <li>, the brush head is much easier to move around in your mouth and reach the very back.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t really use all of the extra options that are on the toothbrush, but maybe one day I will.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li>Without this toothbrush my gums go wild.</li>
            <li>I see my dentist in February and hope that he is pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This one has all the bells and whistles on it of which so far I use 2 of.</li>
            <li>The only thing I question though is I noticed this is made in China and how could it cost so much??</li>
            <li>The old one must be returned.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I had just come out of a professional cleaning at the dentist (</li>
            <li>or maybe it&#x27;s just that my teeth are sensitive...)</li>
            <li>If they come out with a lower-end model without all the various modes, the UV cleaner, etc., at a much lower price, I&#x27;d recommend that over this model.  </li>
            <li>and I had the sensitive gums to show for it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the product itself since I never used it for obvious reasons</li>
            <li>My mouth feels much cleaner when I wake up after having brushed with the Sonicare the night before.</li>
            <li>Meets my expectations thus far.  </li>
            <li>Since lithium batteries have a fixed life, the battery should be user-replaceable.  </li>
            <li>Now the toothbrush is completely exposed to the air</li>
            <li>so far, they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I had an old sonicare</li>
            <li>The whole (short) process from beginning to end was truly exemplary customer service!  </li>
            <li>My old Sonic Care wore out (batteries ceased to hold a charge).</li>
            <li>but with some marked improvements.  </li>
            <li>One Sonicare brush lasted nearly 2 years and died *</li>
            <li>if you have the money for frequent replacements, go for it.  </li>
            <li>sanitizer is a gimmick, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+The old handle had a recessed area.</li>
            <li>You can also adjust for \\&quot;I want you to focus on cleaning\\&quot;, \\&quot;I have sensitive</li>
            <li>last time I had an electric toothbrush, it was heavier than the Sonicare, despite being much shorter.  </li>
            <li>My old Braun electric toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t doing the job and a friend recommended the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my 22 yr old for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a fanatic about her teeth and making sure she keeps them forever.   </li>
            <li>even though my old one still worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Those who use the old design know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with sensitive and bleeding gums for years and since switching to this toothbrush the problem has gone away.  </li>
            <li>even though I can&#x27;t say for sure that it works, it at least makes me feel like my brush is cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if I get professional cleanings every day.  </li>
            <li>(my old ones didn&#x27;t..)</li>
            <li>The toothbrush really holds a charge as with daily use</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned</li>
            <li>It was loud.  </li>
            <li>After using the this Sonicare for awhile, I went on vacation and grabbed my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li>really like the different brushing mode options. &#x27;</li>
            <li>My dentist has been suggesting this type of toothbrush for ever, but being a diehard I stayed with old faith-ful.</li>
            <li>When a person brushes manually, he does most of the work, but when operating a sonic toothbrush, the user must be careful to apply only apply light pressure, angle the brush so that it touches both the tooth and the gum, and move the brush slowly from tooth to tooth.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;There are 5 brushing modes you can choose from, including one for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>, considering these toothbrushes have only 2 year warranties -- they work very well for longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- this model is a bit noisier than the old one&lt;br</li>
            <li>After some research I picked the Sonicare and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>As a result it&#x27;s much easier to clean that previous models, which would be my only gripe about them.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to replace your old one or want to get an powered toothbrush I would recommend.</li>
            <li>I tend to get cavities often (soft enamel maybe?)</li>
            <li>I will purchase a third Sonicare when I&#x27;m ready to replace this Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It seems that since I did not register it, although I thought I did and that I don&#x27;t have a three year old receipt, they told me to buy another one at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li>I still  use the old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from an old Sonicare I got from Costco, wanting to upgrade the type of brush head.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get a professional cleaning every day.  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s because of the sonic action of the brush.  </li>
            <li>But hey, better late than never.</li>
            <li>Make sure you eat enough green vegetables and fruits.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Flexcare&#x27;s brushes but the toothbrush itself only lasts a few months.  </li>
            <li>They offered no course of action beyond sending me on my way, now disgruntled that I&#x27;ve spent $120 on a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t worth their time.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought quite a few Sonicare toothbrushes over the years, but their latest toothbrush is a total junk.  </li>
            <li>All of the different cleaning modes are highly useful for different users.  </li>
            <li>No matter the product, it is only as good as the Customer Care behind it.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t floss, I don&#x27;t use mouthwash, and to be honest, I&#x27;m not great about always brushing my teeth before bed.</li>
            <li>It comes with two heads, one is larger than the other one but either one is fine.  </li>
            <li>Right now, I go for an extra cleaning a year to my dentist (for which I pay, my insurance only covers two per year)</li>
            <li>Right now, I go for an extra cleaning a year to my dentist (for which I pay, my insurance only covers two per year)</li>
            <li>The standard brushhead is just the right size for daily use, not bulky like the manual toothbrushes nowadays.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little quieter, quite a bit smaller, and *much* easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a UV sanitizer to zap any germs that dare to live on your brushing head, and may possibly be used to clean some models of the Oral B brushing heads you may be using in other toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I guarantee you the only setting you need and will use is the normal one!    </li>
            <li>My gum pockets are back to normal!  </li>
            <li>The bristles become a little too soft after a while, and then my mouth starts not feeling as clean, and</li>
            <li>On another note, i&#x27;ve had huge issues with other philips items such as earbuds and whatnot.  </li>
            <li>With a steady hand, I wet the bristles and applied some toothpaste, then confidently pressed the green button......</li>
            <li>Takes less than 7 hours for a full charge.</li>
            <li>I was instructed that either model would work great, so long as I brushed at least twice daily and flossed</li>
            <li>product is great for small mouths, hard to reach areas/crevices and for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel so polished and clean with every use that you can skip the cleanings at the dentist for a little if you want.  </li>
            <li>I have no problems fitting the sonic brush-head into my mouth, the extended reach is long enough to reach all the way to the back teeth and to clean the inside and outside of the teeth and along the gumline without having to open my mouth too wide.</li>
            <li>The other thing is the mode button underneath the power button is way too easy to activate, just the simple act of picking it up can trigger it if your not careful.</li>
            <li>Previous Sonicare models required a large replacement head that I always thought was a huge waste and very environmentally unfriendly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Given all of the above, if you can, please steer clear of the FlexCare units and purchase the older e Series units instead.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Given all of the above, if you can, please steer clear of the FlexCare units and purchase the older e Series units instead.  </li>
            <li>There is no excuse for such appliances that quickly break down, particularly at their high cost.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff to clean my teeth but gentle enough to get into the gums w/o causing bleeding.</li>
            <li>Great imporvement on the brush/head design, so that no more water gets trapped in there and gets all moldy and gross!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run when you consider the cost of regular professional cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run when you consider the cost of regular professional cleaning      </li>
            <li>I think it is worth getting the sonicare flexcare without the UV sanitizer and buying the philips UV standalone sanitizer separately as the standlone UV sanitizer will take other brush heads as well.</li>
            <li>I arranged for the replacement in just a few minutes with a friendly Sonicare representative via Internet chat on their website.</li>
            <li>Oral B and other brands are not as powerful.</li>
            <li>Finally, the brushead is just too small for me, though it is nice that I get to feel when I brush each individual tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist  recommended the Sonicare  over other electric toothbrushes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the others aren&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best electric toothbrush on the market, but unfortunately after less than three years I have over $200 worth of dead phillips sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This is called PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE which means that Philips intentionally made these toothbrushes in such a way that they will mostly break down within 2 years so that you&#x27;re likely to drop another $120+ every 2 years to buy another one of these overpriced vibrators.</li>
            <li>AND I just recently bought a set of new brush heads which cost me almost 40 bucks which now I can&#x27;t use!  </li>
            <li>TWO DAYS later I received new unit in the mail!  </li>
            <li>My complaint with the original Sonicare was that the brush head was too cumbersome, and viola!</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s a bit more, the cheaper, less complex head and the UV sanitizer are well worth it.</li>
            <li>It gives a dentist-like clean everyday.</li>
            <li>handle just buzzes harshly, and the brush doesn&#x27;t clean well</li>
            <li>a more serious note-</li>
            <li>last two had the exact same problem.  </li>
            <li>They told me that miraculously I was the only person who had ever contacted that particular support staff with the brush head problem.  </li>
            <li>Now, the 3rd (or is the 4th) unit is experiencing the exact same problem yet again -- the metal shaft seeming to come apart inside the rubber sleeve.  </li>
            <li>Has several options, including a timer for those who are particular about brushing for the recommended 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>hygienist recommended this particular model during my last visit.</li>
            <li>You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much smaller than all the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the UV Sanitizer thing is worth it, you can&#x27;t really tell if its killing germs or not</li>
            <li>Our dentist noticed a difference, particularly with our gums and back teeth.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even stand using a regular tooth brush anymore, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back ;)</li>
            <li>I told her it could only be attributed to this particular toothbrush (never had a comment from her while using the Braun), brushing three,</li>
            <li>The only reason I switched is because they stopped making the replacements brush heads for my older model.</li>
            <li>It is also a solid improvement over the older generations as toothpaste and muck does not collect under the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>I have had no less than 10 Philips Sonicare tootbrushes over the years for our family.</li>
            <li>Well I had read the reviews before I purchased &amp; remembered the tip to put the toothbrush in my mouth before turning it on because this thing splattered toothpaste like if the main artery had been slashed on the side of my neck with just my mouth barely open</li>
            <li>The general person will not likely spend this much on a toothbrush, sonic or not.  </li>
            <li>The general person will not likely spend this much on a toothbrush, sonic or not.  </li>
            <li>first brush lasted 9 months, the second about the same.</li>
            <li>it is an older model and it may have been damaged by sudden power</li>
            <li>I usually use the quick clean mode because the other one seems like it takes forever.</li>
            <li>It is actually cheaper and I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years now with no problems (other than having to clean out the nastiness that lurks under the brush head).</li>
            <li>My teeth never felt as clean when I brushed manually or with other electrics.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the Flexcare&#x27;s much smaller (and spikier) head just doesn&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
            <li>The price was high, but after reading the reviews and doing some research I finally bought this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The retail pricing is actually too high / inflated price tag, but if you can get it</li>
            <li>So overall, would highly recommend Sonicares, but this one might be overpriced because it&#x27;s the newer model.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush to everyone, especially if you have oral ailments.  </li>
            <li>The new design is really cool and no more</li>
            <li>I called Philips customer service center, was on the phone for under 5 minutes, and they shipped a whole new unit to me.</li>
            <li>I called Sonicare (Philips), they asked my name and are sending me a new handset with no further action on my part.</li>
            <li>They sent a new one out in 3 days (with no cost to me) and provided return shipping to send the old unit back.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one and requested that I send my old unit back.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get the sanitizer version because it was only a little bit more and came with 2 different brush options.  </li>
            <li>the whole unit really don&#x27;t take up a lot of room if you have a typical sink.</li>
            <li>Only annoyance is that the charging/UV station always makes a slight buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>I had the previous one for 10 years and the buttons got worn out - but totally expected after so many</li>
            <li>Now, a year and half later, the replacement unit has become annoyingly loud and does not vibrate as well as it did originally.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses the Sonicare and has been for a long time.</li>
            <li>The oscillation of the brush head is a strange sensation on your teeth and gums, but once you get used to it the system works very well.</li>
            <li>Also, the &#x27;Go Care&#x27; and &#x27;Max Care&#x27; settings are very convenient and take the guesswork out of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing in each area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>If it was larger, it would be harder to fit into smaller curves around the gumline.  </li>
            <li>If it was larger, it would be harder to fit into smaller curves around the gumline.  </li>
            <li>A SonicCare toothbrush is definitely a change from a normal brushing.</li>
            <li>The battery charge last about a week unplugged for a normal usage</li>
            <li>Not having used an electric toothbrush before, I expected to be wearing a lot of toothpaste the first not around, but not so.  </li>
            <li>While it is expensive, I think it is certainly worth it and trust that it will last for many years.</li>
            <li>I tried several chargers to make sure it was the toothbrush itself that was dead, and this was definitely the case.</li>
            <li>It actually fell off a couple of times during normal brushing.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the various modes (normal, max, massage, etc.)</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush last year at Target where it was normally $189...</li>
            <li>The normal clean is a 2 minute, 30 second per side (lower front, lower back, upper front, upper back) program.</li>
            <li>Once you own this it would be very hard to go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I think that this brush could be easily used by a \\&quot;lefty\\&quot; or a \\&quot;righty\\&quot; and is something I wish I had when my right arm was broken!</li>
            <li>Using the Philips wins hands down.</li>
            <li>Yes, there&#x27;s always going to be an exception, but you have to realize a simple fact which is that the sole interest of these large corporations be it</li>
            <li>The built in programs help me make sure I brush long enough, while allowing me to brush for less time when I&#x27;m in a hurry or softer when my gums are sore.</li>
            <li>and/or has more vibration in the hand than some other Sonicare model they had used previously.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve started brushing my teeth and have other models quit on me half way through.</li>
            <li>and my dentist could tell my teeth were in better condition (I brush too hard with regular tooth brushes).  </li>
            <li>It is not as loud as I expected it to be and not nearly as annoying to my mouth as other brands.</li>
            <li>coz for almost 2-3 years I had been suffering with sensitive teeth, only people who has it will understand my feeling; and now I am almost free of sensitive teeth becoz of this little Giant Flexcare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wanted to get the new model with the smaller head design around 2003/2004</li>
            <li>After about two or three years the new model simply wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li>It also has several new features including a massage function and the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>sent me a new unit 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li>While waiting for the new brush to come in, we had to go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li>But after about a months use the blue line on the toothbrush head already begun to recede indicating that I would soon need a new toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>The new one with its smaller brush head and slenderer stem is easier to use.</li>
            <li>After a short discussion of the problem and giving the rep. the model number and serial number of my unit, I was told a new Flexcare would be sent out to me and arrive in a week.  </li>
            <li>Today, Wednesday, a brand new entire unit was sitting on my doorstep when I got home from work.  </li>
            <li>I am still up in the air on all the new &#x60;settings/cleaning modes&#x27; but I will definitely give them all a try.  </li>
            <li>We are now researching new ones and either will replace it with another Sonicare (this was our second) or go with something else.</li>
            <li>It also has a built in 30 second reminder to tell you to switch to a new area of your mouth followed by an automatic 2 minute shutoff.</li>
            <li>so you have to either get used to or go back to the mode for new users.     </li>
            <li>Shawn, I purchased a new Flexcare system back in June 2010 from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but at this point of time I can only suggest you to buy new Toothbrush with the 15% discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only have purchased new brush heads as needed.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to go to the back yard to get a new branch</li>
            <li>live chat with Phillips Care, after remote diagnosing by the representative, resulted in a brand new replacement unit being shipped to me along with a postage paid return package for the old brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this device and would never go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li>Starting with the bottom teeth, I gently moved the brush head in the back and forth motion as directed.  </li>
            <li>last thing, the brush heads are somewhat pricey and the blue indicator bristle section seems to run out much faster than the recommended 3 months.</li>
            <li>My last electric toothbrush lasted over 3 years and it just doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to spend over $100 on a toothbrush that can&#x27;t even last year.  </li>
            <li>I then bought this Sonic set and let me tell you how much I ENJOY and look forward to brushing everyday (several time a day now).  </li>
            <li>The whole package is expensive, even more is the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>The much smaller and simpler FlexCare brush heads make for a much cleaner experience, especially if you travel and have to remove the head to put it in the travel case.  </li>
            <li>So to Sonicare thanks for getting my teeth back to where they are suppose to be and AMAZON for taking the time out to have such a VARIETY of brushes by</li>
            <li>My first minor nitpick is that the brush should remember the cleaning-mode setting that you used last.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying another because I do love it, but at nearly a hundred bucks, I&#x27;m not happy about it at all...  </li>
            <li>I will be buying another because I do love it, but at nearly a hundred bucks, I&#x27;m not happy about it at all...  </li>
            <li>It is expensive but over the years of use it is overall a good value for the benefits that it provides for you and your family.</li>
            <li>The first one I had was an older model with the cup tops, it broke down in the second year.  </li>
            <li>You just push them down until they slide right onto it.  </li>
            <li>We bought this to replace a very old Sonicare that finally stopped working.</li>
            <li>I realize this requirement is pretty commonplace but its pretty frustrating when a dedicated phillips consumer (my home is full of phillips electronics and other Phillips products) gets treated in this manner.</li>
            <li>The unit itself allows for multiple cleaning options: (basic clean, sensitive setting, message setting, 1 minute clean and 3 minute clean).     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Sonicare toothbrushes in the past and feel like they are the reason I&#x27;ve such healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>You mouth would only feel cleaner if a professional had just cleaned it!</li>
            <li>Has some major study come out telling everyone to replace their brush every three months?  </li>
            <li>After having used 2 other models for a couple years each and then breaking, I was a little nervous about spending a lot of money on their top model.  </li>
            <li>That and the gap between the toothbrush head and the backing was a major repository of smelly toothpaste remnants.</li>
            <li>The first one of these that I bought two years ago died recently, and I just got a second one last week to replace it.  </li>
            <li>But in spite of my disappointment with the two year lifespan of my first one, the bottom line for me is that I liked the power and the features enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li>At first, the controls and LED indicators on the brush handle seem confusing--but I&#x27;ve brushed manually for the last couple decades, so that&#x27;s likely just me.</li>
            <li>Apparently both brushes that came with my Sonicare were incorrect models!  </li>
            <li>The unit is much more compact than I expected and not nearly as loud as I expected.  </li>
            <li>I always think about that video clip that shows them vibrating in the water &amp; how the Oral-B barely moves the water &amp; the Sonicare goes bananas!</li>
            <li>where to start:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded from an electric Oral-B toothbrush to this one and notice a major difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much gone insane, even though I took great care of the handle for the two years I owned it.</li>
            <li>I was constantly using the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting, but after a few weeks I have been able to use the regular \\&quot;clean\\&quot; setting thanks to less sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>It is important because lack of torque will prevent Flexcare owners using heavy toothpaste such as Colgate Total, also, its bristles are not of same high quality like the Advance&#x27;s     Few positive improvements of Flexcare compared to the older model:     </li>
            <li>The only down sides that I&#x27;ve heard: if you turn the toothbrush on either free of your mouth, or if you happen to open your mouth while brushing, it has a tendency to splatter - but that makes sense considering the motion the brush takes.</li>
            <li>I buy a big pack of heads at Costco but only replace the heads every 4-5 months and take them off the brush to clean the connection every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I have passed over more than a few purchases, when a brief search revealed a lousy customer service reputation of a company, so this experience was refreshing.</li>
            <li>So can someone please explain why something that should logically cost less since it uses less materials and uses NO radical new technology in fact costs 300%-400% more than a conventional toothbrush and why you would pay for such an overpriced product?</li>
            <li>I usually use the clean setting</li>
            <li>The operation noise is minor compared to my older model.</li>
            <li>Also, there are a few modes to use (extensive brushing, quick, sensitive, etc.)</li>
            <li>A few times over the years I used a Swissco brand toothbrush and recently began using a Radius Original toothbrush three times a day.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but now that I have used the toothbrush for a little while it was worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I read over every review I could find and as many pointed out it looks like some of the &#x27;annoying&#x27; issues have been corrected over the original model (mold/scum collecting under the brush head mount, handle sticking to the charger like glue at times!)    </li>
            <li>Sure, I brush regularly but not for very long, and certainly not following the suggested charts of up and down and side to side for two minutes or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have a few of settings on this including a one minute short setting, a three minute extended clean, and a message setting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to guess the price of the brushheads are cheaper now too because they are smaller and don&#x27;t have all the extra parts the older model has</li>
            <li>newer brush heads are notably more expensive than the older ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But those improvements, as significant as they are, pale in comparison to the Sonicare cleaning experience overall.  </li>
            <li>The first time you get sick, you will be so glad to have the UV sanitizer!    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Sonicare products, but they are not for everyone, the light buzzing can be an annoyance to people who are easily annoyed, but with time even they can get used to the Sonicare system.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying one of these, especially is you are not so keen on flossing daily.</li>
            <li>Not only do my teeth feel cleaner, but I am able to get some of the hard to reach places much easier than I could with a conventional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it will also be much easier to keep clean since the threaded head style of my old model (impossible to keep clean inside) is gone now replaced with a simple slip-in brush head that should have no such issues.</li>
            <li>That is bad, but considering the quality of electronics these days, I am happy this lasted four years.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was amazing, but unfortunately it broke within a year</li>
            <li>Philips who manufactures this toothbrush, General Motors or Apple is PROFIT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not loud enough to wake up my wife while I get ready in the morning -- whereas my electric shaver is louder and will wake her up.    </li>
            <li>The travel pouch will no doubt come in useful and the brush caps will stop the head becoming dirty.</li>
            <li>Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them.</li>
            <li>and I even loved the idea of UV Sanitizer which I at first thought was stupid idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly surprising to see how many others had the same thing happen.</li>
            <li>My only concern was of the reviews that mentioned the toothbrush being loud.  </li>
            <li>I personally like it and surprised no one else is even talked about it.</li>
            <li>like that it has options for sensitive and regular or whitening.</li>
            <li>only downside of this is that the silver button that changes the routine is on the area where you would naturally put your thumb.</li>
            <li>Today, I went to my 6 month check up and the hygienist barely had to do anything.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I barely put any pressure at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, all I wanted was a toothbrush, and one that took the same brush head as my old one did as I have 4 unused brush heads bought as replacements for both my husband and me.  </li>
            <li>may go back to my old one and ditch this.</li>
            <li>Apparently the toothbrush cannot handle this.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, it&#x27;s a bit loud, but again, this seems to make sense considering what the brush is doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then my old sonic which had the bigger brush.</li>
            <li>Apparently just a quality issue.  </li>
            <li>I am back to the old Oral B which I was just about to throw out.   </li>
            <li>I was also asked to ship the old one back to the company, which I did.</li>
            <li>This one has 3 different settings and I use the sensitive one exclusively.  </li>
            <li>This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures.</li>
            <li>The old brushheads use to say they would last 6 months</li>
            <li>You have to realize that every time you purchase something whether it be an organic apple as opposed to a pesticide sprayed apple or a T-shirt made in the USA as opposed to a sweatshop in China, you have a direct impact on these corporations profits and that you have the ability to influence their future decisions.</li>
            <li>I especially like the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>The old one handled only 110V.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After having used the Flexcare, it doesn&#x27;t even seem possible to compare it to my old Oral-B (which is only a year old.)  </li>
            <li>After using the Flexcare for awhile, I went back to my old Oral-B, just to compare...  </li>
            <li>Compared to any regular toothbrush, spin brush or even an Oral B sonic toothbrush I had bought, Sonicare completely blows them away.  </li>
            <li>(the old models seemed to accumulate gunk and required constant maintenance).  </li>
            <li>My 2nd unit is about 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>would turn on but barely move.  </li>
            <li>and I developed gingivitis, and my teeth were not as white as they were.     </li>
            <li>(just pull it off &amp; snap it on), however I only ever had to remove the old one 2 or 3 times before it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Our old sonicare toothbrush recently died so we decided to upgrade to this one.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare moved the tuning fork from the head to the handle, which means smaller brush heads than on the old models.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that within about 10 minutes of starting the chat Philips determined that my toothbrush was still under warranty and sent out a replacement.  </li>
            <li>after 5+ yrs of using my old one every day, the battery finally stopped taking a charge</li>
            <li>and I have found that replacement bulbs can only be purchased from Philips by calling them directly (800-370-6369).  </li>
            <li>(the first time I was disconnected) with an average wait of around 20 minutes.    </li>
            <li>There are various settings for the toothbrush depending on how sensitive your gums are, or depending on what type of brushing you prefer.</li>
            <li>brush has bristles of various lengths that get in-between the teeth  and feel quite soft.  </li>
            <li>The motor is quiet on the Sensitive setting, and won&#x27;t wake anyone else up.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t bore you with the details (which you can read above in the item description), but really, you have just enough options not to overwhelm you, but to suit your every dental hygienic need (short of a root canal or cavity filling, but you shouldn&#x27;t need them if you keep using this thing).  </li>
            <li>Apparently they put money into designing these program modes but they don&#x27;t want you to use them.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they put money into designing these program modes but they don&#x27;t want you to use them.  </li>
            <li>The brush signals each quadrant change by a split second interruption in the brushing action.</li>
            <li>If you have never timed yourself brushing your teeth you might be surprised, sometimes 2 minutes can feel like an eternity, especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>So now Im back on track and need to get busy.</li>
            <li>no need to send the old one back.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of hating to use the Sonicare, and even returning to an old fashioned toothbrush, I contacted their on-line customer service.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when my dentist said I should buy a $120+ toothbrush but my sensitive gums weren&#x27;t happy with my harsh brushing.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to the old manual method of brushing after experiencing this technology.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use all the different \\&quot;modes\\&quot;- I have sensitive teeth but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode.</li>
            <li>The manual action of brushing teeth can get tiring sooner or later, leading to non-brushing.</li>
            <li>professional dental instruments consumers can not buy and this toothbrush is the only thing that comes close to the thoroughness of  specialized equipment.  </li>
            <li>There may be a dentist near you with the same attitude!</li>
            <li>and I only charged mine when it died since I travel quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>it was only 13 months old.  </li>
            <li>If you neglect to choose go care or max care, you apparently get 2 minutes of \\&quot;Clean\\</li>
            <li>I noticed the same thing when I started using the old model, so</li>
            <li>For nearly $200, I was expecting this toothbrush to last longer than 24 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My got old and started leaking, it was gross.  </li>
            <li>Philips will not replace the brush a second time, so I am going back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of companies that stand behind thier products - and I&#x27;ll be buying more Philips products in the near future.</li>
            <li>I know many were not happy with the non-replaceable battery.</li>
            <li>It was messy and didn&#x27;t seem worth the bother.  </li>
            <li>Yes, electric toothbrushes are by nature messy, but this one is worth the bother.</li>
            <li>this is that u have to take out the brush head and wash that thin metal + inside of the brush to make sure saliva/toothpaste etc</li>
            <li>Although that is an unnecessary embellishment, I thought what can it hurt to try it out for about 3% more money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I say everyone should own this toothbrush and won&#x27;t be sorry when they shell out the cash for one.  </li>
            <li>It lasted about two weeks on a full charge with both my wife and I using it twice a day (usually on the max care cycle).</li>
            <li>The other thing I do not like about this model in particular is that the rubber/plastic near the brush head  </li>
            <li>And so instead of just applying toothpaste and turning the unit on, I have to first move the setting down to MaxCare each time before turning on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this tooth brush after my first powerbrush broke down.</li>
            <li>Which leads me to my second and last complaint: the price is pretty high, particularly when you factor in the nonreplaceable battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with Sonicare, but will try the lower priced R710 -- same lightweight design &amp; ProResults brushes as the FlexCare, but under $100 (of course, you lose the extra modes, but I can live with that).</li>
            <li>In addition to the fact that I love my toothbrush, when the handle failed to recharge, I called Philips and, after getting all the pertinent info, they sent me a new handle in the mail.</li>
            <li>Knowing several new models have come out, I decided it was time to finally take the plunge and replace it.</li>
            <li>and I had to throw away the entire string trimmer or cordless drill after the battery could no longer properly recharge, or if Motorola&#x27;s cell phones did not allow you to replace its lithium battery and required you to buy a new cell phone after its battery wore out.  </li>

            <li>This new design has several internal attachment pieces that hold the metal rod in place.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve been a smoker most of my life and a heavy black tea drinker, and the Sonicare has removed all stains from my teeth.</li>
            <li>Mostly just annoying; the button should not have been placed here, or should not  be so easy to activate.  </li>
            <li>The only other electric toothbrush experiences I had before this were the $5 Colgate battery operated from Walmart and the Braun 3D Excel (a Consumer Report favorite a few years</li>
            <li>The pulse vibrations feel extremely different compared to my last toothbrush, the hold was ergonomically improved (though for a while I kept accidentally shutting off the toothbrush, as it&#x27;s very sensitive).</li>
            <li>and it works exactly like the previous model,</li>
            <li>Funny how Philips has no record of my previous exchange</li>
            <li>One nice benefit in changing to the very, very small travel charger was that I freed up some space on my bathroom counter, and the brush is easier to set down and pickup without the sanitizer being in the way.  </li>
            <li>One nice benefit in changing to the very, very small travel charger was that I freed up some space on my bathroom counter, and the brush is easier to set down and pickup without the sanitizer being in the way.  </li>
            <li>It was very large and not comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Flexcare brushheads seem to last just as long as the brushheads that came with the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>First, though, my teeth have been a mess for years.  </li>
            <li>Compared to any other toothbrush/sonicare, this toothbrush really just takes care of business.  </li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers, I have a real problem with plaque.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the battery in the Flexcare will last or whether the whole toothbrush will have to be discarded when the battery does finally wear</li>
            <li>But other than that I really like this flexcare.</li>
            <li>* Gunky buildup under the brush head, and it&#x27;s hard to clean in there  </li>
            <li>they can effectively clean the backs of my wisdom teeth which are usually hard to get to.</li>
            <li>The system and my trusted brand of toothpaste make my teeth feel so much cleaner than any other toothbrush I have ever used (manual or electric/battery operated).</li>
            <li>I have gotten 4 other people to buy it because I like it so much.    </li>
            <li>And the other quadrants collect food much faster than before.</li>
            <li>I usually upgrade every few years, and the last one to be replaced was one of the Sonicare toothbrushes which I also liked.</li>
            <li>The vibration and ease of using the brush is a little better than my previous brush, the Oral B, and it has different power and brushing options.</li>
            <li>It had treated me well, but the battery was no longer holding a charge for more than 60 seconds, and the heads were getting harder and harder to track down.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;downside\\&quot; is that older people (who have trouble keeping their hands somewhat steady)  can&#x27;t get the operation down very well.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend seeing your dentist after you have bought such a toothbrush; especially, if you have always used a manual toothbrush, as this is a big change and you have to transition to a new routine.     </li>
            <li>Unless it&#x27;s making you deaf or genuinely malfunctioning, I don&#x27;t understand why that&#x27;s a serious issue.  </li>
            <li>Some people have complained about the noise, but really - you are brushing your teeth - does it really matter?  </li>
            <li>This product has made such a big improvement in my dental health that I plan to purchase one for each of my adult sons.</li>
            <li>and we expected it to last much longer than 14 months.</li>
            <li>At the end of the time frame, the brush switches to a shorter \\&quot;gum massage\\&quot; action, then finally, there is a tone which is your cue to switch to a different area of your teeth, and the cycle begins again.</li>
            <li>The unit is actually longer than my old brush, but that&#x27;s not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that replacement brush heads are actually cheaper than on my old brush is a big plus.  </li>
            <li>The fact that replacement brush heads are actually cheaper than on my old brush is a big plus.  </li>
            <li>At my last dental checkup, the dentist said I had early gum disease and needed deep scaling/planing.</li>
            <li>As well as it works, for $175 canadian this thing is just not reliable enough, for that kind of money it should last at least a few years, not a few months.  </li>
            <li>This comes with a travel charger, but no second handle, and only a soft case.&lt;br /&gt;-My dentist doubts the need for the UV cleaner and advises people to buy the FlexCare without it.</li>
            <li>I am now back to using a regular old manual brush.</li>
            <li>I only used it for about a minute, gingerly pressing it to my teeth before pulling it back, and this was on the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li>another issue I have is that the timer is only for two minutes, though this is the case with nearly every electric toothbrush, two minutes is just not enough time for me.  </li>
            <li>My 12 yr old daughter recently started using it and her teeth are so white!  </li>
            <li>The main unit has a rubberized handle grip to help you hold onto it with wet hands</li>
            <li>The indicator lights are very straighforward (slow blink still santizing, fast blink done).    </li>
            <li>I have used a previous Sonicare model a few years ago, and most recently a Braun.  </li>
            <li>All of the other pluses mentioned by other reviewers are all true:  </li>
            <li>The sanitizer thing that comes attached is kind of weird- doesn&#x27;t seem that necessary to have</li>
            <li>I thought that was kind of standard for expensive</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s Sonicare of the same model broke down within the first year.</li>
            <li>When the back of the brush rattles against the other teeth (the ones opposite of the ones you&#x27;re brushing), it is not merely an annoyance, it can chip a crown.  </li>
            <li>First off, Its a little off putting to have a motor in your mouth</li>
            <li>The first was given to me as a gift a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li>My gums are pretty sensitive and prone to bleeding when I brush with a normal brush, but while I&#x27;ve had a tiny bit of sensitivity issues (no more than when I brushed with a regular brush), my gums have not bled once since using this toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve used the 3 minute max care (includes 15 seconds of gum massaging per quadrant) every time I&#x27;ve brushed.  </li>
            <li>Took a little bit to get used to the vibration.......and it sometimes tickles my tongue ;-)</li>
            <li>buying a new product of any sort will always have a negative environmental footprint, these new brushes are better than the old models due to their Li-Ion batteries, reduced bulk, and lower waste in the smaller replacement brush</li>
            <li>Like most people, I was taken back first by the vigorousness with which it brushed my teeth, but over time became accustomed to it &amp; my mouth felt dirty when I tried brushing it with any thing else but my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>, my only complaint is that the rubber bottom can get gross pretty fast if you are not diligent to keep it dry.&lt;br /&gt;And once a mold smell gets in that rubber, look out.</li>
            <li>I used the UV Sanitizer a few times, but I don&#x27;t use it at all anymore because of what I believe to be a very real problem with all the anti-bacterial products out there these days.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;d be weary of recommending this particular model; I&#x27;m not certain if they improved or corrected this design weakness with FlexCare Plus.  </li>
            <li>Once again in less than 2yrs the on/off switch malfunctioned and the sonic action was not operating normally.  </li>
            <li>With the FlexCare, I don&#x27;t work nearly as hard as I did with either of my other brushes, and I get a MUCH better cleaning from it.  </li>
            <li>To possibly improve my chances for toothbrush longevity, I rinse the brush head and toothbrush body briefly under running water after usage, dry it lightly with a hand towel, and flick it a few times to shake the excess water off the brush head.</li>

            <li>Then after 14 months the brushing mechanism became very loose to the point where I don&#x27;t think we are getting the same clean as we did previously.</li>
            <li>On the following Saturday when I was off work and had time, I contacted Phillips customer service via their online chat option, because I generally dislike talking to customer service over the phone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I got the unit, I notice that areas on my back teeth that are hard to clean (get plaque build up) are getting cleaner.</li>
            <li>I just charged it up every 2 weeks and it helped to clean those hard to reach areas like the back of your teeth and molars.     </li>
            <li>but it is no where near as loud as some of the other reviews make it seem.</li>
            <li>We like the idea that it has a number of different settings that can  be used to provide for sensitive teeth, regular cleaning, or deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I recently had gum surgery and found the sensitive mode to be helpful in starting back using the electric brush.  </li>
            <li>But, I believe now it is related to the poorly fitting toothbrush head not seated properly and snug on the poorly designed/or manufactured \\&quot;metal rod fitting\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li>Since it is so expensive, my husband and I would share the toothbrush and use our own heads (using the same head would just be gross.)  </li>
            <li>but I prefer manually brushing behind and on top of the bigger teeth in the back.</li>
            <li>So for anyone thinking of this as their first electric toothbrush, give this one a try for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>The first few times that I started using the sonicare</li>
            <li>She explained that they&#x27;re not like the little cheapie battery-operated toothbrushes you can buy in the grocery store right next to the regular Oral-Bs and Reach toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted only several months before it broke down.  </li>
            <li>It came quite earlier than expected and brand new!</li>
            <li>love the uv cleaner attached to the base of holder, so you always have a clean brush to insert onto the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Thsi toothbrush really cuts down on the placque.</li>
            <li>Just like your electric-shavers that broke down on me fast, so did your Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Really cuts down on the amount of toothpaste that I need to use (I did not get it for that reason).  </li>
            <li>The down fall of this product is really up in the air.</li>
            <li>and it is so simple and easy to use (I am no good at reading and following directions).  </li>
            <li>the amazon price was little bit higher when i purchased and now i see the same in walmart for 94$.</li>
            <li>I would have the same major gripes if Black&amp;Decker designed their rechargeable cordless string trimmer and cordless drills such that I could not replace those batteries</li>
            <li>I would have the same major gripes if Black&amp;Decker designed their rechargeable cordless string trimmer and cordless drills such that I could not replace those batteries</li>
            <li>Last September I bought the newer model, Sonicare Flexcare, with the UV light; it broke down in less than one year.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many of these things they sell and replace, but it&#x27;s hard to think of that sad lot of trash going into landfills just to keep our teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I mean, how cool is that?</li>
            <li>So I spent $176 plus the cost of replacement brushes on 2 defective handsets and they don&#x27;t even have the courtesy to reset the warranty for a new device.  </li>
            <li>Outside of the new design, the brush has a few new features, but nothing too noteworthy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>She responded that yes, it was closed and brand new...    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend going with anything other than this soniccare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It was ridiculous how clean my teeth felt, as if I just had them cleaned and polished at my dentist.</li>
            <li>This product replaced my previous (Oral B) and the speed of this toothbrush is much faster.</li>
            <li>Much lighter to hold than the previous Sonicare version.  </li>
            <li>I have not used the UV cleaner as much as I thought I would, and I am not going to get out a petri dish to test its effectiveness, but if it works half as well as the toothbrush</li>
            <li>The ProResults brush heads use what looks like half as much plastic.  </li>
            <li>Another issue is cleaning the Flexcare which is as much a chore as it was with previous models.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if the UV cleaner is really killing any germs but the cleaning action gets an A++.</li>
            <li>Really cleans your teeth as well as if not better than a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I can only hope this brush lasts me as long as my old one did</li>
            <li>Go care is a minute of the standard speed, which apparently is for those of you who can&#x27;t spare an extra minute to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Thin, long toothbrush allows for better reach.</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical that this would be worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and yes, they did send a replacement the first time but same thing happened again after a few months of using the replacement.  </li>
            <li>The default is like last years model in that it brushes for 2 minutes, broken up into 15 second intervals for top front, back, and bottom front and back.  </li>
            <li>To my relief, actually using the toothbrush was painless, although the first few times it tickled a bit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electronic toothbrushes (all battery operated) in the past, and never saw a compelling difference between using them versus the traditional &#x27;manual&#x27; toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good while it works, but it&#x27;s very expensive and should last longer.</li>
            <li>Sure it is a bit noisy, but the smart timer makes it impossible to brush incorrectly.</li>
            <li>Sensitive (toned down for sensitive teeth)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for nearly 14 years every single day</li>
            <li>It easy to use, once you read the Manual, but be careful not to push it hard against your teeth and gum.  </li>
            <li>Since you actually do NOT need to press the brush hard against the tooth and gumline surfaces, the brush does not wear out and get ragged as quickly as a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since you actually do NOT need to press the brush hard against the tooth and gumline surfaces, the brush does not wear out and get ragged as quickly as a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My one major nitpick is that I see absolutely no logic in designing the brush to have a non-replaceable battery (other than purely for Philips&#x27; marketing/sales purposes of planned obsolescence).  </li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re willing to pay $100+ for something that will only last you a few years, this toothbrush is for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually sanitizing the two brush heads, or if I&#x27;m even putting them on right, since they always seem to rest precariously on the pin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually sanitizing the two brush heads, or if I&#x27;m even putting them on right, since they always seem to rest precariously on the pin.  </li>
            <li>The shaft that the brush head mounts on came loose completely inside the product.  </li>
            <li>If you have big hands, putting the brush head into the sanitizer is more awkward, especially if you&#x27;re using the large brush head (FYI: the brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I just move it slowly back and forth, less than 50 strokes does my whole mouth), this isn&#x27;t a problem at all now.  </li>
            <li>(I just move it slowly back and forth, less than 50 strokes does my whole mouth), this isn&#x27;t a problem at all now.  </li>
            <li>I think some of the less expensive soniccare toothbrushes would do just as good of a job at a lower cost.  </li>
            <li>I found it tickled my palette almost unbearably the first few times, which has eased a little, and I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t be so bad once I get used to the unique and ticklish sensations.</li>

            <li>The system takes a little getting used to, but works very well.</li>
            <li>The other thing is the new brush head design.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty old fashioned, and the idea of getting a fancy toothbrush seemed ridiculous until I started getting some tooth decay and the dental bills arrived.  </li>
            <li>But based on our experience, it is tough to recommend it, especially given the pretty high price.</li>
            <li>I hate to give such a great product only one star, but to pay that much for something and have it last less than a year is inexcusable.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal really, but just another little challenge the ergonomic folks should solve before</li>
            <li>It is a little strange getting used to it at first, it \\&quot;tickles\\&quot; your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Now I bought the cheapest \\&quot;HealthyWhite\\&quot; (without the sensitive setting) which lasted a little over a year before making loud grinding noise (the head starts to wobble).</li>
            <li>This new Flexcare model is as they say, lighter, sleeker, smaller, but they did not mention its also louder than any other model.  </li>
            <li>This works fine, charges well, but I feel that the brush head is too large, and I don&#x27;t feel like it works as well as the small round brush on my previous toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>If you seriously thinkthat these corporations sit down and try to figure out how to produce the most efficient and durable product and thereby have your financial interest at hand</li>
            <li>I had the Intelliclen system I was happy with it in till I learned that sonicare no longer made brush heads for it what ever reason which was stupid but</li>
            <li>It worked amazingly for about two years on the dot, then mysteriously started acting crazy.</li>
            <li>, I can only say that some people clearly did not read the instructions carefully.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This system with the Sanitizer is the best one yet.   </li>
            <li> Flex care is the best.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend users couple the FlexCare along with the Waterpick Ultra Jet (another excellent product).</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes excellent mouthwashes that do not include alcohol or saccharin.</li>
            <li> I have perfect gums and perfect heart health, inspite of being overweight and sedentary.    </li>
            <li> And I want really excellent crud removal from between teeth, which I find inadequate with this unit.    </li>
            <li> Using a Sonicare twice a day preceeded by flossing, has resulted in perfect or near-perfect gum checks every dental visit.     </li>
            <li> PS, use the chat tool on philips website when you need your replacement, it is great!</li>
            <li> She said I was doing an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The quality of the equipment is excellent.</li>
            <li> Therefore, despite the inconvenience, I can \\&quot;wax eloquently\\&quot; about the excellent customer care I received.  </li>
            <li> The dentist was impressed with the results too.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li> an excellent concept!</li>
            <li> This is one incredible brush!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THAT awesome.</li>
            <li> Since my husband and I have both had sinus infections this winter, the sanitizer has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best option for healthcare thats been released yet.  </li>
            <li> This is the best oral hygiene you can buy without going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Brushing your teeth with this thing is like going in for a routine cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The impressive part of this product is the ultrasound cleaning of the brush itself!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The FlexCare 900 Series Sonicare was a perfect selection for me.  </li>
            <li> it is iffy at best.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is the very best.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll see what my dentist has to say on January 21 when I go in for my six month cleaning, but I already know it will probably be my best dentist visit ever.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best toothbrush I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> The brush design was the best improvement.</li>
            <li> It is the best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  </li>

            <li> Having said that, I will probably replace it with another one, since the results were so impressive.    </li>
            <li> Two brush heads included with two places to store them in the UV tank, therefore allowing two people to use one brush, which is awesome.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the best clinically</li>
            <li> Of course, sometimes what&#x27;s best isn&#x27;t always what&#x27;s practical.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go for the sanitizer option, it breaks after a couple months, but the brush itself is AWESOME.</li>

            <li> It works great for my husband and I.  </li>

            <li> Have heard about all the germs that are on your toothbrush so the sanitizer is a great feature.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the look of the product is great.</li>

            <li> be warned, it seems like a great product when it works, but if you have a problem there will be no support from the company.</li>
            <li> : Hello Jennifer, welcome to Philips Consumer Lifestyle.</li>
            <li> PLUS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am writing this review not just because it does a great job ..</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great, but there is an issue where the motor dies after a year or so.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is great, almost 2 weeks between charges.</li>
            <li> Has been great for my gums.</li>
            <li> Great investment for your money and teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for $40 from craigslist a couple months ago after hearing from friends how great electronic toothbrushes were.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have this item in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Packing was great.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports and ADA rating are great testimony....</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The UV Sanitizer is a great feature also.</li>
            <li> This works great and my dentist wanted me to buy an electric model from them until I told them I had purchased the Philips Sonicare</li>
            <li> The sanitizer also works great too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, this toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li> And your mouth feels great.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare gives you that \\&quot;dental cleaning\\&quot; great feel.  </li>
            <li> However, whoever is manufacturing these units are not doing a great job of quality control.  </li>
            <li> And, even without the UV, it&#x27;s great to have a place to stick your brushhead so that it&#x27;s not sitting out on the bathroom counter all day collecting flying bacteria from the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the one hand, it&#x27;s incredibly effective and, in my opinion, the best powered toothbrush out there.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade for an Elite Sonicare I happily owned for a year.</li>
            <li> Great Li-Ion battery: can recharge the toothbrush anytime without worrying about breaking the battery.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> great to take anywhere.</li>
            <li> cheaper brush replacements and the UV sanitizer are welcome additions.</li>
            <li> The design is great.</li>
            <li> A great buy to encourage thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> The variable settings are a great feature.  </li>
            <li> It is definetely a great buy.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was great until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It was a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Otherwise everything is great.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning results are great while there&#x27;s no harm to the gums.</li>
            <li> Great service, great 2-year warranty.  </li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  </li>
            <li> Either way, this is a great toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush...when it works.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>

            <li> I am so happy I bought it;</li>
            <li> Great buy...</li>
            <li> However, this product is great</li>
            <li> The truth is this piece is great.</li>
            <li> I wish we could avoid buying these toothbrushes but they are so great for your teeth.</li>
            <li> The product works great</li>
            <li> and now the fact that it is, makes me happy.  </li>
            <li> The two-week startup mode is a great feature, because this brush takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> The UV Sanitizer is great.</li>
            <li> and I am sooo happy I did.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a great investment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the front of the teeth</li>
            <li> The sanitizer works great</li>
            <li> The pro brush head is also designed well and it cleans great.  </li>

            <li> Great thing is that it has the travel charger for up to 220V.</li>
            <li> Greatly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I knew that dentists recommended them, but just couldn&#x27;t imagine what was so great about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The charging station is great, looks sleek and compact and there is a travel charger as well.</li>
            <li> : Performance is great.</li>
            <li> This is also great for my kids.  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonci care is really great.</li>
            <li> but here the prices are GREAT.</li>
            <li> This works great with no complaints.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Easily recommended, great toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Great buy for the health of your teeth and for convenience and brushing options.</li>
            <li> and I get great use out of the Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> But you get used to it, and my teeth look and feel great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I think it&#x27;s a great product when it works.</li>
            <li> It is great for my gums too.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d still buy one every year for $80 a pop because they work so great.</li>
            <li> The max care mode which includes brushing and massage works great.  </li>
            <li> I have not been happy with the 9400</li>
            <li> is great for travel.</li>
            <li> all is great.</li>
            <li> Dental checkups have been shorter too as the toothbrush does a great job of removing any buildup before it can become plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Brush still works great though</li>
            <li> The sonicare was delievered as ordered and works great.  </li>
            <li> and I end up drooling and getting toothpaste spatter all over the bathroom lol.</li>
            <li> this item has made my teeth so happy.</li>
            <li> ifferent colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush-</li>

            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, probably could do without the sanitizer part.</li>
            <li> Automatic timing and a reminder to \\&quot;switch\\&quot; locations is great.  </li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> Also the cleaning apparatus is a great addition.  </li>
            <li> Great product and a great price at Amazon.  </li>

            <li> I get especially important.</li>
            <li> Great results from this toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s been great,</li>
            <li> , just great</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s even better!!</li>
            <li> In the beginnig it worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> The travel pouch comes in very handy along with the brush covers.  </li>
            <li> Very good product for sure!</li>

            <li> Again this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Awesome investment!  : )</li>
            <li> This is the latest in that chain and continues to improve this excellent product.     </li>
            <li> The one we just tossed away was a replacement we received 6 months ago and it literally had a mind of its own - - it would turn on and off by itself when not in use and would wake us like an alarm clock!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Started spontaneously turning on sometimes to, like it&#x27;s possessed!    </li>
            <li> While all models have done their job better than anything else, this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li> love it as i get a thorough brush with the best results.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush, works great.</li>
            <li> The best of all: the feeling of \\&quot;dentist cleaned\\&quot; teeth makes brushing enjoyable.</li>
            <li> You will pay more for this product, but will be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It is really awesome being able to sanitize my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was good and I am quite happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Toothbrush with Sanitizer is an outstanding product and excellent value.</li>
            <li> For the time that it worked, it worked perfectly; my hygienist was always pleased.</li>
            <li> Even better still is the UV sanitizer - it&#x27;s WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li> Great brush, brushes my teeth good, massages my gums.</li>
            <li> You honestly cant beat a Sonicare!</li>
            <li> in all, I think it is the MOST WONDERFUL ITEM I&#x27;VE PURCHASED.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt wonderful, very clean.</li>
            <li> great brushes fit my handle well and are in perfect order.  </li>
            <li> That was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> I needed to call the company to set up the brush but customer service was pleasant and helpful.</li>
            <li> , it is well worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> IS RICH LIKE THE CEO OF Sonicare!!!  </li>
            <li> Currently I am very satisfied with the system and feel my teeth and gums get a great workout</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does a great job cleaning my teeth while stimulating my gums!</li>
            <li> UV sanitizer is an excellent idea and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with my experience in purchasing it from the Amazon website too because the process was easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it sounds like a great tool :)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years with very good results as asserted by my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> The LED&#x27;s are bright and show up well in a lit bathroom allowing you to choose your desired settings with ease.</li>
            <li> Good equipment</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, everyone I know has a sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if I had gum disease, or some disease spread by oral contamination, I&#x27;d think it was a good idea, but frankly?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.    </li>
            <li> Good as new.er I hope.</li>
            <li> Good reports from my hygienist since using this electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but seems to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> it does good job</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is much superior to the Oral-B we phased out.  </li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be a good sign.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be a good sign.</li>
            <li> The charging station is fairly compact and interfaces well with</li>
            <li> cause I just don&#x27;t tend to give things superior</li>
            <li> Works really good</li>
            <li> but it seems to do a good job.....</li>
            <li> One reviewer here said this item is teeth licking good</li>
            <li> One reviewer here said this item is teeth licking good</li>
            <li> I bought the FlexCare to replace my Elite, which I loved.  </li>
            <li> My much loved Braun NEVER worked this well.</li>
            <li> Battery life it really good also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that I like the Flexcare fairly well.  </li>
            <li> and I get a good even brushing on all parts of my mouth.     </li>
            <li> but since dentist recommended, thought it would be a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I took good care of the toothbrush, never dropping it, abusing, etc.</li>
            <li> so I guess this is a good indicator to let one know its been in use.    </li>
            <li> For years I used an Oral B product that I thought did a good job.</li>
            <li> Good product and a good value.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush before it died.</li>
            <li> looks good,   </li>
            <li> I have not had an electric toothbrush for years but this one seems to do a good job and our dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> my dentist told me that I was doing so good that he was going to change my cleanings to every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I ended up making my decision based on aesthetics and good price for this product.  </li>
            <li> SUPERIOR CLEANING.</li>
            <li> She believes the FlexCare does a superior job of cleaning.    </li>
            <li> The good again</li>
            <li> This is a good product that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Genetically I&#x27;ve been blessed with good teeth</li>
            <li> , she told me things looked really good.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads fit perfectly, and do not seem to get any gunk underneath where they attach to the unit.</li>
            <li> Might be good if you shared the brush AND the brush head.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this toothbrush, it gave me the cleanest brush I ever had without going to the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> I hope the results are as good as she(the dentist) expects.</li>
            <li> I chose the Sonicare Ultra Flex since it was fully featured, and amazon had a good price and rebate on it.     </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; mode is supposed to be the easiest on the gums but not as good with the cleaning</li>
            <li> but I have no idea if it is doing any good.    </li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I am a sonicare customer for life, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> It feels good on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> and I loved that it came with 2 brush heads rather then just one size.</li>
            <li> She said that they looked really good</li>
            <li> and I figured I could do just as good a job myself.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that this toothbrush does come with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> It arrived in time and was in good shape, just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Was good while it worked though.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
            <li> Good points:  </li>
            <li> The Sonic Flexcare product is superior to another electric toothbrush we used for years.  </li>
            <li> For a fair while, I just didn&#x27;t want to take this with me when traveling.  </li>
            <li> given it 5 stars because the quality and performance are so good, but you have to decide if you want to spend all that money on what, when all is said and done, is just a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Reeve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved every Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned,</li>
            <li> The battery holds a good charge (2wks from one charge) and I sanitize it once</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 stars because it was a good brush while it lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> she will make an exception to the warranty in order to maintain good customer loyalty.</li>
            <li> she will make an exception to the warranty in order to maintain good customer loyalty.</li>
            <li> Good day.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for</li>
            <li> A good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I know there are others out there, but why change a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good to have a travel charger, also.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare is good, but don&#x27;t bother with the UV sterilizer...  </li>
            <li> Makes mouth and gums feel good.</li>
            <li> I have always believed there are good things to spend money on and</li>
            <li> the grandkids both have braces, and they loved it.  </li>
            <li> I loved that toothbrush and never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with it because it cleans all of my teeth so well.    </li>
            <li> this was a superior product.  </li>
            <li> B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] cleans just as good</li>
            <li> The cylindrical shape of the toothbrush would be perfect to use with two high-powered (and widely available and inexpensive) 2700mAh</li>
            <li> The cylindrical shape of the toothbrush would be perfect to use with two high-powered (and widely available and inexpensive) 2700mAh</li>
            <li> but they claimed it wasnt good for that product.  </li>
            <li> Good investment.  </li>
            <li> Combined with good flossing and mouth wash</li>
            <li> Good product that all should be using.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never looked or felt this good.  </li>
            <li> I also like the idea of the timer so that you are getting a thorough cleaning..........almost as good as going to the dentist.....and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I just plop um on the peg, facing any direction and they fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> Loved it while it worked</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s doing a good job, and I like it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my teeth feel and look as good as if I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> The cleanness of your teeth and the massage in your gums are much superior.  </li>
            <li> All the information I found on  Philips Sonicare was good</li>
            <li> The number of options available with this toothbrush is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I almost gave up on this manufacturer even though I found it superior to the Oral brand brush.</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush</li>
            <li> It is the best I have found at keeping my teeth so amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job of leaving your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I bought another one because I found it at a great price, so hopefully I&#x27;m more successful with this one.</li>
            <li> This however, is an exceptional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy because I&#x27;ve had already a couple of oral surgeries and sure don&#x27;t want to go through it again.</li>
            <li> Great product, much better than the Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use the Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes We are very pleased with how well the toothbrush cleans  our teeth.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Then the hygienist whipped out a demo brush, a lighted model of teeth and gums and gave me a very interesting presentation.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It also is great for building healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My sanitizer is still working, and I am still very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> you have a great product...please make a more reliable product.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best one ever and totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service from Sonic.</li>
            <li> I think it was a great buy for the price &amp; the fact that I am taking much better care of my teeth by using it.</li>
            <li> Very elegant design, battery lasts about 1 month for brushing 2 min twice per day</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade to a Flexcare model and am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love the massaging settings, the cleaning settings are great.</li>
            <li> I also love the UV cleaner because it makes a great storage place for the brush head</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this toothbrush greatly</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than getting a great review from your dentist and this toothbrush will give you that satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very healthy because of them.  </li>
            <li> That, of course, is the quickest road to the dentist&#x27;s, a place we all know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after trying this toothbrush, I&#x27;m very pleased to know that the number of trips I will be taking to the dentist will soon rapidly diminish.</li>
            <li> LOL I am sure with time</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the switch.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be keeping his teeth very healthy and gums.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, thoroughly cleans your teeth and there are a couple of additions that make it just that much better.  </li>
            <li> Great dental checkups as well :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare FlexCare has a mind / programing of it&#x27;s own which for me is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush with easily accessible features.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the best brushing habits or the cleaniest teeth, but my dentist was amazed at how clean my teeth where after using this for 3 months! &amp;#34;Your teeth or extremely clean!</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I felt around my teeth and the gums felt great and very clean, even between the teeth without flossing.</li>
            <li> free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.used to holding the brush at the required angle, it cleaned my teeth wonderfully, but more of that in a moment.</li>
            <li> The original toothbrush lasted form many years and provided excellent checkups.</li>
            <li> I love the attached sanitizer, as I am somewhat of a germaphobe!</li>
            <li> The first one was great!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>

            <li> Add all that into the price, and it&#x27;s a winning combination!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> :) Cheers!</li>
            <li> Use the toothbrush for 4 minutes top and bottom and you will not have placque!</li>
            <li> Well I bought and tried and LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a Sonicare e-series for about a year before switching to the FlexCare model and I love it!  </li>
            <li> We just replaced them a month ago with this newer version and really LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush!  </li>

            <li> I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the ability to change modes, and to have a longer brush time if you want!  </li>

            <li> And yes, sure does make my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist!</li>

            <li> Top notch product!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re so glad that we did!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!    </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I feel better knowing it has the UV Sanitizing feature which kills 99% of germs on the brush head!      </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!  </li>
            <li> Great product, helps keep teeth and gums clean and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> so you will know how to use it, how you use it and make sure you get the best clean for your teeth.      </li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and the sanitizer is a great addition.  </li>
            <li> After brushing, the gums have a pleasant healthy tingling.</li>
            <li> two heads have been defective and they replaced the first but claim that there is no warranty on the heads!!!!  </li>
            <li> The Flexcare looked so great,   all was fine during the slower break in time,   but as soon as it was over, and it began going faster,  Now each time I use it, while brushing the brushhead keeps falling off ,  over and over again.   </li>
            <li> It reminds me of an Apple computer--almost a work of art; easy to use; very effective.</li>
            <li> Very nice feature and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel great after brushing (I like the massage setting), and I am very satisfied with the how clean my teeth</li>
            <li> life is amazing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s downright amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I just wish Sonicare would provide more brightly colored rings.  </li>
            <li> This is an Amazing toothbrush, with 40,000 strokes a minute</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing thing.  </li>
            <li> Plus the UV light to keep the germs at bay is a great thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this is an amazing gadget.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel amazing after I use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a week, I have to say the results are amazing</li>
            <li> This was amazing product i used.</li>
            <li> And if you are an Advanced user and want a simpler experience, the FlexCare models are great.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare support is also amazing-</li>
            <li> importantly, it does a great brushing job.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare Toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> but these things always break at some point and Philips Customer Care is amazing.</li>
            <li> toothbrush itself cleans amazingly well.</li>
            <li> which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I do wish this model came with two handles, but instead my wife and I just take turns and switch out our own heads.</li>
            <li> (but it&#x27;s nice to have one</li>
            <li> I think they best Option really is the Quad-placer</li>
            <li> and I both were looking for our own head but extras aren&#x27;t too pricey on amazon.  </li>
            <li> They do work excellently, however is Philips really making an outrageious profit on them?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably never use the 1-minute \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; option, but it&#x27;s nice to have if you&#x27;re strict about brushing after meals and take the brush with you on the go.  </li>
            <li> And a 2-year warranty is nice.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are slimmer, too, and the unit just has a nice, futuristic look to it.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a travel charger and a nice carry case, including plastic covers for the brushes.    </li>
            <li> When I want to use the massage setting, though, it is nice to have.</li>
            <li> you honest.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> (They liked the idea of the UV Sanitizer).</li>
            <li> Also provided is a handy travel kit with separate portable charger.    </li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;Go\\&quot; is really nice for between meals</li>
            <li> After rave reviews from family and friends that own one, I decided to purchase a Sonicare for myself.  </li>
            <li> The sanitizer is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> -UV Santizer helps to &#x27;warm the brush&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I was also very impressed with how fast the toothbrush showed up in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> Have a nice day.rse</li>
            <li> Have a nice day.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But, everyone has there own sense of perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when I travel, we both need our own unit.</li>
            <li> I see some nice improvements over that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I each own the Sonicare</li>
            <li> I just made sure I&#x27;d check the reputation of the seller which was good and ask them if the box was sealed.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of having my toothbrush sanitized evertime I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 times using it before I liked how it felt on my teeth.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of pricey</li>
            <li> The best part is probably the ease of cleaning, since the FlexCare model has much fewer crevices to trap the gunk.  </li>
            <li> The addition of the UV Sanitizer is quite nice.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is nice too, keeps the brush heads out of the way as well as sanitizing them.    </li>
            <li> Definitely better than manual brushing and surprisingly superior to the electric rotary toothbrush I had been using.  </li>
            <li> features on this unit all work as advertised, and are actually handy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> If the sanitizer does what it claims, it&#x27;s a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Nice to rotate them on usage.</li>
            <li> I really liked the sonic toothbrush until yesterday when it would no longer charge.  </li>
            <li> Ignore these reviews at you own risk.</li>
            <li> If you are not using it, it&#x27;s still nice storage for the 2 brush heads.</li>
            <li> In under 15 minutes the courteous and helpful representative walked me through a series of diagnostic problems attempting to pinpoint the source of the malfunction.  </li>
            <li> It kind of froze up...</li>
            <li> No biggie, actually a nice feature.</li>
            <li> Best price on line and and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> So, from time to time, I find the toothbrush spontaneously changing to an unwanted setting while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]I have owned Philips Sonciare toothbrushes before and always liked them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on co-workers comments and I have to be honest</li>
            <li> He is thrilled with its performance and the results.   </li>
            <li> Nice compact design for the bathroom and even a travel charger is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, I am amazed how effective the system is at getting rid of food between teeth that flossing didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> They basically told me to find my own source.</li>
            <li> I like almost everything about this product:&lt;br /&gt;Choice of settings: 1 minute setting is nice</li>
            <li> It seems twice as effective.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is excellent, but it is very noisy.  </li>
            <li> The biggest drawback is that it has its own timer on when to shutoff</li>
            <li> It is compact and the cord storage and travel charger are really handy.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the battery were replaceable.</li>
            <li> Draw your own conclusions on why Sonicare does not offer that technology.</li>
            <li> The travel charge is nice</li>
            <li> it is just as effective  in cleaning</li>
            <li> I researched this tooth brush and have been an enthusiastic fan for the 10 months since purchase.  </li>
            <li> Your Dentist is like your Mom and Dad:  really, they just want what&#x27;s best for you.  </li>
            <li> Battery life depends on how you use it, and the nice thing about the Sonicare is that you can change your mind any time:  </li>
            <li> The variable brushing speeds are a nice touch</li>
            <li> Then I realized I was the one suffering for my own pride here.</li>
            <li> so that is a nice option to have.  </li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice sleek look to its design - this is the toothbrush that George Jetson would be using before he starts his 3-hours-a-day workdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always use its MaxCare setting, a nice mixture of teeth cleaning and gum massage.  </li>
            <li> But along with the $8 replacement brush heads, I image that Philips is making a tidy profit from their premium Sonicare model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is a nice addition as well.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t had a cavity since....</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare rechargable sonic toothbrush and sanitizer is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> You still need to do bi annual cleanings with us, but I&#x27;m impressed at how much they have improved!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for two years now</li>
            <li> I really liked the Oral B</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t ask what kind of tooth brush I was using, and wasn&#x27;t offered a tooth brush after the visit.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush comes with a handy gauge that indicates its charge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to scraping my own teeth every couple of weeks.     </li>
            <li> I would have liked to receive a docking station that would hold 2 brush heads, as my husband and I both use one Sonicare and switch out the brush heads.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to be a good toothbrush, better than the Sonicare of 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> UV sanitizer is nice.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper Sonicare before this, the kind that use the twist on brush heads.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a great unit, well made, and totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!!!  </li>
            <li> The end result is a squeakly clean, refreshed mouth that feels great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s always taken pretty good care of my teeth, and am proud of a life-long record of (almost) no cavities.</li>
            <li> The ultraviolet brush head sanitizer is great for knowing that your brush head is clean every time you use it.</li>
            <li> Currently, I&#x27;m a happy owner of a diamond clean, which I purchased after this model stopped working.</li>
            <li> replaced an older model, was really impressed by the updates and options.</li>
            <li> My friend uses this and said her dentist said her teeth were basically clean of plaque and gums in great shape</li>
            <li> so I knew what I was getting: an exceptional toothbrush that cleans your teeth way better than a manual one does.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I always thought I was brushing good and that my teeth were clean until I tried this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> The customer service crew couldn&#x27;t be friendlier or more helpful - very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted something more hygienic, and am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The problem I experienced with this newer unit is the battery says full charge and it is running</li>
            <li> I did you have the perfect clean mouth and no bad breath.</li>
            <li> This is very handy for those of us who don&#x27;t always keep up as easily with the printed manuals, or who prefer to be able to text search the manual for the information</li>
            <li> Also, the new toothbrush sanitizer is awesome.</li>
            <li> Best part of the new design?</li>
            <li> The new one works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> : In this situation, my best suggestion would be to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, but honestly i don&#x27;t use the &#x27;sensitive&#x27;, &#x27;massage&#x27; or &#x27;Max Care&#x27; options</li>
            <li> I was back on the internet searching for my beloved Philips Sonic toothbrush, and found the best ever yet, yes the Sonic flexcare with UV sanitizer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good-looking, easy to use, does the job, and feels good.  </li>
            <li> It makes perfect sense to proactively take good care of your teeth/gums in order to prevent future issues.  </li>
            <li> Going with this system was a great choice, and I quickly grew accustomed to the feel.  </li>
            <li> Having the portable brushes made it easy for us and kept us in a good dental hygiene situation.</li>
            <li> The mode selection button presses very easily and you will wind up changing brushing modes while you are brushing.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the stand that recharges the toothbrush works well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> But this also makes it very easy to accidentally turn off when you are moving the toothbrush around and twisting your wrist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to use and comes with an informative instruction manual.</li>
            <li> Very strong, my teeth are already noticeably whiter  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is great since it means I always have a clean brush, and it also keeps the cat from chewing on it when I&#x27;m not home :-)</li>
            <li> Anyway, after a lot of work, my teeth are finally nice and healthy, and I bought this toothbrush - Philips Sonicare</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you love this warped and amazing logic?    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall definitely worth the great cleaning you get.  </li>
            <li> far as a toothbrush goes they are the best.  </li>
            <li> The best product by far.</li>
            <li> I liked the option to be able to set it on max care to get the teeth done and the gums massaged.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with how my teeth feel after using this plus the brush is so much better</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping this will allow me to drop one of the visits if the home cleaning is more effective than before.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping this will allow me to drop one of the visits if the home cleaning is more effective than before.</li>
            <li> The unit comes with 3 color-coded rings for households with more than one user, and a nice travel bag and travel charger.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s cost, when you think of how many in a family it can be utilized by, the cost is greatly effective.  </li>
            <li> It is clear that this is the best on the market and my dentist will attest to that statement.</li>
            <li> If this continues to perform the way it has so far I will be very happy.</li>
            <li> The best one so far.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Customer service was excellent and sent me a replacement with a postage paid return for the old brush</li>
            <li> It is by far the best toothbrush my wife and I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> This one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good to know that there is something in my bathroom that is 99% germ free.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizing system seems like a good idea, just put the brush head in, push a button and UV light cleans any bacteria on the brush head.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months and never had to use the sanitizer feature, so if you want to save the money, you can buy the lower model and still get most of the benefits.  </li>
            <li> The Flexcare was the best of all of them so far, both in streamlined design, charger size, dual-voltage capability and brush head design.    </li>
            <li> I have gone through everything from the old manual ones to the so called best electric ones from Oral B and Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was, by far, the best deal out there.</li>
            <li> When dealing with oral hygiene, I wanted the best and all the research pointed towards the Philips Sonicare for all the features it offers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have wanted one for 10 years but never knew how important it was till I read the reviews of others that had bought one and are now getting good checkups.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> The first year it worked great; all the features were nice and dandy.</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful product if you want to keep  your teeth strong and healthy, and to give you a smile that&#x27;ll light up a room!</li>
            <li> has a toothbrush type for strong or gentle, a massager, and best of all</li>
            <li> but even without knowing how to use those features, right out of the box (and after a charge) it works great.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy!  </li>
            <li> Called customer care and after making me take the bulb out (not that easy!) and replace it</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Still going strong!</li>
            <li> and I love, love, love them!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I bought their original electric toothbrush and loved it.  </li>
            <li> So definitely a good replacement for the original.</li>
            <li> Took the handle and brush on a 9 day vacation, no chance to recharge...and it worked flawlessly and powerfully the whole time!!  </li>
            <li> The good: Great cleaning, comfortable grip, the brush timer is very handy (although I think it should be programmed with times for chewing surfaces instead of just front and back tooth surfaces)</li>
            <li> It gives a real &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling, very smooth teeths to the tongue.  </li>
            <li> it has to be the most powerful sonicare Ive ever experienced with all the options as well ?</li>
            <li> Bought for my 12 year old son for him to brush better and has worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I knew this was a great selling prodeuct but wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> It works exceptionally well and is light weight.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job, my teeth feel as clean as when they are cleaned by the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its amazing, you can get the clean that you get at the dentist at home with this product!</li>
            <li> This is our first automatic toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but a great improvement over manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is great at first, but then breaks.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat stuff and my teeth feel great.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just as good as the other one - which means EXCELLENT.  </li>
            <li> is the best solution for brushing because it apparently does everything by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my First Electronic brush and i am happy that i had made the decision to buy this.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for a month now and gotten over the intense tickling it originally caused I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> work great for the first month.</li>
            <li> And the more i use, the more i enjoy brushing my teeth cause the sensation from the vibration seems like a good message.     </li>
            <li> It keeps my teeth bright and clean and I love the sanitizing ability.  </li>
            <li> And I find it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> dental and gum care are so very important.  </li>
            <li> I had delivery issues from the post office loosing my order and the replacement order went very smooth from Amazon though I had to call as the e-mail customer service needs some work.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; travel case is a joke, being that it is made from canvas and very cheap, I give it two stars.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; travel case is a joke, being that it is made from canvas and very cheap, I give it two stars.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and after each brushing session my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> It is an exceptional product, my dental hygenist always remarks how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> The brushes do stand up on their own on the counter, although they&#x27;re fairly easy to knock over.</li>
            <li> Brushing with the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush is a positive joy.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel as smooth as glass after using it, like you have just gotten out of the dentist, or better!</li>
            <li> The santizer is nice, very easy to use, and gives some confidence you&#x27;re keeping your brush head clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the new, slim, snap-on heads as a great improvement over those gunk-collecting screw top types.  </li>
            <li> The handle is also slimmer and more comfortable to hold, the design couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything is real easy to maintain and clean or replace parts from the diagrams provided.</li>
            <li> It has worked just fine and the automatic timer feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Talk about a HUGE difference!  </li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference!  </li>
            <li> Replacement love this product.</li>
            <li> If I can get 5 year usage, I will be pleased.     </li>
            <li> should I be going somewhere for more than a week).</li>
            <li> to help keep my teeth in top shape.  </li>
            <li> 2 1/2 years later and this toothbrush system is still working flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they kept that on there.</li>
            <li> So, I have to floss more diligently than I have in years now.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!nt.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but the Sonicare is much better.</li>
            <li> (it is more efficient to use the Sonic).</li>
            <li> The newer ones even more so IMHO.  </li>
            <li> Even the best of products occasionally have a quality issue, i.e. the proverbial \\&quot;Lemon\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush and the options it has.</li>
            <li> The one I have now is a HX6932 with the sealed top to keep the crud out.</li>
            <li> Did marketing do this on purpose to sell more units? ?</li>
            <li> I have owned four Sonicare toothbrushes over many years.  </li>
            <li> Love the benefits of using the Sonicare</li>
            <li> but I still love Sonicare toothbrushes, so I settled on four stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly glad I switched.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love the timer on it</li>
            <li> I love the UV sanitizer as well...</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s just a ploy to sell more brushes</li>
            <li> I doubt they cost more than a dollar to manufacture.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the most awesome toothbrush ever invented!  </li>
            <li> will be much better.</li>
            <li> They are as smooth as they are when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office!    </li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare multiple cleaning choices, the sealed brush/unit connection and brush cleaning system are  excellent feature improvements.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare brushes for years and love them.  </li>
            <li> We both love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Just sputtered on and off, no matter how many buttons I pushed, or curse words I called it.  </li>
            <li> Love it, need I say more?</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and my kids like to use it too.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I do love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> love the product.</li>
            <li> But then I read the review &amp;#34;Pay more for the better design&amp;#34; by College Jane</li>
            <li> I love the thinness and how light it is!</li>
            <li> My favorite?</li>
            <li> Love these electric brushes!just in case).</li>
            <li> i love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A bit over the top?</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly believe if everyone brushed with a toothbrush like this, dentists would lose a great deal of business!</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly believe if everyone brushed with a toothbrush like this, dentists would lose a great deal of business!</li>
            <li> Overall, awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> Somehow the seals around the top must have leaked.  </li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it has the UV sanitizer to kill off germs</li>
            <li> As to does it work, I think so, although my gums don&#x27;t feel that much better.  </li>
            <li> I really love the Sonicare toothbrushes and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Flexcare model now for 2 months and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely pleased with Amazon</li>
            <li> The additional colour rings to differentiate cleaning heads are perfect (the colours are pastel and not garish at all, in keeping with the overall design).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to take the more bulky UV sanitizer unit with</li>
            <li> I had not been to the dentist for many years so 6 months ago when I did go, I had a lot of dental work to be done.</li>
            <li> My old-school Elite was more reliable than this dog.    </li>
            <li> I Love Love</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare FlexCare is an outstanding purchase.</li>
            <li> My roommate was so impressed with my love of this toothbrush she purchased one for herself last week.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m getting a better cleaning;</li>
            <li> This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> I would of had one many years ago</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that they just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this product performs and the results.</li>
            <li> I like to hear from some more users of this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought 5 of these tooth brushes in November of 2010, kept one for myself, and gifted the others to my brothers and sisters.</li>
            <li> My teeth are cleaner and more polished, and my mouth feels cleaner along the gumline and in-between teeth.</li>
            <li> it would not die but thought I should get something more up to date.  </li>
            <li> more like 7 months and has ceased to function in the fashion already described.  </li>
            <li> This is the best possible way to brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the UV sanitizer and travel case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be able to see the results.</li>
            <li> , I guess I won&#x27;t be purchasing another sonicare unless I know they can make a better unit.</li>
            <li> Better for me with receeding gum problems.     </li>
            <li> It has a timer built-in, so you always brush for the appropriate time.  </li>
            <li> They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better.</li>
            <li> I still bought more of their products, because it&#x27;s just mo[[ASIN</li>
            <li> But, I won&#x27;t buy any more of Sonicare if their product ruin my teeth like their latest one.</li>
            <li> What a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> The two settings I use most often are the \\&quot;Go</li>
            <li> The sanatation devise is appealing, but think twice.</li>
            <li> the Sonicare is so much better.</li>
            <li> I recently had my teeth cleaned, and my dentist commented on how great my gums are doing!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better about this product is the UV storage container.</li>
            <li> We had a Sonicare before but after 4 years of using it, it gave up, so we ordered the latest model.</li>
            <li> : We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.&lt;br /&gt;Harry :</li>
            <li> but when the FlexCare came out it was recommended as even better as a stain remover ..</li>
            <li> Because I have had so many of the products over the years ..</li>
            <li> I should have known better that to buy anything from Philips.  </li>
            <li> and we love it.</li>
            <li> She is well pleased with it;.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should have known better, but I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> After 45 seconds of \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;massage\\&quot;, the Quadpacer signal indicated it was time for a change of location, as it did faithfully three more</li>
            <li> According to the booklet, the power will increase after this for 13 more brushings, by which time I will have grown to love the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let the charging process continue and play with it some more</li>
            <li> I agree with all of the reviews here, but there is one thing more</li>
            <li> I notice this when I am able to increase the power of my \\&quot;waterpik dental water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly one of the best thing I have for my personal use!</li>
            <li> I was going to the dentist to do a cleaning every 3 months for many years</li>
            <li> Just like Phillips, their sonicare is an extremely most valuable product.  </li>
            <li> It does cost more, but this is not about price but about the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> So what was $150.00 is more like $30.00 per person.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li> This is simply the best toothbrush ever!  </li>
            <li> Thought it was all okay</li>
            <li> I am going to try and check in with Sonicare and will update if things get better.</li>
            <li> I love every feature of this product.</li>
            <li> Better maneuverability in your mouth means better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaped/Curved bristles allow for better cleaning.</li>
            <li> I feel that the curved bristles here also give me better coverage on my teeth.</li>
            <li> am very happy with the 3 improvements above.</li>
            <li> We love the sanitizer, and although I could be giving it undo credit, there have been no colds or sore throats since we have been using it.  </li>
            <li> I love the slimmer profile and the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I love the way my mouth and teeth feel after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and we both love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the Sonicare by Phillips.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare does a better job for me than any of the competing products.  </li>
            <li> and I love the UV sanitizer-</li>
            <li> The toothbrush holds an ample charge, the brushing settings are okay they get the job done.</li>
            <li> My gums love the message setting.</li>
            <li> Since I am so used to buying on Ebay, I continued my search with them and finally ordered the one I was sure was a best buy.</li>
            <li> , they were pleased with my choice as well as I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My 3 children (ages 11, 10 &amp; 6) also use it, they love it as well.  </li>
            <li> And I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a lot of money for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Buying it is a better investment than any tooth-whitening product.</li>
            <li> I have been a very happy Oral-B (Braun) user for about the last 4 years.  </li>
            <li> These accessories will make traveling with my brush much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never understood why more electric toothbrush makers don&#x27;t include or even make these</li>
            <li> Although, removing and attaching the brush head on the Flexcare wand requires a lot more force, which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope that you have better luck.  </li>
            <li> I hope that you have better luck.  </li>
            <li> and/or throwing away so many toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> , one would think they would have better addressed the durability issue by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And I must say, this product has everything I missed from the last one: it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I believe it is better for the battery to \\&quot;cycle\\</li>
            <li> I am extreemly glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I also am as always, pleased with Amazon&#x27;s pricing as well as the prompt service.    </li>
            <li> It is so much better</li>
            <li> in that it cleans my teeth better and it has a charge indicator</li>
            <li> The blue indicator is excellent for someone like me who forgets when to change out the head.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my decision and can&#x27;t imagine going back to handbrushing.</li>
            <li> Having the sanitizer makes me feel better about my toothbrush and its cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably mostly me just needing to change my grip on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li> My latest purchase was this FlexCare with sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> Like most places, your warranty date doesn&#x27;t reset when you get a warranty replacement.      </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Not terrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several versions of Sonicare, and this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> everything is better.</li>
            <li> I may be glad it has a 2 year warranty.      </li>
            <li> Assuming it turns out to be reliable, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I called Philips and had to wait many months for a replacement handle.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve love the sonicare products and have used them for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush now that I am used to it.</li>
            <li> As someone else noted the beep between quadrants is more of a pause</li>
            <li> Love  the Sonicare Rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Guess I won&#x27;t be buying any more $30 replacement brushes for this $130 unit.</li>
            <li> UV Cleanser is an OK gimmick, not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the dentist will say brushing twice a day would make life even better.</li>
            <li> was the best and the only one they sold and told me to switch to oral B.</li>
            <li> The Philips sonicare flexcare heads are better shaped</li>
            <li> I have a mold allergy &amp; this downside prevents me from giving it any more than 1 star.</li>
            <li> I love the UV sanitation and always worried that my toothbrush was in an environment that would collect germs.</li>
            <li> If something can be done about it, pls contact me at hibridr@me.com , would love to change my view on this service.</li>
            <li> If you are a gadget junkie and want the lastest OK, if not just get the value priced unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because of so many 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> It gathered a lot of distgusting gunk under the top so when newer models came out with the snap/slide on brush head, we traded up.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It really tickeled, and I LOL.</li>
            <li> I tell you, your whole day, no matter what you eat, afterward, your teeth will feel great.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a superb electric toothbrush, my mouth feels like it does after a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> The ultraviolet cleaning is a thoughtful addition and maybe especially useful for families.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re paying a lot more up front, and you get to keep paying more every time you buy replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> make sure you register it when you buy, so you can get the replacement if it breaks within 2 years.</li>
            <li> I did not do this thinking it will be OK.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I love the sanitize uv feature.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I follow the directions and seem to do a much better job of it.</li>
            <li> I orderded my sonicare here two weeks ago, and I ve been enjoying brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even take the UV recharger on most trips.  </li>
            <li> I love it otherwise</li>
            <li> During this time, we&#x27;ve owned many models.</li>
            <li> After purchasing one, I purchased two more for my mother and sister.</li>
            <li> Okay I love, love, love this sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush with Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a wedding present &amp; one of the best ones I received I might add.</li>
            <li> Give it to yourself as a healthy treat!price tag, but if you can get it</li>
            <li> I love the soniccare toothbrush with sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gumshave never felt better.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I  made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> the design is sleek and I love the UV sanitizer for the heads..</li>
            <li> I made the move and glad I did it.</li>
            <li> and I love how I can take the toothbrush with the included travel charger and throw it in my bag knowing</li>
            <li> ok, so i NEVER</li>
            <li> i just make sure to change into my day clothes AFTER brushing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly more cumbersome to travel with.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure will cost more than the 2 buck ones at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I would expect something that works for more then 1.5 years.  </li>
            <li> I love using the massage feature at night</li>
            <li> Also, at Amazon I was able to get this model with the UV brush sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> That can get pricey if more than two people use it.</li>
            <li> but this toothbrush does a better job than I ever did.</li>
            <li> What surprizes me most is that I&#x27;ve even noticed a decrease in \\&quot;morning breath.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the more I think about it</li>
            <li> I love that the sanitizer cleans the brushhead after each brush.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I try a sonicare brush for an even better cleaning.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Oral \\&quot;B\\</li>
            <li> I have to admit I love this toothbrush for all of the reasons listed in these comments.</li>
            <li> I even replaced the toothbrush head thinking this might make it work better.</li>
            <li> We have noticed better reports each time we go in for cleaning.</li>
            <li> love the Sanitizer feature and the thinner size of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> and I saw this model and thought I might like it better.  </li>
            <li> but the brush helps to keep my gums in better shape.</li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
            <li> I am brushing my teeth more often and for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> although this comes with 2 brush heads, i imagine most people will end up using the compact one all the time.</li>
            <li> We are really enjoying this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is my favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help of think it might be better for PR and the bottom line to up the engineering or construction.</li>
            <li> I love being sure that my toothbrush is clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> mounted to the more stationary charger.  </li>
            <li> I got the FlexCare and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I used to have the AA battery operated e3000 which is a sure \\&quot;self-destructor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I also find myself flossing a lot more too...</li>
            <li> I used to use an Oral B battery operated but this is so much better.</li>
            <li> I hope it continues to perform well for many yrs.</li>
            <li> I tried more threadlocker, but it didn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the money this cost, it should have been better designed and lasted a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a sonicare for several years now, and I have always been impressed with the level of performance.</li>
            <li> so it dries out better.</li>
            <li> I almost would have preferred a beep, but this works ok.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting addition to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (I am an efficient brusher manually, but it just does a better job.</li>
            <li> I will be a lifetime user unless someone else makes something even better...</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice 3 light battery level monitor.</li>
            <li> love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shawn: I aapologize for the inconvenience and will be glad to assist you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shawn: I do understand your concern Ryan, I wish I could help you more on this</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my cleaning visits to the dentist alot shorter.</li>
            <li> Love the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> I have been using some version of the Sonicare toothbrush for many years...</li>
            <li> One more point:  </li>
            <li> I love the built in sanitizer.</li>
            <li> If you use it your gums and teeth will love you.</li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I was told about 2 weeks ago I had to get a better toothrbush or else by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I make sure I take care of them too.</li>
            <li> They are, in my opinion, top notch</li>
            <li> This newer model is not recessed, and as per the manual&#x27;s recommendation, you should wash out the bottom of the brush and the top of the handle (where you attach the brush).</li>
            <li> I just heard the newer models were better and opted to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I was also pleased to see it comes with two charging cords.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I bit the bullet and bought it.</li>
            <li> Cleans better than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve every had.</li>
            <li> I love to brush my teeth with this tooth brush....</li>
            <li> I also love all the features it has.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read research that this may be more of a gimmick than anything else, but nonetheless I like the ability to \\&quot;quarantine\\</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this Sonicare</li>
            <li> and my teeth are already whiter, and they feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically more no-nonsense than that</li>
            <li> I get better ratings on my dental cleanings and checkups</li>
            <li> My dental check-ups have been much better since I began using this toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a travel case and sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Assuming that the newer model must be better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> As it is, all they respect is your wallet and want you to buy more when it dies.</li>
            <li> LOVE the timer feature</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the multiple programs that let you know when to change sections in your mouth and then automatically turns off it is awesome.</li>
            <li> I also love that I know my toothbrush is sterilized after every use.</li>
            <li> My teeth have felt cleaner and my dentist is a lot more complementary of my teeth these days.</li>
            <li> Better performance, love the sanitizer unit to use, and the battery does not want to die.  </li>
            <li> much better job than manual brushing</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li> I always need more than the 2 minute timer allows-</li>
            <li> I love gadgets</li>
            <li> And I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> better it reminds you how to brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt better after a brushing, even with the Oral B electric brushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the sanitizer feature too.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is timed and shuts itself off once you are done.  </li>
            <li> I think I do a better job of brushing with that feature.    </li>
            <li> love how this thing cleans!&lt;br</li>
            <li> In this age where too many people throw too many things away, and where our nation&#x27;s landfills are increasingly cluttered with plastic grocery bags and plastic water bottles being thrown away, this is a disposable product that could have been designed to not be disposable.  </li>

            <li> I have to admit that yes the sonic power &amp; sound kind of scared me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sonicare as a replacement to a Braun product which has seen better years.  </li>
            <li> It takes some time to get used to, about a week or so, but after that you will love it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are much more joyous with this.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush but found out a couple of things along the way.  </li>
            <li> I really love my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> :) Now I&#x27;m purchasing one for my nephew and parents.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s because of the Sonicare, but I&#x27;m sure it helped.</li>
            <li> It does need occasional cleaning, but it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> and I love that it comes with a travel charger.</li>
            <li> 6 months later I got the best checkup I have had in years!!  </li>
            <li> My teeth have been cleaner by using this magical device for a year.  </li>
            <li> I love how it has a place to store the heads when not in use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Then the inside breaks along with the timer - well, that happened to me, then I googled the problem and found it happen to many folks who purchase this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would like you replace the toothbrush or even better refund my purchase (</li>
            <li> and I was confident that The Phillips name would assure quality.</li>
            <li> Dental check-ups have been much better over 4 yrs without need for scraping with the hook.  </li>
            <li> A nuisance but love the toothbrush otherwise.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice compact charger and a light to let you know when it is almost time to recharge it.</li>
            <li> Overall, she thinks it is great and of good quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free!</li>
            <li> One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This will fit in my luggage nicely and the weight is negligible.</li>
            <li> I replaced my Oral B toothbrush with this one after many years.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for many years.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I am impressed that a corporation the size of Philips actually listened to its customers.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anything more for a toothbrush ...</li>
            <li> I love the idea of it, and I hope that it is truly keeping my toothbrush germ-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> particularly love the massaging function on the toothbrush, designed to prevent gingivitis by massaging the gums.  </li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many times</li>
            <li> course, I&#x27;ll be better able to report on this area in a year, but the product seems sturdy and built for long-term use, unlike some hardware which feels more like</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, and find myself extremely satisfied with all of its parts and features, as well as the results of brushing with it diligently for almost three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I think that is a question better answered by looking at your own budget and how important your dental health is to you.  </li>
            <li> I think that is a question better answered by looking at your own budget and how important your dental health is to you.  </li>
            <li> most people, this unit is overkill - but it is well thought out and works well for its intended function.</li>
            <li> Customer service is top notch.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many reviewers, aside from the cosmetic durability, I had no problem with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> - I would love if Philips would launch a simplified model.</li>
            <li> It also has a softer cover for better grip.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist and I am glad they did.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The FlexCare has so many positives.</li>
            <li> more streamlined and not prone to gunking up.    </li>
            <li> There is more functionality and the battery life after each charge is longer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this toothbrush about one month ago here on Amazon and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month now and love the results.  </li>
            <li> , there are color coded rings for each brush so more than one family&lt;br /&gt;member</li>
            <li> Their cleaning capabilities is second to none and they are an excellent choice for teeth and gum health.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> I charge it once a week, otherwise it lays on my vanity counter top with the brush covered.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with its performance in those areas.    </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning this toothbrush provided when it worked.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it one more try</li>
            <li> When you pay $125 for a toothbrush you expect to get more than just 2-3 years out of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Sonicare from my dentist, many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Used appropriately during that time...never dropped or abused.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush, but at this cost, I expect a longer life.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sonicare electric toothbrush for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had Sonicare toothbrushes for years - but I really love this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought the newer model in July 2011 and liked it very much and especially liked the new design which keeps gunk from accumulating in the head.  </li>
            <li> The switch to change the brushing options is right where anyone with a good sized hand is going to hold the thing.  </li>
            <li> so much I went for this model as it has the massage feature for the gums (love this!!).</li>
            <li> The best part of the FlexCare are its 5 timed brushing options: 2 minute clean, sensitive, massage,</li>
            <li> It is also nice to know that your toothbrush is clean every time with the UV cleaner.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice to have a way to clean the gunk that collects in the spaces in these brushes&#x27; handles and to sanitize them.  </li>
            <li> The UV cleaning system is good too, I have seen too many TV shows that tell us how much bacteria are on our toothbrush!</li>
            <li> each use and are nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made well, comes well-equipped, has a lot of settings to choose from, and most important, it seems certain to do a great job keeping your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> The regular mode gives you plenty of time for each quadrant and the quick clean is perfect for that hurried morning, it still gives a good and still has quadrant timer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it because it makes my teeth feel so squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> I love how clean your mouth feels after you use it!  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this; and after a follow-up I was told my teeth were very clean +</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after brushing -</li>
            <li> After every brushing, your mouth feels very clean...</li>
            <li> &quot; but I am conscientious about getting my teeth very clean, and with a manual toothbrush, I was damaging my gums because I could not refrain from brushing too vigorously.</li>
            <li> gets very clean if used correctly,   *  sanitizer,   </li>
            <li> However, I found my teeth never felt very clean</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean almost like a dentist has cleaned them.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Very clean and neat.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very light and easy to manipulate in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, Philips customer support is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Braun electric toothbrush for many years and was recently convinced to buy a Sonicare based on an article I read and my sister-in-law&#x27;s assertion that it is the best home cleaning devise available.</li>
            <li> All in all, the Philips FlexCare is a remarkable product, very well-built and well-thought out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush, and look forward to using it for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> but still kind of cool</li>
            <li> I had my first Sonicare for 6 years..and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The timer function is nice because it forces you to break up your mouth into 4 quadrants and brush every area for a full 2 min which is what is recommended.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone interested in getting good checkups and saving your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> is probably the first thing you&#x27;ll notice if you&#x27;re coming from an older Sonicare handle, and it is a very welcome improvement.  </li>
            <li> so I gave my dad the original one, which he still uses today!  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was to replace our original Sonicare that lasted for 14 years!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been getting perfect check-ups from the dentist within months of using it so long ago!</li>
            <li> GREAT NEW PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because it really is a great toothbrush when new.  </li>
            <li> Great are also the features on this new brush.</li>
            <li> The new one featured here handles both 120 and 220V. Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I upgraded to the flexcare I found the new features to be great.  </li>
            <li> new heads are great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UV Sanitizers for toothbrushes are relatively new to the market, and a great idea.  </li>
            <li> The quick 1 minute choice is nice at times, but others times I take advantage of the longer 4 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li> I find myself using it more times throughout the day because it is so easy</li>
            <li> so its easy to travel with  Sanitizer makes sure you&#x27;re not spreading filth on your mouth  </li>
            <li> one is much more sleek and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Philips could make any number of paths to improve the consumer experience here, including: inclusion of better batteries with longer lifespans, and/or a longer warranty of the battery, and/or redesign to allow a consumer easy replacement of the battery.  </li>
            <li> The Flexcare model is not advertised by Sonicare as \\&quot;Healthy whitening\\&quot;, but I have a strong feel that eventually my teeth will soon become a shade or two brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the three settings and the carrying case makes it easy to take with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean the teeth better and the multiple brushing modes are great!  </li>
            <li> Having used the toothbrush for a while now, I find it refreshing, stimulating, and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]This is absolutely the best of all-bar none and was very affordable.</li>
            <li> Also, and perhaps most important, is that it feels like it cleans my teeth better than my Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Unit is easy to clean too and the Sanitizer is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I could get by with one setting, as the great sonic action seems to be the most needed feature.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use - like that everything can stay clean with the toothbrush covers and the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re okay with buying a new sonicare every two years, go for it, it&#x27;s an absolute awesome brush when it works.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as they do when the dentist does them!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel incredibly clean!</li>
            <li> It give you that \\&quot;clean from the dentist\\&quot; feeling at home!</li>
            <li> It leave my teeth feeling so so clean!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using and the machine does all the work!</li>
            <li> Each brusshing feels like dentist clean!    </li>
            <li> We are clean people, I swear!</li>
            <li> When it came time to use it, I felt like the Oral-B didn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all!</li>
            <li> At first, I was unsure how much better it could be than the normal frayed sassafras branch I had been using, but now that I own it I can say its pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> As a physician I&#x27;m very aware that healthy gums are one of the most important things for HEART health, too!  </li>
            <li> This model has a great design and really gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great when it works and really gets your teeth and mount clean.  </li>
            <li> but it really does do a great job in getting his teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I think five plus years of daily use is very good.</li>
            <li> Carefully crafted to give you best qualitity instrument.</li>
            <li> The thing looked great, felt good in my hand and seemed powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Speed feature great for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Alternatively, the Triumph is Oral-B&#x27;s \\&quot;Most technologically advanced toothbrush.\\</li>
            <li> and I can already see my teeth becoming whiter from its use.</li>
            <li> Brushes enter comfortably between teeth, and the 30-second intervals are well fit for the the cleaning!</li>
            <li> The rear of the handle is rubber backed which is perfect when you&#x27;ve wet hands after your cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  </li>
            <li> I think that Sonicare did a great thing to upgrade the systems, but they are not as durable and practical as the old ones.    </li>
            <li> ok, so i lucked out and got to try this out free as a bzzz reviewer.  </li>
            <li> my old Sonicare and the gum massage setting makes my mouth feel great when I have a minute extra.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is clearly an evolved product (or is that intelligently designed?)    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Electric toothbrushes are fantastic, but technology must exist to manufacture more reliable motors and mechanisms.</li>
            <li> In my opinion UV light is not sufficient to kill as many microorganisms as they seem to claim.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more secure.</li>
            <li> got this for christmas and so far seems to work great.</li>
            <li> and I liked that even more that the first one that I had.  </li>
            <li> I primarily kept it in the shower mostly out of the water&#x27;s reach</li>
            <li> I really wonder if these are good for your gums.</li>
            <li> I also used a Crest Spinbrush, and didn&#x27;t really find it to be nearly as good as the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> I loved the Braun and I loved that it lasted so long with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> As soon as I turned it on, I couldn&#x27;t believe that I loved it so much, it felt like, and sounded like an antique in comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush plus UV Sanitizer whole system looks good on the shelf when it is charging.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth price and also looks nice on the counter.</li>
            <li> gums\\&quot;, and \\&quot;I&#x27;m really in the mood for a good gum massage\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This product exceeds my expectations and really does a good job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, it would be pretty easy to share this toothbrush with someone else, assuming you have your own brush head :)    </li>
            <li> The best part is that I spend less time brushing and get a much better result.</li>
            <li> the best of my previous purchases because it is slimmer, has more brushing options and has a disinfecting process.</li>
            <li> However, the toothbrush is excellent and a lot better than my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The full size is much too large for me, but works perfectly for my husband.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and very clean.  </li>
            <li> This model builds on their Philips&#x27; expertise, and works even better than the original models.      </li>
            <li> I had the original sonicare which served me well for many years till the electronics quit.    </li>
            <li> Sweet!)  </li>
            <li> The mode button is actually more readily accessible than the on/off.  </li>
            <li> We have had other Sonicare products and this is the best yet.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m very, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare electric brush and I must say I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Beyond the excellent reviews, this brush has a small head perfect for my mouth, and it is smaller and lighter.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the compact brush and the other is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> for over 6 months, I am now a true believer!</li>
            <li> This is the best money I have ever spent on any household product!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have also mentioned that the brush heads need to be perfectly aligned in the sanitizer for the door to close, but I have never had an issue of them not being \\&quot;aligned\\&quot; correctly.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, really leaves our teeth clean and the dentist has noticed a significant difference as well.</li>
            <li> It can easily go a week between charging (even now), and I&#x27;ve never needed the travel charger that it comes with</li>
            <li> It gives you more time to massage your gums or clean additional places, I guess.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed how easy this toothbrush is to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> A great product that actually has us brushing more than ever.</li>
            <li> BUT the control buttons are too easy to press accidentally.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel so clean, and you get better dental visits.</li>
            <li> Made to resist toothpaste build-up, it is easily removed for cleaning/sanitizing.</li>
            <li> It is truely one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put a lot of toothpaste on your brush, and make sure you have it in your mouth before you turn it on (otherwise expect to clean up toothpaste on your walls or wherever).</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for about 6 years and love how clean it gets my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and love the just from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Then I started reading the reviews, and some people said that the Healthy white tooth brush is a defective model and the flexcare plus is a great one to get.</li>
            <li> The on/off and mode buttons are easy to use and understand.</li>
            <li> I use my brush, then easily remove the brush head from the brush and put it in the sanitizer, close the door and hit the on/off button.</li>
            <li> The brush easily pops on and off the handle without any difficulty.</li>
            <li> And she said they can simply get your teeth cleaner than even the most experienced and dedicated manual brushing.    </li>
            <li> I have used various Sonicare products for many years and been happy with them ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to set up and easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to charge, easy to keep track of which brush</li>
            <li> WELL-MADE, EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to share.</li>
            <li> I have found NONE of these flaws and, if used correctly, the unit is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have found NONE of these flaws and, if used correctly, the unit is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This brush has a easy to wash handle that doesn&#x27;t have any crevices to collect junk.</li>
            <li> But if it can help save me from dental work, which could easily run into the hundreds or thousands even with insurance, then so be it.</li>
            <li> He said it will clean my teeth much better than a manual toothbrush and prevent my gums from receding.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is a lot better with this design as well.  </li>
            <li> The brushheads are easy to remove and install.</li>
            <li> then the units before it which made the clean feeling even better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, despite being packed with features.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> As far as cleaning teeth, it does an amazing job and the UV sanitizer is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> i think the dual brush unit from costco is a better deal for the same money, but this is a great brush.  </li>
            <li> it was an easy fix to slide the guts out, put superglue on the post hole and then re-install the head piece.  </li>
            <li> though there are bells and whistles associated with this toothbrush, the instructions are easy to read and inderstandable to the electonically challenged, of whom I am one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is also a UV sanitizer for sanitizing the brush head after each brushing that is easy to use and also a carrying case for the toothbrush when you travel.</li>
            <li> I find it too easy to press the button that changes the cleaning mode while holding the brush.    </li>
            <li> Brush seems to clean better than manual brushing</li>
            <li> Recoment this product, easy to take with you to Europe and use in 230 outlets.  </li>
            <li> It also is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love how clean sonic brushing is for the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Use is easy and I like the sanitizer also.  </li>
            <li> easy fix unplug it.</li>
            <li> toothbrush will start you off easy.</li>
            <li> It was easy to feel the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Electric Toothbrush is easy to use and thorough.</li>
            <li> As many reviews mentioned, this cleans great and the regular toothbrush is no match for this one.</li>
            <li> keeps my teeth and gums healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> If I hold the device the way that I&#x27;d like to, my index finger too easily brushes against the mode button and the mode changes.  </li>
            <li> it easy to use?  </li>
            <li> Easy on the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Easy on the mouth.  </li>
            <li> We clean the handle after every use and love the UV cleaner.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are easy to get.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt much more clean with this newer one.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is easy to use and I like the UV sanitizer unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived, the packaging was surprisingly easy to break through, and I set about to charging it for 18 hours...</li>
            <li> The Oral-B brush I used before just vibrated, this tooth brush seems to be a much more precise and advanced movement that vibrates with purpose.</li>
            <li> Clean&#x27; is the 2 minute option, that I use most often. &#x27;</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t change it as easily as I can now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can rest easy now</li>
            <li> to use - I adapted easily to the button functions on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Durable</li>
            <li> I adapted easily to the button functions on the unit.  </li>
            <li> - I would love a battery (double AA) operated model since I travel a lot, and it&#x27;s great not to have to worry about voltage and outlet compatibility (and not carrying a charger).  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s easy to accidentally press the power button while brushing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that the brush heads stay inside the UV cleaner when not in use, which keeps them clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves mouth feeling more clean and</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using electric toothbrushes for years as I feel they are far superior to manual ones.</li>
            <li> This is a really good model and compared to the older Elite:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Rate a strong 5.</li>
            <li> Had mine for about two years now and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it is still running strong.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very STRONG and something to get used to at</li>
            <li> As I get older I find the superior dental care</li>
            <li> And if you can get the Special Edition with 2 handles, even better.  </li>
            <li> It was the best deal since I would&#x27;ve had to get extra replacement heads right away with the Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> The brush works great, Phillips will stand behind it for two years and the service reps are good: after that you are on your own.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush now for 2 weeks, it is true what most people are saying.</li>
            <li> I switched to the compact brush head and it fits my mouth much better than the full sized one.</li>
            <li> you are using this kind of toothbrush for the first time, it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Since this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, I have nothing to compare the Philips Sonic Toothbrush to excecpt the old-fashioned kind of toothbrush and a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> It was rather interesting feeling but not painful.</li>
            <li> but this time let it charge for a full day hoping that it needed more juice.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush, is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> I must say that sonicare has to  be the best toothbrush out there hands down.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this new sonicare, I loved it!  </li>
            <li> But really, nothing beats the felling of nice clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Product just as described... does a fantastic cleaning job &amp; the UV sanitizer is so cool!</li>
            <li> It seems to me that this unit cleans tooth surfaces just fine, but that is not what I use an electric toothbrush for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to use, my teeth and gums feel cleaner, stains are gone and it is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is fine.  </li>
            <li> Then this instrument will work just fine for you.</li>
            <li> All seem to work just fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine...</li>
            <li> When the unit I purchased arrived I found that one of the two brushes was fine</li>
            <li> On top of all that, the small UV chamber in which you store your brush-head during the day is an excellent idea.</li>
            <li> The brushes are light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The battery works just fine</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve had my electric toothbrush for 10 years and it still works fine&#x27;.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts even one half of that time, I would feel I got an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> Sanitizer and battery both still fine.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; cycle is fine for some gum stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery is charged and it sounds like it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare FlexCare rechargeable toothbrush is lightweight, comfortable to hold, and comes with a variety of functions:  Just press a button to set it for a thorough Cleaning (too much vibration and tickling for me and it shakes the toothpaste off), Sensitive (perfect for me) and Gum Massage, which is great when you have extra time.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine until about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> Let me just say, the first couple times wasn&#x27;t all that enjoyable and like many others</li>
            <li> The product is fine.</li>
            <li> fine-</li>
            <li> Even brushing with just water seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> The battery life is fine.</li>
            <li> The brush is contoured, the unit is easy to grip and light, and there is no moldy gunk buildup anymore because the brush head snaps onto the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it did fine up until now.</li>
            <li> and it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Care\\&quot; for a quick yet thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li> Luckily I had bought it at Costco and was able to return it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like a sonic toothbrush, but I got used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand the \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; on the roof of my mouth but quickly got used to it</li>
            <li> This product does a good job -- my mouth feels fresh and clean after using it, and I can never go back to a manual toothbrush after getting used to the superior cleaning of an electric toothbrush, but I would recommend buying an Oral-B instead.  </li>
            <li> I absolute love it!</li>
            <li> second one has been going strong for a couple of months now, and still doing great.</li>
            <li> My teeth are more than clean, they seem to be squeaky clean after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only dinging it one star for all this because their support was great, I was able to get though quickly, and got my warranty claim approved in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Now the brush works fine, I enjoy cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> A little bit pricey, but you can find the best deals here on Amazon and Phillips will extend the warranty for two and one-half years.  </li>
            <li> I do agree that its kind of noisy &amp; I sure did make a mess the first time I used it, but that being said, if you want great feeling and clean teeth, take the plunge!</li>
            <li> The ultraviolet sanitizer is cool and keeps them clean and off of the counter!  </li>
            <li> The little sanitizer is nice to have when you have an OCD moment about brush cleanliness, however this would still be a great toothbrush without the feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than happy to pay a little more for the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> No Bulky holder for the toothbrush that gets filled with...and has to be   cleaned weekly, and the compact brush heads are great for smaller mouths  and control when brushing.  </li>
            <li> but I am a huge germ-a-phobe.</li>
            <li> It was huge for one thing, like holding a tree limb.</li>
            <li> This one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> I had liked that significantly more than my old Crest Sprinbrush.  </li>
            <li> though if you have something like a pedestal you might need a shelf or something because it wont fit.</li>
            <li> felt like a light bulb exploded in my head.</li>
            <li> I wish I still had my cheap Sonicare.</li>
            <li> They confirmed it&#x27;s still under warranty,</li>
            <li> Cory confirmed that \\&quot;080828\\&quot; means that this replacement unit came from a production batch of hundreds of brushes made on Aug. 28, 2008.    </li>
            <li> Regardless I&#x27;m a customer for life, it&#x27;s a cheap luxury.</li>
            <li> None of the cheap made-in-China-construction.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering the easy clean for $60 soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how happy this has made me.</li>
            <li> so I like having the toothbrush head locked away in the sanitizer with the UV light blasting away the germs.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter weight and extra modes were great.  </li>
            <li> use I feel like my teeth are smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> plaque free.</li>
            <li> UV sanitizer is a fantastic breakthrough idea for the toothbrush as well.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fantastic toothbrush and</li>
            <li> of Use:&lt;br /&gt;Pressing the mode select button will move through all available brush modes.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer that comes with this product is just a added bonus that I enjoy having because I have always worried about the bacteria build up on brush heads.</li>
            <li> Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</li>
            <li> Everybody likes the smooth feeling that brushing your teeth with the Sonicare creates.</li>
            <li> The dental assistant recommended this specific tooth brush with sanitizer as a great way to maintain my teeth.</li>
            <li> Likes: Easy brush head clean up.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, but will change to \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; about one a week.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally invested in one.  </li>
            <li> , the cheap components break too often.  </li>
            <li> be ay why for lower price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This uses a replaceable ultraviolet light bulb.  </li>
            <li> I know my tooth brush is free from bacteria with the Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable in my mouth too.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush when it&#x27;s working, but fast-forward to two months out of the warranty and this one stops working all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> But my thinking is perhaps they build these to be a commodity rather than a solid great product.</li>
            <li> -Sanitizing box have this translucent area where light will be emitted when the box is in use.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product in January and the light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> That one quit working in August 2009 and SonicCare sent out a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li> We purchased a Philips Sonicare Flex Care with the Ultra Violet light.</li>
            <li> We like the Ultra Violet light sanitizer.</li>
            <li> The different settings that change the duration and pulse of the vibrations are a great feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please wait while we find an available agent</li>
            <li> Does the light come on when the handle is on charging base?&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: just tried it</li>
            <li> We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
            <li> We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC FOR REMOVING TEA STAINS ..</li>
            <li> .. noticed that people said Phillips Sonicare was great about standing in back of their products .. called their customer service at  1-800-682-7664 ..</li>
            <li> Replacements for the compact brush aren&#x27;t yet available for sale, and heads need to be changed</li>
            <li> So, I waited and finally I was blessed with this great Sonicare Flexcare.</li>
            <li> With six people in our family, we have tried every toothbrush/system available on the market.  </li>
            <li> the trouble and am using it the best</li>
            <li> I can fit two brush heads in at once and it makes me feel healthier every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I think Phillips is really on to something with an electric toothbrush that works as effectively as this one does.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it does a great job.      </li>
            <li> Philips also sent me one free one as a purchase bonus for signing up online with them.</li>
            <li> I called the company and asked if there should be a sound coming from that unit, and they said no.  </li>
            <li> UV light isn&#x27;t like antibiotics</li>
            <li> Light weight also helps.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth after using it and</li>
            <li> It took me about a week or so to get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> My UV light charger died within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is also a lot more powerful than the cheaper toothbrushes I had before.     </li>
            <li> Philips replaced it free of charge.</li>
            <li> In short, great product and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The sensitivity settings on this are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Advice: get the basic model and be happy.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great toothbrush</li>
            <li> I enjoy ever morning and evening that I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 months for me to convert to this as my primary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That includes by the way disinfecting the heads, using the built-in UV light that it comes with on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> admit I was one of these people who would buy the cheap electric ones for a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel smooth after each time you use it -</li>
            <li> I thought the toothbrush was a bit more powerful</li>
            <li> It works great but with a short life.  </li>
            <li> enjoy my Sonicare and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a $5 coupon for these in the FlexCare box, and your dentist probably has the coupons available.   </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped it within 24 hours too even though I selected the free shipping method.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the way my teeth and gums feel after I use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Well, the UV sanitizer was a great deal for me because I have always used one with my regular toothbrushes</li>
            <li> and I would have had to get one to fit whatever brush I got.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several rechargeable toothbrushes for years and have been happy.  </li>
            <li> It took several days to get use to it, but then it was great.</li>
            <li> I would think it would be great for children as it would do a great job of keeping their teeth brushed properly.</li>
            <li> thing is fantastic, and I love the feeling of my super clean teeth</li>
            <li> You can only get it from your dentist office and I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with it</li>
            <li> These are handy additions, but the real value is the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re that important.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but i find it to be louder than before but one will get used  to the sound over time</li>
            <li> : The HX6921/02 is on Amazon for $119.95 free shipping.</li>
            <li> Even with your discount and free shipping, it is still cheaper to buy it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> : The HX6921/02 is on Amazon for $119.95 free shipping.</li>
            <li> Even with your discount and free shipping, it is still cheaper to buy it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> An ultraviolet light cleans the brush heads after each use or when you choose to do so (two at a time).</li>
            <li> The UV sterilizer seemed like a gimmick, but I had a coupon for this one, so it basically was a free add-in.  </li>
            <li> Had the last model, think called elite, and it worked great for 3 or 4 years until it died in India.  </li>
            <li> the multiple options are great.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com had such a great deal on this brush</li>
            <li> The Sanitizer is fantastic and helps to eliminate germs.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t use the UV light.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare toothbrush did a great but the internal battery lasted (3) months.</li>
            <li> if you love your smile please buy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The best brush I have ever used and still using it everyday.</li>
            <li> steroids\\&quot; sound of it.  </li>
            <li> They have fewer places for crud to collect, and the UV sanitizer light is keeping bacteria growth away.  </li>
            <li> After using only 6 weeks our teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel great everytime you brush.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor leaves the teeth feeling polished and super clean, and the UV light is nice peace of mind for anyone with mysophobia.</li>
            <li> It was free at no cost to me because it played out before the two year warranty had expired.</li>
            <li> my UV light went out.  </li>
            <li> and I can offer you a coupon code for 15% off and free shipping on purchase of the unit through our Philips online store.</li>
            <li> The brush is no longer securely locked to handle.  </li>
            <li> Prior to being a proud Sonicare owner, I used the Oral-B electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Philips Sonicare Advanced cleaning  which has 3 Modes and 2 routines for custom cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable, the on/off button is conveniently located, and there is a travel charger if you want to take the brush with you on the road.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the toothbrush daily since September 21, 2007 and am happy to report that this product performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li> use the sanitizer faithfully each time I brush my teeth, but to be perfectly honest, I don&#x27;t know how to judge whether the sanitizer is really making any difference or not.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, it is worth to pay more for this model than the Elite.   </li>
            <li> We used the sanitizer for both toothbrushes prior to leaving for the Carribean, using the portable toothbrushes while on vacation, which was great, and then sanitized the brushes when we got home.</li>
            <li> With the Advance, they&#x27;d be smooth and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> The charger also has a UV cleaner which is great for making the replicable heads last longer.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush was great initially but then started turning itself on and off throughout the day without provocation.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few months, the dentist found a great improvement - no need to scrape!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has greatly improved my oral care and has made a big difference in my gum health.  </li>
            <li> Performance of the toothbrush is far superior as well.</li>
            <li> but this time was told that the warranty is only good for two years and that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to send a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was able to maneuver the compact head a lot better, and not so much toothpaste escaped.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for such a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> Not having experienced any product of this kind before, I&#x27;m in no position to make such comparisons, but IMO the level of noise and vibration is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li> , I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li> , I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li> WOW, I wish all my interactions with customer service department were this good.</li>
            <li> So far they have been good about replacing it, but it is a hassle.  </li>
            <li> My old Oral b brush used to keep running after the two minutes which I liked if I wanted to do more brushing.  </li>
            <li> Good for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> With so many models to choose from with or without the UV light anyone can improve their smile at a price within your budget.    </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend that anyone should buy this brush and it will make your mouth care routine much more rewarding and guided.</li>
            <li> * Light weight, easier to held thus more useful    </li>
            <li> In short, these are the absolute best toothbrushes for dental care.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> most of which were very positive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, compact and sleek, and very powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used successive generations of Sonicare electronic toothbrushes for a number of years now and every generation has been better than the last -- and they have all been great, right from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to wait months to achieve that super clean feeling that comes from a dentist visit!</li>
            <li> Is a very good product and it seems to do better than my older one, I&#x27;ll find out at my next cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of using the Sonicare Toothbrush right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The varying modes are nice; although, I find that I use the 3-minute mode most often to ensure a complete clean in all quadrants of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Overall a great brush and company, Sonicare makes brushing fun!</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed my time using Sonicare, I feel at this point it is a luxury and doesn&#x27;t offer me anything more than a standard, albeit special kind, of toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVES IT!!!  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel very calm about the cleanliness of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am buying more and more from Amazon as I find out how professional they are; so far I never had any kind of problems purchasing from its site and I am amazed at their efficiency!</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is very nice, but not essential, so you may want to get the brush by itself if cost is an issue.</li>
            <li> The timer function is very useful.  </li>
            <li> All in All, a very nice product that will vastly improve</li>
            <li> I also knew I wasn&#x27;t happy with OralB - because my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and I knew that it was definitely not getting into all the contours of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so happy I splurged on this purchase--I replaced an older sonicare toothbrush I had, and the technolgy of the FlexCare has been much improved.  </li>
            <li> i m glad i have one it makes my mouth feel really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love how fresh and clean Philips Sonicare Flexcare Toothbrush makes my mouth, teeth and breath feel.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to keep clean, does a great job cleaning teeth, and you can sanitize the different heads too.</li>
            <li> They work great and give your mouth that clean feeling like you just left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought it because it had the UV light...</li>
            <li> I smile more, I&#x27;m more comfortable about my smile, and I know I&#x27;m finally taking good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I smile more, I&#x27;m more comfortable about my smile, and I know I&#x27;m finally taking good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> One handle for me, one for my girlfriend, and a super cool UV sanitization chamber to play with!</li>
            <li> : As your unit&#x27;s 2 year warrenty is expired, at this point of time, the best option that I can suggest to you is to purchase a new unit and to help offset some of the cost, we can offer you 15% off your total Sonicare purchase along with free shipping at our online store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and I also like the onboard sanitizer to keep the brush clean and germ free.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean just like after a dental visit &amp; are noticably whiter.  </li>
            <li> It is much more convenient and easy to use than a manual toothbrush and provides far better results.      </li>
            <li> I too find myself licking my teeth after a clean and find they stay smooth and shiny for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> I too find myself licking my teeth after a clean and find they stay smooth and shiny for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> That is the sound of clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing.</li>
            <li> But now, I&#x27;m hooked again and enjoy brushing my teeth and the clean feeling that I get with it.  </li>
            <li> I picked this unit because of the UV light to use on to clean the  brushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The included UV light completes the package, helping make this toothbrush consistently clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not noisy at all.  </li>
            <li> I can choose from several modes (including GoCare, for when you&#x27;re on the run, or MaxCare, when you have more time); I can even choose a nice, easy gum massage mode.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use</li>
            <li> I received one of these for Christmas from my best friend, and I swear I will never go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Super easy.</li>
            <li> Super easy.</li>
            <li> However, this toothbrush quickly and easily gets my teeth cleaner than I could do with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had the older version of the Sonic Care toothbrush and liked it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own an older model Sonicare and its battery begin to wean and the brush heads always stayed junky.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works perfectly, holds an extremely long charge, saves toothpaste and is very sanitary.</li>
            <li> my trips to the dentist are quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush also comes with a travel charger and a travel bag which makes it super easy to take with you on vacation or on work</li>
            <li> This is my first time using electrical toothbrush, so far I am happy.</li>
            <li> QUICK RECAP - PROS &amp; CONS  Easy to use -</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> teeth feel the cleanest with this new toothbrush and it better for the price!  </li>
            <li> and I enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> All-in-all a product well worth using if you want to keep your teeth really clean!</li>
            <li> and I look forward to the fresh clean teeth every time I use it!</li>
            <li> I noticed that performance with new brushheads are much better, so it&#x27;s better change it</li>
            <li> Now, after 3 weeks, I press a little more because I am acclimated to it, and pressing more feels good.  </li>
            <li> Love Sonicare since my mom bought me my first one for Xmas after I had moved away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the upgrade!)    </li>
            <li> So I Bought the 900+ flex-care after the first time I&#x27;m glad I did...</li>
            <li> Various modes are convenient and effective!</li>
            <li> If you want a straightforward toothbrush without all of the settings or cleaner</li>
            <li> He said he could send me a $15 rebate coupon ifI could send him the original purchase receipt.  </li>
            <li> Treat yourself--and SMILE!</li>
            <li> I had the original Sonicare</li>
            <li> Worked ok first year, then I have had to replace it  </li>
            <li> The UV light is interesting, if it actually works to sterilize--very nice.  </li>
            <li> The original broke after 9 months, and the replacement just broke as well.  </li>
            <li> From the first time, I felt like I got a better cleaning than I got even from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> (I had the original packaging by chance.)  </li>
            <li> It worth every penny!</li>
            <li> After registering the product the manufacturer offered a year&#x27;s worth of replacement heads at no cost too!  </li>
            <li> Since the original product was purchased Dec 2009 Phillips would not replace the handle.  </li>
            <li> This models battery lasts for a long time and makes it great when traveling.</li>
            <li> There is a fairly significant buzz that occurs when you fire it up.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews, I finally gave in and I&#x27;m thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> So far we are very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Most everyone has gone over the benefits pretty well</li>
            <li> (it works great cleaning teeth, charge lasts a long time, etc)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my dentist, and although pricey, it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am familiar with the seller.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Your teeth are worth it, buy this product!    </li>
            <li> I have owned it for about a month and am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush handle is lighter and easier to handle than the original Sonicare style.      </li>
            <li> At first I thought I was accidentally touching the selection button by mistake while brushing.  </li>
            <li> My original Sonicare was still working</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a significant</li>
            <li> Great product, shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to purchase.  </li>
            <li> So worth it!    </li>
            <li> My original Sonicare toothbrush just gave up the ghost after just under a decade of use.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Philips&#x27; customer service department was friendly, efficient, and apologetic.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and after two weeks can already tell that it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> but there is no doubt its a night and day improvement over the original Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and works great!  </li>
            <li> I can remember four different dentists telling me that I should be brushing more and flossing more and coming more often.  </li>
            <li> Since then, we have had the original and two replacement units, but all three we have had died.  </li>
            <li> but so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an investment in your smile - and that lasts a lifetime!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and all you have to do is stand there and let the brush do all the work!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the model with the sanitizer but that never worked well</li>
            <li> This is worth it!</li>
            <li> so I kind of tear up my mouth with a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to happen again.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the value!</li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t been this happy with me for a long time.y at all.  </li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t been this happy with me for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you are a person that has always used a manual toothbrush and are contemplating getting an electric toothbrush for the first time, I know the Sonicare costs more</li>
            <li> I bought my first one about 13 years ago (maybe more) after having a gum infection and surgery.</li>
            <li> Plus the customer service rep was so friendly and helpful.</li>
            <li> with 2 years of manufacturer warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Shalom: OK&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Shalom, the warranty on the replacement handle is based on your original product&#x27;s date of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: I&#x27;ve checked the entitlement and the unit is not within warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Please note that the Sonicare toothbrushes are non-repairable</li>
            <li> The original one worked for a while, then it would just make noise (sounded like it was working), but the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t vibrate.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is excellent (so far about 2 weeks on its initial charge), the slimmer design is easier to hold and maneuver, and the 3 selectable &#x27;speeds&#x27; are very useful.</li>
            <li> I have a quadrant in my mouth that the brush just won&#x27;t clean, and as a result I have significant plaque buildup in that quadrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had oral surgery the week prior to ordering and I was excited to try their Sensitive mode (it&#x27;s great by the way!).</li>
            <li> clean feel.  </li>
            <li> but there is no denying the exceptionally clean feeling after the 2 minute timer cuts the power cycle.</li>
            <li> It is the closest clean to the \\&quot;6</li>
            <li> Each time I clean my teeth the brush end shoots off into my mouth</li>
            <li> I also like the sanitizing attachment, instead of just shoving it in a drawer and hoping it stays clean.  </li>
            <li> (timer, max clean, go clean, etc</li>
            <li> How really clean your mouth feels?</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic brushing cleans everything clean.</li>
            <li> I had a different electric toothbrush before this is by far the best one i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean feeling and shiney.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to really clean between there at all, as it doesn&#x27;t need it.    </li>
            <li> when I didn&#x27;t UV clean my brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is a pleasure not to have to clean the olds.  </li>
            <li> The wife and kid had a backup toothbrush, but I&#x27;d used mine to clean my rims.</li>
            <li> I am always told how clean my teeth are..</li>
            <li> they always feel dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> The Flexcare Sonicare has been a pleasure to use and to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> How clean it stays, and the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I notice the difference in how clean my teeth feel after each use</li>
            <li> The Phillips FlexCare Toothbrush with Sanitizer is an excellent product offering several teeth cleaning options that provide a near Dentist cleaning experience.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth and gums are really clean now.  </li>
            <li> squeaky clean</li>
            <li> The charging light is bright, but if you turn the power head to face the rear it takes the glare away and the unit still charges the same.</li>
            <li> clean everytime</li>
            <li> u are getting a &#x27;100% clean&#x27; set.</li>
            <li> teeth never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> And the clean?</li>
            <li> But you DO get a feeling of clean</li>
            <li> The brush handle seems to stay clean.  </li>
            <li> Must hold the brush on each tooth for an extended period of time (have to brush this way to get really clean)    </li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep my teeth squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li> But if you use this gizmo as instructed you won&#x27;t have to do anything else to keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The brush head needs to be aligned perfectly in the sanitizer and the door closed and snapped gently.  </li>
            <li> It literally cleans your teeth so well that when you floss it feels as though you&#x27;ve already flossed because your teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li> I started using UltraSonics consistantly when my Dentist asked how I was keeping my teeth so clean between checkups.</li>
            <li> But I always feel, after I brush, that my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> have now been using the Sonicare Flexcare for more than 90 days, and I have to say I am extremely pleased at its performance so far.  </li>
            <li> I do take the brush head off and clean the mounting post about once every 8-10 days.  </li>
            <li> It is much more compact and more wieldy than than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as if I had just visited the dentist</li>
            <li> My mouth doesn&#x27;t even feel this clean after leaving the dentist.  </li>
            <li> So I clean it once a week</li>
            <li> and I find I can reach all my teeth, and there is no toothbrush on this planet that will leave your teeth and mouth as clean as this brush will.  </li>
            <li> After brushing with this toothbrush, you teeth feel dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> now they look whiter and brighter, and they FEEL SO CLEAN.  </li>

            <li> It has a neat, clean look on the vanity.</li>
            <li> I have them both, turn them on and press the heads lightly on my skin, the Advance seems to provide as much as 40% more torques than the Flexcare.</li>
            <li> I will still get the Sonic clean feeling while I&#x27;m away from home and don&#x27;t have to use the crappy manual stuff.  </li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s a clean toothbrush head during every brush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have NEVER felt so clean.</li>
            <li> All the feedback I&#x27;ve read about \\&quot;as clean as a dentist visit\\&quot; match my experience.</li>

            <li> My teeth feel so clean</li>

            <li> You feel like your teeth are so clean and that you just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> The clean feel just wouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>

            <li> My teeth just felt clean.  </li>
            <li> The UV light burned out quickly but as I&#x27;m not a germaphobe I didn&#x27;t mind</li>

            <li> Gets my teeth sparkling clean every day.</li>
            <li> this clean is the day for my cleanning appt every six months.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the Advance.</li>
            <li> a clean cloth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel extremely clean after use and</li>
            <li> and my dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are (this was after I started using this toothbrush)  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that you have to be sure to clean the thing every once in a while because it gets kind of gunky, and that gunk is nothing but bacteria.</li>
            <li> something that is actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> something that is actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> U.V. sanitizer is a nice gadget, but who knows how useful it really is?  </li>
            <li> The price is big but it was worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these new brushes and loved it for the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> But on the other hand, if you are fine with the reliability issues, it is a great toothbrush and made my teeth feel incredibly clean when it worked so</li>
            <li> My all family asked for one as the most desired present and they all love it!!!Perfect for the busy people who take time to clean their teeth and forget to clean their toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> I expect a much more positive six month check-up.  </li>
            <li> The original was always louder and had more vibration than this replacement but the replacement cleans just as good as the other ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like nothing else you&#x27;ve experienced, except possibly the feeling you get right after you leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Very simply it worked great in all respects right up until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for selling such great items at such great prices.  </li>
            <li> The head pops off the toothbrush easily and slips right in the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> Though there are some good combo packages on the Elite through Costco (with extra handles and bases), for us it is worth staying with the newer model for the additional modes and features, and the gunk-free head replacements!</li>
            <li> Most significantly, I had to get the whole thing replaced just now.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that allows you to clean those \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Before I start reviewing, I should mention that I bought the Special Edition package from Costco with 2 Sonicare brushes for about $170.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highest recommendations if you want good, clean teeth and lesser visits to the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> However this model has a max clean that adds 15 seconds to each interval with a more intense vibration.  </li>
            <li> If you look through the reviews, you will see others have experienced my exact same problem.</li>
            <li> I started using it on a regular basis and at first it was great.</li>
            <li> This brush is not nearly as loud as the Oral B was, but it seems to brush even more effectively.</li>
            <li> I really hesitated before spending so much but am very satisfied that I did.  </li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying that I am very happy with Sonicare in general and the replacement toothbrush I purchased was the same make and model.    </li>
            <li> I cannot believe the difference in the amount of gunk that remains between my teeth after using the unit the full cleaning program.  </li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t you think two full cycles with a Sonicare should get that out???  </li>
            <li> Phillips is good about sending a replacement but the second time I got it replaced</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just beginning to use it more than once a day because it almost tickles your mouth TOO much.  </li>
            <li> It was good enough for generations before us!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I can feel the difference this toothbrush made versus my old (non sonic) electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> His solution was that we each need our own FlexCare toothbrushes and not remove the heads so frequently.  </li>
            <li> Quick clean mode for brushing on the go.</li>
            <li> my teeth are so super clean, even my dentist said they were the cleanest teeth he&#x27;s seen in a while.  </li>
            <li> Max-care is the full works.</li>
            <li> My teeth are smooth and shiny and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Max-care is the full works.</li>
            <li> My teeth are smooth and shiny and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Tomorrow I am going to contact the Sonicare customer service and give them a ear full.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.    </li>
            <li> Makes the teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> You may need to go buy another full size bush.  </li>
            <li> Hope that isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just an overall good feeling.</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel so clean after every brush and our gums never bleed anymore, not even when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I brush the full two minutes and hold the brush on my tooth at the gumline...</li>
            <li> Hope you fall in love with this toothbrush as much as I did.</li>
            <li> Good pricing compared against the big retailers.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m probably back with Sonicare for good.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but my dentists repeatedly told me about how good these things are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to bad-mouth Sonicare, because it&#x27;s a good brush, but I just preferred the smaller size of the Oral-B, along with the pop-off brush heads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money to put out every two years for a product that should really have greater durability.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Plenty of brushing programs: I specially love the GoCare for when I&#x27;m in real hurry.</li>
            <li> Finally the most important part; it does an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Of course I did start with a pair of very thorough periodontal cleanings 3 months apart, but my periodontist and hygienists agree than the Sonicare is an outstanding dental home-care maintenance</li>
            <li> It is more gentle to the gum and I can feel the cleanness inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> they give 2 full years from date of purchase.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner and my dentist visit have gone better.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush keeps me brushing my teeth for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li> Try number 3 back on \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; and all was good, though it will still take a bit getting use to.</li>
            <li> In as much as I want to love this toothbrush, I can&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This button is to change the way the brush head vibrates, so you can get a kind of massage action.  </li>
            <li> Overall it really is a good product.  </li>
            <li> It looks like the Cybersonic 2 is similar to and superior to the Sonicare:</li>
            <li> I agree that it does a good job of cleaning; however, the UV bulb in the sanitizer  did not last the year</li>
            <li> It keeps the brush head clean and dry and is much more effective than just rinsing.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare comes with a soft travel case and a separate travel charger--that&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I always brush my teeth now for the full two minutes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to hear the \\&quot;beep\\&quot; of the \\&quot;Quadpacer\\&quot;, (the timer that does 15 seconds per quadrant in Quick Clean mode, or 30 seconds in \\&quot;Max Clean\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I knew it would be better, but not this much.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has a complimentary  hole in the bottom for the peg to fit into.</li>
            <li> 1min quick clean feature for after lunch or before outings.</li>
            <li> and I prefer the full sized brush head.  </li>
            <li> I also bought one for my father recently and he has nothing to say but good things as well.      </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot;, which will run the brush for a minute, and \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot;, which will give you a full 2 minutes of time.  </li>
            <li> Even with \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; settings, I don&#x27;t have that achy, itchy gums feeling that a Water Pik turned on full can do.  </li>
            <li> Even with \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; settings, I don&#x27;t have that achy, itchy gums feeling that a Water Pik turned on full can do.  </li>
            <li> I hope my next purchase would be equally good.</li>
            <li> The brush has a 14 use warm-up to get to full</li>
            <li> I used to own an electric toothbrush model that was 5 years old or so.</li>
            <li> Also want to mention that I&#x27;m a true bargain shopper...</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a good, worhwhile electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product &amp; the manufacturer....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been a week, and now I can make the full three minutes of the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; setting and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tooth brush for about 3 years and love it as much today as I did 3 years ago.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush also comes with a travel case, and brush head covers, which is really cool.</li>
            <li> I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd phillips sonicare i have had and have loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Also included is two toothbrush heads, a compact size and a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> By chance I found it has a feature that gradually builds up to full power while you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I did like this product, the brush heads were a good size and the battery kept a charge for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> It was an awesome product, just sucks</li>
            <li> Based on this and current reviews of Oral B being superior in almost every way, we will be switching.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth feel fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> its not a bad deal at all i guess for the toothbrush with uv sanitizer, which alone sells for around 50 bucks</li>
            <li> I would like to know how many senior citizens were upset when they attempted to buy new heads and they weren&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li> The new Sonic toothbrush that I purchased is as I expected it to be, Great!</li>
            <li> I loved the Braun so much I recommended it to my roommate who was searching for a new rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found the Flexcare model on sale on Amazon.com at a much more reasonable price than the retail price in stores, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited to try the Sonic to see if I could avoid having to use two different brushes and especially because of the UV sanitizer which the Rotodent doesn&#x27;t have and is a wonderful addition.</li>
            <li> AMAZON had the best prices too, as usual!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re pretty easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li> The different settings are great, and when I&#x27;m in a rush I can set the toothbrush to clean in a fast amount of time.    </li>
            <li> brush looks like Phillips did some thorough research to see what you and I want in a hi-tech toothbrush (easy to read indicators, multiple settings, sanitizer build into to charger) and what dentists want (better breakup of plaque film, fluid driving between teeth for more effective</li>

            <li> I purchased this product after one of my other family members told me how great it was.  </li>
            <li> I have had the original Philips rechargeable toothbrush for many years and when it came time to get a new one, I went again with my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and selected this FlexCare model.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon and used Google to get the low down on the best at home cleaning options and mostly all pointed to Sonicare products.     </li>
            <li> It is quiet and does not vibrate, has great features, and has a very high quality feel and appearance.  </li>
            <li> I love my new electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Love my new Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> I love my new Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new Phillips rechargeable toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I love our new Sonicare - my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentists!</li>
            <li> I had an older version of the Sonicare Toothbrush years ago, and this new version is vastly superior.</li>
            <li> This new model is much better because it is easier to clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Exceptional cleaning, my mouth is a whole new place.</li>
            <li> The first two years it worked fine,</li>
            <li> For the first three months it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money for me, my teeth feel really clean all day.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re OCD-obsessive about teeth and gums or you just want to have clean teeth without a lot of effort, this is definitely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re OCD-obsessive about teeth and gums or you just want to have clean teeth without a lot of effort, this is definitely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> and I always feel fresh and clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> Obviously proper oral health and regular dental visits are the best method.</li>
            <li> I like the quick 1 minute cycle for a quick brush.  </li>
            <li> and this is better than the 2 older models I had because it has a slimmer brush wand and also has speeds settings to chose from.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough power to really get a great cleaning from it.    </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I get a sonic toothbrush since I have mild gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend this much on another toothbrush, but being that I loved my old Sonicare</li>
            <li> My last brush lasted way many more years</li>
            <li> My last brush lasted way many more years</li>
            <li> I found that really helpful - my husband doesn&#x27;t really pay attention to it and does his own thing.    </li>
            <li> And, as always, Amazon provided a quick delivery, and took care of the import taxes to Brazil.</li>
            <li> but you will quickly get use to it.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I was sedated and the work was completed in one visit.</li>
            <li> The unit, overall, is really quite attractive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace an older model (Sonic Care Elite) and it&#x27;s much better.  </li>
            <li> The best part about the toothbrush is that it has a timer built into the device, and when it is done with working on one side of an individual&#x27;s mouth, it will beep letting that individual know that it is time to switch sides.</li>
            <li> Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; settings; with these, the brush actually times you, allowing you to brush one each of four areas of your teeth (top front, top inside, bottom front and bottom inside) at a time.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was still under warranty</li>
            <li> but I was moving the head around way too quickly, and as a result, my dentist says the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; effect was not working.  </li>
            <li> But boy was I lucky, they didnt have any at that time in their office.</li>
            <li> I owned an Oral B rechargeable brush for about 5 years and was happy with it; it was only after purchasing the Sonicare Flexcare that I realised how much the technolgy had improved.</li>
            <li> Maybe, if I get lucky, it has NOT been used.</li>
            <li> It cleans nicely but the light for the sanitizer burned out after one year of use (and we only used it maximum of once a week.)  </li>
            <li> (as compared to sonicare&#x27;s old screw on heads) are fantastic and much better than the Oral-B pop-off ones.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare brushes for the better part of a decade and never had a problem with any of the older \\&quot;first-generation\\&quot; units.  </li>
            <li> I have been using philips sonic toothbrushes many many years, during that entire time I never needed any dental work or fillings, infact I did not even need to visit the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Sonicare fan for years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the older model I have had for many years.  </li>
            <li> i have really enjoyed using this since it arrived, my older model did not have any of the features on the handle</li>
            <li> (I only wish that the UV Sanitizer would have some kind of music / sound to let you know when the process is all done.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on many different \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrushes and am SOOO glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> and I use the quick care when I&#x27;m rushing out the door.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I got mine through my dentist</li>
            <li> Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This means that you have to find your setting, move the brush quickly to your mouth, and turn it on, all within 3 seconds.  </li>
            <li> This means that you have to find your setting, move the brush quickly to your mouth, and turn it on, all within 3 seconds.  </li>
            <li> One reason for getting a brush like this is that it might encourage your gadget-crazy kids to brush their teeth more, so many people will require those extra brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a quality, easy to use toothbrush that really does seem to get your teeth almost as clean as they are after a visit to the dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> It resets to default \\&quot;Quick Clean\\&quot; 1 minute setting every time.    </li>
            <li> The smaller brush head is perfect for my younger son while my teenager</li>
            <li> The Go Care provides a quick 1 minute freshen up.</li>
            <li> But we prefer to just leave the brushes out in the air most of the time and also not have the charger (most likely)</li>
            <li> it sounds like you&#x27;re gargling with a lightsaber, but the feeling amounts to a mild vibration that leaves your gums tingly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Oral-B. Then a while later I upgraded to the Oral-B Triumph because it had the lcd, but it just looks better than the 8850, the 8850 is a way better brush than the 9400.</li>
            <li> This product was great while it worked, but for as much as this product costs, it should last longer.</li>
            <li> What I also like better about this model is the simplicity of the actual head design--no more nooks and areas for gunk and residue build up as a result of brushing.  </li>
            <li> it just seemed like a worthy plus for Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I quickly learned is to not turn the toothbrush &#x27;on&#x27; with toothpaste before putting it in your mouth - doing so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been more than two years with the Sonicare Flexcare for me and more than 10 years using Sonicare toothbrushes exclusively, save for trips where I took a non-electric standard toothbrush with me.  </li>
            <li> In the older e-Series units, the connection was performed via a screw top connection to the handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it cleans my teeth like no other toothbrush has been able to before.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this Phillips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush if you want really clean, professional results every time you brush!!!</li>
            <li> Going from the Elite to the Flexcare, the Flexcare has a much improved design with narrow handle, very attractive blue and silver trim, ridges on back for better gripping, and most significantly a head which easily pops off for santizing</li>
            <li> much as I love this brush, I do realize that the price Sonicare has marketed it at is exceedingly high.  </li>
            <li> As much as I love this brush, I do realize that the price Sonicare has marketed it at is exceedingly high.  </li>
            <li> :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It felt extremely comfortable and after a few minor teeth chatters as I got used to holding the brush at the required angle, it cleaned my teeth wonderfully, but more of that in a moment.</li>
            <li> really makes your mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how smooth my teeth felt the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I am sorta dissatisfied with the carrying case, it looks pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> On the first one I received the UV light wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> With this product I really don&#x27;t miss a thing, it&#x27;s the perfect tooth cleaning solution next to a professional inside your mouth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, it seems to do a lot better job than my old sonicare toothbrush and is much lighter and easier to hold.</li>
            <li> They were very willing to send me another</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I saw a store exhibit of the Philips Sonicare Flexcare and was very interested.</li>
            <li> takes some time to get used to using this coming from a normal toothbrush, but it works way way better.</li>
            <li> my regular morning routine, and by the time I am ready to brush, my heads are nice and sanitized &#x3D;).  </li>
            <li> When I finally followed through, I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I cannot think of any good excuse for the folks at Philips designing it this way, unless it is a money-making scheme.</li>
            <li> However, I wish that the developers have been more thoughtful when they come up with some certain simple but important parts to make life easy for users.     </li>
            <li> I had the older &#x27;e&#x27; series of sonicare toothbrushes, and this is a great update in respect to the charging and the yellow stuff that grows in the head area.</li>
            <li> And once I&#x27;m done, I pop the brush head into the sanitizer for a nice, clean brush the next time I use it.    </li>
            <li> The handle comes set by default to the two-minute clean cycle, the 30-second beep cycle, and the startup mode--this uses a slower brush rate to start, and gradually increases over the first two weeks to the full speed.</li>
            <li> I really liked that extra clean feeling every time I brush my teeth now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Flexcare brushes as a great upgrade to any toothbrush, electric or manual, that you&#x27;re currently using.</li>
            <li> So, thanks to my dental hygienist for introducing me to Sonicare, and thanks to Philips for keeping a healthy smile on my face!</li>
            <li> It is a good product as long as it is WORKING, if it works!  </li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare FlexCare.  </li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li> But his favorite things about this new toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Took my brushing to a new and better level.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the sanitizer feature, its like using a new toothbrush head every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear&#x27;s top load models in efficiency and economics.t.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear&#x27;s top load models in efficiency and economics.</li>
            <li> Thank you and hopefully this new one work better.    </li>
            <li> New heads are so much more sanitary and easier to use    Cons:  </li>
            <li> I was GREATLY pleased with the new Sonicare with sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my new Sonicare Flexcare with the Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I love to brush my teeth with this new model.  </li>
            <li> I previously used an Oral-B automatic and thought that one was great</li>
            <li> Really great improvement over previous models.  </li>
            <li> The battery seems as good today as it was when I first opened it -- wish I could say the same for my laptop and cordless tools.</li>
            <li> It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush, and look forward to using it for a long time to come.    </li>
            <li> Has 3 different modes: clean, sensitive, and massage (which greatly assists when cleaning/flushing gums).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, your teeth are really going to feel clean, but it has a very short life.  </li>
            <li> With the whole timing helper settings it makes it so easy to brush sufficiently.</li>
            <li> a manual toothbrush is as effective, if not more effective, than an electric, but I preferred the electric.    </li>
            <li> The kit includes a handy, small travel recharger and a nice travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> One drawback is that the battery is not replaceable, so I&#x27;m not sure how many charges the Sonicare is good for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first brush with the Sonicare was an interesting experience because I wasn&#x27;t expecting the feeling of a hypercharged, intensely vibrating bristles--I used the MaxCare setting.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve been good about keeping it dry</li>
            <li> There are plenty of features to utilize like the \\&quot;quadrant timer\\&quot; which alows you to break down the 2 minute timer into 4 sections for the most effective and even brushing.</li>
            <li> I hope the noise means more effective vibrations that break down the plaque.</li>
            <li> You really can feel a significant difference in how clean your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used one, you will be amazed at the huge positive difference they make in your tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li> First of all it is not as vigorous a vibration as the original</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Philips Sonicare fan since I got my first electric tooth brush for aprx $100 (on sale!)</li>
            <li> I bought a set of 3 extra brush-heads, and plan to have/use this unit for many years to come!</li>
            <li> I bought this 9 months ago and love it so far!  </li>
            <li> My whole mouth in general feels a lot more healthy.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, I was not too excited about the gift at first.</li>
            <li> This is the first Sonicare brush I have ever tried and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not trying them sooner!</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicare toothbrush twice daily (okay!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I actually wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to be able to handle it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading my manual, I also learned that my first time wasn&#x27;t even as powerful as it could have been!</li>
            <li> the end, this is no doubt a luxury item for most, more likely to end up under the Christmas tree for those who are interested in a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end, this is no doubt a luxury item for most, more likely to end up under the Christmas tree for those who are interested in a sonic toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> - the new design is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Quadtimer is great, new head design is terrific</li>
            <li> The new one is lighter and smaller, and the performance is great</li>
            <li> The buttons are easy to press and feel sure and solid in the case.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the on-off button is positioned so it is easy to press, so you have to keep turning the thing back on.</li>
            <li> The smaller, more rounded brush head on the flexcare makes it so easy to reach all of the teeth in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare really leaves my teeth CLEAN; like just after a dental cleaning clean</li>
            <li> , the multiple modes is fantastic new touch to an already good item.     </li>
            <li> I arrived at this one after at least 20 hours of reading reviews online and comparing models, so I&#x27;m positive that I got the best one on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course you still have to floss, but you won&#x27;t believe how clean your teeth are after the first time and</li>
            <li> The brush head is great, I like the different cycles, and the sanitizer is an extra bonus and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> far as performance goes, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been more or less happy with this toothbrush than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> I have to say I don&#x27;t use with any regularity the side attachment to where the toothbrush is stored; there&#x27;s no particular good reason for my NOT using it.  </li>
            <li> and I think I would have been fine with a cheaper model like the Healthy White.</li>
            <li> The first was an older model with the screw on top.  </li>
            <li> Now, the charging station is clever; not only can you keep the unit at full charge (recommended for effective use) but the sanitizer holds two brushes and it&#x27;s right there so that after you brush, you can pop the head into the unit and press a button to activate the UV light.</li>
            <li> It felt great when it worked and now it was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> We both were BLOWN AWAY by the quality, functionality, and price point for such and amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness of the sanitizer, but I guess it gives you some peace of mind knowing your toothbrush is germ free.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel very cleaned and smooth.</li>
            <li> Once I got used to the feeling though, I really started to enjoy the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin with, there is no gross slime getting stuck in these heads, and the UV sanitizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> The size of the head is huge and the bristles much softer than the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I liked all the different settings this one offered.  </li>
            <li> Plus having the U.V. Sanitizer on board is nice only takes 10mins to run a cycle.</li>
            <li> People have noticed my smile is brighter and ask what I&#x27;m doing to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 2 week charge (great for vacations in Europe when charging is an issue - my old one only charged for 48hours</li>
            <li> Lasted for many years, actually cracked on the threads in 1996 and was replaced for free</li>
            <li> It is worth</li>
            <li> it was worth it</li>
            <li> For this reason alone, the brush is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I find this product 100% worth my dollar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, the &#x27;soniccare&#x27; experience is far above any brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> probably worth the additional price to you.  </li>
            <li> The different modes are nice, too.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 2014:  </li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I pointed out that Philips PAID for the the return shipping and therefore would have its own proof of return, I was told that was a different department and that it was MY RESPONSIBILITY to provide Philips with the return tracking ID.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t decided yet how useful the sanitizer is, since it kills invisible stuff</li>
            <li> The newer ergonomic design that this electronic toothbrush has feels much more natural in holding while brushing.</li>
            <li> Pro: Terrific slimline design, Longer time between battery recharging, More functionality, Virtually maintenance free.</li>
            <li> We considered buying another one - we liked the brushing features, the overall design and size plus the sanitizer - but have opted to go for an Oral B this time instead.</li>
            <li> thing is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This thing is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li> all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  </li>
            <li> Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  </li>
            <li> and my mouth felt so fresh.</li>
            <li> It is much more dependable, although my husband really prefered the Sonicare, which didn&#x27;t vibrate as much</li>
            <li> and he thinks has a smaller head more comfortable for his mouth.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh from the dentist</li>
            <li> Within one day, it started going off on its own, sometimes in the middle of the night, even though no one pressed any buttons.</li>
            <li> and they recommend Oral-B, which they claim has great customer service and is better at getting behind the teeth.</li>
            <li> The rubber material coating is far more than the 9500 series i guess</li>
            <li> I owned an old Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like)</li>
            <li> All three of the settings work well, although I use mostly the Sensitive and Massge settings when working on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> but I will have to say it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall Philips did a nice job on the upgrade.</li>
            <li> This alone is already worth the value.     </li>
            <li> Once I was young and foolish too like many of u out there.</li>
            <li> I dont know if they have done something about this or not, but I didnt have fun removing the collection .</li>
            <li> But after using it for a while now, I think it was worth price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the brushing options, the auto shutoff sanitizer, and the ease of use, is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> so far okay...</li>
            <li> Or at least my most recent one didn&#x27;t, and that was the dentist who really impressed me</li>
            <li> I questioned the cost when I purchased, but now I believe it is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> This brush actually seems 20 years more advanced, and that is not an exaggeration.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter, quieter, much better brushhead design and the battery lasts and lasts (so far).</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it for an appliance used this often.</li>
            <li> When I finally purchased and started using the Sonicare FlexCare RS930, I honestly wondered why I had not used the product before.  </li>
            <li> We honestly thought the price tag was worth it and were planning on buying a second one</li>
            <li> It has more features which the old model did not have and the sanitzer is a plus.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> love it so far</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare because I liked the idea of different settings and the UV sanitizing feature.</li>
            <li> but I assume it is doing a better job than the old Braun.</li>
            <li> the UV sanitizer is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> really worth the money...</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product so far though.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase/gift</li>
            <li> he said my teeth were in far better condition</li>
            <li> , I agree it is noisier, and for me I have to use the compact head, however the different modes for cleaning is really great for those with sensitive gums, and find the oral b too abrasive, I cannot stand the heads on the oral b either.  </li>
            <li> I am fortunate enough to be able to replace it, but don&#x27;t get hooked if you can&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here to tell you it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> My gum feels very loose now, probally because of the toothbrush being so powerful, and I don&#x27;t think that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning by itself and in the evening combined with a Braun/Oral B which is better at scrubbing off the plack on my molars near the gums.  </li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go back to the Sonicare and really liked the idea of the sanitizer (if you have ever researched all of the germs and bacteria in the bathroom, you&#x27;ll know why), but I felt the added cost was prohibitive.  </li>
            <li> the 2 week \\&quot;ramp-up\\&quot; program that gradually increases the power for the 1st 2 weeks you use it is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad that they have a sensitive setting too as sometimes my teeth and gums need that as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to keep it in the charger all the time anyway, as it&#x27;s usually better to completely drain a rechargeable battery before recharging.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled enough with the results to take the time to post this review.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is so worth the money.</li>
            <li> the added feature of the uv sterilizer is nice especially after you have had an illness.  </li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is fancy, but I have no medical-base opinion whether it&#x27;s really useful.</li>
            <li> I always get the fresh out of a dentist chair feeling, but you get use to that feeling after a while.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive but I have been OK with this product.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the rather hefty price?  </li>
            <li> I use the UV cleaning but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really useful.  </li>
            <li> and I love the litle blue light that shines through the sanitizer (yes, I&#x27;m a dork.  </li>
            <li> who knew!?!?brush head, so I&#x27;m ordering the compact because I think it will be more comfortable for my smaller mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I love the litle blue light that shines through the sanitizer (yes, I&#x27;m a dork.  </li>
            <li> but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> and I feel the investment was so worth it.</li>
            <li> this being my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> On the rare occasion that I&#x27;ve been without my Sonicare</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Although pricey, it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth all of the pennies you paid and will pay for replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Really liked this brush, but a week ago it died in the middle of the night..</li>
            <li> and by January 2013 it was no longer effective (It does not vibrate properly making cleaning ineffective).  </li>
            <li> I bought one for myself several months ago and loved it so much i bought one for my husband for Fathers Day.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare replaces my old Philips Sonicare Advanced model, which lasted me over 8 years!  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get a stockpile of replacement brush heads since you probably won&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Sonicare toothbrushes and have used them for nearly 10 years, always getting rave reviews at semi-annual dentist checkups.</li>
            <li> I used to think electric toothbrushes were a huge waste of money because I never had any problems brushing my teeth without one, but I finally decided to try one out after hearing so many great things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend everyone gets this toothbrush, it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The induction charging technology is worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+The old brushes were bulkier too, the newer brushes are better.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the older brushes had exposed magnets, which would easily detach.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if Sonicare passed some of the materials savings onto the consumer, but the replacement heads seem to be about the same cost from what I remember.    </li>
            <li> and this one by far blows it away in so many ways.</li>
            <li> I like having the choice of what kind of brushing I would like, rather than no choice brushing like the regular Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> so well, I guess it is worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Decided to see if their upgraded technology was worth the money..</li>
            <li> Well..it was worth every penny I can say.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> it makes the bristles brittle so I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> much worth buying.  </li>
            <li> Very much worth buying.  </li>
            <li> can carry far more germs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, one could reason that it is worth the dental health benefits.  </li>
            <li> However it does not affect the cleaning power obviously, which is the most important part of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money and</li>
            <li> :) I think the UV light that sanitizes the brush head is the key.  </li>
            <li> This thing is powerful.</li>
            <li> Healthy/clean teeth are worth it.</li>
            <li> it is about $100 buck&#x27;s, But it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s an investment, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely use the infrared receptacle (sanitizer).</li>
            <li> It is a much more vigorous action than my rotating head brush.</li>
            <li> It claims that you will see a whiter smile in one week</li>
            <li> Teeth are worth the investment in these specialized tools.  </li>
            <li> The first charge lasted 2 weeks, not bad</li>
            <li> We purchased this product right on time for vacation, little did we know it would be great ,since it was portable.</li>
            <li> In fact, it can be a bit intimidating the first time you put it inside your mouth, because the motor is so much more powerful than what you were probably expecting if you&#x27;ve previously used the kind of \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one, my teeth are cleaner, dentist visits shorter, and I have had this one for over 2 years and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This problem is normal for batteries, and normally easy to fix.   </li>
            <li> If you get this toothbrush, you may experience some tingling around your gums when you first start out, but you&#x27;ll quickly get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Twelve years ago I used to pooh pooh electric toothbrushes, but my first Sonicare quickly made a convert of me.  </li>
            <li> First the noise and vibration alerted me tremendously.</li>
            <li> so i looked at all the new models and chose this one because i thought the new UV cleaner is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Flexcare brushes as a great upgrade to any toothbrush, electric or manual, that you&#x27;re currently using.has been reduced in exchange, but the noise can be too much for some.  </li>
            <li> My old electronic brush made my gums bleed - this one seems to be more powerful but is very gentle to my gums.</li>
            <li> the only thing it needs is a brush that can clean the teeth better in the curves.</li>
            <li> It broke, the button caved in but I love how clean my mouth/teeth feel after using it (compared to a regular manual brush).</li>
            <li> you can make sure your brushes are clean and sanitized and will not transfer germs back into your mouth.</li>
            <li> but I definitely feel like my mouth is more clean</li>
            <li> In the last 2 month I feel my teeth clean and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> The battery seems excellent: the instructions say a full charge takes 24 hours, so when the battery indicator has been on one green bar (out of three) for a couple days, I put the unit on the charger after my evening usage, and leave it there for 24 hours, using a manual brush the next morning.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s always good to check in other areas too.</li>
            <li> - This model is so superior to the other Sonicare toothbrushes, that I would suggest Philips stopping making them, and reduce the price of this one.</li>
            <li> A 3 pack of the new heads is the same price as a 2 pack of the old heads, making them actually a better deal for a superior</li>
            <li> Price is high, but then again you can&#x27;t really put a price on healthy teeth and</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m doing the right amount.</li>
            <li> , I know I am brushing my teeth, every time, for the right amount of time (per quadrant).  </li>
            <li> The mode selection button is right below the on/off button.  </li>
            <li> Man, was she right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand one reviewer who said the brush doesn&#x27;t sit right or balance well on the stand.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand one reviewer who said the brush doesn&#x27;t sit right or balance well on the stand.  </li>
            <li> that right</li>
            <li> This is it, priced just right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right where my thumb is when I use it.</li>
            <li> The compact head is also the right size for the hard-to-reach teeth areas.</li>
            <li> All the reviews I had read on this product were right on.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s right folks, I can feel my plaque with my tounge because it is so hardened on).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers are right...</li>
            <li> &quot; know that until 2 weeks ago, I was right there with you.</li>
            <li> &quot; know that until 2 weeks ago, I was right there with you.</li>
            <li> The difference is that the head pulses and emits sonic waves that shake the microscopic ick that you&#x27;ve accumulated right off your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Should have used the right parts.  </li>
            <li> :rolleyes:  I like the new style brush heads -- easy to snap on/off (2 of us share the brush)</li>
            <li> This new one is even more fantastic than the old model.  </li>
            <li> I opted for the regular and it felt fine and fitted between my gums and cheeks easily,</li>
            <li> I tend to use the quick care (one minute) cycle in the mornings and in the evening I switch off between the normal clean cycle (two minutes) and the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; cycle (three minutes).&lt;br /&gt;-Newly designed head.</li>
            <li> It really gets you the clean feeling just like you have gotten out of a dental visit.</li>
            <li> My teeth really feel clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> it really does clean</li>
            <li> find the feature that makes the toothbrush \\&quot;burp\\&quot;, a tiny pause and beep after each of the first three segments of a cycle, to be also extremely handy.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am VERY pleased with this product, and recommend it unconditionally to anyone seeking to maintain and augment their professional dental</li>
            <li> So far, I am VERY pleased with this product, and recommend it unconditionally to anyone seeking to maintain and augment their professional dental</li>
            <li> Leaves my whole mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does clean better than my previous electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so my brush is always clean and enclosed when I get ready to use it.</li>
            <li> and I really missed that clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth &amp; gums feel really refreshed &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> The different cleaning modes are a nice touch (the Massage mode is quite effective), but I find the standard cleaning method to be more than enough.  </li>
            <li> Performance-wise, I honestly find them exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> , I gently swabbed it with alcohol to clean the filth that had accumulated where the brush mounts.  </li>
            <li> (15 seconds each - good if you want to do a brief brushing after a meal or something), MaxCare (3 minutes, 45 seconds each - 30 seconds normal,</li>
            <li> Now it is much easier to change and keep the brush head / inter-connect area clean.</li>
            <li> Who wants to put slime in their mouth when they are trying to CLEAN their teeth?</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and will repurchase for other family members! :)</li>
            <li> I really liked it over the Oral B because the Brush heads looked more like a traditional toothbrush and seemed to feel better in my mouth vs the round heads of the Oral B.    </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s ridiculous when they don&#x27;t have any type of support for out of warranty, I would be more than willing to pay for a repair or refurb unit at a fair price.</li>
            <li> GumCare&#x27; takes 3 minutes, the first 2 minutes of this mode are just like clean, and the last minute is more of the &#x27;massage&#x27; feature, which is a bit softer and is meant to use for brushing your gums.</li>
            <li> (To be fair, I doubt Philips is the only one who has done this -- Arm &amp; Hammer does it on their baking soda boxes as well, now you&#x27;re supposed to put a new box in the fridge every 30 days -- used to be every 90 days.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare has some nice new features (e.g., massage and sensitive settings and sanitizer)</li>
            <li> SINCE I RECEIVED MY NEW SONICARE FLEXCARE LAST MONTH, I AM DELIGHTED WITH HOW MY DENTAL HEALTH HAS IMPROVED.</li>
            <li> I weighed the cost of this new Sonicare toothbrush against the cost of going to the dentist and decided it was a good investment in my overall health.  </li>
            <li> Good day.n only suggest you to buy new Toothbrush with the 15% discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I can say its a very SMART toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped very promptly and the price was right!    </li>
            <li> LiOn powered model easily lasts 3 or more weeks of daily brushing, is thinner and the new head style (vs the old vibrating magnet style) feels like a more focused brushing.  </li>
            <li> I used to have some cigarette tar underneath my teeth and the only way to get rid is to go to a dentist, but after using this for about 1 month, I am very happy that 80% of those black stains are gone.</li>
            <li> The next best part of the timer is the quadpacer which gives a slight pause to help break up the time brushing into 4 sections.</li>
            <li> This brush has less vibration, and the battery is many times better.  </li>
            <li> Brushing was easy, unobtrusive, and fairly comfortable overall.</li>
            <li> Works fine, brand new.</li>
            <li> As I said I can&#x27;t comment on the durability or long term quality but the performance is amazing.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are nice, although I prefer the larger one (standard vs. compact) to cover more tooth area.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I was looking for; the customer reviews are accurate--the Philips Sonicare Flexcare is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The plaque is smooth normally, so I don&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li> First of all I know it sounds pricey but worth every dime..</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable considering the full 2-year warranty.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is because of the sonic fast pulsing of the brush head and timer that allows me to brush for the full recommended time.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have invested the money in my oral care when this first came out because it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare brushes in general.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested the one-minute GoCare routine and found it acceptable for a rush job, but I much prefer to perform the full MaxCare routine, which runs through a 4-quadrant brush and massage cycle in three minutes.  </li>
            <li> The smaller toothbrush head makes it easy to clean those hard-to-reach places - leaving my teeth and gums shiny and my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> Good excuse to buy a new one!    </li>
            <li> It has appeared in previous models (not my 5300 though), and is nice if you&#x27;ll use it, but I tend to go at my own pace as I focus more on problem areas in my mouth and less on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I turned it off and pressed the head down and took a good look at it.  </li>
            <li> So good that now two other people I know have one from me!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare has a very vigorous, and seemingly very effective, brushing action (the next visit to the dental hygienist will tell the tale).  </li>
            <li> The timer is great because we know we&#x27;ve brushed long enough to keep our teeth clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation to you is that if you are looking for a new toothbrush, and I know you are because you clicked on this product, then buy this toothbrush and enjoy all the oral health benefits that come with owning a sonicare.</li>
            <li> Called Philips and they are sending out a brand new one free of charge.</li>
            <li> Our unit stopped charging after a year, so I chatted online (available 24 hours) with a Phillips rep who said I&#x27;ll get a new unit within 10 days....</li>
            <li> Philips took him at his word and shipped him a brand new brush for free-</li>
            <li> Thi particular model comes able to setup for a new person to Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Wow, when I&#x27;m done brushing with the Sonicare, my whole mouth feels intensely clean and my teeth are as smoothly polished as they get after a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> A few more days went by, my teeth stayed with that smooth clean feeling.</li>
            <li> However, set it to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; as the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode was far too strong and may get your gum to bleed.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is perhaps a bit more useful but still not necessary.    </li>
            <li> Including: quick care, max care, massage, clean, and sensitive.</li>
            <li> The Old Sonicares we had are still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s positioned to easily turn on the tooth brush since it&#x27;s where your thumb would naturally rest.</li>
            <li> I returned to Sonicare after my Oral B Professional died (after several years of good service).</li>
            <li> Friends of ours had the same toothbrush and experienced the SAME thing!  </li>
            <li> I almost threw it away expecting the typical customer service nightmare when I tried to make good on the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I used the UV Sanitizer once, and the brushheads appear \\&quot;dry and nicely warmed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product that should make your next dental appointment for teeth cleaning much easier.    </li>
            <li> The toothbrush not only cleans my teeth a lot better, but keeps them clean for much longer as well, when I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> My old one wasn&#x27;t charging as easily anymore</li>
            <li> The settings allow you to clean your teeth with  regular and easy settings and massage your gums.  </li>
            <li> Seeing HUGE results with my 8 year old in just one week of brushing - SO worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I have this odd sensation that this is what good brushing should feel</li>
            <li> Instead, I have this odd sensation that this is what good brushing should feel like.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally sold on daily use of a Sonicare (along with flossing of course), as the dental hygienist has almost never found plaque in the years since I began using one, and my gum health has been great.  </li>
            <li> It also has a 1 minute cycle that uses the intense vibration for a quick brush.  </li>
            <li> Being a dentist I have used just about every toothbrush out there for free or next to free.  </li>
            <li> Newer head design eliminates having to clean inside the head like in the older designs.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the money, and I&#x27;m glad I finally upgraded to newer cleaning tech!</li>
            <li> It does take a full 10 minutes to complete a full sanitization session, but I just turn on the sanitation while I am showering and/or flossing-</li>
            <li> so he did not have much incentive to steer me to this unless it works), and I have seen my mild gingivitis begin to go away since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The new handle I received in 8/10 JUST DIED OUT AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> Simple design and very easy to use, you can feel it instantly working easier and better than the cheaper rotating brushes.</li>
            <li> The included heads are also very soft and extremely comfortable to brush with&lt;br /&gt;-Battery</li>
            <li> On the regular setting the brush has a bit of a high pitched whine so since then, I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; teeth setting and that works just great.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really massages your gums and cleans your teeth better than any other cheaper battery powered brushes out there and it leaves your mouth with a clean fresh feeling that I have never felt in my life!</li>
            <li> Today I decided to call Philips to see if it would be possible to buy just a new wand (since the UV sanitizer and charging station still works fine) and they are sending us a NEW ONE FOR FREE!!  </li>
            <li> The tingling feeling on teeth and gums is unusual, but not unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I have done the right thing to make sure my teeth are not just pearly white...</li>
            <li> The per head price is still several times what it would cost to buy a new manual brush; but for me the superior cleaningis worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise&lt;br /&gt;-Flexcare models are louder than older models.  </li>
            <li> No problem, the remedy was immediate and very much to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> It is a very comfortable brushing experience overall.</li>
            <li> On my Oral-B I had to remove the brush head to wash out the gunk after brushing, but because the Sonicare brush heads are longer, very, very litle gunk gets in them.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much.  </li>
            <li> I like my Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer very much.</li>
            <li> and they also like it very much.  </li>
            <li> its on, so you only have to exert very light pressure when using it against the&lt;br /&gt;teeth.  </li>
            <li> My wife likes this very much.</li>
            <li> very powerful and cleans good, hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> However, last time I went to the dentist, which was the first time in 3 years, I got a very clean bill of health, for this first time in my life!</li>
            <li> The selection of the various programs which vary in both length and intensity is very easy and the dividing of all these into four quarters, marked by a slight interruption, is a great help in ensuring an all-round cleaning.</li>
            <li> The pop-off heads are a huge improvement over the screw-ons, as many other reviewers have said.     </li>
            <li> but the max care sets the toothbrush for a normal 2 minute clean as well as a 1 minute gum massage setting.    </li>
            <li> They also include a set of three alternate snap-on color rings so multiple family members can easily identify their own brush tip.</li>
            <li> That stopped working just after the warranty for the original handset expired (they don&#x27;t reset the warranty after they send you a new defective handset)</li>
            <li> The UV ray cleaner is a key feature that provides peace of mind that you are using a clean brushing tool free of germs and molecules.</li>
            <li> I had an older version with a battery that finally gave out, so this was a nice upgrade.  </li>
            <li> I particularly feel good about the sanitizer feature, as I can only imagine what types and quantities of germs normally cultivate on the head of a used toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you already have one, I would say you&#x27;ll be fine with the one you have, and suggest perhaps waiting until the price comes down more.</li>
            <li> the flex-care from Sonic-care is even better than our orginal Sonic-care toothbrush, the vibration is very intense and soothing at the same time</li>
            <li> This thing oscilated very fast, If you can get over the feeling of the first time, the way your teeth feel after makes up every time for that first.</li>
            <li> However, as far as the brushing part goes -- my teeth did not restain with coffee and wine as they usually do after the dentist visit, so it does a very good job brushing.</li>
            <li> The little travel charger, which we used on a recent trip, is handy, but it would be nice if it had a couple of pegs to store the brushes on.</li>
            <li> It also has push on brush heads, which is a huge improvement over the old locknut design.</li>
            <li> Plus being able to have two brush heads in the sanitizing unit allowed for me to use different brushes during the morning and evening...</li>
            <li> Considering the higher price, most cannot afford to have this even though it should be attainable and because of that, overall I would rate 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> The first decision I had to make was a rotating head (Oral B) or back-and-forth</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, been using it for a year now</li>
            <li> first use with my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes since they were first introduced.</li>
            <li> i NEVER thought i would pay this much for a toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> No longer using Sonicare in Houston ;-)</li>
            <li> An innovative and terrific design and product.</li>
            <li> The first one to suffer this fate I had stored on the charger every day.</li>
            <li> The most recent one I decided maybe that was the problem</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush - boy</li>
            <li> how well this brush would work until I first tried it.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, not thinking I was going to have problems with a $100 toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t keep it.  </li>
            <li> At least those won&#x27;t fly off into your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast!</li>
            <li> My teeth have felt cleaner and looked whiter consistently since I began using this brush.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was the IntelliClean model.</li>
            <li> Made it to the house faster than the first one.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a couple of days after that Amazon had found problems with the first shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love brushing with this so much, I regularly use the \\&quot;pro-clean\\&quot; timer, and still could keep brushing!</li>
            <li> You have to know why your gum is bleeding first, if it&#x27;s plaque, check that you eat healthy diet, that&#x27;s also another reason to get plaque growing and is not told in the commercial advertisements.</li>
            <li> This is my first high-end toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was a 4000 series Advance model.</li>
            <li> I realized the next evolution of the product was out, and expecting to use the toothbrush for many years to come, decided to pay the extra money for the top of the line version.  </li>
            <li> I love the multiple settings!</li>
            <li> How much whiter my teeth are!</li>
            <li> It really made my day!</li>
            <li> It really made my day!</li>
            <li> At my last cleaning I was told my brushing could not have been better.</li>
            <li> A lot of features if your willing to take the time to remember, so</li>
            <li> I received this for for my birthday last year, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a wedding gift for some friends, and they&#x27;ve told me that it&#x27;s worked out very well for them!</li>
            <li> However, the cost is well worth it if it keeps my teeth and gums in the shape that the product appears to be capable of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that the next time I go in for a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office, I am going to be able to maintain that cleanliness for a LOT longer with my FlexCare than I ever could with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At first, the brush vibrations were tickling my gums.</li>
            <li> I insisted for some days and soon became used to the vibe feeling - not a big deal any more.</li>
            <li> My first one had the on/off button wear through and stop working.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before it feels a bit funny at first</li>
            <li> But make sure you read the brief instruction manual BEFORE you use it</li>
            <li> This is not my first Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Not sorry about purchase, I can see it&#x27;s effects in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I am heartily impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products overall!!</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working at all after 6 months.  </li>
            <li> This is my first battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the amount of build up this sonic brush removed in the first use.</li>
            <li> Areas that build up tartar are feeling as smooth as if I just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> feeling twice a day is pretty luxurious.</li>
            <li> feeling twice a day is pretty luxurious.</li>
            <li> face cleaner first.</li>
            <li> first one worked for 8 months and the replacement worked for 5 months.</li>
            <li> I am sure Philips is going to replace my unit because it is well within the warranty period (2 years) but it is such a hastle</li>
            <li> Even with the two of us using the power head it has more than enough stored power.</li>
            <li> Overall, a outstanding product.</li>
            <li> When I first saw and held the Flexcare, I thought it was going to turn out to be too flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I know I like to get more toothpaste in the middle of my brushing</li>
            <li> the pause part allows me to take a second to spit and reload my toothbrush with more paste, etc.</li>
            <li> They are better than a regular store.</li>
            <li> I have convinced my whole family to buy one!</li>
            <li> It helps me to make sure I&#x27;m taking enough time with all four sections of my mouth.</li>
            <li> used for first time this morning</li>
            <li> I first bought my Flexcare in Nov.2008 after using a Sensonic brush for 9 years</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could tell feel the difference it made.</li>
            <li> It has started turning on in the middle of the night or day by itself and giving us almost a heart attack each time because we can never figure out what the sound is!  </li>
            <li> : Thank you for providing request information.&lt;br /&gt;Harry : What is the exact issue with your toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: it keeps turning on by itself and you can&#x27;t turn it off</li>
            <li> When I changed how I brushed, the results were night and day better.    </li>
            <li> First use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had just begun to enjoy myself, so I started it again, this time switching to Sensitive mode and Massage mode.  </li>
            <li> One of my kids had a dentist visit last week, and his teeth were much better than they used to be.    </li>
            <li> I bought one for my husband first</li>
            <li> So I searched around Amazon for info on the various models and read many reviews,</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years, ever since the first model.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush and I&#x27;m pleased to say it&#x27;s even better than the first or second.  </li>
            <li> The conclusion: I am considering replacing the FlexCare with the Healthy White version, saving about $30.  </li>
            <li> I love Sonicare-but this model seems to have not been tested enough.</li>
            <li> Works much better than a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> First time I have purchaed an electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the reason that the brush handle is now smaller which makes it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the reason that the brush handle is now smaller which makes it more manageable.    </li>
            <li> HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first ones got cracks in them (their support people told me toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide caused them).  </li>
            <li> The more recent models I had (including the one that dispenses toothpaste) collected saliva in the heads and in a cavity in the handle.  </li>
            <li> Since getting this Sonicares, my gum checkups have been stellar.  </li>
            <li> and I love the santizer that assures me that I am not putting germs back into my mouth</li>
            <li> (Yuck-o!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to buy extra brush heads for about $8.50 apiece for a 3-pack, cheaper than retail.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Sonicare toothbrush I have owned.  </li>
            <li> It has not failed me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted over 4 years and this one just crapped out in almost a year.</li>
            <li> I will say that this is the first model I&#x27;ve had problems with.  </li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush but can&#x27;t rationalize buying a third one...</li>
            <li> and I would have to scrub it out with brushes and hot vinegar or rubbing alcohol, it was a pain.</li>
            <li> I had to have the first toothbrush replaced after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> When it worked it was terrific, but I have to think many people are having this problem with the toothbrush dying out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electrical toothbrush</li>
            <li> At first the vibrating almost made my head hurt</li>
            <li> My first unit was replaced through the warranty.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> The second time around I use the \\&quot;Sesitive\\&quot; setting which was more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one of these toothbrushes about two years ago based on a recommendation from my dental hygienist, and I didn&#x27;t know they even existed in this price range until I saw this one.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend tell me I would throw it out after the first use...</li>
            <li> going a hundred times a second, and vibrating the top of your mouth...</li>
            <li> I think its the first try that will make or brake it for you.</li>
            <li> I think that this problem is abetted by the slimmer design of the latest generation, which makes gripping it a tad more difficult.  </li>
            <li> The first sonic lasted 4 years.  </li>
            <li> This product, bought exactly one year ago, worked well for a couple months.</li>
            <li> We bought this newer version of the same brush and continue to be equally pleased with it after 6 months.</li>
            <li> it cycles at a higher speed and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> And the Interplak is similar to and superior to the Braun/Oral B brushes: each tuft rotates, rechargeable batteries are apparently replaceable and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> so i am not too sure how to use them, or rather - what the differences are in the actual brushing...</li>
            <li> Our first electric toothbrush lasted 10 years.    </li>
            <li> However, the design can be improved to prevent it from happening in the first place.  </li>
            <li> The first two just stopped working.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my teeth felt like they had been professionaly cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I visited my dentist a week later, and he remarked at how healthy my gums looked.  </li>
            <li> Something to be aware of before you invest in this product.</li>
            <li> It was my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I felt like I just had a cleaning, I couldnt stop running my tongue over my teeth..</li>
            <li> maybe because this is my first brush.</li>
            <li> My first lasted for almost 10 years before the battery gave out.  </li>
            <li> and I first bought the Oral B version because it was cheaper</li>
            <li> it looks pretty.  </li>
            <li> but did i mention my toothbrush is now pretty?</li>
            <li> and glad I purchased on with multiple options/settings.</li>
            <li> Phillips, I will make deviled eggs for your next company picnic; I love you.</li>
            <li> The shorter one has a concave bristle surface; the longer one has a double-concave surface and has a larger set of bristles, and is supposed to do a more through cleaning job.</li>
            <li> I use that one; the smaller one seems better suited for a child.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever purchased and used an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and they were each better than their earlier versions so this is not a surprise.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still on the first charge.  </li>
            <li> Although I balked at the price of the toothbrush, when I made up my mind to attack my dental problems the Sonicare Toothbrush was the first to come to mind.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare Flexcare w/ Sanitizer for exactly three days now.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my recent upgrade from my old model to this one.</li>
            <li> Although the brush heads are still pretty spendy.</li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ll ignore the fact that I found the two pack with an extra handle at Costco for $[...] more than I paid for this just three weeks after I got it for the purposes of this review</li>
            <li> first brush:  </li>
            <li> (I guess I should have listened to the person who said to turn it on only once it is touching your teeth)</li>
            <li> Ok, back to my story.  </li>
            <li> BUT Philips has been nothing short of FANTASTIC in replacing these under warranty!</li>
            <li> Philips replaced the first two, but we received the third one more than a year ago so if we want another one, we have to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I also like being able to have different modes of cleaning, for thorough versus on-the-run toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li> Of course, you&#x27;ll be able to buy extra brushes, but there&#x27;s no holder for them.  </li>
            <li> It will feel like an overpowered rocket in your mouth the first time or two</li>
            <li> I use the sanitizer every time I brush not because i&#x27;m a germaphobe, but because I&#x27;m drawn to things that are shiny and pretty</li>
            <li> I use the sanitizer every time I brush not because i&#x27;m a germaphobe, but because I&#x27;m drawn to things that are shiny and pretty</li>
            <li> My teeth also look much whiter and that is another reason to smile.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has kept me out of the dentist office for repairs since I bought the first one 4 or 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> were cleaner for those first couple weeks than they had been in weeks.  </li>
            <li> The soft travel case is just a cheap fabric bag to throw the brush in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Denmark and here we have 2 years warranty on all electronics, so i&#x27;m pretty pissed that it choose to die 2 month out of warranty.</li>
            <li> I know this is a problem your company is aware of because there are hundreds of reviews out there about this issue.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to share our entire conversation today with the Amazon community.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to share our entire conversation today with the Amazon community.</li>
            <li> The compact head is much better than the standard.</li>
            <li> First of all, there&#x27;s a battery meter.</li>
            <li> It lights up pretty.</li>
            <li> I purchased the flexCare with the sanitizer as a replacement for an old Sonic Care A model:  Advanced.  </li>
            <li> When I discovered the loss, the first thing I did was to go online and immediately purchase another.</li>
            <li> I had:&lt;br /&gt;+This brush is much smaller and the rubber is more ergonomic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brushing system seems to work very well!    </li>
            <li> Then the whole cycle starts over!  </li>
            <li> This is the second electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned and mostly love it.</li>
            <li> I have only had this toothbrush for two days now and I have to say that I am in love already.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips, I am sold for life!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty vigorous and with the three speeds</li>
            <li> This toothbrush takes some getting used to at first.  </li>
            <li> You sort of get a tickling sensation when you first use this brush if you are not use to sonic-type toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> It was almost unbearable at first</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled I even spent $62 and got my daughter the kid one.</li>
            <li> I had heard of this toothbrush first from a friend of mine and then from the dentist who cares for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush, it comes with a sterilizing home for your brushes, with enough room for two heads.</li>
            <li> It has many different features for brushing.</li>
            <li> After trying the first time - she said it literally shakes her brain.  </li>
            <li> I love this Sonicare Toothbrush for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> I really love that you can get two different size brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Exactly one month out of the 2 year warranty, the toothbrush died on me.</li>
            <li> Being a dental care professional, when I called the Philips service center to address my concerns, their reply was perfunctory at best and only emphasized the fact that my warranty had expired.  </li>
            <li> first got us on Sonicare about 6 years</li>
            <li> I expect a top of the line, Flexcare to last longer than 2 years and 5 months - this company has perfected planned obsolesence - beware!</li>
            <li> my dad never used the one I bought him so after my first one burnt out in 2 years</li>
            <li> I wish I would of kept track of the first 2 I bought but out</li>
            <li> It worked well for the first year.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that just that fact might be enough to get me to pay more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the most standard setting is default.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be easier to use or to use exactly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Of course I purchased it because it was my first electric brush</li>
            <li> that is why I first purchased the Oral-Bs</li>
            <li> The product is great, Sonicare as a company sucks.  </li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth much better than a regular toothbrush, based on research I did on the effects of brushing with a 31,000 movements per minute toothbrush.</li>
            <li> had this most recent one now over 6 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, this is my first electric toothbrush that cost over 20$.</li>
            <li> just kidding, that&#x27;s what the package says but I ended up charging mine for about 6 hours before using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Simple operation, made even more simple by reading the manual</li>
            <li> Our entire family uses Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes and love them.</li>
            <li> it felt funny in the mouth</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips!</li>
            <li> The sanitizer activates with a simple push of the button on top of the unit and shuts off automatically when it completes the sanitizing cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, but after several weeks, I love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t life be easier first thing in the morning??).   </li>
            <li> The first symptom after just 45 days of use was the the brush head would no longer seat properly...causing the brush head to vibrate off.  </li>
            <li> let alone in the first 90 days.      </li>
            <li> Not only do me and my wife love this product our Dentist loves it and</li>
            <li> exactly what they wanted</li>
            <li> The vibration was generated internally in the handle and transmitted to the brush head by means of metal feet in the brush head, resting on the top of the interior of the brush handle.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and especially use the massage mode of brushing often.</li>
            <li> This appliance works exactly as they state.  </li>
            <li> Thought at first</li>
            <li> The timer helps make sure you take enough time in all quadrants.</li>
            <li> The first one stoped working after 6 months, and I thongh that my son broke it.</li>
            <li> and my dentist said that an electric toothbrush would help (along with more regular flossing and rinsing).  </li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product if you want something to last more than 2 year or so.  </li>
            <li> Even though I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s cleaning or protecting from bacteria, it definitely makes me feel that it&#x27;s sanitized.</li>
            <li> Noticed my teeth were whiter after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> The battery is not holding charge as it was when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I love sonic, have owned several of them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last July and love the toothbrush, however, I&#x27;ve had issues with the sanitizer not working.  </li>
            <li> It worked at first and then stopped.  </li>
            <li> All round good feeling.</li>
            <li> So I got a replacement from Philips and it was all good for a few months until it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a quick clean cycle and a gentle setting for those with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The brushing action also feels more powerful than the old design.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months, my dentist noticed that my teeth were as good as when I was using the Sonicare - plus</li>
            <li> I already got a good checkup from&lt;br /&gt;my dentist after using it a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a new one that also worked great for a little over a year</li>
            <li> I had a dry run at cleaning this unit and changing the bulb and it is all very easy to disassemble and reassemble so</li>
            <li> done brushing with the Sonic (other than when the dentist cleans them), so if you&#x27;re looking for clean and healthy teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Philips expects you to remove the battery for special disposal and toss the rest of the brush away, then buy a new one.   </li>
            <li> /DOCUMENTATION&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to find that not only does this product come with very informative, concise written instructions, but the manuals can also be easily downloaded from the Philips&#x27; website in PDF format.  </li>
            <li> Never before has a toothbrush made my teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning!    </li>
            <li> It was very hard to clean, but this toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li> This new brush has far more power than the version I had, which was the version before the Elites (and Phillips&#x27; purchase of Sonicare).  </li>
            <li> Go Care Routine shortines the standard 2 minute clean mode to 1 minute, while Max Care is a longer, 3 minute cycle that includes both clean and massage mode.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and the sanitizer keeps the brush clean and dry.</li>
            <li> This model is quite a bit lighter than some of the previous ones which makes it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> My teeth just feel cleaner and my biannual cleanings seem to go more smoothly (my hygienist seems to have way less scraping to do).</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit in 2009, it became very loud and didn&#x27;t vibrate as effectively a year later.</li>
            <li> Now however, Sonicare has changed that with their new model, the Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this model because it was recommended by a dentist who said that the new Flexcare is not just a new style of brush, but that it actually has a greatly improved brushing technology.  </li>
            <li> First the original I picked up in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> If you are a regular flosser/good brusher, or you own an older Sonicare, you probably don&#x27;t want 14 days of gentle ramping up.</li>
            <li> Turning the toothbrush on for the first time didn&#x27;t alleviate my nervousness much, as the device certainly SOUNDS powerful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different, but it works very well and my most recent checkups have been much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I went with this instead of the Oral B Braun one I used to own that last only a few years</li>
            <li> Really gets to the back teeth very comfortably and the pulsation of the brush head against the teeth is just like the one you feel at your dentists.  </li>
            <li> Try the regular clean for a full cycle and then use the massage setting.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricy but appears to be well built so it will pay for itself; I was really surprised at how clean my teeth felt after the first use.    </li>
            <li> Now my teeth feel smooth and clean all day long.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; back and forth (thus reducing gum irritation), but still get very clean teeth after each sonic</li>
            <li> and they just sent me a brand new replacement (actually an upgraded model) free of charge after a quick webchat!</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product so far since it is far better and seems to clean better than my old toothbrush did.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to note whether it&#x27;s a lot better, but it is a lot more invigorating</li>
            <li> Some advice from other reviewers here came in handy</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare was over 12 years old and still doing well.   </li>
            <li> I tried two other battery toothbrushes and liked the process but knew I needed a rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth which I consider to be sensitive (It wasn&#x27;t until the age of 31 that I had my first filling).  </li>
            <li> It broke due to my own clumsiness.</li>
            <li> In fact, I kind of have to laugh a little at those who complain about the noise it makes.</li>
            <li> I specially love the UV clean option, and it&#x27;s much quieter than other brands.</li>
            <li> My previous brush came with a hard plastic case that fit the brush head and handle perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable grip and long (1-2 weeks) battery life.</li>
            <li> The actual cleaning is better than any other toothbrush I have used, and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The best feature, other than the thorough cleaning itself,  is that the program ensures you brush for the proper length of time and that you spend an equal amount of time in each of the four quadrants of your mouth (top inside, top outside, bottom inside, bottom outside.)         </li>
            <li> /&gt;Successfully meeting my 2 requirements for being happy with my new tooth brush, the Sonicare went above and beyond when it comes to the actual brushing.</li>
            <li> All of these options have an amazing slight pause every 30 seconds, that you use to make sure you are spending equal time in each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing much easier and pleasant, especially when you have stitches in your mouth and can barely open your mouth.</li>
            <li> Unlike the old screw on type, the brush pulls off and is easier to manage (and keep clean).  </li>
            <li> It also has three settings on it: Clean, Massage, and Sensitive.</li>
            <li> While brushing in the clean mode, it would switch to the \\&quot;massage mode\\&quot; or the \\&quot;sensitive mode\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> However, even knowing it will not last forever, I consider the price a worthy investment for the time I do get to use it and am happy to replace it every few years.</li>
            <li> Philips has not taken the design responsibility to put a soft rubber/plastic on the back of the brush head, so you will have to take care on your own.  </li>
            <li> Got it because my dentist said the oscillating action this model has was good to not only brush the teeth, but that it would scrub away plaque from between teeth and along gum lines better than my old &#x27;up-and-down&#x27; electric or regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and really like the different brushing cycles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  </li>
            <li> The removable, replaceable brush heads themselves come with bristles which are actually nice and soft - just like your dentist would likely recommend.</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;d like to be able to do is to \\&quot;program\\&quot; the brush to do the 3-minute brushing mode every time by default (this mode does the brushing action and also the massage action.)  </li>
            <li> It will be of no suprise to hear that for the first time in that period of use I needed a filling for the first time in 17 years, and another filling came out all together, my gums became very sore from the oral b</li>
            <li> More Crud in the Handle!&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with my old brush was that old toothpaste/drool/water tended to collected in the space where the handle connects to the brush head.  </li>
            <li> First, I love the timer that tell you how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> it is expensive, but it really does the best job without hurting your gums.  </li>
            <li> Also, I could have done without the UV Sanitizer, but I do use it at least once a week, especially when I have a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, customer service is really excellent.  </li>
            <li> Of course, there are major flaws and if another brand comes out with something better I will be quick to switch, so they really need to put in some more R&amp;D to improve these few flaws before someone else comes out with a product that does...</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> And what a big difference it makes to the feeling of a clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I have braces and since day one, I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush for better cleaning, less flossing (sensitive gums;bleed easily), and overall better care of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> PS, the free shipping came three days earlier, only took one day shipped to my city, that was a Huge surprise!</li>
            <li> I think this is the best toothbrush I have ever had so far and have had a few of the earlier models</li>
            <li> My teeth look much whiter, even after the first time (I&#x27;m a coffee, tea, and cola</li>
            <li> However, I may change my mind about this when I find out how much it saves me in dental bills ... not to mention how much &amp;#34;chair time&amp;#34; it may save me when I&#x27;m AT the dentist&#x27;s office!  </li>
            <li> , the battery is lasting over 2 weeks before needing recharge, comes with two different sized brush heads so you can choose which is more comfortable for you.      </li>
            <li> I am grateful for having the toothbrush for so long as I sincerely enjoyed this product</li>
            <li> Apparently Biology labs use UV light to sanitize their workspace</li>
            <li> With my first, according to the dentist there was much improvement in the health of my gums...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The default setting of \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; was too intense the first time around.</li>
            <li> The design of this brush is smaller than my last model, which makes it more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer was an added plus, even though I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s useful (other than making me THINK I&#x27;m using a cleaner toothbrush as a result).</li>
            <li> My teeth feel noticeably cleaner and smoother after brushing with the FlexCare, pretty much like when you get them cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The power button is logically placed just under your thumb, and all you really need to do is turn it on and brush.</li>
            <li> I first read the reviews, I didn&#x27;t really believe that the flexcare would make a difference whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love that it holds charge for so long.</li>
            <li> the higher end models have a much longer battery life.</li>
            <li> I also believe that the UV sanitizes is a big marketing scam, its nothing more than a fancy brush head holder that can give you a blue light show when you push the button.  </li>
            <li> It may not be cheap but its a sound investment in your mouth and is alot cheaper than what you will pay for dental work due to decay.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pressing, really. ;)</li>
            <li> It was an OralB product and I was quite satisfied with it as long as it worked.</li>
            <li> - it comes with one full size brush and one \\&quot;compact\\&quot; brush which is designed for a two year old.  </li>
            <li> On top of that it has a basic clean, sensitive, massage, quick clean (15 seconds for section) and  max care that is like the usual clean but adds in 15 seconds of massaging at the end of each section (i use this one all the time).</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but the clean feel and the obvious whiter appearance makes this product well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My teeth are definitely whiter after a month of steady use and my mouth has never felt better.    </li>
            <li> 11/13/09 - I had older Sonicare and after years of use/abuse it finally died when it hit the floor one too many times.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased my Flexcare in September 2009, I&#x27;d owned three Sonicares before (two Advances over a several-year period, each lasting 3-4 years, which in my mind is OK, and one of the battery-operated ones for extended travel, since the older models didn&#x27;t have dual-voltage chargers).    </li>
            <li> Typically I am pretty frugal and don&#x27;t like to spend that much money on something that seems so trivial, but Sonicare really makes you feel like it&#x27;s worth the high price.</li>
            <li> So an economical and logical person would find out how much it would cost to buy a replacement battery and replace it instead of dropping another $120 on a brand new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> have never used an electric toothbrush of any kind before, and although I&#x27;ve been intrigued by the idea for some time, I was a little nervous to use this one at first.  </li>
            <li> - smaller toothbrush head is more comfortable  - easier to clean and to keep clean (no more gunky buildup inside the brush!)    </li>
            <li> The different modes are a great feature as stupid as they may seem, but I love using the timer function depending on what kind of brushing session I am looking for.</li>
            <li> It is at first a bit hard and surprising to use for people not accustom to it /</li>
            <li> I only use one- full power baby!  </li>
            <li> When the new one began spontaneously turning itself on recently I contacted Phillips and they agreed to promptly send me a new one at no charge -- covered by the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> because Phillips took the &amp;#34;high road&amp;#34; and actually did something very rare now a days and treated the customer fairly, I would definitely buy this same brush again and will recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do?&lt;br /&gt;Harry : All the Sonicare toothbrush are electrically welded and non-repairable unit.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: is it normal for a 150 dollar toothbrush to break right over 2 years?&lt;br /&gt;Harry :</li>
            <li> do?&lt;br /&gt;Harry : All the Sonicare toothbrush are electrically welded and non-repairable unit.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: is it normal for a 150 dollar toothbrush to break right over 2 years?&lt;br /&gt;Harry :</li>
            <li> That being said, this one is by far my favorite for one VERY important reason - NO MORE GUNK in the brush heads.      </li>
            <li> However, for those of us thatfeel off track, you first two steps is to get this toothbrush (and don&#x27;t look back) and find a dentist you feel comfortable with and create a plan to regain optimal oral health.     </li>
            <li> Several of the comments have said that the buttons on the front get bumped too easily and you find yourself changing brushing modes even when you don&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li> I do use the clean mode most of the time, but I have also used the massage mode occasionally at night to get the extra gum stimulation.</li>
            <li> A longer timed session, made easy to time with the above mention</li>
            <li> A longer timed session, made easy to time with the above mention quadpacing feature.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my oral hygiene, flossing every day too.</li>
            <li> At first, you may not even bat an eye at this price and assume that the price is somehow justified by the technology in the toothbrush head, but when you take a close look at the toothbrush head you&#x27;ll see that the head has no moving parts and that it&#x27;s the handle that simply vibrates.</li>
            <li> It does take a few uses to get completely accustomed to the experience, but the end result is remarkable.  </li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the extra button is too easy to press accidentally while holding the brush.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush handle is light-weighted overall, slim and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and are more white than when I used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It comes with a very stylish and functional travel case and a tiny travel charger (though you won&#x27;t need it for a short stay, since it holds a charge for 2wks).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has several modes.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the two brush head holders in the sanitizer make it easy for two people to share the Sonicare and have their individual brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The brush handle is smaller and the brush heads are easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> , the white plastic tends to stain easily.</li>
            <li> had purchased two of these (one with the sanitizer) because I was unaware how easy it was to change brush heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement parts - Brush heads are easily ordered through [...], but I am uncertain if they can be purchased in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Replacement parts - Brush heads are easily ordered through [...], but I am uncertain if they can be purchased in local stores.  </li>
            <li> device itself was easy to install (you&#x27;ll have to wait two hours after initially charging the unit before you can use it).</li>
            <li> Using the Sonicare was extremely easy - there&#x27;s a button on the back of the toothbrush unit that you have to press in order to activate the brush.</li>
            <li> All I know is, a pretty blue light comes on when you hit the button.</li>
            <li> If you do get one, realize the first time you use it, your gums will freak out; it kind of tickles, but it is not a comfortable feeling.  </li>
            <li> Although my lips didn&#x27;t appreciate the tingle for a few days, that has now gone away and I am able to benefit from the full cycle.</li>
            <li> Apparently for the first 15 uses it doesn&#x27;t vibrate at full power in an attempt to get you used to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a bit larger and bulkier but its going strong after 2 or 3 years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t feel like a good person returning a toothbrush for no other reason than my own disbelief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I certainly didn&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> I use the UV sanitizer about once a week; I have no problem getting the two brush heads (both large) in place.  </li>
            <li> But it certainly can&#x27;t hurt, and if nothing else, the chamber provides a dust-free environment for the brush head, instead of just sitting in the medicine cabinet or in a toothbrush holder where it gathers dust all day.     </li>
            <li> It certainly gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It certainly operates as intended mechanically.</li>
            <li> and even if i did, i could just bring a regular toothbrush and leave my new treasured toothbrush safely at home.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with new smaller brush and UV cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Most recently I purchased a new model from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have a new toothbrush, same model, and I still love it.</li>
            <li> The top where you attach the brush head was loose and no longer vibrated.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s unlike anything you&#x27;ve likely experienced previously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are three main programmes to use, Clean, Sensitive and Massage..</li>
            <li> Using the sanitizer is easy, just pop the brush head(s) in, press the green button, and wait for the UV light to kill the germs.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never owned a Sonicare, you will probably find this toothbrush to be really noisy and much heavier than a normal toothbrush, but that&#x27;s because it actually cleans significantly better than a toothbrush, leaving you with that</li>
            <li> I love the brush, the small piece to travel with, the fresh feeling after brushing, the timer to make sure I spend enough time everywhere.</li>
            <li> The third replacement unit I got has been working fine for over a year.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is loaded with features that really make sense for someone with an active lifestyle and does a fantastic job--easy to use, efficient, and clean.  </li>
            <li> It did exactly the same thing my original brush did.</li>
            <li> My teeth are slicker after one use, I&#x27;m now brushing the recommended length of time, I use far less toothpaste per year, and my gum health showed incredible improvement after only two weeks of use!  </li>
            <li> My last couple of SonicCare&#x27;s withstood my toothpaste fine.  </li>
            <li> The regular \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; cycle (30 seconds of cleaning per quadrant) is fine for the morning brushing.  </li>
            <li> I brushed for about 60 seconds (using a clock with a second hand to make sure I did 15 seconds in each quarter of my mouth) just to be sure I was following the recommended useage for this first time.  </li>
            <li> replacement price for the exact same toothbrush without the charging station and UV Sanitizer (which I originally purchased as a package) is $149.</li>
            <li> While I have been satisfied with the OralB toothbrushes I have been using for years, the dual voltage recharger on the Sonicare got me interested as I do alot of foreign travelling.  </li>
            <li> I must say initially the Sonicare was more powerful than realized and it took a few times before being able to use it at the normal speed.  </li>
            <li> Junk (original toothbrush), junk (first replacement), junk (second replacement), junked.</li>
            <li> For four years my dentist was amazed at how clean my teeth were (and I barely flossed).     </li>
            <li> As you get older, you need to purchase this to avoid any gum recession or to improve the gums, as I have found!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular model for over 4 years!</li>
            <li> , I imagine the margins are *very* high on the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> You can set it to either the normal &#x27;clean&#x27; setting, &#x27;sensitive&#x27;, or &#x27;massage&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might just be the first time, but every time since then i get the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I thought I might have gotten him something a little more exciting</li>
            <li> It was a little more expesive, but definetly well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This little unit works great and is a terrific value.</li>
            <li> We wanted the ability to \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the brush heads in the little capsule but honestly, I have no idea if that makes much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week because, as people have stated before, being TOO clean can lead to your body being unable to fight off bacteria, or bacteria becoming more resistant.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly wait for it to charge overnight to get a good and thorough cleaning.     </li>
            <li> One feature she touted was that the brush will stop if you push too hard, which is good for me and my brushing style.  </li>
            <li> The colored rings certainly come in handy when two people living in the same household use the same model</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;GoCare\\&quot; cycle (15 seconds of cleaning per quadrant) is fine if you&#x27;re in a hurry, or just want to touch up The \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; cycle will probably come in handy as I ease back into brushing following any future dental work or periodontal surgery.</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare toothbrush stopped working after one and a half years, and philips sent a free replacement.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to add to what others have said, but go into any store that sells Sonicare toothbrushes and you will immediately see that this model is much slimmer and more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The new handle design is much easier to clean than my old brush.  </li>
            <li> I have not changed my toothpaste, yet I am convinced that my teeth are at least twice as bright as they were before I started using the FlexCare.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is quite attractive; brushed chrome front with all kinds of lights to show the setting (chosen with an oblong button below the on/off button) and a green charging indicator--three full-on lights indicating that the brush is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work great, just frustrating to have to plow so much money into it.  </li>
            <li> If the tooth brush does indeed last for two years, it&#x27;s still a huge expense.</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush has made such a huge difference in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> So, after research, the reviews really spoked for themselves.</li>
            <li> I recomment this product for it&#x27;s ability, design and features although I am unsure what difference the \\&quot;UV light\\&quot; sanitizer really makes.</li>
            <li> The brush IS very pricey but consider this product if you really care about your dental upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I really have valued my Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very noticeable difference when using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> A very well thought out toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great for Philips bottom line, not great for the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I was really brushing my teeth until I used this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to my dentist for having one of these in his waiting room for his patients to play around with.    </li>
            <li> Honestly, I am very please with it at this point.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made too much use of all of the cleaning modes.  </li>
            <li> I tried out the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; mode, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> How can that be if they only fit on one way?   </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried an electric or sonic toothbrush before, you really have to try this.  </li>
            <li> This model is lighter in weight,sleek works very well</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s fantastic and I can&#x27;t write enough superlatives about it.</li>
            <li> You can hold it at the very end and not have this problem</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of the UV cleaner too.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and none of the headaches.    </li>
            <li> On the downside, it is a bit noisey and tickles a bit too much at firstl.  </li>
            <li> Should toothbrushing really cost this much?</li>
            <li> ; didn&#x27;t really care that I got a sanitizer</li>
            <li> Aside from the two handles (handle is really just Sonicare lingo for toothbrush)</li>
            <li> really triggered me to write this review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used manual or cheap battery powered toothbrush my entire life so</li>
            <li> I really like how the brush works (when it&#x27;s working).  </li>
            <li> The travel charger doesn&#x27;t fit into the travel case; only the toothbrush itself fits.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably pricedas</li>
            <li> The 2-minutes always end too fast for me.  </li>
            <li> The one issue with this toothbrush is that it isn&#x27;t very reliable long-term.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself cleans very well</li>
            <li> My gums don&#x27;t bleed, yet my teeth feel so much cleaner than with the manual</li>
            <li> I opted for massage where the brush cleans for thirty seconds and then massages for fifteen seconds of each part of the cycle (there being fours parts in total, outside top teeth, inside top teeth, outside bottom teeth and inside bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> &quot; brushing at the end then stop it yourself because it will just go through the whole 2 minutes again.  </li>
            <li> I use the UV about once a week to really combat the germs.  </li>
            <li> So, after much research, I settled on the Phillips Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li> I can say that she absolutely loves hers as much as I do mine.       </li>
            <li> It is a shame that Philips is getting these product manufactured in the cheap chinese factories instead of in Germany which is renowned for the quality and reliability of its products.</li>
            <li> The charger with UV sanitizer is also quite slim and fits onto my sink/countertop without taking up much room at all.</li>
            <li> It would have made brushing much easier.</li>
            <li> The three speeds are a much improvement over the Elite (one speed) and the sanitizer is an added feature that exemplifies itself.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can just stand there and hold it against my teeth with a gentle touch and it does all of the work for me.</li>
            <li> This one also came with the UV sanitizer which I really like.     </li>
            <li> The article I purchased is working very well and it is what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I called customer service and all they could do was say \\&quot;sorry.\\&quot; Thanks that helps.</li>
            <li> whole package (plastic) is fully sealed up.</li>
            <li> really know when to charge it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> So, after one month of gentle use the sanitizer broke and won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the motor action which is powerful.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels and is  so much cleaner, my gums are healthier</li>
            <li> it really does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The sanitizer hasn&#x27;t been of much use, neither has all the settings.</li>
            <li> I did have the old sonicare model and it died after just a few months, but these have worked great so far.</li>
            <li> My wife is very concerned about keeping her teeth cleand and flossed.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I don&#x27;t really trust it.  </li>
            <li> I am living proof that it really works.</li>
            <li> Amazon customer service were very understanding and helped a lot.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is a real value.  </li>
            <li> Our teeth feel and look so much cleaner since using this</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner than they did with a brush.  </li>
            <li> It applies pressure yet feels gentle to the teeth.</li>
            <li> The difference here is also very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The Flexcare bristles are like a modern toothbrush with contours to match my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The vibration is intense, but I started with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting and within 1-2 weeks I was using the \\&quot;maxcare\\&quot; setting.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perplexed by the people who give this brush a low rating.  </li>
            <li> After researching and pricing the different Sonicare products available, I chose to get him this Flexcare system.  </li>
            <li> We give it five stars and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel like we just came from the denist&#x27;s office and our gums are much healthier.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and read some reviews that I thought were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> This really is the evolution of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You really do feel the difference.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a high-pitch to it which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but the real story is in the vibration.  </li>
            <li> If you brush twice a day, it becomes too much of a bother to remove the brush head every time and put it in the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> Especially after he handed me a manual toothbrush for free in my sample packet.</li>
            <li> but this is very neat for storing our brush heads anyway.</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is also a neat and very convenient attachment---</li>
            <li> I had read one review where someone mentioned that they don&#x27;t use the sanitizer because they fear that it&#x27;ll just leave the UV resistant bacteria like when antibiotics are used to much.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s really nothing that is UV resistant just because of how UV affects DNA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much to pay for so-so quality.</li>
            <li> It really delivers on what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li> i am very statisfied with it...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on the longevity yet, but it seems to be a very well made product</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is powerful, but just push dirt up to near and under the gum.  </li>
            <li> This is comfortable to use, has preprogrammed cycles for different types of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are a bit pricey but this brush really performs.  </li>
            <li> is really making your teeth and gums look better.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> After using the toothbrush, I was convinced that my teeth felt much cleaner and smoother than they ever had when using a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (Amazon.com&#x27;s shipping is also very prompt.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a very thrifty person like me to write this 5-star review for this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it really does the job..</li>
            <li> but I did it because I HAVE to (no one wants stinky breath).  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing much.  </li>
            <li> I was really worried because I have rather tender gums with some receeding gum lines; I was surprized that this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt me anywhere.</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer is one of those things you really didn&#x27;t know you needed</li>
            <li> and you will be much happier.</li>
            <li> I actually received this toothbrush free as a product test over a year ago</li>
            <li> However, I waited for years to purchase one because I thought the price was too much</li>
            <li> The sonicare brush also made it easy to get the teeth further back in my mouth really clean.  </li>
            <li> Now I see the same type of cheap rubber is being used for the Sonicare FlexCare model.</li>
            <li> Much lighter.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I really like the three brushing cycles 1-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> brushes are the only ones available.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like paying so much for a tooth brush</li>
            <li> 2 years in it is very sturdy and still cranking.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much cleaner and brighter</li>
            <li> , that has really pissed me off...</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if this device could take tar off a roof with how fast it vibrates.  </li>
            <li> Well, for two weeks my mouth felt numb after each use, which would have dropped my rating to two stars when balanced with the excellent results.  </li>
            <li> However, for short trips I&#x27;m going to bring a cheap disposable electric in a travel sanitizer</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li> However, for short trips I&#x27;m going to bring a cheap disposable electric in a travel sanitizer</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li> (Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
            <li> so I was very happy to have the sanitizer to help kill any germs if I did get his cold.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is much easier to use than my old one - this is much lighter and easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that much of a difference in models.</li>
            <li> Is that really of any use to anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can adjust the type and strength of vibration, you have a timer that encourages you to keep brushing, a travel charger and a very neat UV</li>
            <li> Also, the whole thing is designed as if for one person, with just two, different-sized brushes.  </li>
            <li> Still, over 5 years, the price of this model isn&#x27;t too much to spend on your teeth.</li>
            <li> not something I really focused on...</li>
            <li> I also like that it is very compact, making it quite convenient for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like that it is very compact, making it quite convenient for travel.    </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped this so fast</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is fairly fast</li>
            <li> it really is just a pause.    </li>
            <li> I know, I know, that much for a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Compared to the advance, the design is much improved.</li>
            <li> With the screw on models, gunk and grime would build up underneath the threads which made me very queasy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a sonicare, don&#x27;t worry too much.</li>
            <li> The features are fantastic - I especially like the GoCare</li>
            <li> who knows what it really does but it makes me think \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Two things I really like about these model.  </li>
            <li> if you want it you might as well pay extra for shipping because it will take 3 weeks to get to you with the free ship.</li>
            <li> They were courtious and very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I noted in another review that the reviewer was concerned about too much sanitizing and use of anti-bacterials.  </li>
            <li> Who knows if it makes much of a difference.    </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is enough, but all of the included accessories are of fantastic quality as well.</li>
            <li> It really changed me</li>
            <li> and I never use a manual toothbrush anymore unless I absolutely have to and without my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Normally, the brushes are evidently meant to be stored within the sanitizer, and the sanitizer run every time the brushes are used.</li>
            <li> Battery charge meter is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> So much for buying Philips products from now on.    </li>
            <li> and it looks like Sonicare really worked to improve their quality.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the addition of the UV Sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> When I thought about the price--and complete lack of fun--involved in getting my head drilled, I decided a hundred bucks was worth the investment to avoid a cavity.  </li>
            <li> When the commercials say \\&quot;straight from the dentist clean\\&quot;, its no joke.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I wonder about how much whiter my teeth could be.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely does.  </li>
            <li> Used with a whitener in toothpaste, works really well.</li>
            <li> UV Sanitizer adds a high-tech functionality to the whole package, even though I cannot vouch for its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> The unit&#x27;s design makes it easy to clean off toothpaste residue, there is not much vibration in the handle, and given the vigor of the brushhead&#x27;s action, I do not mind the \\&quot;bumblebee on</li>
            <li> NiMH AA rechargeable batteries that one could insert into the barrel of the body, without too much added bulk added to the handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> NiMH AA rechargeable batteries that one could insert into the barrel of the body, without too much added bulk added to the handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes attach to the handle much easier now.  </li>
            <li> soak the heads in Listerine if you are that much of a germ a phobe.  </li>
            <li> out the sanitizer for nearly as much money</li>
            <li> The battery life is also excellent, I have only charged it three times in the last three months, brushing twice daily for the regular advised time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought this one and really like it...hoping it lasts....</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, my gums are healthier and my whole mouth just feels cleaner.  </li>
            <li> This brush really does leave my mouth with a cleaner feeling than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a manual brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, your dentist can prescribe you a rinse with chlorhexidine that will really help to reduce frequency and/or length of irritation by the cancer sores*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent product I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t know if I really need this much teeth cleaning power.</li>
            <li> I am very thorough when it comes to cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> I am really bummed out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very reliable toothbrush</li>
            <li> I was going to buy an Oral B Pro 5000, but these were on sale for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Since I lived a toothbrush sanitizer free life before, I can only assume my lot has improved.ust 1).  </li>
            <li> Since I lived a toothbrush sanitizer free life before, I can only assume my lot has improved.</li>
            <li> toothbrush itself vibrated too much</li>
            <li> I solved both of these issues with this Sonicare, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s where they really make their money</li>
            <li> I saw the much lower price on Amazon, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I purchase the Soniccare about a month ago,It really does feel like you just had your teeth cleaned by a dentist,</li>
            <li> Keep in mind it will take about a week to really feel the diffence,But for the parents out there&lt;</li>
            <li> Thanks, Karen</li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothbrush is packaged with a number of items, including a travel case and a travel charger which packs in a toiletry bag much easier than the countertop charger with the built in sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t spare my teeth that extra two minutes, and my dental health is important.  </li>
            <li> area is the real kicker.  </li>
            <li> I personally enjoy using mine and would recommend it without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my Philips Sonicare died last week.</li>
            <li> and I really do not regret it:-)    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The ability to customize the way you brush without compromising the quality of the cleaning is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge very well.  </li>
            <li> Another gift for my son and he really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> I was taking care of it more carefully than my car.</li>
            <li> It is very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, it turns on by itself like very five minutes.  </li>
            <li> Much improved gum health and teeth appearance with the help of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I used an Oral-B electric toothbrush, and I liked it quite a bit when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> I had settled on the Sonic Elite, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled to hear about the messy part</li>
            <li> At my recent check up, I was told my brushing has been effective because I had no cavities or extensive plaque build up.</li>
            <li> It is never to late to start good hygene start today.  </li>
            <li> The brush body is smaller and much more ergonomic than my old model, and angled for easier use.</li>
            <li> I found out that they have a 30 day money back deal direct from the manufacturer (check to make sure it still applies before buying)</li>
            <li> That is the only thing about this toothbrush that bothers me, but clearly I liked it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush makes it possible for me to reach all my teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li> We could not turn it off, but it went off eventually on its own, only to go back on.  </li>
            <li> I started with the sensitive program which found out later by reading more of the manual</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still very satisfied and will definitely purchase a new one when mine ultimately dies.  </li>
            <li> a little high for most - more likely a luxury expense or gift item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pricing a little high for most - more likely a luxury expense or gift item.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts twice as long as the previous ones and the sanitizer is a great addition.</li>
            <li> (Apparently these replacement heads cost less, so that&#x27;s good.)    </li>
            <li> Its a very nice brush, and my teeth have never felt cleaner (I can tell my 10 year old model had apparently slowed down a bit).    </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, heads for Flexcare units are actually a cheaper than the older models; you get 3 Flexcare heads for the same price as 2 of the old heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shawn: If you are interested to buy the new Toothrush, should I go ahead and help you with the 15% discount code?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed the unit very much I have to give it a low rating as I believe that for items that cost as much as this should last longer than 45 days.  </li>
            <li> It thoroughly cleans my teeth, is easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The handle is also long, slim and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate and has a long battery life.  </li>
            <li> I had two minor issues and they were ironed out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Finally, use the small brush: I was tempted to use the largest one being accustom to standard tooth brush but the smaller one is best fit for electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a nice package with two brush heads, one smaller and more compact than the other, several easy-to-understand manuals and a travel case and a travel charger, plus the main charger which houses a UV sanitizing unit.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel healthier and I really like that I can clean  my toothbrush regularly in the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> And the simplified charger connection makes keeping the charger clean that much easier, and allows for a much smaller travel charger.      </li>
            <li> I really like the extra clean feeling on my teeth after using it</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very easy to maintain for what little maintenance there is for it.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush back in 2007.  </li>
            <li> Definitely is an significant improvement vs. a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than a convential toothbrush or other electric burshes.</li>
            <li> I had recently undergone significant periodontal work, including lots of laser treatment, significant enough to have the procedure done under anesthesia.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would complain about is that the original unit was made in the USA, but replacement unit was not and there is a noticeable difference the replacement being weaker.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the &#x27;original&#x27; human parts.</li>
            <li> Better than any other electronic toothbrush on the market.  </li>
            <li> You will feel a significant difference in cleanliness when you use this compared to a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had to go back to the original toothbrush...</li>
            <li> They will not replace the handle again because they only honor the warranty of the original purchase, not the replacement.</li>
            <li> Sonicare could be a great product but just doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for the price.  </li>
            <li> My only recommendation is to become familiar with the owner&#x27;s manual.  </li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t get a better result from any other product on the market.</li>
            <li> this is a very big improvement over the original Sonicare</li>
            <li> i moved up from an other brand power toothbrush to this model which was recommended by my dentist for better plaque removal.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every type of high-end electric toothbrush, going back to the original InterPlak.</li>
            <li> Read many of the other reviews &amp; decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I spent the money on it!</li>
            <li> However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my other ones were no longer able to be charged.</li>
            <li> replacement unit&#x27;s operation was noticeably different from the original.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it&#x27;s time for me to move on and move back to the world of non-electric toothbrushes, and hence lower my original score of a 4 to a 3.  </li>
            <li> I just use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, and sometimes I accidentally touch the button and change to other modes (boy, even to brush my teeth I need so many options??</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes has had its internal mounts snap, causing a significant loss of vibration and cleaning power, with a simultaneous increase in noise.  </li>
            <li> Almost half a decade and still going strong!</li>
            <li> I think that I could live without the sanitizer but for the little extra it&#x27;s a great bonus.  </li>
            <li> The dark blue is great, but the gray, light blue and light green look too similar to easily differentiate the heads.</li>
            <li> this does not rank high on my list of necessary attributes of my toothbrush, but i just had to say it.  </li>
            <li> The massaging action and different brush heads insure my teeth feel \\&quot;just out of the dentist\\&quot; clean!  </li>
            <li> In one minute this has done more than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned, more than flossing, more than a full hour of horrible deep cleaning by a dental hygenist, more than four different dentists (and perhaps more when I was younger) could do.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that the old Sonicare was a solid electric toothbrush but after using the flexcare for about a month I&#x27;m so glad I got the new one.</li>
            <li> You may not think that some simple vibration will clean well.  </li>
            <li> , PHILLIPS HAS ADDRESSED PROBLEM WITH EARLIER MODELS THAT IS KEEPING IT CLEAN.</li>
            <li> The power behind the brush on the normal setting and the massage setting is really great.</li>
            <li> but I really like the variety offered, particularly the massage mode.</li>
            <li> I set mt brush on the MAX CLEAN and it beeps when I am supposed to move to the next section of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought it immediately after my last cleaning to see if it would keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t get the same clean feeling with that.</li>
            <li> Deep clean, massage etc.</li>
            <li> It comes with two different heads and has a sanitizing cycle with UV for keeping the heads clean.  </li>
            <li> The manual says you should only clean Sonicare ProResults brush heads in the sanitizer, but the Sonicare website lists four types of brushes that can be cleaned.</li>
            <li> is much louder and raspier than the older unit.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for only 3 weeks and my teeth and gums never have felt and so clean.  </li>
            <li> , my teeth feel extra clean after I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I had to use a dental tool to clean around my crowns and around my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> They are actually squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> It seems this brush is simply easier to keep clean as well.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s lighter and smaller and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> The brush has a couple different settings to fit your different moods, but the normal clean mode turns the brush on for two minutes, which is divided into 30 seconds for each quadrant.</li>
            <li> There are several modes, which may be selected to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> And the Max Care provides a deep 3 minute session with alternating massage and clean modes.  </li>
            <li> The different modes are great, but I usually use maximum care.</li>
            <li> The bristles clean deep.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t feel like her teeth are as clean with this as they were with the regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> alot better than a manual toothbrush, having a Sonicare now makes Oral-B barely a step above a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> said\\&quot; wow your teeth are really clean\\&quot;, it won&#x27;t be much for her to do today since I was there for a cleaning! ^^</li>
            <li> The UV clean kills any residue germs that might be left on the bristles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to see that Sonicare has FINALLY ditched the NiCad batteries and went to Li-ion batteries; what took so long?  </li>
            <li> I think the consumer should know they are spending that kind of money on a product that only lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Liked using it but didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Rest at ease, your oddarid having a trouble free products are very good since I am the one who received the rare troubled Flexcare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I like to use the 3 minutes when I can and cut down to the 1 minute for a quick clean when I have to run out of the house in a hurry.</li>
            <li> For example, there is a Clean Mode, described as \\&quot;standard mode for sueprior teeth ceaning; a Sensitive Mode for a more gentle cleaning for sensitive gums and teeth; and finally, a Massage Mode for \\&quot;gum</li>
            <li> My Series E toothbrush is still going strong and I have never had a single problem with it.</li>
            <li> The unit does not allow battery replacement, and the high breakage rate (motor to brush head coupling) indicate a very problematic design.</li>
            <li> My model only came with a standard brush head, so I&#x27;m ordering the compact because I think it will be more comfortable for my smaller mouth.  </li>
            <li> The brush head does move in a very energetic way, and it is made of hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell much difference with my gums, but given its speed when it&#x27;s operating, it obviously does as advertised--forces the toothpaste/water solution between your teeth and under your gum line to completely clean all the places you can&#x27;t get with a normal brush.  </li>
            <li> As with any new product, the FlexCare took a little bit of getting used to, but now it is quite comfortable and our teeth feel extraordinarily clean.  </li>
            <li> No, actually I want you to send me a new one for free.</li>
            <li> No, actually I want you to send me a new one for free.</li>
            <li> It really takes the brushing experience to a whole new level</li>
            <li> And this toothbrush does have some nifty special features including the sanitizer, travel charger, timer and three different speeds.</li>
            <li> I just simply cant get it right!</li>
            <li> Another nice thing is that you use very little toothpaste and will save money on that purchase.</li>
            <li> The new brush head design is what really makes this brush better than their other offerings.</li>
            <li> works just as well, or better, with less guilt for having paid too much</li>
            <li> The Flexcare will get your teeth clean just as well as the older and larger Sonicare toothbrushes do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brushing in half the time I did manually, and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush is doing twice as good a job as I ever did with a standard</li>
            <li> Make sure to  hold the brush straight out or slightly up</li>
            <li> The handle is less bulky than others making it very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> You can see how Sensonic went out of business selling one brush every 10 years, but you have to wonder how long Phillips can keep sending out free warranty replacements.</li>
            <li> It also comes with two brush-heads a standard for everyday cleaning, and a compact head to use in order to help clear food from the rear of the oral cavity and greatly assist in localized stain removal.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty clear which each do and why a person would use them.  </li>
            <li> For those used to small toothbrushes (size 30), the compact head works nicely.</li>
            <li> the full size heads are not too big for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts for days before recharging which makes it nice for traveling; but, also included, is a small recharger to take on longer trips.     </li>
            <li> But the overall appearance of my toothbrush was... kind of old, and gross.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner than using a normal brush.</li>
            <li> But it is nice that Philips decided to give you a small charge adapter that you can bring on a trip.    </li>
            <li> Within a week or so, you don&#x27;t really notice the vibrations and the larger standard brush is OK.    </li>
            <li> Philips replaced the brush very promptly (the service was great) but unfortunately, after about 4 months, the replacement seems to have gone the same way as the original brush.</li>
            <li> This is not only cool, it also means no metal to corrode in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li> For the first 14 brush cycles, this unit ramps up on the intensity of the brush action.</li>
            <li> it got exactly 2 years and 2 month old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another really cool thing about this brush is that it comes with 2 different chargers!</li>
            <li> Again, only time will tell here if that is wishful thinking on my part or a true benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, only time will tell here if that is wishful thinking on my part or a true benefit.    </li>
            <li> First, let me preface this review by stating that since the early 2000&#x27;s I have been a user of the Sonicare line of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I use the brush twice daily, in the morning and before the bedtime on full 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li> Some people comment on price, but if you consider one visit for cleaning at the average of $95.00 per visit, it is really OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure just how much \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; would be on a regular toothbrush after a month or two of use, so I can&#x27;t give a measurable opinion as to how good a job the UV light is doing at killing potential bacteria.</li>
            <li> Starting using this one and not a bad check up since.</li>
            <li> I have no hard data that this the Sonic system  is better than other pricey electric ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a real professional toothbrush that makes your mouth feel extremely clean just like you came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> &quot; all the way up and most of the way down, rather than</li>
            <li> l charger down or you wont be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> After having more than one come off while brushing and causing toothpaste to splash out and down my shirt.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it would be nice if there was a special head for the gum massage instead of using the toothbrush but that really isn&#x27;t a deal breaker or anything.</li>
            <li> i usually don&#x27;t use all the modes that this toothbrush comes with, but i was comfortable even with the default settings right from the first time.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this toothbrush cleans, but I&#x27;m don&#x27;t like that it broke a little more</li>
            <li> So you have to shell out $100 for a new one !    </li>
            <li> I credit this tooth brush for my new found tooth health!</li>
            <li> they STILL are mailing me out a BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT!  </li>
            <li> as soon as the warranty is over, time to buy a new one!</li>
            <li> I told her that all I had done was buy a new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Since then we have a new dentist and he is selling it for $77 - with the Sanitizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the manual, and it is true that the battery cannot be replaced once dead, but I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be able to get at least another year before that happens.</li>
            <li> The brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package, and I use the large ones and have still never had any issue with them fitting in the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot reiterate enough that with the power the FlexCare provides, I cannot imagine any other brush really doing an effective job at cleaning.</li>
            <li> I know that the other reviewers are going to say that I should stop whining and go back to a manual brush, but, I loved my old 7300 series units.  </li>
            <li> Cleans teeth very well, but expect to buy a new unit once every 18 months.  </li>
            <li> We were very relived as our new Flex Care came in</li>
            <li> It breaks you in gently to the new sensation</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to change the brushhead every 90 days, but you can probably go 4-6 months between new heads without diminishing brushing effectiveness too much.  </li>
            <li> Might have to get one.\\&quot;head every 90 days, but you can probably go 4-6 months between new heads without diminishing brushing effectiveness too much.  </li>
            <li> I talked it over with my husband and we immediately agreed we would buy a new one, because we like this one so much.  </li>
            <li> I really like the options of cleaning times on this new one - but have to confess</li>
            <li> This model comes with some new settings, basically a quick version and a rather intense deep cleaning version that massages your gums.  </li>
            <li> sleeker design than my previous Sonicare and so much better having the sanitizer attached and not a separate device.</li>
            <li> Gum disease is more serious than first thought--it can be associated with heart disease so it pays to take care of your gums and teeth, not just for a pretty smile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I immediately enjoyed healthier gums but in less than two years, the handle broke.</li>
            <li> The brush seems to work exponentially better with 80% less vibration; it&#x27;s a dream to use.  </li>
            <li> Cleans better than the Oral B I previously used.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when the oral B broke (after less than 2 years of use).  </li>
            <li> you want to experiment with different brushing modes, there is a standard \\&quot;clean mode,\\&quot; a \\&quot;sensitive mode\\&quot; for a more gentle feel, and a \\&quot;massage mode\\&quot; for extra gum stimulation.  </li>
            <li> and I like it even more than my previous Sonicares.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was one of the better, yet slightly cheaper electric tootbrushes on the market.  </li>
            <li> whatever I think it was mainly because they wanted people to upgrade....</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t build up all the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; of the older version.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and that tingly feeling in your lips and gums is kinda weird at first, but you&#x27;ll learn to love it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I went back 2 months later she said that things were looking better.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li> The stem of the brush is \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; that its older model.  </li>
            <li> I needed to replace my older, well-used Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This particular brush was recommended by our dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush that left my teeth with that smooth feeling you get after a professional cleaning at your dentists office until using this product.</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist are very vigilant about gum disease; each visit they give plenty of ideas for better flossing and brushing based on where you might have trouble spots.</li>
            <li> A quick search online suggests otherwise, there are tons of people complaining about the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants a whiter smile and healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> It should be held lightly but firmly, not clenched in one&#x27;s fist, taking care to keep your fingers off the various buttons on the front.  </li>
            <li> It should be held lightly but firmly, not clenched in one&#x27;s fist, taking care to keep your fingers off the various buttons on the front.  </li>
            <li> This Sonicare replaced an older version.  </li>
            <li> Love the slimmer design.....fits well in my hand and best of all, the disgusting build-up in the handle and under the brush is gone.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it was only a year old and still under warranty.  </li>
            <li> It has an LCD panel and selector to chose several modes, including a shorter brushing cycle for quick freshen ups, and a gum massage mode.</li>
            <li> I purchsed this product in January 2008 as a replacement to a much older version of a Sonicare product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older Sonicare model, the \\&quot;Essence 5300\\&quot; on which the switch was beginning to go out.  </li>
            <li> I like the 30 second timer to make sure I get all of my teeth cleaned the same.  </li>
            <li> They are sending another replacement to their credit, but it seems like 6 months is about the lifespan of this particular model.  </li>
            <li> I had the older sonic care but burned it out when I plugged it into a 220 line in another country.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the older models, but the Flexcare model (I got it with the Sanitizer intergrated) works so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a regular toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> Since then mine started buzzing in the middle of the night and luckily was covered under warranty.</li>
            <li> I find it cleans my teeth outstandingly and even gets around my back teeth and especially my crowns.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version and needed to upgrade.  </li>
            <li> a great checkup after using it, including improvement in my gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;Since no one has complained about the durability of this brush, I&#x27;m hoping it will last longer than some of the others that have had complaints about battery life and on/off button quality.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I had an older version</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various Sonicare toothbrush models over the last 10 years or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more noticeable the next morning after brushing with a regular brush instead of the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It works harder, faster and better than your old school</li>
            <li> I needed to use manual brush to do the main job.</li>
            <li> It produced such fantastic results that even my dentist was surprised.  </li>
            <li> Better safe than sorry,</li>
            <li> like older models, there&#x27;s no removeable battery.</li>
            <li> The product has a 2 year warranty but because mine is older than 2 years they cannot help me.</li>
            <li> After using 3+ times daily for 1.5 years, I have not noticed any wear on the buttons and am confident this will last.      </li>
            <li> is the main reason.  </li>
            <li> My older brand never had this issue and kept everything off the body of the device.</li>
            <li> About 30% of the time even after owning it a few years I still end up accidentally triggering the quick brush mode because that button is way too soft and easy to hit.</li>
            <li> I like being able to check different vendors and to read the feedback provided before actually purchasing a product.  </li>
            <li> Had the older model before this one.  </li>
            <li> This could be just a flaw in this particular toothbrush, or it could be the TSA for smashing my bag and damaging the motor.</li>
            <li> of the best things about the Toothbrush is that not only does it come with a &#x27;home&#x27; base station, it also conveniently includes a travel station as well, something many companies do not include, but it extremely useful for constant travelers who want to minimize their baggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has been promoting the great benefits of using a Sonicare toothbrush regularly for at least 4 years.</li>
            <li> One thing I like in particular with the Sonicare is that you do not have to apply any force while brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an older model (Elite)</li>
            <li> They provide the same level of cleaning power, but with the added benefit of much more reliability over multiple years of use.e value of the purchase decrease dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They provide the same level of cleaning power, but with the added benefit of much more reliability over multiple years of use.</li>
            <li> but I had on older Sonicare that lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> Purchase the older model if you still want a Sonicare after reading our reviews.</li>
            <li> No issues with this particular product per se</li>
            <li> I have loved my Sonicare tooth brushes and was very relieved that they stood behind their product and service.</li>
            <li> In short I highly recommend this brush to all my patients, especially those with many fillings and crowns/bridges.  </li>
            <li> The first toothbrush to come down with the problem got replaced free of charge by Philips.  </li>
            <li> something I was very conscious of when the unit was vibrating against my teeth!</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with the units failing due to the handle vibration becoming decoupled from the brush head.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is good, but THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS !    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been good up till yesterday when it ran weakly for about 10 seconds and stopped and won&#x27;t run now.  </li>
            <li> I have never walked away from a dental cleaning (even a \\&quot;full mouth debridement\\&quot; that I had a few years back which took an hour) without being able to still feel ridges at the edge of my teeth where there was still plaque built up</li>
            <li> I have only used this brush a hand full of times since it is brand new</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to be more stiff and really gives you the \\&quot;just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist\\&quot; feeling every time you brush.  </li>
            <li> Kinda high.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended indeed.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> All in all, highly recommend the Sonicare Flexcare 9630.</li>
            <li> If we all collectively stop buying their products then I can assure you they&#x27;ll start to listen and begin producing the types of high quality products that we demand.</li>
            <li> I rarely use the Sanitizer which is not a particularly useful addition; a quick swill under the tap serves me fine.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable batteries do not last forever, so is life, however this new FlexCare toothbrush is even better than my last one.</li>
            <li> Their latest brush does not clean thoroughly at all and often I had to do additional brushing using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll NEVER go back to any other kind.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than the previous models yet seems even more powerful.</li>
            <li> I carefully cleaned it and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> brush is a vast improvement over my previous brush, and has fixed most of the problems I had without introducing any significant new ones.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a vast improvement over my previous brush, and has fixed most of the problems I had without introducing any significant new ones.  </li>
            <li> If I press more that just a little the vibration stops.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my FlexCare for a little more than four months</li>
            <li> I have to say I am in love with this little guy.</li>
            <li> Having owned the original Sonicare for about 4 years now I was impressed and then disappointed when my battery finally gave out, then I found the Sonicare RS930!    </li>
            <li> However, the need for the sanitizer is real due to the nature of the type of bacteria floating around most bathrooms.    </li>
            <li> I decided to sink my teeth into something a little bit more helpful.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more powerful than my older one from a different brand and</li>
            <li> A natural whiteness appeared, my teeth FELT clean, and my gums and tongue have actually benefit from usage.</li>
            <li> I NEVER get through a brushing without changing the setting from clean to sensitive (which my teeth definitely aren&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> EVerything is sealed up and much easier to clean up in the wet world of the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> mainly because I really see the benefits this brush offers and figure</li>
            <li> I am an adult with braces and the only thing that makes my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li> not least, I love the little things on this brush.  </li>
            <li> Yes its a little pricey as most point out, but what is your only set of teeth really worth to you?  </li>
            <li> I did a side by side comparison using my older elite 7300 and the new flexcare model</li>
            <li> The brushes (as of right now) are actually cheaper for this brush than the older ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the massage setting much, and never use the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to hold than my old Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This model is great until it fails.</li>
            <li> I paid a very hefty price, even with the \\&quot;professional discount,\\&quot; because my dentist raved about the results.</li>
            <li> -Light bulb might be damaged and have to get it from service center.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this brush for a little over a year, so I&#x27;m very familiar with it&#x27;s pros and cons.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the sleek look and minimal heft and the UV sanitation option.</li>
            <li> It was no worse than what happens with a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than the old a-series.  </li>
            <li> But why is it that companies nearly always tack on a bunch of bells and whistles and don&#x27;t quite design for the way people really use the product?</li>
            <li> Our dentist recomended this brush for our 9 year old that was building up plaque fast.</li>
            <li> I have actually been able to switch to regular toothpaste instead of sensitive toothpaste.    </li>
            <li> The unit is pricey, and having to change out the heads every three months means another $30 or so per person a year, but for us the benefits have been worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> so in an effort to be more GREEN</li>
            <li> He said they normally don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Using Google and Amazon, I was quickly able to determine that the heavy hitters in the power toothbrush playing field were the Sonicare Flexcare and the Oral-B Triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No plaque, no tartar, and most importantly, no cavities.</li>
            <li> A+rtar, and most importantly, no cavities.</li>
            <li> The brush came with the Sanitizer for a few more dollars than my dentist tried to sell it for without.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it was definitely worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li> It has a massage feature which helps my teeth move faster after getting my braces tightened, a sensitive and clean feature for regular brushing (personal preference - sensitive), a go-care feature for when youre in a rush and just need a quick brush, and max care if you have some time.</li>
            <li> But while it worked, I have no complaint, it cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li> I can tell you for sure that I wasnt brushing long enough before.</li>
            <li> After brushing with the Sonicare my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with normal home brushing.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for quite awhile, not too sure how long; but I know I use it twice a day and have recharged only 2 or 3 times since purchasing a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> I hope that wasted time is used to make the brush better in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she really appreciated it more than the usual gifts I get her.</li>
            <li> Makes oral hygiene fun, ranks next to godliness.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> But, if you have the gum problems I potentially could have (because of the plaque build up), it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a normal six month rotation and the brush</li>
            <li> I normally use the \\&quot;MaxCare\\&quot; cycle, 30 seconds of cleaning plus 15 seconds of massage on each quadrant.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a sonicare toothbrush and stopped using it because it was such a hassel to use and did not feel like it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> and it still runs normally.</li>
            <li> When my old one from many years ago finally gave out, I tried to just use a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , I definitely believe it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Overall, the FlexCare is worth the money--especially at Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having bought two of these, and known another purchaser, none of our top end models has lasted long enough to engender confidence in the durability of the motors or mechanisms of Sonicare electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> And as I&#x27;m famous for leaving electric toothbrushes in hotel rooms, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> FlexCare is an outstanding product, but did not last as long as it should have, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is great, much smaller and easier to attach to the base, and the kit includes a travel charger which is handy as well.  </li>
            <li> The feel of the brush takes some getting used to the first time (only because the vibration really tickles)</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an &#x27;electric toothbrush&#x27; - I still work it across my teeth and gums like a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Fired it up for the first time and although it was a strange sensation at first, when i was done, my mouth felt cleaner than when I go to the dentist.     </li>
            <li> I would tell any friend or stranger that it is well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> a few more days, and I would have been out a lot of money paid for this thing....</li>
            <li> Is it worth the initial investment?  </li>
            <li> Is it worth the initial investment?  </li>
            <li> A $150 toothbrush should not look like this with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few more and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I love the UV sanitizer, and use it every few days or week.</li>
            <li> so much that when my first one suddenly stopped working after about 2 years, I had to get another one.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot to like about this unit&#x27;s ergonomics, but two glaring fault&#x27;s make all the good things about it unimportant.</li>
            <li> Good to see a company stand behind their product</li>
            <li> So I was on my own trying to winnow down the wide array of models and features available online and at local retail stores.  </li>
            <li> It says it leaves you with a Dentist office clean which I agree whole heartedly and in my case without any of the pain that I would typically be in from keeping my mouth open and having them clean my sensitive teeth!    </li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking but now that I have finally broken down and bought one, it is the best thing ever</li>
            <li> In fact, I use it three times as much as I did the other toothbrush, because it makes my mouth feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Technology has come a long way since we bought the earlier model - love the new features.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have and with the sanitizer i feel more comfortable about using it even though I have a cold right now.    </li>
            <li> not hard enough?\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> I am NOT hard on my things.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind spending $150 every 2 years to buy a completely new system, it&#x27;s great just REALLY expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new sonic toothbrush a few weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li> The nice large brush area on the Advance just BLASTED my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Having used it, I am now confident that it is worth the price, and am looking forward to fewer dental visits, other than the general check-ups necessary.  </li>
            <li> Having used it, I am now confident that it is worth the price, and am looking forward to fewer dental visits, other than the general check-ups necessary.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates and has a buzzing sound, but it is MUCH quieter than our previous toothbrush (rotating head model).</li>
            <li> ; nothing beats it, but be prepared to replace it frequently, as its lifespan is less than one year, if you intend to use it between/among more than one family member.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, just kind of an odd sensation if you are not used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a tad loud compared to my previous one, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning routine I prefer, the &#x60;MaxCare&#x27;, includes massage in the routine for each tooth quadrant, making it easy to incorporate into your daily brush habit without extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This newer SonicCare was a similar design, with the simple and MUCH cheaper brush replacements than the original SonicCare, so I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other electric tooth toothbrushes and this one by far is the most professional to use.  </li>
            <li> the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sanitizer is also a major plus as I feel like I&#x27;m always using a clean brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the mode/routine button is right where I have been used to holding the handle with my thumb.</li>
            <li> It cleaned better than a plain toothbrush, and did a lot of the work for me.  </li>
            <li> I am finally brushing correctly after years of trying to get it right by myself.  </li>
            <li> One big mistake that Sonicare made is putting the mode selection button right where your thumb goes when you are holding the Sonicare and brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> You can also push the off button at any time (say, for instance, if you have to spit or speak with someone), and when you push on again, the brush will pick up right where it left off.    </li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: that they are likely to break right after warranty&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: and</li>
            <li> It cleans the yellow right out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> (Customer Service has been very good about replacing the failed toothbrushes!)</li>
            <li> brush lasts a long time after recharging and charges quickly    </li>
            <li> the rate of failure these Sonicare toothbrushes have shown over three purchases (around 16-24 months), the cost of operation to own this toothbrush, along with the ongoing brush head replacements, is well over $10.00-$13.00 every month.</li>
            <li> The vibrating became louder and sure enough, the head was loose again.  </li>
            <li> This is still working great, the battery does last as long (New-the battery lasted a little over two weeks.  </li>
            <li> However, the design of the brush is only good for brushing along the gumline outside and reaching the last back teeth.</li>
            <li> and they were all difficult to keep clean and sometimes more trouble to take apart and clean than worth the time.</li>
            <li> The first one I had was an older model but gave similar results.  </li>
            <li> When handled properly, the end result is a definite fresh and crisp feel: your teeth feel super-smooth and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with the sound or vibration, unlike some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The price was also fantastic compared to other sites.</li>
            <li> The brush stopped charging properly, and started sounding some kind of error code (2 short buzzes and one long one, \\&quot;dot dot dash\\&quot;, over and over again).  </li>
            <li> The design is wonderful, the gunk is 95% reduced, the charger base is nice and small.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more a high whine than anything else and not that excessive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more a high whine than anything else and not that excessive.</li>
            <li> Got this new flexcare</li>
            <li> so I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> We didnt notice any lessening of brushing quality, but did start thinking of buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Picked up a another new one around 2006.  </li>
            <li> This continued until battery was fully discharged and then will not accept a new charge.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a new one.  </li>
            <li> I cannot live without this Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but I bought it new on Ebay for $109 after shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the new cleaning compartment.</li>
            <li> I guess I will make another support plea and see if they keep sending a new unit.</li>
            <li> When I needed a new toothbrush for our cabin, I decided against the FlexCare and just purchased an Elite.</li>
            <li> However, once I sent the intent to return, in hours a new one was on</li>
            <li> My brush head looks brand new after three months of use.  </li>
            <li> and they sent me a new handle (with a new brush head and travel charger included).</li>
            <li> and I hope this new replacement will go the distance for another 3-5 years before I have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a new handle (with a new brush head and travel charger included).</li>
            <li> and I hope this new replacement will go the distance for another 3-5 years before I have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The new one lasted 13 months.</li>
            <li> Feb. 9, 2011: Still working like new.</li>
            <li> They shipped me a brand new unit in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the new unit.  </li>
            <li> The new toothbrush just snaps on and you don&#x27;t have to unscrew the brush head.</li>
            <li> and they are going to send me a new one.</li>
            <li> I have a new dentist now</li>
            <li> Maybe the new lithinum battery means it can be charged anytime</li>
            <li> After five years, I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li> One of the instructions ruined my brand new travel brush handle.  </li>
            <li> It must have a new design as my husband&#x27;s comes apart and collects dirt under the handle - not so with this model.</li>
            <li> So I went on line to research purchasing a new one.  </li>
            <li> but the new ones are rated at 3 months.  </li>

            <li> Christmas of 2007, my eldest son asked for a new Sonicare system.  </li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I try the new Sonicare Flexcare tootbrush that he sells for retail.</li>
            <li> I contacted Philips Sonicare using their \\&quot;Live Chat\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and I have to call sonicare for a new one.  </li>
            <li> My wife needed a new one and ordered this new model.  </li>

            <li> My new dentist &amp; hygienist recommended that I purchase the Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying something new this week - maybe my 4th or maybe try Oral B.</li>
            <li> The new batteries charge faster, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is basically a beep that goes off every 30 seconds while brushing, reminding you to switch to a new area of your mouth.  </li>

            <li> I got this new, slimmer model.  </li>
            <li> After telling them I had no receipt (my sister had got this new one for me) and guessing it&#x27;s age, they asked for the code on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> This new Flexcare with the sanitizer just takes it to a new level.</li>
            <li> They tell me they are sending me a new unit.  </li>
            <li> I received my toothbrush within the time specified and it was in the condition it should have been as a new item.</li>
            <li> but they discontinued it, so it was time to go with new system.  </li>
            <li> I just replaced my FlexCare with a new DiamondCare.  </li>
            <li> I like the New Flexcare one</li>

            <li> Hello,     Today, my dental hygienist, Jennifer, told me that I was a new person since I started caring for my teeth using the Sonicare sonic toothbrush 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> new model has some improvements.  </li>
            <li> Everyone has listed them here, and I can&#x27;t add anything new.</li>
            <li> so I was in the market for a new toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> I bougth a new one becouse</li>
            <li> The agent said: \\&quot;Since, you do not have the reciept I will suggest you to purchase a new unit.\\</li>
            <li> The brushes for the new one do a beter job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I just purchased seven new brushes for this toothbrush and now have to either buy another one at Target, Walmart or Amazon or throw my money out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; I purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> then I know it&#x27;s time to switch it out for a new one.</li>
            <li> I buy new ones at Costco or on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After receiving a new replacement bulb from Philips, the sanitizer worked for a period of time and then stopped again.  </li>
            <li> You just place the brush head inside and turn it on and after a ten minute cycle, where a small window glows magically, the brush head comes out clean and ready for the next use.</li>
            <li> I got this a couple of weeks ago and it is hands down better than my old oralb sonic complete.  </li>
            <li> Clean--a 2 minute clean with three beeps to tell you to move from quadrant (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right)</li>
            <li> After every use, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned, and it&#x27;s actually a lot of fun using the thing.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping it would come with more than one normal head and one small one since my gf</li>
            <li> Yes, I was  out shipping (the old unit back), but it was worth it.   </li>
            <li> After using the toothbrush for a week, I found my teeth are much cleaner, those places in the back of the mouth are much easier to reach and with the customization</li>
            <li> While others in my family are using earlier models without problem, I finally made this purchase because of redesign and upgraded options which are detailed in the products description.    </li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to, particularly if you have sensitive teeth&lt;</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums really do feel much like they do following a checkup at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed an appreciable increase in the overall \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; of my smile, an unexpected benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also noticed an appreciable increase in the overall \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; of my smile, an unexpected benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the older models, the toothbrush would fit into the charger, so about an inch of the toothbrush was hidden while on the charger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also owned Oral B ProCare, SonicCare Classic and Elite, and the Oral B Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li> At night I typically turn it to MaxCare for a solid 3 minute clean, whereas after lunch I just go for the quick 1 minute GoClean.</li>
            <li> All my teeth remain smooth only until the next meal.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a recharchable lithiom ion battery I expected better longevity, especially for an investment of over $100.  </li>
            <li> This is a very powerful cleaning tool, unlike anything I have ever felt, other than at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> The one and only small ergonomic foible with this latest generation is that it&#x27;s far too easy to bump the control switch on the handle when I&#x27;m changing quadrants or moving from the inside to the outside of the teeth, or vice versa.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine until 12/15/11  (5 months), and then broke down.</li>
            <li> My last cleaning was very intense at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes of various kinds have been around for a long time now - at least since the sixties - and manufacturers are having to get more inventive about adding features to keep consumer interest.  </li>
            <li> - I think that button is just very soft.      </li>
            <li> It is much lighter and feels a little more powerful than the previous models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips sent a replacement handle right out (they do send a prepaid label and ask you to mail back the old one) and we got to keep the $130 we were about to shell</li>
            <li> so to speak, the first several times you use it (I highly recommend taking advantage of the &#x27;ease in&#x27; functions it offers</li>
            <li> The sonic action really does leave my teeth and gumline feeling cleaner than I was EVER able to get them by manual brushing, and I have even seen slight improvement in my periodontal situation (some moderately deep pockets).  </li>
            <li> The new brushes are easier to keep clean and sanitary due to their design and the Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> The new flexcare is smaller and lighter, but the vibrator mechanism is build-in the handle and doesn&#x27;t provide as much torque as the older model like the Advance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this model in particular and Sonicare in general.</li>
            <li> -Sensitive mode that is much gentle than the previous generation and Clean function.</li>
            <li> The first two brushes were noticeable but by the third day, I handled all settings with no problems.     </li>
            <li> The design is different and the brush is a different shape, more like a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It simply ceased to work on 2 occasions within the first 18 months.  </li>
            <li> I have some pretty deep pockets</li>
            <li> When I first purchased my Sonicare elite several years ago, they said to replace the heads every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll last much longer than that!    </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The brush feels like you are in control of it, more so than the bulkier versions I&#x27;ve had in the past.    </li>
            <li> The smaller brush size (sold separately) works better, especially for the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re most likely to run into this same problem with your recent purchase.</li>
            <li> He started sharing my old one over a year ago and his oral health improved immediately!</li>
            <li> is how pleased I have been with this toothbrush over the past six months.</li>
            <li> It is my first electric toothbush, and now I can never go back to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> They both had the exact same issue; they stopped charging/working altogether.</li>
            <li> I have been lazy and have not registered this latest one when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get the same exact model ..</li>
            <li> The vibration might bother you the first couple uses, but after that you&#x27;ll never want to use a regular brush again.  </li>
            <li> the extra noise I first encountered has gone away.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted about 13 months, and the second lasted 16-17 months.  </li>
            <li> With the 2-year warranty, the first was replaced, but not the second.  </li>
            <li> the brush was larger and a bit cumbersome to maneuver around in your mouth to brush exactly the way you were supposed to.</li>
            <li> My teeth were pretty yellow...</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is my second purchase, and an upgrade from the first model.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I bought our first SoniCare toothbrush in 2000 and each used it daily for 11 years before it died.</li>
            <li> The first one was replaced by Philips, but the third one, they said, was not covered, so we had to purchase it.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> During the first 4 months I used it only once a day, then went to get my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> It is obvious that Sonic did not place the same emphasis on reliability that they placed on such an elegant design.</li>
            <li> for the two complaints that I have aside from my initial reaction of numbness:  First, the battery is one of those that you have to use up before you charge.  </li>
            <li> Now for the two complaints that I have aside from my initial reaction of numbness:  First, the battery is one of those that you have to use up before you charge.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time one actually pulled out.</li>
            <li> and I did not have any problems with my gums hurting after first several uses.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so pleased with a product in my entire life.</li>
            <li> recently my hygienist told me to try this one and at first I was put off by the price.</li>
            <li> However, this was before I mine died 9months, and I replaced the first one and the second one died under 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of this exact model I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> sonicare replaced first defective one, within one year same thing happened again.  </li>
            <li> It is just like getting your teeth professionally cleaned every day and night!  </li>
            <li> My original Sonicare with NiCad battery finally couldn&#x27;t give me enough charge for one brushing so</li>
            <li> On the first use it was obvious</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through 2 of these exact same models-</li>
            <li> wow this thing rocks!</li>
            <li> I first received this item last year before Xmas</li>
            <li> This was my first but not last Amazon purchase.  </li>
            <li> The warranty has run out and just yesterday it started making funny noises and seems like it&#x27;s not working properly anymore.  </li>
            <li> I know some people might want to set it for the one they like and have it always use that option, but me personally, I like to use different modes at different times, so it would annoy me more if it was set to one</li>
            <li> Sonicare replaced the first toothbrush, but will not replace the second.  </li>
            <li> $25 for only three - really?!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush required no complicated setup, simply removing the items from the packaging and plugging it</li>
            <li> The product inspires confidence in me that Philips truly means this unit to last the consumer for many years, only needed to replace consumable parts such as the toothbrush heads periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VALUE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Durability: this is an issue that bothers me because the handle with the soft rubber began peeling/coming off after just a year of normal use.  </li>
            <li> I doubt Philips would back their product even if you have all the supporting evidence.</li>
            <li> The first started running in the middle of the night, within a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use the standard \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, which is good for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I will credit the company for customer service (they provided me with free replacements when the first and second models broke down during the year-long warranty)</li>
            <li> \\&quot;just got a dental cleaning\\&quot; feeling -- versus those other vibrating/rotating brushes that are basically designed for the lazy brusher and don&#x27;t really clean any better.</li>
            <li> The buttons are all sealed, easy to press, and the head slides on and off with little effort.</li>
            <li> It would get all moldy and gross if you didn&#x27;t clean it out regularly.  </li>
            <li> i had to take it apart about 3 years in when the post for the head unit seemed to have come disconnected from the main unit internally, making the brush head very wobbly.  </li>
            <li> and considering a second clean with the regular brush.  </li>
            <li> I like the Go Clean with four 15 second intervals in the AM and the regular 2 minutes in the PM.</li>
            <li> Unlike the older Sonicare models, this one has a cheap rubber green button that disintegrates after 6 months of usage.</li>
            <li> However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li> However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.</li>
            <li> I set the brush on clean mode and tend not to use the other options, but some may find them useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to me to be a way of making people buy new replacement brushes when their old ones get worn.  </li>
            <li> So when you go to replace the battery in the toothbrush you would think you just unscrew the bottom, pop out the old battery and pop in the new one.</li>
            <li> I attempted to buy new heads for the old model and they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  </li>
            <li> I bought this new one to replace an 8-year old model.</li>
            <li> The new model is easier to hold, has soft brush for gums as well as teeth.  </li>
            <li> but it breaks about once a year, so i get a new one under warranty and send the old one in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We bought this new one because our old one just got funky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this new model, and &#x27;wow&#x27;</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this new model because the battery in my old one is wearing out.  </li>
            <li> New motor is a bit quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li> This is a much neater and easier toothbrush to keep clean compared to the plain Sonicare sets.</li>
            <li> and they confirmed that the flexcare model is louder, but has less vibrations in the hand.  </li>
            <li> The replacement lasted less than a week, at which point the power button fell off, the toothbrush filled with water, and that one ceased working.  </li>
            <li> These features may not be important but together, despite recommendations I can brush in 30 seconds or less if pushed.  </li>
            <li> buy the over the counter oral b or whatever is available, that costs less.  </li>
            <li> The head has been completely redesigned (even though the brush portion itself is basically the same) and no longer requires daily \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li> BUT this particular series is a complete waste even though the positives are light weight</li>
            <li> different brushing modes on the Flexcare are really nice, but there is a small problem with all your options.  </li>
            <li> The FlexCare handle is small and feels much better in the hand than my old bulky 5300 handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time switched to sonicare and chose this model, all I can say is it&#x27;s DIFFERENT, and your teeth is going to be cleaned completely.</li>
            <li> I was pretty bummed as it was only 1 year old.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another one a few years ago but the the vibration was too strong.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it came with one large brush head and an addititonal small one that I can reach the backs of my back teeth with.</li>
            <li> Love the UV Sanitizer and the smaller brush head makes it easier to clean hard to reach area in back of mouth.</li>
            <li> This means that they will intentionally produce products that are specifically designed to break down or be unusable/incompatible within a specific time frame so that you buy their products over and over again thereby taking more of your money and increasing their profits.</li>
            <li> There are too many reviews that indicate a high failure rate.  </li>
            <li> I settled on this unit based on several positive reviews, its feature set, and the fact that for $5 more than the next model down, it came with the UV sanitizer feature.  </li>
            <li> HUGE MESS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly loud, but it&#x27;s loud enough that you probably won&#x27;t want to use it around a light sleeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this last checkup, my dentist spotted a problem area where brushing just can&#x27;t reach:  the very pits of my molars are pretty deep.  </li>
            <li> I went looking for a new brush for two reasons: one, the Oral-B brush heads always accumulated a gross slime inside of them, that really grossed me out.</li>
            <li> The second reason I went looking for a new toothbrush, is that I really wanted a UV sanitizer for the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Its slimmer, less vibration and the toothbrush head is much smaller and just slips easily on top of a metal rod.    </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more is that the head uses probably 30-40% less material and plastic than a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> It is smaller, lighter and quieter while cleaning even better than the previous models.</li>
            <li> I will never use a regular toothbrush again (except to clean the toilet).</li>
            <li> It took 2 years in the previous unit, and 1 year in the most recently purchased unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much smaller and lighter than my previous brush, which makes it much better to use.  </li>
            <li> I could never get it to calm down, even the lowest setting was out of control, but the good thing about that model is that it had a pressure sensor, if you brushed too hard it would stop.</li>
            <li> it is going to die within a few days because exactly the same thing happened with my Sonicare Healthy white brush (dual brush) a year ago.</li>
            <li> This is mostly my fault due to a fear of dentist for a variety of reasons (including the time when the dentist inadvertently stuck me in the arm with a novocaine needle) which kept me from the dentist&#x27;s office for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unwilling to spend the big bucks for this model, and I certainly understand, I would suggest getting the flexcare without the sanitizer or go for the elite model.</li>
            <li> but with a different model, the one that has the large bottom to the brush head that you screw on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s a fantastic product but a little noisier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use the sanitizer about once a week, putting the brush head in the little compartment after the evening brushing, firing up the UV light, and then wiping off the unit&#x27;s mounting post.</li>
            <li> The little traveling case is fantastic, I can go on trips for days and it fits snugly in my bag and does not need a charge for days.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the cheaper models clean your teeth as well as this expensive model, which has bells and whistles that most people will never use.</li>
            <li> Retightening it will only buy you a little more time before it loosens again.</li>
            <li> Oral B&#x27;s products are much more reliable, but their brushes are way too hard compared to the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> But as for other of these types of brushes, this one is super.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gripping it particularly hard</li>
            <li> as I feel I get into hard to reach places better.</li>
            <li> This is one way you can offset the high cost (relative to a normal toothbrush).    </li>
            <li> If you call or Live Chat Philips saying you have a problem, the first thing they ALWAYS ask me is if the shaft is loose.</li>
            <li> Also, the heads have a little plastic circle on it that comes in a few different colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush-</li>
            <li> I called the number above and after a little troubleshooting they were kind enough to offer a replacement even though the warranty was expired by 3 years - just as a one time courtesy!</li>
            <li> I called the number above and after a little troubleshooting they were kind enough to offer a replacement even though the warranty was expired by 3 years - just as a one time courtesy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the UV sanitizer very often since it seems a little gimmicky but it&#x27;s nice piece of mind and someplace enclosed to store the brush head.    </li>
            <li> This little machine cleans my teeth far better than a regular, manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush a lot but the 2 that I bought for my family both stopped working - one 2 and a half years after purchase and the other 3 years after purchase.</li>
            <li> Not yet sure if this makes a difference  - soft carrying case rather than hard plastic case    </li>
            <li> - my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as clean since I last visited the dentist, which was too long ago!</li>
            <li> The sanitizer has worked great during the cold season.  </li>
            <li> I was all excited to purchase this one and to disappointment I paid such a huge amount for a used product and that too a toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> Well, the brush is clearly five stars.  </li>
            <li> It uses less toothpaste and after brushing you teeth seem really clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to go back to my old reliable Oral B toothbrush, but I&#x27;m gonna really miss the softness of the Flexcare brushes.</li>
            <li> this thing lasts for at least a few years then I will be happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get the feeling that Philips wants me to buy and replace bristles far too often simply for profit.</li>
            <li> Into my second year the battery died fast; the metal part where the brush attachments stick on completely BROKE OFF.  </li>
            <li> LED for power is clear and bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x27;s be clear on this: a Sonicare toothbrush is a luxury product.  </li>
            <li> clear whenever you stop using it or if you don&#x27;t turn it on for three seconds.  </li>
            <li> clear whenever you stop using it or if you don&#x27;t turn it on for three seconds.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t see any real need for the massage and sensitive settings and just use the standard one.</li>
            <li> I used the previous model for almost 2 years while I had braces and for each of my semi-annual checkups at the dentist, the dental hygienist was amazed at how clean my teeth were even with braces.  </li>
            <li> This product is clearly defective and sonciare knows it.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare FlexCare has a clear and thorough instruction booklet explaining each feature.  </li>
            <li> : that said, the cost of the brusheads is just too much, cosmetically the toothbrush is done, and I&#x27;ve come to the point where I feel that this toothbrush offers nothing over standard toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to this model after my old elite bit the dust, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I have tried various brands; you know, the ones when you purchase another toothbrush when the battery dies because its too much of a hassle to get to the battery.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and was worried about agitating my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really hope Sonicare plans on keeping this one around longer then 4 years unlike my last one.</li>
            <li> I guarantee my old one would have.      </li>
            <li> I keep accidentally turning the toothbrush on and off while brushing, even when I make a conscious effort to avoid the switch.  </li>
            <li> With the Sonicare, it oscillates back and forth, mimicking real tooth brushing motion.</li>
            <li> I received this product faster than anticipated and so far it has worked well.</li>
            <li> At least it sure looks like their work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Sensitive mode&lt;br</li>
            <li> these toothbrushes don&#x27;t seem to last much beyond 2 years anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> Used it a few times but noticed it increases bristle wear and they aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> so he assured me that with my sensitive teeth I would have no problems.</li>
            <li> I could always use the sensitive setting or even the massage one.      </li>
            <li> Battery seems to last much, much longer.  </li>
            <li> I replaced another Sonicare with this one because the old one was dying.  </li>
            <li> Now I know how much battery I have left.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a soft travel case for keeping the brush and heads in, and a includes compact charger for travel that doesn&#x27;t have the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> So I bought replacement heads (for way too much money)and the same happened with those three.  </li>
            <li> I never use the additional settings that the brush offers either.  </li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t recommend this brush highly enough.</li>
            <li> So today I call, and they tell me that the problem is MY fault -- that this toothbrush is not built to withstand frequent head changing.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> It is a low-toned buzz, far quieter than an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> This one, by far, beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m storing the old one just in case).</li>
            <li> and it really leaves you with the same feeling as when you come out of the hygienist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> You will know the end is near when you start hearing a loud rattling noise during brushing.</li>
            <li> models offered top-of-the-line features and each had earned near 5-star reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I M E S  so far in 2010.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush in early 2009.  </li>
            <li> I am so far, anyway.  </li>
            <li> Nor do I visit my dentist nearly as often as I should.</li>
            <li> It has worked really well, and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use extra whiteners, since my teeth are whiter also.</li>
            <li> It requires entirely too much pressure to turn it off.</li>
            <li> It REALLY feels like you just left the dentist after brushing.</li>
            <li> I dont have plaque on my teeth through out the whole day, even through multiple meals.</li>
            <li> and I can completely agree.</li>
            <li> and I can completely agree.</li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  </li>
            <li> My husband has now switched to the Oral B Professional Series.</li>
            <li> Within another couple of days, the thing just died completely-</li>
            <li> I asked about having it fixed for a fee and was told that they don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> That can&#x27;t be fixed?</li>
            <li> These models are not as hardy as the old design.  </li>
            <li> As a result, the brush makes a loud noise and eventually falls off the shaft.  </li>
            <li> In fact they feel near as sparkly as they do when stepping out of the dentist&#x27;s office.     </li>
            <li> I started using electric toothbrushes long before Sonicare came up with their first product - like 20 years ago, and might have been an Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping it continues to work like it has so far.  </li>
            <li> so I should not have been surprised.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t find them to be too loud.</li>
            <li> It has performed without flaw so far.  </li>
            <li> it is confusing which head you want (customer service says they should say \\&quot;Pro Results\\&quot; on them, but many websites show a pic with Sonicare on them (with matching model #),   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fearlessly, I pushed the shiny button until a green light appeared beside the Max Care routine.</li>
            <li> and nearly jumped out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks professional</li>
            <li> I also realize that my gums are not as sensitive as before or rather my gum has become stronger.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this style brush because it has various timed settings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bye Bye Sensitive Teeth.</li>
            <li> My old sonicare literally died after about 20 years of recharging.  </li>
            <li> The old Sonicare Advance one had all of the bristles lined up.</li>
            <li> FEELS LIKE PROFESSIONAL TOOL IN DENTIST&#x27;S OFFICE.</li>
            <li> If I do buy the Healthy White, it is with my eyes open to the fact that it may only last 2 - 3 years, but hopefully provides comparable results to the FlexCare.</li>
            <li> The young man adviced me to get it through Amazon, since they honor the warranty b/c they have no way of knowing who sells them on Ebay or where they get their toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> had I listened to the young guy at Philips.    </li>
            <li> Even though I am not big on spending that much on a tooth brush, I went with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for around 3 months now and the biggest con so far is the noise.</li>
            <li> Even on old stains it will take a bit but you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this works.</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive teeth and use a sensitive toothpaste, and the brushes&#x27; actions have not bothered me at all.  </li>
            <li> By the way, my old old Braun brush that I talk about in this review?  </li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive teeth and use a sensitive toothpaste, and the brushes&#x27; actions have not bothered me at all.  </li>
            <li> By the way, my old old Braun brush that I talk about in this review?  </li>
            <li> Anyway this brush completely turned around my dental health.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems so far with the flexcare, and I would recommend this brush to any person of any age.</li>
            <li> Sensitive teeth:  </li>
            <li> Having extremely sensitive teeth, I had my doubts when my hygienist recommended Sonicare, but was relieved to find it to be gentler than a manual toothbrush with extra-soft bristles.      </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner than they have ever felt, and seem to stay that way between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner than they have ever felt, and seem to stay that way between professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> so you can tell how much charge is left.  </li>
            <li> However, 8 months after purchasing this wonder brush, it has developed a mind of</li>
            <li> It extremely loud and distracting when it is in use, don&#x27;t bother trying to listen to anyone talk to you unless they&#x27;re yelling.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if my teeth are much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I still have my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> because the old one will die.</li>
            <li> One concern was that the brush started out very quiet, but became very noisy in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I could always turn it back on if I really wanted to and do another cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes it is pricey, but dental hygiene is extremely important and for me I did not hesitate to pay the price as it is something I use everyday twice a day and</li>
            <li> This never happened on my old model.</li>
            <li> the extra cost for the sanitizer is a bit much considering it is about a $15.00 value for the UV bulb.  </li>
            <li> It starts gentle, and after the next 14 cycles it will gradually step up the frequency...</li>
            <li> They prepaid a package to return the old unit to them.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this problem is completely gone with the Flexcare</li>
            <li> In addition, it reaches all of the areas in my mouth, where my old brush needed to be supplemented with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> Our dental hygienist really believes in these brushes, especially for gum health.</li>
            <li> MY OLD SONICARE WAS ACCIDENTALLY DISPOSED OF BY AN ORDERLY WHEN I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR A SURGERY</li>
            <li> was backing out completely.    </li>
            <li> I gave this to my adult son as a gift.  </li>
            <li> His dentist had recommended this because of his sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> Plus + for GUM Gums Professional Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth like a professional cleaning and leaves them so shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about different mechanical toothbrushes</li>
            <li> i totally agree with the whole messiness issue.  </li>
            <li> My old style tooth brushes and hand could never give me the cleaning that I get each time I use this.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smaller size of both the handle and brush head</li>
            <li> , the brush head is much easier to move around in your mouth and reach the very back.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t really use all of the extra options that are on the toothbrush, but maybe one day I will.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li> Without this toothbrush my gums go wild.</li>
            <li> I see my dentist in February and hope that he is pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This one has all the bells and whistles on it of which so far I use 2 of.</li>
            <li> The only thing I question though is I noticed this is made in China and how could it cost so much??</li>
            <li> The old one must be returned.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I had just come out of a professional cleaning at the dentist (</li>
            <li> or maybe it&#x27;s just that my teeth are sensitive...)</li>
            <li> If they come out with a lower-end model without all the various modes, the UV cleaner, etc., at a much lower price, I&#x27;d recommend that over this model.  </li>
            <li> and I had the sensitive gums to show for it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about the product itself since I never used it for obvious reasons</li>
            <li> My mouth feels much cleaner when I wake up after having brushed with the Sonicare the night before.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations thus far.  </li>
            <li> Since lithium batteries have a fixed life, the battery should be user-replaceable.  </li>
            <li> Now the toothbrush is completely exposed to the air</li>
            <li> so far, they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had an old sonicare</li>
            <li> The whole (short) process from beginning to end was truly exemplary customer service!  </li>
            <li> My old Sonic Care wore out (batteries ceased to hold a charge).</li>
            <li> but with some marked improvements.  </li>
            <li> One Sonicare brush lasted nearly 2 years and died *</li>
            <li> if you have the money for frequent replacements, go for it.  </li>
            <li> sanitizer is a gimmick, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+The old handle had a recessed area.</li>
            <li> You can also adjust for \\&quot;I want you to focus on cleaning\\&quot;, \\&quot;I have sensitive</li>
            <li> last time I had an electric toothbrush, it was heavier than the Sonicare, despite being much shorter.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun electric toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t doing the job and a friend recommended the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my 22 yr old for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a fanatic about her teeth and making sure she keeps them forever.   </li>
            <li> even though my old one still worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> Those who use the old design know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with sensitive and bleeding gums for years and since switching to this toothbrush the problem has gone away.  </li>
            <li> even though I can&#x27;t say for sure that it works, it at least makes me feel like my brush is cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if I get professional cleanings every day.  </li>
            <li> (my old ones didn&#x27;t..)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush really holds a charge as with daily use</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned</li>
            <li> It was loud.  </li>
            <li> After using the this Sonicare for awhile, I went on vacation and grabbed my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> really like the different brushing mode options. &#x27;</li>
            <li> My dentist has been suggesting this type of toothbrush for ever, but being a diehard I stayed with old faith-ful.</li>
            <li> When a person brushes manually, he does most of the work, but when operating a sonic toothbrush, the user must be careful to apply only apply light pressure, angle the brush so that it touches both the tooth and the gum, and move the brush slowly from tooth to tooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance - Brushing with the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling like you&#x27;ve just had them professionally cleaned.it diligently for almost three weeks.  </li>
            <li> Performance - Brushing with the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling like you&#x27;ve just had them professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 5 brushing modes you can choose from, including one for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> , considering these toothbrushes have only 2 year warranties -- they work very well for longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - this model is a bit noisier than the old one&lt;br</li>
            <li> After some research I picked the Sonicare and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> As a result it&#x27;s much easier to clean that previous models, which would be my only gripe about them.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to replace your old one or want to get an powered toothbrush I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I tend to get cavities often (soft enamel maybe?)</li>
            <li> I will purchase a third Sonicare when I&#x27;m ready to replace this Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It seems that since I did not register it, although I thought I did and that I don&#x27;t have a three year old receipt, they told me to buy another one at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> I still  use the old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an old Sonicare I got from Costco, wanting to upgrade the type of brush head.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get a professional cleaning every day.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s because of the sonic action of the brush.  </li>
            <li> But hey, better late than never.</li>
            <li> Make sure you eat enough green vegetables and fruits.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Flexcare&#x27;s brushes but the toothbrush itself only lasts a few months.  </li>
            <li> They offered no course of action beyond sending me on my way, now disgruntled that I&#x27;ve spent $120 on a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t worth their time.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few Sonicare toothbrushes over the years, but their latest toothbrush is a total junk.  </li>
            <li> All of the different cleaning modes are highly useful for different users.  </li>
            <li> No matter the product, it is only as good as the Customer Care behind it.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t floss, I don&#x27;t use mouthwash, and to be honest, I&#x27;m not great about always brushing my teeth before bed.</li>
            <li> It comes with two heads, one is larger than the other one but either one is fine.  </li>
            <li> Right now, I go for an extra cleaning a year to my dentist (for which I pay, my insurance only covers two per year)</li>
            <li> Right now, I go for an extra cleaning a year to my dentist (for which I pay, my insurance only covers two per year)</li>
            <li> The standard brushhead is just the right size for daily use, not bulky like the manual toothbrushes nowadays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little quieter, quite a bit smaller, and *much* easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> It has a UV sanitizer to zap any germs that dare to live on your brushing head, and may possibly be used to clean some models of the Oral B brushing heads you may be using in other toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I guarantee you the only setting you need and will use is the normal one!    </li>
            <li> My gum pockets are back to normal!  </li>
            <li> The bristles become a little too soft after a while, and then my mouth starts not feeling as clean, and</li>
            <li> On another note, i&#x27;ve had huge issues with other philips items such as earbuds and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> With a steady hand, I wet the bristles and applied some toothpaste, then confidently pressed the green button......</li>
            <li> Takes less than 7 hours for a full charge.</li>
            <li> I was instructed that either model would work great, so long as I brushed at least twice daily and flossed</li>
            <li> product is great for small mouths, hard to reach areas/crevices and for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel so polished and clean with every use that you can skip the cleanings at the dentist for a little if you want.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems fitting the sonic brush-head into my mouth, the extended reach is long enough to reach all the way to the back teeth and to clean the inside and outside of the teeth and along the gumline without having to open my mouth too wide.</li>
            <li> The other thing is the mode button underneath the power button is way too easy to activate, just the simple act of picking it up can trigger it if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Previous Sonicare models required a large replacement head that I always thought was a huge waste and very environmentally unfriendly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Given all of the above, if you can, please steer clear of the FlexCare units and purchase the older e Series units instead.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Given all of the above, if you can, please steer clear of the FlexCare units and purchase the older e Series units instead.  </li>
            <li> There is no excuse for such appliances that quickly break down, particularly at their high cost.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff to clean my teeth but gentle enough to get into the gums w/o causing bleeding.</li>
            <li> Great imporvement on the brush/head design, so that no more water gets trapped in there and gets all moldy and gross!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run when you consider the cost of regular professional cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run when you consider the cost of regular professional cleaning      </li>
            <li> I think it is worth getting the sonicare flexcare without the UV sanitizer and buying the philips UV standalone sanitizer separately as the standlone UV sanitizer will take other brush heads as well.</li>
            <li> I arranged for the replacement in just a few minutes with a friendly Sonicare representative via Internet chat on their website.</li>
            <li> Oral B and other brands are not as powerful.</li>
            <li> Finally, the brushead is just too small for me, though it is nice that I get to feel when I brush each individual tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist  recommended the Sonicare  over other electric toothbrushes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the others aren&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li> Probably the best electric toothbrush on the market, but unfortunately after less than three years I have over $200 worth of dead phillips sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This is called PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE which means that Philips intentionally made these toothbrushes in such a way that they will mostly break down within 2 years so that you&#x27;re likely to drop another $120+ every 2 years to buy another one of these overpriced vibrators.</li>
            <li> AND I just recently bought a set of new brush heads which cost me almost 40 bucks which now I can&#x27;t use!  </li>
            <li> TWO DAYS later I received new unit in the mail!  </li>
            <li> My complaint with the original Sonicare was that the brush head was too cumbersome, and viola!</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a bit more, the cheaper, less complex head and the UV sanitizer are well worth it.</li>
            <li> It gives a dentist-like clean everyday.</li>
            <li> handle just buzzes harshly, and the brush doesn&#x27;t clean well</li>
            <li> a more serious note-</li>
            <li> last two had the exact same problem.  </li>
            <li> They told me that miraculously I was the only person who had ever contacted that particular support staff with the brush head problem.  </li>
            <li> Now, the 3rd (or is the 4th) unit is experiencing the exact same problem yet again -- the metal shaft seeming to come apart inside the rubber sleeve.  </li>
            <li> Has several options, including a timer for those who are particular about brushing for the recommended 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> hygienist recommended this particular model during my last visit.</li>
            <li> You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than all the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the UV Sanitizer thing is worth it, you can&#x27;t really tell if its killing germs or not</li>
            <li> Our dentist noticed a difference, particularly with our gums and back teeth.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even stand using a regular tooth brush anymore, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back ;)</li>
            <li> I told her it could only be attributed to this particular toothbrush (never had a comment from her while using the Braun), brushing three,</li>
            <li> The only reason I switched is because they stopped making the replacements brush heads for my older model.</li>
            <li> It is also a solid improvement over the older generations as toothpaste and muck does not collect under the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I have had no less than 10 Philips Sonicare tootbrushes over the years for our family.</li>
            <li> Well I had read the reviews before I purchased &amp; remembered the tip to put the toothbrush in my mouth before turning it on because this thing splattered toothpaste like if the main artery had been slashed on the side of my neck with just my mouth barely open</li>
            <li> The general person will not likely spend this much on a toothbrush, sonic or not.  </li>
            <li> The general person will not likely spend this much on a toothbrush, sonic or not.  </li>
            <li> first brush lasted 9 months, the second about the same.</li>
            <li> it is an older model and it may have been damaged by sudden power</li>
            <li> I usually use the quick clean mode because the other one seems like it takes forever.</li>
            <li> It is actually cheaper and I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years now with no problems (other than having to clean out the nastiness that lurks under the brush head).</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt as clean when I brushed manually or with other electrics.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the Flexcare&#x27;s much smaller (and spikier) head just doesn&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
            <li> The price was high, but after reading the reviews and doing some research I finally bought this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The retail pricing is actually too high / inflated price tag, but if you can get it</li>
            <li> So overall, would highly recommend Sonicares, but this one might be overpriced because it&#x27;s the newer model.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush to everyone, especially if you have oral ailments.  </li>
            <li> The new design is really cool and no more</li>
            <li> I called Philips customer service center, was on the phone for under 5 minutes, and they shipped a whole new unit to me.</li>
            <li> I called Sonicare (Philips), they asked my name and are sending me a new handset with no further action on my part.</li>
            <li> They sent a new one out in 3 days (with no cost to me) and provided return shipping to send the old unit back.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one and requested that I send my old unit back.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get the sanitizer version because it was only a little bit more and came with 2 different brush options.  </li>
            <li> the whole unit really don&#x27;t take up a lot of room if you have a typical sink.</li>
            <li> Only annoyance is that the charging/UV station always makes a slight buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> I had the previous one for 10 years and the buttons got worn out - but totally expected after so many</li>
            <li> Now, a year and half later, the replacement unit has become annoyingly loud and does not vibrate as well as it did originally.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses the Sonicare and has been for a long time.</li>
            <li> The oscillation of the brush head is a strange sensation on your teeth and gums, but once you get used to it the system works very well.</li>
            <li> Also, the &#x27;Go Care&#x27; and &#x27;Max Care&#x27; settings are very convenient and take the guesswork out of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing in each area of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> If it was larger, it would be harder to fit into smaller curves around the gumline.  </li>
            <li> If it was larger, it would be harder to fit into smaller curves around the gumline.  </li>
            <li> A SonicCare toothbrush is definitely a change from a normal brushing.</li>
            <li> The battery charge last about a week unplugged for a normal usage</li>
            <li> Not having used an electric toothbrush before, I expected to be wearing a lot of toothpaste the first not around, but not so.  </li>
            <li> While it is expensive, I think it is certainly worth it and trust that it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> I tried several chargers to make sure it was the toothbrush itself that was dead, and this was definitely the case.</li>
            <li> It actually fell off a couple of times during normal brushing.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the various modes (normal, max, massage, etc.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush last year at Target where it was normally $189...</li>
            <li> The normal clean is a 2 minute, 30 second per side (lower front, lower back, upper front, upper back) program.</li>
            <li> Once you own this it would be very hard to go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I think that this brush could be easily used by a \\&quot;lefty\\&quot; or a \\&quot;righty\\&quot; and is something I wish I had when my right arm was broken!</li>
            <li> Using the Philips wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Yes, there&#x27;s always going to be an exception, but you have to realize a simple fact which is that the sole interest of these large corporations be it</li>
            <li> The built in programs help me make sure I brush long enough, while allowing me to brush for less time when I&#x27;m in a hurry or softer when my gums are sore.</li>
            <li> and/or has more vibration in the hand than some other Sonicare model they had used previously.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve started brushing my teeth and have other models quit on me half way through.</li>
            <li> and my dentist could tell my teeth were in better condition (I brush too hard with regular tooth brushes).  </li>
            <li> It is not as loud as I expected it to be and not nearly as annoying to my mouth as other brands.</li>
            <li> coz for almost 2-3 years I had been suffering with sensitive teeth, only people who has it will understand my feeling; and now I am almost free of sensitive teeth becoz of this little Giant Flexcare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wanted to get the new model with the smaller head design around 2003/2004</li>
            <li> After about two or three years the new model simply wouldn&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li> It also has several new features including a massage function and the UV sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> sent me a new unit 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li> While waiting for the new brush to come in, we had to go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> But after about a months use the blue line on the toothbrush head already begun to recede indicating that I would soon need a new toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> The new one with its smaller brush head and slenderer stem is easier to use.</li>
            <li> After a short discussion of the problem and giving the rep. the model number and serial number of my unit, I was told a new Flexcare would be sent out to me and arrive in a week.  </li>
            <li> Today, Wednesday, a brand new entire unit was sitting on my doorstep when I got home from work.  </li>
            <li> I am still up in the air on all the new &#x60;settings/cleaning modes&#x27; but I will definitely give them all a try.  </li>
            <li> We are now researching new ones and either will replace it with another Sonicare (this was our second) or go with something else.</li>
            <li> It also has a built in 30 second reminder to tell you to switch to a new area of your mouth followed by an automatic 2 minute shutoff.</li>
            <li> so you have to either get used to or go back to the mode for new users.     </li>
            <li> Shawn, I purchased a new Flexcare system back in June 2010 from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but at this point of time I can only suggest you to buy new Toothbrush with the 15% discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only have purchased new brush heads as needed.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to go to the back yard to get a new branch</li>
            <li> live chat with Phillips Care, after remote diagnosing by the representative, resulted in a brand new replacement unit being shipped to me along with a postage paid return package for the old brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this device and would never go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Starting with the bottom teeth, I gently moved the brush head in the back and forth motion as directed.  </li>
            <li> last thing, the brush heads are somewhat pricey and the blue indicator bristle section seems to run out much faster than the recommended 3 months.</li>
            <li> My last electric toothbrush lasted over 3 years and it just doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to spend over $100 on a toothbrush that can&#x27;t even last year.  </li>
            <li> I then bought this Sonic set and let me tell you how much I ENJOY and look forward to brushing everyday (several time a day now).  </li>
            <li> The whole package is expensive, even more is the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> The much smaller and simpler FlexCare brush heads make for a much cleaner experience, especially if you travel and have to remove the head to put it in the travel case.  </li>
            <li> So to Sonicare thanks for getting my teeth back to where they are suppose to be and AMAZON for taking the time out to have such a VARIETY of brushes by</li>
            <li> My first minor nitpick is that the brush should remember the cleaning-mode setting that you used last.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying another because I do love it, but at nearly a hundred bucks, I&#x27;m not happy about it at all...  </li>
            <li> I will be buying another because I do love it, but at nearly a hundred bucks, I&#x27;m not happy about it at all...  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but over the years of use it is overall a good value for the benefits that it provides for you and your family.</li>
            <li> The first one I had was an older model with the cup tops, it broke down in the second year.  </li>
            <li> You just push them down until they slide right onto it.  </li>
            <li> We bought this to replace a very old Sonicare that finally stopped working.</li>
            <li> I realize this requirement is pretty commonplace but its pretty frustrating when a dedicated phillips consumer (my home is full of phillips electronics and other Phillips products) gets treated in this manner.</li>
            <li> The unit itself allows for multiple cleaning options: (basic clean, sensitive setting, message setting, 1 minute clean and 3 minute clean).     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Sonicare toothbrushes in the past and feel like they are the reason I&#x27;ve such healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> You mouth would only feel cleaner if a professional had just cleaned it!</li>
            <li> Has some major study come out telling everyone to replace their brush every three months?  </li>
            <li> After having used 2 other models for a couple years each and then breaking, I was a little nervous about spending a lot of money on their top model.  </li>
            <li> That and the gap between the toothbrush head and the backing was a major repository of smelly toothpaste remnants.</li>
            <li> The first one of these that I bought two years ago died recently, and I just got a second one last week to replace it.  </li>
            <li> But in spite of my disappointment with the two year lifespan of my first one, the bottom line for me is that I liked the power and the features enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li> At first, the controls and LED indicators on the brush handle seem confusing--but I&#x27;ve brushed manually for the last couple decades, so that&#x27;s likely just me.</li>
            <li> Apparently both brushes that came with my Sonicare were incorrect models!  </li>
            <li> The unit is much more compact than I expected and not nearly as loud as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I always think about that video clip that shows them vibrating in the water &amp; how the Oral-B barely moves the water &amp; the Sonicare goes bananas!</li>
            <li> where to start:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded from an electric Oral-B toothbrush to this one and notice a major difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much gone insane, even though I took great care of the handle for the two years I owned it.</li>
            <li> I was constantly using the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting, but after a few weeks I have been able to use the regular \\&quot;clean\\&quot; setting thanks to less sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It is important because lack of torque will prevent Flexcare owners using heavy toothpaste such as Colgate Total, also, its bristles are not of same high quality like the Advance&#x27;s     Few positive improvements of Flexcare compared to the older model:     </li>
            <li> The only down sides that I&#x27;ve heard: if you turn the toothbrush on either free of your mouth, or if you happen to open your mouth while brushing, it has a tendency to splatter - but that makes sense considering the motion the brush takes.</li>
            <li> I buy a big pack of heads at Costco but only replace the heads every 4-5 months and take them off the brush to clean the connection every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I have passed over more than a few purchases, when a brief search revealed a lousy customer service reputation of a company, so this experience was refreshing.</li>
            <li> So can someone please explain why something that should logically cost less since it uses less materials and uses NO radical new technology in fact costs 300%-400% more than a conventional toothbrush and why you would pay for such an overpriced product?</li>
            <li> I usually use the clean setting</li>
            <li> The operation noise is minor compared to my older model.</li>
            <li> Also, there are a few modes to use (extensive brushing, quick, sensitive, etc.)</li>
            <li> A few times over the years I used a Swissco brand toothbrush and recently began using a Radius Original toothbrush three times a day.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but now that I have used the toothbrush for a little while it was worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I read over every review I could find and as many pointed out it looks like some of the &#x27;annoying&#x27; issues have been corrected over the original model (mold/scum collecting under the brush head mount, handle sticking to the charger like glue at times!)    </li>
            <li> Sure, I brush regularly but not for very long, and certainly not following the suggested charts of up and down and side to side for two minutes or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have a few of settings on this including a one minute short setting, a three minute extended clean, and a message setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to guess the price of the brushheads are cheaper now too because they are smaller and don&#x27;t have all the extra parts the older model has</li>
            <li> newer brush heads are notably more expensive than the older ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But those improvements, as significant as they are, pale in comparison to the Sonicare cleaning experience overall.  </li>
            <li> The first time you get sick, you will be so glad to have the UV sanitizer!    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sonicare products, but they are not for everyone, the light buzzing can be an annoyance to people who are easily annoyed, but with time even they can get used to the Sonicare system.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying one of these, especially is you are not so keen on flossing daily.</li>
            <li> Not only do my teeth feel cleaner, but I am able to get some of the hard to reach places much easier than I could with a conventional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it will also be much easier to keep clean since the threaded head style of my old model (impossible to keep clean inside) is gone now replaced with a simple slip-in brush head that should have no such issues.</li>
            <li> That is bad, but considering the quality of electronics these days, I am happy this lasted four years.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was amazing, but unfortunately it broke within a year</li>
            <li> Philips who manufactures this toothbrush, General Motors or Apple is PROFIT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud enough to wake up my wife while I get ready in the morning -- whereas my electric shaver is louder and will wake her up.    </li>
            <li> The travel pouch will no doubt come in useful and the brush caps will stop the head becoming dirty.</li>
            <li> Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them.</li>
            <li> and I even loved the idea of UV Sanitizer which I at first thought was stupid idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly surprising to see how many others had the same thing happen.</li>
            <li> My only concern was of the reviews that mentioned the toothbrush being loud.  </li>
            <li> I personally like it and surprised no one else is even talked about it.</li>
            <li> like that it has options for sensitive and regular or whitening.</li>
            <li> only downside of this is that the silver button that changes the routine is on the area where you would naturally put your thumb.</li>
            <li> Today, I went to my 6 month check up and the hygienist barely had to do anything.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I barely put any pressure at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, all I wanted was a toothbrush, and one that took the same brush head as my old one did as I have 4 unused brush heads bought as replacements for both my husband and me.  </li>
            <li> may go back to my old one and ditch this.</li>
            <li> Apparently the toothbrush cannot handle this.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, it&#x27;s a bit loud, but again, this seems to make sense considering what the brush is doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then my old sonic which had the bigger brush.</li>
            <li> Apparently just a quality issue.  </li>
            <li> I am back to the old Oral B which I was just about to throw out.   </li>
            <li> I was also asked to ship the old one back to the company, which I did.</li>
            <li> This one has 3 different settings and I use the sensitive one exclusively.  </li>
            <li> This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures.</li>
            <li> The old brushheads use to say they would last 6 months</li>
            <li> You have to realize that every time you purchase something whether it be an organic apple as opposed to a pesticide sprayed apple or a T-shirt made in the USA as opposed to a sweatshop in China, you have a direct impact on these corporations profits and that you have the ability to influence their future decisions.</li>
            <li> I especially like the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> The old one handled only 110V.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After having used the Flexcare, it doesn&#x27;t even seem possible to compare it to my old Oral-B (which is only a year old.)  </li>
            <li> After using the Flexcare for awhile, I went back to my old Oral-B, just to compare...  </li>
            <li> Compared to any regular toothbrush, spin brush or even an Oral B sonic toothbrush I had bought, Sonicare completely blows them away.  </li>
            <li> (the old models seemed to accumulate gunk and required constant maintenance).  </li>
            <li> My 2nd unit is about 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> would turn on but barely move.  </li>
            <li> and I developed gingivitis, and my teeth were not as white as they were.     </li>
            <li> (just pull it off &amp; snap it on), however I only ever had to remove the old one 2 or 3 times before it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Our old sonicare toothbrush recently died so we decided to upgrade to this one.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare moved the tuning fork from the head to the handle, which means smaller brush heads than on the old models.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that within about 10 minutes of starting the chat Philips determined that my toothbrush was still under warranty and sent out a replacement.  </li>
            <li> after 5+ yrs of using my old one every day, the battery finally stopped taking a charge</li>
            <li> and I have found that replacement bulbs can only be purchased from Philips by calling them directly (800-370-6369).  </li>
            <li> (the first time I was disconnected) with an average wait of around 20 minutes.    </li>
            <li> There are various settings for the toothbrush depending on how sensitive your gums are, or depending on what type of brushing you prefer.</li>
            <li> brush has bristles of various lengths that get in-between the teeth  and feel quite soft.  </li>
            <li> The motor is quiet on the Sensitive setting, and won&#x27;t wake anyone else up.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t bore you with the details (which you can read above in the item description), but really, you have just enough options not to overwhelm you, but to suit your every dental hygienic need (short of a root canal or cavity filling, but you shouldn&#x27;t need them if you keep using this thing).  </li>
            <li> Apparently they put money into designing these program modes but they don&#x27;t want you to use them.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they put money into designing these program modes but they don&#x27;t want you to use them.  </li>
            <li> The brush signals each quadrant change by a split second interruption in the brushing action.</li>
            <li> If you have never timed yourself brushing your teeth you might be surprised, sometimes 2 minutes can feel like an eternity, especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> So now Im back on track and need to get busy.</li>
            <li> no need to send the old one back.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of hating to use the Sonicare, and even returning to an old fashioned toothbrush, I contacted their on-line customer service.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my dentist said I should buy a $120+ toothbrush but my sensitive gums weren&#x27;t happy with my harsh brushing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to the old manual method of brushing after experiencing this technology.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use all the different \\&quot;modes\\&quot;- I have sensitive teeth but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode.</li>
            <li> The manual action of brushing teeth can get tiring sooner or later, leading to non-brushing.</li>
            <li> professional dental instruments consumers can not buy and this toothbrush is the only thing that comes close to the thoroughness of  specialized equipment.  </li>
            <li> There may be a dentist near you with the same attitude!</li>
            <li> and I only charged mine when it died since I travel quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> it was only 13 months old.  </li>
            <li> If you neglect to choose go care or max care, you apparently get 2 minutes of \\&quot;Clean\\</li>
            <li> I noticed the same thing when I started using the old model, so</li>
            <li> For nearly $200, I was expecting this toothbrush to last longer than 24 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My got old and started leaking, it was gross.  </li>
            <li> Philips will not replace the brush a second time, so I am going back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of companies that stand behind thier products - and I&#x27;ll be buying more Philips products in the near future.</li>
            <li> I know many were not happy with the non-replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> It was messy and didn&#x27;t seem worth the bother.  </li>
            <li> Yes, electric toothbrushes are by nature messy, but this one is worth the bother.</li>
            <li> this is that u have to take out the brush head and wash that thin metal + inside of the brush to make sure saliva/toothpaste etc</li>
            <li> Although that is an unnecessary embellishment, I thought what can it hurt to try it out for about 3% more money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I say everyone should own this toothbrush and won&#x27;t be sorry when they shell out the cash for one.  </li>
            <li> It lasted about two weeks on a full charge with both my wife and I using it twice a day (usually on the max care cycle).</li>
            <li> The other thing I do not like about this model in particular is that the rubber/plastic near the brush head  </li>
            <li> And so instead of just applying toothpaste and turning the unit on, I have to first move the setting down to MaxCare each time before turning on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this tooth brush after my first powerbrush broke down.</li>
            <li> Which leads me to my second and last complaint: the price is pretty high, particularly when you factor in the nonreplaceable battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with Sonicare, but will try the lower priced R710 -- same lightweight design &amp; ProResults brushes as the FlexCare, but under $100 (of course, you lose the extra modes, but I can live with that).</li>
            <li> In addition to the fact that I love my toothbrush, when the handle failed to recharge, I called Philips and, after getting all the pertinent info, they sent me a new handle in the mail.</li>
            <li> Knowing several new models have come out, I decided it was time to finally take the plunge and replace it.</li>
            <li> and I had to throw away the entire string trimmer or cordless drill after the battery could no longer properly recharge, or if Motorola&#x27;s cell phones did not allow you to replace its lithium battery and required you to buy a new cell phone after its battery wore out.  </li>

            <li> This new design has several internal attachment pieces that hold the metal rod in place.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve been a smoker most of my life and a heavy black tea drinker, and the Sonicare has removed all stains from my teeth.</li>
            <li> Mostly just annoying; the button should not have been placed here, or should not  be so easy to activate.  </li>
            <li> The only other electric toothbrush experiences I had before this were the $5 Colgate battery operated from Walmart and the Braun 3D Excel (a Consumer Report favorite a few years</li>
            <li> The pulse vibrations feel extremely different compared to my last toothbrush, the hold was ergonomically improved (though for a while I kept accidentally shutting off the toothbrush, as it&#x27;s very sensitive).</li>
            <li> and it works exactly like the previous model,</li>
            <li> Funny how Philips has no record of my previous exchange</li>
            <li> One nice benefit in changing to the very, very small travel charger was that I freed up some space on my bathroom counter, and the brush is easier to set down and pickup without the sanitizer being in the way.  </li>
            <li> One nice benefit in changing to the very, very small travel charger was that I freed up some space on my bathroom counter, and the brush is easier to set down and pickup without the sanitizer being in the way.  </li>
            <li> It was very large and not comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Flexcare brushheads seem to last just as long as the brushheads that came with the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> First, though, my teeth have been a mess for years.  </li>
            <li> Compared to any other toothbrush/sonicare, this toothbrush really just takes care of business.  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I have a real problem with plaque.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the battery in the Flexcare will last or whether the whole toothbrush will have to be discarded when the battery does finally wear</li>
            <li> But other than that I really like this flexcare.</li>
            <li> * Gunky buildup under the brush head, and it&#x27;s hard to clean in there  </li>
            <li> they can effectively clean the backs of my wisdom teeth which are usually hard to get to.</li>
            <li> The system and my trusted brand of toothpaste make my teeth feel so much cleaner than any other toothbrush I have ever used (manual or electric/battery operated).</li>
            <li> I have gotten 4 other people to buy it because I like it so much.    </li>
            <li> And the other quadrants collect food much faster than before.</li>
            <li> I usually upgrade every few years, and the last one to be replaced was one of the Sonicare toothbrushes which I also liked.</li>
            <li> The vibration and ease of using the brush is a little better than my previous brush, the Oral B, and it has different power and brushing options.</li>
            <li> It had treated me well, but the battery was no longer holding a charge for more than 60 seconds, and the heads were getting harder and harder to track down.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;downside\\&quot; is that older people (who have trouble keeping their hands somewhat steady)  can&#x27;t get the operation down very well.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend seeing your dentist after you have bought such a toothbrush; especially, if you have always used a manual toothbrush, as this is a big change and you have to transition to a new routine.     </li>
            <li> Unless it&#x27;s making you deaf or genuinely malfunctioning, I don&#x27;t understand why that&#x27;s a serious issue.  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the noise, but really - you are brushing your teeth - does it really matter?  </li>
            <li> This product has made such a big improvement in my dental health that I plan to purchase one for each of my adult sons.</li>
            <li> and we expected it to last much longer than 14 months.</li>
            <li> At the end of the time frame, the brush switches to a shorter \\&quot;gum massage\\&quot; action, then finally, there is a tone which is your cue to switch to a different area of your teeth, and the cycle begins again.</li>
            <li> The unit is actually longer than my old brush, but that&#x27;s not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that replacement brush heads are actually cheaper than on my old brush is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> The fact that replacement brush heads are actually cheaper than on my old brush is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> At my last dental checkup, the dentist said I had early gum disease and needed deep scaling/planing.</li>
            <li> As well as it works, for $175 canadian this thing is just not reliable enough, for that kind of money it should last at least a few years, not a few months.  </li>
            <li> This comes with a travel charger, but no second handle, and only a soft case.&lt;br /&gt;-My dentist doubts the need for the UV cleaner and advises people to buy the FlexCare without it.</li>
            <li> I am now back to using a regular old manual brush.</li>
            <li> I only used it for about a minute, gingerly pressing it to my teeth before pulling it back, and this was on the sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> another issue I have is that the timer is only for two minutes, though this is the case with nearly every electric toothbrush, two minutes is just not enough time for me.  </li>
            <li> My 12 yr old daughter recently started using it and her teeth are so white!  </li>
            <li> The main unit has a rubberized handle grip to help you hold onto it with wet hands</li>
            <li> The indicator lights are very straighforward (slow blink still santizing, fast blink done).    </li>
            <li> I have used a previous Sonicare model a few years ago, and most recently a Braun.  </li>
            <li> All of the other pluses mentioned by other reviewers are all true:  </li>
            <li> The sanitizer thing that comes attached is kind of weird- doesn&#x27;t seem that necessary to have</li>
            <li> I thought that was kind of standard for expensive</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s Sonicare of the same model broke down within the first year.</li>
            <li> When the back of the brush rattles against the other teeth (the ones opposite of the ones you&#x27;re brushing), it is not merely an annoyance, it can chip a crown.  </li>
            <li> First off, Its a little off putting to have a motor in your mouth</li>
            <li> The first was given to me as a gift a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> My gums are pretty sensitive and prone to bleeding when I brush with a normal brush, but while I&#x27;ve had a tiny bit of sensitivity issues (no more than when I brushed with a regular brush), my gums have not bled once since using this toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve used the 3 minute max care (includes 15 seconds of gum massaging per quadrant) every time I&#x27;ve brushed.  </li>
            <li> Took a little bit to get used to the vibration.......and it sometimes tickles my tongue ;-)</li>
            <li> buying a new product of any sort will always have a negative environmental footprint, these new brushes are better than the old models due to their Li-Ion batteries, reduced bulk, and lower waste in the smaller replacement brush</li>
            <li> Like most people, I was taken back first by the vigorousness with which it brushed my teeth, but over time became accustomed to it &amp; my mouth felt dirty when I tried brushing it with any thing else but my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that the rubber bottom can get gross pretty fast if you are not diligent to keep it dry.&lt;br /&gt;And once a mold smell gets in that rubber, look out.</li>
            <li> I used the UV Sanitizer a few times, but I don&#x27;t use it at all anymore because of what I believe to be a very real problem with all the anti-bacterial products out there these days.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;d be weary of recommending this particular model; I&#x27;m not certain if they improved or corrected this design weakness with FlexCare Plus.  </li>
            <li> Once again in less than 2yrs the on/off switch malfunctioned and the sonic action was not operating normally.  </li>
            <li> With the FlexCare, I don&#x27;t work nearly as hard as I did with either of my other brushes, and I get a MUCH better cleaning from it.  </li>
            <li> To possibly improve my chances for toothbrush longevity, I rinse the brush head and toothbrush body briefly under running water after usage, dry it lightly with a hand towel, and flick it a few times to shake the excess water off the brush head.</li>

            <li> Then after 14 months the brushing mechanism became very loose to the point where I don&#x27;t think we are getting the same clean as we did previously.</li>
            <li> On the following Saturday when I was off work and had time, I contacted Phillips customer service via their online chat option, because I generally dislike talking to customer service over the phone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I got the unit, I notice that areas on my back teeth that are hard to clean (get plaque build up) are getting cleaner.</li>
            <li> I just charged it up every 2 weeks and it helped to clean those hard to reach areas like the back of your teeth and molars.     </li>
            <li> but it is no where near as loud as some of the other reviews make it seem.</li>
            <li> We like the idea that it has a number of different settings that can  be used to provide for sensitive teeth, regular cleaning, or deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I recently had gum surgery and found the sensitive mode to be helpful in starting back using the electric brush.  </li>
            <li> But, I believe now it is related to the poorly fitting toothbrush head not seated properly and snug on the poorly designed/or manufactured \\&quot;metal rod fitting\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> Since it is so expensive, my husband and I would share the toothbrush and use our own heads (using the same head would just be gross.)  </li>
            <li> but I prefer manually brushing behind and on top of the bigger teeth in the back.</li>
            <li> So for anyone thinking of this as their first electric toothbrush, give this one a try for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The first few times that I started using the sonicare</li>
            <li> She explained that they&#x27;re not like the little cheapie battery-operated toothbrushes you can buy in the grocery store right next to the regular Oral-Bs and Reach toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted only several months before it broke down.  </li>
            <li> It came quite earlier than expected and brand new!</li>
            <li> love the uv cleaner attached to the base of holder, so you always have a clean brush to insert onto the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Thsi toothbrush really cuts down on the placque.</li>
            <li> Just like your electric-shavers that broke down on me fast, so did your Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Really cuts down on the amount of toothpaste that I need to use (I did not get it for that reason).  </li>
            <li> The down fall of this product is really up in the air.</li>
            <li> and it is so simple and easy to use (I am no good at reading and following directions).  </li>
            <li> the amazon price was little bit higher when i purchased and now i see the same in walmart for 94$.</li>
            <li> I would have the same major gripes if Black&amp;Decker designed their rechargeable cordless string trimmer and cordless drills such that I could not replace those batteries</li>
            <li> I would have the same major gripes if Black&amp;Decker designed their rechargeable cordless string trimmer and cordless drills such that I could not replace those batteries</li>
            <li> Last September I bought the newer model, Sonicare Flexcare, with the UV light; it broke down in less than one year.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many of these things they sell and replace, but it&#x27;s hard to think of that sad lot of trash going into landfills just to keep our teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I mean, how cool is that?</li>
            <li> So I spent $176 plus the cost of replacement brushes on 2 defective handsets and they don&#x27;t even have the courtesy to reset the warranty for a new device.  </li>
            <li> Outside of the new design, the brush has a few new features, but nothing too noteworthy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> She responded that yes, it was closed and brand new...    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend going with anything other than this soniccare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was ridiculous how clean my teeth felt, as if I just had them cleaned and polished at my dentist.</li>
            <li> This product replaced my previous (Oral B) and the speed of this toothbrush is much faster.</li>
            <li> Much lighter to hold than the previous Sonicare version.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the UV cleaner as much as I thought I would, and I am not going to get out a petri dish to test its effectiveness, but if it works half as well as the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The ProResults brush heads use what looks like half as much plastic.  </li>
            <li> Another issue is cleaning the Flexcare which is as much a chore as it was with previous models.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the UV cleaner is really killing any germs but the cleaning action gets an A++.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your teeth as well as if not better than a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I can only hope this brush lasts me as long as my old one did</li>
            <li> Go care is a minute of the standard speed, which apparently is for those of you who can&#x27;t spare an extra minute to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Thin, long toothbrush allows for better reach.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that this would be worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and yes, they did send a replacement the first time but same thing happened again after a few months of using the replacement.  </li>
            <li> The default is like last years model in that it brushes for 2 minutes, broken up into 15 second intervals for top front, back, and bottom front and back.  </li>
            <li> To my relief, actually using the toothbrush was painless, although the first few times it tickled a bit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electronic toothbrushes (all battery operated) in the past, and never saw a compelling difference between using them versus the traditional &#x27;manual&#x27; toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good while it works, but it&#x27;s very expensive and should last longer.</li>
            <li> Sure it is a bit noisy, but the smart timer makes it impossible to brush incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Sensitive (toned down for sensitive teeth)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for nearly 14 years every single day</li>
            <li> It easy to use, once you read the Manual, but be careful not to push it hard against your teeth and gum.  </li>
            <li> Since you actually do NOT need to press the brush hard against the tooth and gumline surfaces, the brush does not wear out and get ragged as quickly as a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since you actually do NOT need to press the brush hard against the tooth and gumline surfaces, the brush does not wear out and get ragged as quickly as a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one major nitpick is that I see absolutely no logic in designing the brush to have a non-replaceable battery (other than purely for Philips&#x27; marketing/sales purposes of planned obsolescence).  </li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re willing to pay $100+ for something that will only last you a few years, this toothbrush is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually sanitizing the two brush heads, or if I&#x27;m even putting them on right, since they always seem to rest precariously on the pin.  </li>

            <li> The shaft that the brush head mounts on came loose completely inside the product.  </li>
            <li> If you have big hands, putting the brush head into the sanitizer is more awkward, especially if you&#x27;re using the large brush head (FYI: the brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I just move it slowly back and forth, less than 50 strokes does my whole mouth), this isn&#x27;t a problem at all now.  </li>
            <li> (I just move it slowly back and forth, less than 50 strokes does my whole mouth), this isn&#x27;t a problem at all now.  </li>
            <li> I think some of the less expensive soniccare toothbrushes would do just as good of a job at a lower cost.  </li>
            <li> I found it tickled my palette almost unbearably the first few times, which has eased a little, and I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t be so bad once I get used to the unique and ticklish sensations.</li>

            <li> The system takes a little getting used to, but works very well.</li>
            <li> The other thing is the new brush head design.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty old fashioned, and the idea of getting a fancy toothbrush seemed ridiculous until I started getting some tooth decay and the dental bills arrived.  </li>
            <li> But based on our experience, it is tough to recommend it, especially given the pretty high price.</li>
            <li> I hate to give such a great product only one star, but to pay that much for something and have it last less than a year is inexcusable.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal really, but just another little challenge the ergonomic folks should solve before</li>
            <li> It is a little strange getting used to it at first, it \\&quot;tickles\\&quot; your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Now I bought the cheapest \\&quot;HealthyWhite\\&quot; (without the sensitive setting) which lasted a little over a year before making loud grinding noise (the head starts to wobble).</li>
            <li> This new Flexcare model is as they say, lighter, sleeker, smaller, but they did not mention its also louder than any other model.  </li>
            <li> This works fine, charges well, but I feel that the brush head is too large, and I don&#x27;t feel like it works as well as the small round brush on my previous toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you seriously thinkthat these corporations sit down and try to figure out how to produce the most efficient and durable product and thereby have your financial interest at hand</li>
            <li> I had the Intelliclen system I was happy with it in till I learned that sonicare no longer made brush heads for it what ever reason which was stupid but</li>
            <li> It worked amazingly for about two years on the dot, then mysteriously started acting crazy.</li>
            <li> , I can only say that some people clearly did not read the instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> , I can only say that some people clearly did not read the instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> Hard telling how much this has saved us in dental bills over the past decade - it does a tremendous job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and not near the hassle to keep clean like</li>
            <li> It vibrates so fast that it startles you unpleasantly if you touch the plastic shaft of the brush tip to your teeth while it&#x27;s running--which is easy to do.</li>
            <li> This system of internally mounting the metal vibration pole is much more fragile than the previous system and is the weak link in terms of reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sonicare flexcare is quite expensive compared with other choices, but seems to be really effective without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> Other options to replace just the broken brush handle itself are not the most desirable because they come bulk packaged, which questions the authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not like the reviews that complain about loose brush heads and dead units within the first year.</li>
            <li> I do not like the reviews that complain about loose brush heads and dead units within the first year.</li>
            <li> when my dentist recommended the Sonicare FlexCare I was a little skeptical that it was just going to be another cheap electric toothbrush with a much higher price tag.</li>
            <li> I had done this exact same thing with every other electric toothbrush I have ever owned and had no issues doing this (even with the previous sonicare) until this one gave me the issue.  </li>
            <li> I now truly know that my brush is clean and that there&#x27;s nothing gross secretly growing on my brush.</li>
            <li> The travel charger works the same, but my complaint there is that a lack of weight will cause you to need to position the cord carefully when putting the travel charger down or you wont be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> But, a couple of days after getting the brush, it actually took some of the plaque off that the older brush was missing.  </li>
            <li> With frequent sinus infections, strep, pneumonia, bronchitis, and other illnesses, I&#x27;m all too grateful to have the UV sanitizer, and don&#x27;t mind taking a  fraction of a minute&#x27;s time twice a day to prevent re-infection</li>
            <li> but I suffer from migraines and some of the buzzing sounds &amp; vibrations from other brands seem to trigger them (my migraines) early in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really do like this toothbrush and although my husband did not want me to replace my first one because it only lasted 3 years and is so expensive, I did get another one for $120.</li>
            <li> usually, just stick to the basic settings and don&#x27;t really feel a difference between brushing and massage settings - they feel the same to me.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is fantastic that this has some useful programs ~ unlike its predecessors, which left you with like gentle and hard brushing (totally useless, in my humble opinion).  </li>
            <li> I thought the price was a little high</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful when buying a Sonicare of any model to replace an old one.  </li>
            <li> So, now less than one calendar week from when the toothbrush died, I have a brand new set up</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush is the replacement for our previous Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> The only minor issue I have is that the plastic coating on the back of the brush is peeling off.</li>
            <li> Guess we&#x27;ll just have to see how long the second replacement will last...</li>
            <li> Did not last long until I went back to my manual brush.</li>
            <li> Wow - I read many of the reviews in detail before I decided to shell out the bucks for this expensive toothbrush and finally after a couple weeks of arguing with that voice in my head about how big a waste it would be -</li>
            <li> If youre looking for a good tooth bush then look no further you wont be disappointed..</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it&#x27;s a little hard to get the back of my front top and bottom teeth, but other than that, no issues.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small brush head and a large brush head, travel charger and a case.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush comes with one of each head:  a large and a small.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush comes with one of each head:  a large and a small.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a small head that he uses and a large head that I use.</li>
            <li> Sensitive turns down the power a bit, and oddly enough, I&#x27;ve never tried massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to chase down warrenties and mail this back to get fixed.  </li>
            <li> I run the battery down to zero once a month, and two and a half years later I can still get well over a week&#x27;s worth of use out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but at least it is as good as described here in Amazon.com; the only reason I give it only four stars is that I&#x27;m still waiting for the advertised $40 coupon from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Not only am I NOT buying another expensive Sonicare brush, am making sure that I get this message out far and wide on the Web to alert other consumers.    </li>
            <li> As a number of other reviewers have noted there are major reliability issues with this brush, and I have gone through 3 in the last year or so.  </li>
            <li> I called Philips and they sent me a new one a few days later.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed immediately after only a few months of the new brush.</li>
            <li> I said I would think about it and found the same model elsewhere for far less.  </li>
            <li> Got this to replace my previous generation sonicare which finally died after nearly 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I was reticent, as my only experience with electric toothbrushes was from many decades back, when such things only used an exaggerated up and down brushing motion.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending so much money for a toothbrush, but the positive reviews, plus my disdain for periodontist visits, convinced me to try it.</li>
            <li> but it at least gives me some piece of mind that I won&#x27;t be having a bunch of flu germs procreating on my toothbrush ; )</li>
            <li> The Oral-B&#x27;s \\&quot;action\\&quot; was increasingly useless, perhaps because the replacement brush heads were becoming poorer in quality over time.  </li>
            <li> The first one the shaft somehow got disengaged from the motor which seems to be a common problem with this unit.  </li>
            <li> Lately I noticed it sounded funny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is, and supposedly vibration has been reduced in exchange, but the noise can be too much for some.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are much whiter after using just a few weeks!</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t do much traveling anymore w/2 small kids.  </li>
            <li> no more \\&quot;ugh, i&#x27;m already in bed and don&#x27;t really feel like brushing...</li>
            <li> The advance uses a larger, more square shaped brush which makes it somewhat awkward to reach the teeth in the very back.</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint so far is with the \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; soft travel case.</li>
            <li> I have had Sonicare brushes for at least 15 years - bought the first one from my dentist, and it lasted forever.  </li>
            <li> There is no back stop or guide to help in placing the handle back onto the charger making it difficult to locate the precise spot that the handle fits into.</li>
            <li> so I know I am brushing as long as I should be and the different levels of time.  </li>
            <li> I can only hope that the problems I&#x27;ve read here about the toothbrush not holding up for the long haul won&#x27;t be something we encounter.</li>
            <li> As long as I have no problems in the future with the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I obviously have been a long time fan</li>
            <li> Let us see how long this will last.</li>
            <li> can last that long.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get my money back on the product because it&#x27;s been too long</li>
            <li> : How long have you been facing this issue?&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: for like 4 days&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: i am actually scared to use it or plug it in now&lt;br /&gt;Harry</li>
            <li> : yeah apparently not mine</li>
            <li> : yeah apparently not mine</li>
            <li> so I called to find out if I could pay a flat fee for a replacement toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so you brush long enough, the interval timer</li>
            <li> Theres others that are a timer, so you brush long enough.</li>
            <li> Ion Batteries&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a long time for Sonicare to upgrade from inferior NiCd batteries, and they finally have.  </li>
            <li> The one problem I&#x27;ve had with the Rotodent is that because the brush is so small and round I was getting some staining on the surface of my teeth and had to alternate using the RD with a regular toothbrush, so since my Rotodent was wearing out I was very interested to try another brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My second minor nitpick is that at $170, the brush is a bit pricey for what it is.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few days of being wet to cause a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t fit firmly into the charger base, and I had to check to make sure I put it on correctly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amanda Richards, September 29, 2007toothbrush doesn&#x27;t fit firmly into the charger base, and I had to check to make sure I put it on correctly.  </li>
            <li> Get a tube of Locktite blue from your local auto parts supply store and put a drop on the loose Phillips screw before re- installing.</li>
            <li> I bought the same one again, and after only 3 months the metal prong is loose.</li>
            <li> Upon further inspection, I realized that the rubber that insulated the electronics from the outside had become loose and as a result, water had damaged the internals.</li>
            <li> It only starts to vibrate when I push hard against my teeth at certain angle.   </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing an electronic toothbrush, particularly considering the price.</li>
            <li> The sonic action of the brush breaks down the film built up by plaque bacteria.</li>
            <li> : Product broke down completely.  </li>
            <li> My parents and I are now laughing that Amazon.com built a distribution center a couple of streets down from where I live!</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews on this site prior to ordering the new units and I must say that I am a disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When I received the Flexcare I wondered about durability of the soft handle since I knew from using previous Sonicare models that the hard plastic handles were very durable, and only yellowed over time.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they have a marketing plan toforce consumers to buy a new one every few years.  </li>
            <li> Even a new brush pops off every few seconds.  </li>
            <li> But like I mentioned, prepare to purchase a new one every few years and get zero help from the joke of \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; Philips has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem so loud any more, and the tingling wasn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> I always dry the toothbrush off before putting it back on the stand - no mold issues.  </li>
            <li> This Sonicare is less than a year old..</li>
            <li> The ugly: Philips business model for the toothbrushes appears to be the same as for their Norelco shaving products - make a nice product that dies after a year or two.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have avoided any hideous mouth diseases (except for my pre-existing periodontal disease), but I didn&#x27;t contract any in my previous 55 years of non-sanitized toothbrush use, so</li>
            <li> There is less of a chance of getting all goopy inside, which was my problem with the old one.</li>
            <li> So while I still am disappointed that the initial product broke, I am very pleased with the ease of replacing it.</li>
            <li> I have always alternated between two manual toothbrushes, thoroughly rinsing each brush after use and letting each totally dry in between use, and I never had any issues with hygiene from contaminated brush bristles (heck, doorknobs, public drinking fountains, kitchen sink sponges, and shaking peoples&#x27; hands</li>
            <li> You price was far less and included the sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the idea of having the UV sanitizer included since I always wondered about bacteria lurking on brushes as they dry.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the battery is not designed to be replaceable--but if I get even two years&#x27; daily use out of it, I think I&#x27;ll still call it money well spent.</li>
            <li> I found the 14-use \\&quot;ramp-up\\&quot;, which slowly increases the brushing to full-power over about a week&#x27;s time, to be a good way to ease into the Sonicare experience, which can be startling for a newbie.</li>
            <li> We purchased this toothbrush in March 2010 and in April 2012 had the problem I&#x27;ve read about in other reviews -- the metal shaft that the brush heads attach to became loose, causing a really loud noise when operating the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Go-Care is for those times when you&#x27;re in rush and only have a limited time to brush your teeth and</li>
            <li> Go-Care is for those times when you&#x27;re in rush and only have a limited time to brush your teeth and</li>
            <li> One other thing with sonicare in general.  </li>
            <li> New users: the vibrations of the brush do tickle until you become accustomed to the sensation; the small brush head definitely helps with that.   </li>
            <li> A tiny screw came loose that clamps the vibrating steel brush rod to the guts.</li>
            <li> When you go to remove the brush head, the rubber sleeve turns into Gumby and s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-s out until the head finally comes loose.    </li>
            <li> metal shaft vibrates loose in one year, sent me another , same thing came apart.</li>
            <li> My old one did not completely wear out, but it had started having less power.  </li>
            <li> After reading that flushing a toilet can spray water particles 6 feet, I like my toothbrush in a covered sanitizer!</li>
            <li> It is a little costly on the price, but definitely cheaper than major dental work.</li>
            <li> And now mine broke down, I am sure I am going to hear from my brothers and sisters also about the failure of their brushesreal soon (probably within a few weeks).</li>
            <li> A little pricey but has done as advertised so far.      </li>
            <li> It is a little loud.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is loud, but it&#x27;s not a significant drawback.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is a little loud</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m taking a star off because the unit is a little loud when I&#x27;m brushing, but</li>
            <li> The vibration does take a little getting used to and it is a little loud but the pros completely outweight the cons with this product.  </li>
            <li> This most recent purchase had a battery life of less than 2 years from the time we began using it, a common complaint you can read in the reviews for every one of their recent models.</li>
            <li> Given that Sonicare is a behemoth in this product market, has been doing this awhile, and gets a lot of feedback on this one major and frequent complaint</li>
            <li> Sonicare changed the way I brush my teeth so much that I could hardly survive with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Friends and the manual said not to press too hard, especially early on; I followed that advice</li>
            <li> In the past couple of months, both toothbrushes have come down with the exact same problem - the shaft that attaches the head to the handle came loose.  </li>
            <li> This is probably because my old Sonicare unit was very durable, despite the fact that the old screw on brushes and handheld unit got a lot of funky gunk inside of it and was disgusting to try to clean.    </li>
            <li> I have spent some time on the net researching these issues, only to find out that my problems are certainly not unique, and that subsequent models (I was hoping for a fix) still have the same issues.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Top notch rechargeable toothbrush you would be crazy not to buy this one..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth mentioning that, although my teeth \\&quot;feel\\&quot; much better after brushing with a Sonicare, the evidence suggests they are no better than manual brushing: [...]    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding criticisms that this toothbrush spurts toothpaste and water all over, is difficult to use, make a deafening sound, is accidentally activated, etc</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding criticisms that this toothbrush spurts toothpaste and water all over, is difficult to use, make a deafening sound, is accidentally activated, etc</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with its design, however, and had given it to my husband for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that I brushed my teeth real well with a manual toothbrush, but boy was I surprised on how wrong I was.</li>
            <li> I will get used the scary sound &amp; tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure time will wear it away, but it was slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is about the second button, I seem to accidentally switch the modes while brushing because it is quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> but then all of sudden the brush heads started slipping off of the brush into my mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel polished all day long.</li>
            <li> but no, it&#x27;s not loud at all.     </li>
            <li> My teeth even feel cleaner all day long.  </li>
            <li> Long time user of Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> Nothing but an annoyance, not nearly at the level of the chipped-crown thing, but it is something that should have been seen to in the design stage.</li>
            <li> A couple of minor complaints:  1.)</li>
            <li> As long as Philips continues to provide a two year warranty, I would buy this toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Should have done this long before....</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the durability or long term quality yet.        </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to justify the price.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time to recharge the battery in the device.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds strange to describe a toothbrush as \\&quot;thrilling,\\</li>
            <li> I should have bought this model long ago.</li>
            <li> We never really used the extra features of the FlexCare.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even hesitate about the price because you will save in the long run by miles.</li>
            <li> Oral-B has a LONG way to go to catch up to this Sonicare model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oral-B has a LONG way to go to catch up to this Sonicare model.    </li>
            <li> There were minor problems with each of them.</li>
            <li> Seeing a few others report issues and failures, I hope this brush is as reliable as my old.</li>
            <li> It also held a charge well during a long trip and charged both in the US and Europe.</li>
            <li> Well designed with long battery life.</li>
            <li> Either way, I somehow expected it to last longer.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer also makes a quiet electric \\&quot;hum\\&quot; when plugged in with the door closed, even if the UV bulb isn&#x27;t run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The UV sanitizer also makes a quiet electric \\&quot;hum\\&quot; when plugged in with the door closed, even if the UV bulb isn&#x27;t run.    </li>
            <li> This brush does not lose power, it brushes as long as you need.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on the phone trying various numbers I was given and never got a number that works for tech support.    </li>
            <li> &quot; long)</li>
            <li> You can also set it for Go Care which is one-minute long, and Max Care, which is three-minutes</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a minor gripe.  </li>
            <li> I just hope it lasts long time.</li>
            <li> minor issue I&#x27;ve had is that I have to watch how I hold it</li>
            <li> But this is minor.    </li>
            <li> You can use it as long as you keep on paying, and paying, and paying...</li>
            <li> a day does the trick and saves you money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer than it did</li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts for a long time (two people could share this brush for a week without charing).</li>
            <li> Both have long stems</li>
            <li> Both have long stems</li>
            <li> &quot; long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Also, it holds charge for a long time and has a sanitizer.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> the first was recently \\&quot;played with\\&quot; by someone in the house and was broken.  </li>
            <li> Other than the high price and a little nitpicking on the brushing modes</li>
            <li> Other than the high price and a little nitpicking on the brushing modes</li>
            <li> yes they are cheaper then the other Sonicare models but at about $10 each they still seem a little high priced for what they are...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the UV sanitizer and could do without it as well as without all the bells and whistles for little less money</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B Sonic Complete was holding less and less of a charge, so it was time to look for a new brush.</li>
            <li> clean mode: (2 minutes broken into 30 second segments), sensitive (a \\&quot;gentler\\&quot; clean mode) and massage (the brush pulsates for gum stimulation).  </li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare model lasted more then 5 years and the only reason i upgraded is because I was having trouble finding the outdated tooth brush heads.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really annoying, though, is that while the brush is running, the silver button is too easy to touch, so we end up in the sensitive or the massage modes unless we&#x27;re careful to hold the wand at the far end.</li>
            <li> Now exactly 1 year later the new one has gone crazy turning itself off and on at will at any hour.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite improvement comes with the new design on the base charger.</li>
            <li> Customer service does not have the handle as a replacement part, so I am either forced to by a new set, or purchase the entry level White model.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended it in part because the replacement heads are less expensive than most.</li>
            <li> Actually using a screw for this ap is totally STUPID.Lots of ways to do this at half the manufacturing cost.</li>
            <li> I will be on my 3rd of these brushed in less than 18 months.  </li>
            <li> My regular six-month dental check-ups/cleanings have definitely improved since I started using the Sonicare (e.g., a lot less tartar build-up).</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sonicare unit a year and a half ago, and the unit stopped functioning after about 6 months, they replaced it, and now 6 months later I&#x27;m having the same issue.</li>
            <li> And Sonicare only expect their toothbrushes to last 3 to 5 years (less than 3 years for me).    </li>
            <li> I am not able to purchase new toothbrush heads that stay on the handle when in use.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer knows that this is a defective product and chooses to hide behind their 2yr warranty instead of doing what is right to maintain customers.  </li>
            <li> Right behind my lower teeth in the front is one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough on sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> The travel charger, case and head covers are handy - no more of those awkward, giant &#x27;snap in&#x27; travel toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I have not used my regular brush since I purchased this item</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy it and use it!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will have a long life and I will prosper from it!</li>
            <li> However, after two tries at the Sonicare it really seems not worth the trouble to get one again as we expect we would have to deal with trying to return it within 6 months again.</li>
            <li> : Okay.&lt;br /&gt;Harry : Please remove the brush head, and see if the metal shaft on the handle is loose?&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer: same thing with other outlet&lt;br /&gt;Harry</li>
            <li> We have had two, one died after ten months and the other after a year.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of other reviews where people had the same issue, the motor slows and weakens then stops working altogether.  </li>
            <li> So lets say that your toothbrush finally dies after 2 years due to a worn out battery.</li>
            <li> But little do people here come back to review such products after years of use and let you know how it performs over time!</li>
            <li> We ignored the other reviews that described similar experiences with short-lived products.  </li>
            <li> Any other extras that come with this thing, are really only their to pad the price.</li>
            <li> My dentist actually recommended it due to my arthritis...</li>
            <li> but I constantly turn if off while using due to placement of on-off button.</li>
            <li> I have not tried other sonicare toothbrushes, but I definitely reccomend it over an electric.</li>
            <li> The vibrations seemed a little intense but after a few uses it wasn&#x27;t a factor anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other of the sonicare tooth brushes and like the way my feel after brushing</li>
            <li> I read other reviews here of similar issue and lengthly replacement times.  </li>
            <li> I am only charging it every other month</li>
            <li> Expensive but WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, I never contacted sonicare or anything, but for the money I had hoped this would last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I have read some other reviews that mentioned that daily use of the UV sanitizer can be cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I purchased the small heads &amp; they fit well behind the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Scientists actually recommend that a toothbrush be kept 3 feet from the toilet due to \\&quot;airborne particles\\&quot; from the flush - yuck!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Right before the warranty ran out, the first unit&#x27;s drive mechanism became very sloppy and loud and the brush became unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it very long</li>
            <li> , it actually wasn&#x27;t stormy, and it wasn&#x27;t technically \\&quot;night\\&quot;, seeing that it was two in the morning, but it WAS very, very dark.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need it, and it won&#x27;t work for very long anyway.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;that&#x27;s all well and good, but only crazy idiots who are rich spend $180 on a toothbrush,\\</li>
            <li> \\&quot;that&#x27;s all well and good, but only crazy idiots who are rich spend $180 on a toothbrush,\\</li>
            <li> But this toothbrush ranks right up there with my TIVO (with whom I have a serious relationship!)</li>
            <li> But this toothbrush ranks right up there with my TIVO (with whom I have a serious relationship!)</li>
            <li> This uses a new technology that I read about last year after CES which send electricity to the device just from being within less than an inch of the base top.  </li>
            <li> Things went smoothly for another year, until two weeks ago, when the lights started flashing crazily and the brush would only work sporadically.</li>
            <li> and I didnt dry it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> So I will try to wipe it dry after every use, put it in my studyroom now.</li>
            <li> this, in a few mnts of handling (a result you cannot achieve in the same amount of time with a standard brush).</li>
            <li> The initial investment might be a bit expensive but your oral care/health is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> (apparently it will work only with the green button!)</li>
            <li> I had a big problem with tartar and even a few weeks after I left the dentist</li>
            <li> However after using it for a few weeks I am totally convinced and can&#x27;t imagine going back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I was also actively trying to buy a UV sanitizer for my toothbrush after hearing that toothbrush heads collect particles from human feces (which makes sense).  </li>
            <li> problem is that for the money I spent, and the minimal daily use it got (two brushings per day by a single user.)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep oral hygiene tip-top on a regular basis, or someone who is experiencing oral problems (such as recurrent bad breath, or food stuck between teeth).</li>
            <li> After two days away, my brush head started getting loose on the hand unit and I had to be very careful not to exert any extra motion or movement.  </li>
            <li> H O W E V E R, Philips initially refused to provide a third replacement because I did not have proof of returning the previous two defective units!  </li>
            <li> Bristles are a bit tough and will hurt when you first use it</li>
            <li> it is NOT loud (for me) as some other reviewers complained and it is pretty compact compared to other sonicare models.</li>
            <li> When I used a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush, my gums bled EVERY SINGLE TIME.</li>
            <li> This change means that the brush will now run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> means that the brush will now run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> Seems their return policy is limited.</li>
            <li> After shopping around, I opted for the plain FlexCare model, because it has all the same functions as the Plus--they&#x27;re just labelled differently.</li>
            <li> Our bathroom counter space is limited, so I have the charger/cleaner on a shelf unit separate from our vanity.</li>
            <li> My experience is that the brushes do have a limited life, (just over two years and just after the limited warranty expires), before they die.</li>
            <li> His periodontist recommended it and sold him the single brush w/</li>
            <li> and I havnt had a single cavity or issue with my teeth or the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to use a conventional toothbrush like some sort of savage until I figure out what electric toothbrush I should buy next.</li>
            <li> Lower rating is because it failed about two years after I bought it, right outside of the warranty period.</li>
            <li> It feels a little loud to me, but I&#x27;m not used to an electric toothbrush, and my girlfriend insists it isn&#x27;t that bad, which makes me feel it must sound louder in my head!</li>
            <li> It feels a little loud to me, but I&#x27;m not used to an electric toothbrush, and my girlfriend insists it isn&#x27;t that bad, which makes me feel it must sound louder in my head!</li>
            <li> that you can&#x27;t tell me that is or is not normal whether they break&lt;br /&gt;Harry</li>
            <li> that you can&#x27;t tell me that is or is not normal whether they break&lt;br /&gt;Harry</li>
            <li> In the past I used one of those old Sonicare models, and eventually it broke, but this x mas I was given this model</li>
            <li> The problems of the past have been fixed.  </li>
            <li> My old rotary brush died, this one tickles and causes excessive salivation</li>
            <li> Not worth the price with only a 1-2 year lifespan.</li>
            <li> I usually dont update items till the old one becomes unusable.  </li>
            <li> There will be a period of adjustment for the average person who is used to putting extra effort into cleaning his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> First, the on/off switch is in a poor location.  </li>
            <li> I bought that brush from costco, and it failed within 9 months or so, and I returned it to costco and got full credit for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting a jet engine in your mouth (although it&#x27;s not painful or uncomfortable, as all these brushes sometimes can be for first-time users), and you can feel the difference on your teeth when you&#x27;re done.    </li>
            <li> Speed changing button is in the wrong location such that when holding the handle while brushing one is frequently hitting the button thus changing the speed far too often.   </li>
            <li> I understand that this type of failure can be an issue with the FlexCare -- particularly if the user switches from one mode to another while the brush is running, e.g, from \\&quot;clean\\&quot; to \\&quot;massage\\&quot;.      </li>
            <li> The little Phillips logo on the travel case arrived broken, and when I contacted Sonicare, they said they would ship me a new one out for free without me having to send my broken one back.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for 10 months, head got loose and noisy,</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses the toothbrush head came loose while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Caused the toothbrush head to come loose and at times to pop off.  </li>
            <li> , so I figured I had nothing to loose.  </li>
            <li> There is a screw in the brush head that works its way loose over time.  </li>
            <li> After using it for probably 9-10 months, the metal prong that fits into brush head became loose and noisy.  </li>
            <li> that was \\&quot;out of the norm\\&quot; which I use loosely</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to the feeling but the brush breaks you in slowly - its that smart!</li>
            <li> Since the last Sonicare broke down within one year of purchase, I called their customer support and they are sending me a replacement handle.</li>
            <li> My only complaints would be that stuff can dribble down under the brush head while using it, necessitating its removal and cleaning after every use.</li>
            <li> It had a case that the toothbrush could be put in and add it to your other toilet articles.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used a Sonicare a few times I cannot imagine going back to a regular toothbrush, nor any other electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers have mentioned that the programming  of the brush modes can be annoying, but honestly it is just pushing one button next to the name of the program you wish to use at that time.</li>
            <li> They hold the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; too tightly &amp; make what should be a easy job, difficult.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Oral-B toothbrush my wife is using, this product sucks and I ordered a new Oral-B toothbrush from Amazon.</li>
            <li> (For this price, I would expect at least four brush tips, since they recommend a new tip every three months.)  </li>
            <li> These still work like new and will hold a charge for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> The motors go bad, become a noisy racket, and thus, do not vibrate well enough to clean properly.</li>
            <li> This brush gets my teeth \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; while being gentler on my gums, with much less sensitivity overall as an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> I had previously owned the larger models (now called Essence), and each lasted around 5 years.  </li>
            <li> and I believe it will turn black like what happened to my earlier series.    </li>
            <li> If you want more info on planned obsolescence take a look at this short clip: [...]    </li>
            <li> So what can you do to discourage planned obsolescence and not be subject to these low quality and overpriced products?</li>
            <li> The sanitizer is an extra feature my previous one did not have.   </li>
            <li> The replacement only lasted less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> The only improvement over the previous model is that the brush head isn&#x27;t as bulky &amp; easier to use.</li>
            <li> Less than a year after purchasing this toothbrush, it suddenly stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The different cycles help people who are sensitve (less of a frequency).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily for less than a year.  </li>
            <li> The sanitizer bulb burnt out in less than 3 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to this toothbrush from the original Philips Sonicare because the design of the original was flawed in that the plastic backing of the head allowed bacterial and paste accumulation and made cleaning in the crevice virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> Unless of course, you are grading reliability on lasting less than two years.</li>
            <li> I had marker on my hands which I did not notice, now the rubber grip is slightly stained with red marker, and will not come out without a fight.</li>
            <li> All that is necessary is that you replace the head every 6 months or less if needed.</li>
            <li> Previously, I avoided taking up space traveling with an electric toothbrush and took only a manual brush.</li>
            <li> That is unacceptable when considering the cost of the units (~180 per unit), and when considering the lifespan of my previous and my wife&#x27;s current \\&quot;e-</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t dish out another $130 for a toothbrush that only lasted a short bit past the warranty period.  </li>
            <li> I want the gum stimulation, which is adequate by virtue of the sonic vibration--you don&#x27;t need that silly \\&quot;massage\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> The reason I deducted 3 stars is because with this particular model, I had 3 units fail prematurely in less than 2 years where the metal post retaining the brush head had come off the main body.  </li>
            <li> Am I expected to pile up receipts from every single purchase that I make?</li>
            <li> It makes a big mess</li>
            <li> And package tube had new label for me to return broken unit back to them.  </li>
            <li> The center shaft got loose.</li>
            <li> You can probably get a less expensive version of this without the UV light.</li>
            <li> Smaller head makes cleaning in tight spot easier.</li>
            <li> The initial new product I received failed after only one day.  </li>
            <li> As to the brush sanitizer:  I figure if that nasty sludge that used to build up in the handle of my old Sonicare didn&#x27;t kill me, surely I don&#x27;t need an infrared cleaner for the brush head!  </li>
            <li> I gave four stars instead of five, because for some reason, no matter how thoroughly I brush back there, I can always feel just a little bit of leftover plaque that I end up removing when I floss.</li>
            <li> I always felt a little gross letting my brush sit out on the counter, even with the cover that comes with sonicare heads, and then putting it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> and now I only feel a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> - I feel like it needs to go for just a little longer - but not a big deal, I just hit the button again and brush until I feel I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I actually (embarrassed to admit this) got a little giddy this week when I remembered, \\&quot;I get to brush my teeth.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I tried a little different version of this toothbrush, the Elite 7300, and it just didn&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m in a rush to head out the door and don&#x27;t realize how little I did actually brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Also, at least several months ago, some of the rubber on the product grip (on the back of the handle) started to peel loose.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to open your mouth while brushing, that takes a little while to get used to.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t collect any hard water stains and goo, like my old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I registered the brush with manufacturer and so far there were no problems, except when I press brush too hard to the gums, and it slips, then I relax the pressure</li>
            <li> Only suggestion to improve is that the manufacturer should include two each of the regular and \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; brushes as opposed to the one each that comes with the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I paid a similar price for my Advance, and got a second brush with hard travel case.</li>
            <li> You control how hard you push down on your teeth, though - and you don&#x27;t need to push hard at all to get the full effect of the brush.    </li>
            <li> We also like that the new brush head design uses much less plastic and metal, so there&#x27;s less waste.</li>
            <li> My hope is that with continued usage by the time my dental appointment arrives, I will not need root scaling/planing and that my plague build-up will be minimal.     </li>
            <li> Oral B brush heads were rough and painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and notice not only are my teeth cleaner, but they are truly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and notice not only are my teeth cleaner, but they are truly whiter.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried holding the brush differently, but it&#x27;s not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The button should be disabled while the brush is in operation, if not moved to a different location on the handle.      </li>
            <li> I also like that the beep for the QuadPacer is louder, so that I don&#x27;t have to listen as carefully to tell when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> and I spent around $100.00 for it.  </li>
            <li> so I carefully reviewed all the brands, reader comments, consumer research reviews, etc.  </li>
            <li> It has happened to me a few times but you can learn to avoid it and if you hit it by mistake, just hit it again to restart, the timer continues from where you left off.</li>
            <li> After a  few questions, the gal just told me to package it up with all the components and ship it back to them.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you grip the toothbrush in a closed fist that could happen.  </li>
            <li> You must keep your lips closed as your mouth fills with saliva.  </li>
            <li> until you get used to it), doesn&#x27;t come with a pink color code ring</li>
            <li> (I know it&#x27;s not really a \\&quot;bad\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Big thumbs up for this toothbrush.inds of lights to show the setting (chosen with an oblong button below the on/off button) and a green charging indicator--three full-on lights indicating that the brush is fully charged.     </li>
            <li> The on/off button is much harder to press, so you probably won&#x27;t shut off your toothbrush by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So with the waiting for the replacement 9551 + delay to service center, my 2yrs warranty period is up.     </li>
            <li> Manual mentione abt green and yellow battery indicator..</li>
            <li> If thats the case, its not really a &#x27;traveller&#x27; charger.</li>
            <li> That is to be expected I suppose, given the \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; aspect of the product&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for something that craps out and stops charging all the sudden.</li>
            <li> Although, based on the few times I did use it, I could see where its utilization on a daily basis would be cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the charging station with the UV Sanitizer and I now only use the \\&quot;travel charger\\&quot; for everyday use at home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the charging station with the UV Sanitizer and I now only use the \\&quot;travel charger\\&quot; for everyday use at home.  </li>
            <li> So there is no real need to worry about UV resistant bacteria.</li>
            <li> I purchase one for my husband and few months later I purchased one for myself.  </li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> but Philips really stands behind their products.  </li>
            <li> I expected that since I was at the end of the 2 year warranty that I would be denied.  </li>
            <li> I SPENT NINE MONTHS WITHOUT ONE, SO I UPGRADED.</li>
            <li> I had to call their fulfillment center twice</li>
            <li> Unknown Soldier</li>
            <li> toothpaste spit goes flying everywhere unless i keep my mouth closed and even then, i drool.  </li>
            <li> I paid around $150, which included the UV Sanitizer, a few extra brush heads, and the travel charger.  </li>
            <li> The handle unit seems well made and carefully sealed against moisture.</li>
            <li> just heavy enough to keep it stable when it&#x27;s running, but not too heavy to maneuver and hold for several minutes.</li>
            <li> It does the job that I expected and</li>
            <li> , Philips have released a high-end (ie horribly expensive) product that has a host of useful features but none that can be dismissed as gimmicks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The experience can be a bit messy, though I&#x27;m finally getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> The experience can be a bit messy, though I&#x27;m finally getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Works fully as expected.  </li>
            <li> So in 5 years, I have spent $200 on Philips care products, but without the customer support, I will no longer purchase their products.</li>
            <li> We have used the UV sanitizer, but, of course, there&#x27;s really no way to tell how well that works.</li>
            <li> Not only will any dental work as a result of poor dental health be much more expensive than this toothbrush, but there&#x27;s always the chance that whatever damage is done cannot be reversed.  </li>
            <li> but I have zero regrets.</li>
            <li> I always feel like my teeth are cleaner if I brush harder</li>
            <li> Mine started vibrating uncontrollably in the last few days.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to (if you&#x27;re coming from a standard brush), but a few days into it, you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever used another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There are a few different brushing programs now.  </li>
            <li> All that it  was advertised to be and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> I tried using superglue to keep it attached, but it was hopeless - by six months it had broken off completely and couldn&#x27;t be glued back.</li>
            <li> The base has many different options to use for cleaning and maintaining your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I guess I just expected it to have her talking properly after a few sessions.</li>
            <li> It had a shorter stem where the Sonicare&#x27;s attachment head is long and slender, and I had a tendency to drool messily down the thing--while the Sonicare doesn&#x27;t cause me that problem at all.  </li>
            <li> well spent.is long and slender, and I had a tendency to drool messily down the thing--while the Sonicare doesn&#x27;t cause me that problem at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used other electric toothbrushes in the past, but always ended up switching back to a conventional toothbrush because I felt like they never cleaned my teeth well enough.  </li>
            <li> However my last 2 brushes died in less than 3 years, but after the 2 year warranty!  </li>
            <li> So, I will receive another FlexCare -- my 3rd in less than 2 years!  </li>
            <li> Although I liked the brushing action of the old design, I hated the design of the brush head itself because the screw-in head became all gunked up and nasty if you didn&#x27;t take it off the motor and clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> I agree with a comment from at least one other reviewer about not needing all the options for different settings and timers with the brush, especially if they are adding to the price.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after about 1 1/2 years the brush heads just start vibrating right off.</li>
            <li> This is the second Philips product I have had fail (the first one was a digital photo frame) and the second time that Philips has stood behind their product and sent out a replacement without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is due to the unavailability of firm brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dentist clean on a daily basis, and I had to use a regular toothbrush as I forgot to pack mine for an outing and was appalled at how \\&quot;unclean\\</li>
            <li> I ended up getting the premium model (as a gift) for a replacement &amp; I must say it is a significant disappointment.</li>
            <li> Compared to other powered toothbrushes out there, the Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush is not very noisy.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B never had one, so I only knew if it was running low when it would slow down.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is small enough to keep your mouth closed and still maneuver around.    </li>
            <li> I normally just brushed randomly, with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but the Sonic toothbrush is a different experience!  </li>
            <li> One for the larger base unit, and a minimal charger cord that is easy to pack for traveling with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They ship a replacement toothbrush to you within a few days rather than requiring you to first ship in your broken toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> The few things that annoyed me with my first one was 1.)</li>
            <li> I turned it upside down and left it alone for a few days.</li>
            <li> However, the main reason I chose this model is because it has a thin handle compared to other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a number of buttons on both the base charger/sanitizer and the cordless toothbrush, but they are simple to learn and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy again though due to the price.</li>
            <li> It is just has loud/quite as any other sonicare</li>
            <li> I have not had these problems with other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> First it started turning itself on randomly.  </li>
            <li> My gums are now extremely healthy, and I don&#x27;t expect any cavities in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed in the nonreplaceable battery.</li>
            <li> I think you could save some money and get one of the other soniccare brushes.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist; saved $30 over other online sources.  </li>
            <li> my other one was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews on here that claim this brush is louder than other Sonicare models but coming from the Elite</li>
            <li> This version is an excellen product with usual home charger, but also comes with smaller charger for travel including a travel container for the brush and portable charger.</li>
            <li> Given some of the other review I was somewhat concerned about the noise, but it is not an issue.  </li>
            <li> At my last dental checkup, the hygienist said the buildup was excessive and that I should now start having cleanings three times a year rather than twice.  </li>
            <li> After 10 months or so the rubber backing started to peel off from the top back of the toothbrush - we trimmed it several times but it looked awful.</li>
            <li> The rep at Philips said they cannot replace the toothbrush due to wear and declined to offer me any solutions.</li>
            <li> The first one also failed within a year.  </li>
            <li> One other thing:</li>
            <li> Either this model or another model extremely close to it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in it, especially since my boyfriend&#x27;s did the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> now I will take the other peoples advice on here and try a Oral B and a cheaper model for</li>
            <li> I have never used any other spin brush as comparison.</li>
            <li> I picked up the Sonicare FlexCare the other day and all 3 of these issues are taken care of.  </li>
            <li> Oh NO:((((  But, I am glad that I went to the dentist</li>
            <li> If tend to do other things when you brush your teeth, you might not notice the toothbrush turning off and will be depriving yourself of the recommended 2 minutes of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit has two size brushes, and as I have a small palate, the smaller size brush fits my mouth well.</li>
            <li> : The first failed unit was replaced under warranty with no problems.    </li>
            <li> Purchased the Sonicare due to the recommendation of my Dentist.  </li>
            <li> At first, i thouht it was too expensive and was not going to buy it.  </li>
            <li> And no more plaque build up on the back of my lower teeth!  </li>
            <li> I was due for a cleaning at the dentist about 2-3 weeks after getting the brush.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not looking through seven hundred other reviews to find out.  </li>
            <li> Speaking of the brush heads, both the standard and small size worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> Other companies should take note.</li>
            <li> On the other, it just seems to have shorted.  </li>
            <li> Looking into other options.</li>
            <li> I have anxiety about whether my dental hygiene is being compromised due to the unit&#x27;s degradation in performance.</li>
            <li> Seems pretty useless to me.  </li>
            <li> One was bought from Sam Club and the other was from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> There are other options.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the price I thought that I would be writing a review telling people that it is way too expensive....</li>
            <li> Basically he just said that since it&#x27;s not under warranty there&#x27;s nothing they can do and ended the chat abruptly.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of auto tooth brushes and did not care for them.</li>
            <li> You can change the cycle with the handle controls, and the other defaults can be reset while the unit is in the charging stand.</li>
            <li> Between this toothbrush and flossing every other day</li>
            <li> With this setup you can have His and Hers, one for mom and dad and one for the kids, one for home the other for work, or even one for home and one for vacationing.  </li>
            <li> The other reason I chose this model is the UV sanitizer; have you ever looked at plaque under a microscope?  </li>
            <li> other features does it have?  </li>
            <li> first experience was a bit startling.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use whitening toothpastes or any other whitening products, but we do both use our Sonicare 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> One word of warning for those who haven&#x27;t used a Sonicare before: be careful not to slip up and press the power button before you get the toothbrush head into your mouth or you&#x27;ll end up with toothpaste everywhere!</li>
            <li> I would not be as disappointed as I was the second time, except my first Sonicare brush, which was the White,</li>
            <li> The other thing I like are the selectable modes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used an electric toothbrush in the past, but this one was recommended by my dentist&#x27;s hygienist, and I decided it would help me reach the hard-to-reach back teeth.  </li>
            <li> This seems to happen about every other time I brush.  </li>
            <li> I had two of these, one lasted longer than the other.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;ve used like 3 other power brushes.</li>
            <li> Even though I thought this toothbrush was rather spendy, I ordered it anyway after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> However, it seems that the unit lasts between 1-2 years, which I think is due to wear-and-tear and/or water damage over time.  </li>
            <li> The UV sanitizing chamber is bit gimmicky but at least the science behind it is sound.</li>
            <li> but the battery needs to be charged every other week</li>
            <li> but I have owned other rechargeable brushes and battery-powered brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had the other brush for a month</li>
            <li> I gave a 4 star rating due to the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other electronic toothbrushes,  but compared to manual brushing</li>
            <li> I would recommed this product over any other electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not coming out and it will transfer to other things, like your clothes in a suitcase, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not much better than what we are supposed to do with regular toothbrushes - replace every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> One has the sanitizer attached to it, and the other one it for travel and does not come with a sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I have noted other reviewers comment on this as well.  </li>
            <li> He said that an ordinary toothbrush could not possibly perform as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> I like how the toothbrush head and handle is small, actually smaller</li>
            <li> This device is WAY to expensive to have these kinds of issues in the first year...</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other night, the toothbrush started buzzing all by itself.  </li>
            <li> For the past 4 years it&#x27;s had double the work.  </li>
            <li> I guess the toothbrush had other ideas, though, because now it won&#x27;t even turn on when I press the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hopefully my next one will make it past its toddler years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all due to this toothbrush, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dislike with the previous Sonicare models was the large screw-on brush head that would build up an ugly gunk on the inside of it, but no more, the brush head is completely new and similar to the Oral-B type.</li>
            <li> I note that initially the FlexCare was a little noisey, but, this noise went away after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds a little over a one week charge (single user).</li>
            <li> -Dont have place for us to dry or seperate the brush from the handle!!!</li>
            <li> It is an entire assembly, including a new UV/charger base, travel charger, travel case, and 2 new brush heads.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just really bad luck, because were it not for this reliability issue, the product would easily earn a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> It has been working great since that time,but this week one day, it kept turning off after a few seconds of use, and when I placed it on the charger, it would make the awful noise, beep, beep, beeeep, beep, beep, beeeep.</li>
            <li> Approximately 8 months later, same thing.</li>
            <li> but seriously, you only get one set of teeth, and Phillips really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> When my old electric toothbrush died, I went back and forth on whether or not I should spend the money on this expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When the first one broke down, it just started making a strident noise and then failed.  </li>
            <li> My main concerns with the previous toothbrush was it worse than average Ni-Cd battery, it&#x27;s non-universal charger, and the rigidity of its 2-minute timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, and the smaller of the two brush heads that came with the machine seems too small to be of much use (and the replacements are expensive), but I would recommend this product to anyone who can afford to pay $170 for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not only is the black mold really gross, it&#x27;s actually in the part of the brush that goes in your mouth &amp; is impossible to entirely remove.</li>
            <li> :I find it odd that 3 out of 3 toothbrushes failed within the first 2 years.</li>
            <li> No more in toilet.</li>
            <li> Conventional toothbrushes can&#x27;t come close to the job this thing does.  </li>
            <li> It looks a little rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for a very long time but always hated how the older model was hard to clean the handle.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews have covered the features of this extremely well thought out and designed toothbrush</li>
            <li> The vibrations were a little weird at first</li>
            <li> On my second trip to the dentist, the dentist said that she hardly saw any plaque on my teeth or gums, which means that the toothbrush is doing its job.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this thing is a little scary at first because it buzzes like an orbital sander.</li>
            <li> I wanted to hard to give a 5 star review, but the brush is simply not working.</li>
            <li> , I replaced my last 2 brushes due to upgrades, not product failure.)</li>
            <li> Too bad they can&#x27;t last forever, but I understand...got this for a replacement of my first one that lasted about 12 years...true and faithful to the end...</li>
            <li> Needless to say it works really well and does it&#x27;s job as advertised.</li>
            <li> BUT because Phillips Sonicare REALLY stands behind its products!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a dark and stormy night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which on average costs $2-3.</li>
            <li> Also if they were going to charge me $10 per replacement head I would expect to last at least 6 months-1 year</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the brush is the placement of the mode select button.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the button that changes the \\&quot;speed\\&quot; is located where you hold the handle when brushing.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long this can go on.</li>
            <li> The second complaint is that the programs (which I haven&#x27;t figured out yet)</li>
            <li> The second complaint is that the programs (which I haven&#x27;t figured out yet)</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it&#x27;s a marketing gimmick  for paranoid germ fearing suckers.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I have used in the past few years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;ѾѾѾ Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies feature ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But not fun.</li>
            <li> I have searched The Internet and this is not a rare occurrence.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly learning to keep my thumb away from it; it&#x27;s not enough of an issue to downgrade my rating.</li>
            <li> Like the travel charger base as I travel alot and often for more than two weeks at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used the UV sanitizer in a while, so the sanitizer door was closed for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start by saying I hate brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice to have a small base that would hold the brush upright, rather than tossing it in a drawer or letting it lay on the counter.</li>
            <li> I am learning to keep the wand from touching my teeth since that is annoying.  </li>
            <li> did not find the brush action irritating at all when using it and noise was not an issue.</li>
            <li> Sonicare comes with its own small charging base.  </li>
            <li> The coupon will be applicable to our US consumer only.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Should I provide the information about discount coupon?&lt;br /&gt;Shalom: So I basically wasted $150 on a toothbrush that was replaced twice and never really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this Sonicare has a brush head that clicks onto a metal fitting that sticks up out of the base.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, they believe I had a bad drive unit and are replacing the brush with a brand new brush.</li>
            <li> I hate when corporations like Philips exploit customers with intentionally designed inferior products that breakdown fast so that you will run and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> just so so, the head is small and stiff, don&#x27;t feel that its an improvement over a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> One plus is the skinny top part that does make for less goop collecting by the base of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mirror is continually getting splattered with toothpaste and the toothpaste continually dribbles down the brush and handle when in use.</li>
            <li> So, I broke down and decided to spend the money.</li>
            <li> I have never had a Sonicare toothbrush that didn&#x27;t break down.  </li>
            <li> Also, let the battery run all the way down, then recharge it.  </li>
            <li> It is now down to a week).  </li>
            <li> I keep the manuel handly until I have it locked down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never happened to me, as I grip it lightly down the side grip pads.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare products are going down hill.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had two and neither one lasted 2 years before breaking down.</li>
            <li> Verify Easy-Start feature by holding down power button for 7 seconds while handle is on the charger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s running down my chin too.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since adjusted my rating down a star because of this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since adjusted my rating down a star because of this.  </li>
            <li> The handle has been slimmed down and there is no place to saliva to collect inside the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Let it go down to 10-15% charge before recharging in order to prolong battery life.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> The down sides of this product is the noise,</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of problems with my teeth, and this has slowed it down.</li>
            <li> Also, after each use, wipe it down</li>
            <li> The problem is that it eventually vibrates itself out of the mount down int the brush and once that happens you have to throw the brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;re programed to break down after a couple years.</li>
            <li> So I wipe it down with some vinegar, and that does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more slimey gross mess!  </li>
            <li> I almost returned it right then and there because of how numb my mouth became.  </li>
            <li> I had the same failure both times.</li>
            <li> initially thought the little breaks were because I was pressing too hard and it was automatically stopping for that reason, but no.. perhaps I should have read my manual instead of just assuming.</li>
            <li> A few years ago - in my quest to find an electric toothbrush per my dentist&#x27;s instructions led me to stand in front of the products meticulously comparing one vs. another, did it do this that and the other, price point, etc.</li>
            <li> I am now about to experience the exact same thing -- the head is vibrating wildly and making horrible noise.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said this is a noisy gadget but for a few minutes every day it is tolerable.  </li>
            <li> (I ended up purchasing the FlexCare without UV, which other than having a lime green handle and no UV, is functionally identical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is probably due, in part, to the fact that I brushed too hard, trying to get rid of the freakin&#x27; plaque!</li>
            <li> My routine visits to the dentist have been less than desirable.</li>
            <li> I usually start off with the regular \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; function taking care to brush each \\&quot;quad\\&quot; section in my mouth (I usually do this twice), followed by the \\&quot;Message\\&quot; section to go over my gums.  </li>
            <li> This Philips Sonicare FlexCare is an update to my previous sonicare.    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had an issue in the previous 28 years</li>
            <li> When it comes to noise, yes it is noisier than the previous model.  </li>
            <li> Now, with the price cut in half, I could afford 2 of these for</li>
            <li> Not charging, made odd noise.  </li>
            <li> I have owned the RS930 for less than 4yrs.  </li>
            <li> Under warranty the handle was replaced in less than 2yrs since the tip broke from inside.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparing my previous Oral-B to the Sonicare...</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this toothbrush for a year and a half</li>
            <li> I previously had a Sonicare Elite I had purchased at Costco about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Of couse, I was a user of the previous version</li>
            <li> I am going to guess the ROI (lower dental bills) is less than a year.</li>
            <li> So say goodbye to the gunky,icky build up in the brush head and handle on the previous models</li>
            <li> I recommend this particular brush, even in a less expensive presentation.  </li>
            <li> I used to do a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; go care counting on my mind with the previous brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge has lasted at least 10 days per, so far, or at least 20 cycles.  </li>
            <li> I have had my previous Sonicare for about 7 years.</li>
            <li> Nor can I recommend Sonicare for such an expensive price if it breaks like a Chinese made toy!</li>
            <li> It lasted less than one year.  </li>
            <li> The previous brush had lasted 5 years before quitting.</li>
            <li> It takes less than 5 min to pull the Sonicare Flex gut out and re-install the screw.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this system might save me from having to have serious dental work later on.  </li>
            <li> However, after about 5 months, the toothbrush just stopped working - all it would do is emit slight buzz, like the motor is running</li>
            <li> &quot; I used previously.</li>
            <li> However, after less than 9 months, the sanitizer won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I have also owned the previous model to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also owned the previous model to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * less time as in it died within 6 months.  </li>
            <li> A lot less</li>
            <li> The previous model ended up breaking as the buttons got corroded, and stopped working, but given how well the toothbrush worked at cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this model for almost a year and a half now</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not just the odd sensation that my toothbaste has almost taken on the texture of whipped cream...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not just the odd sensation that my toothbaste has almost taken on the texture of whipped cream...</li>
            <li> This brush takes up less space on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Only time I had to replace them was when the sealed Ni-Cad battery died and failed to keep a charge, usually lasting about 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would consider a newer model without the UV chamber for less money or DiamondClean model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently, I&#x27;ve been using DiamondClean model for about a year and half now without any issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working just as well a year and a half after purchase.</li>
            <li> odd thing though</li>
            <li> Previous models lasted minimum 4 to 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Its too expensive for the short amount of time they last.</li>
            <li> I read the previous customers review of this product, and it does not do this product justice.</li>
            <li> The handle is slightly shorter, thinner and lighter.  </li>
            <li> Now, the second one failed in the same manner.    </li>
            <li> You really need to use a towel to dry off the toothbrush before placing it back on the base.</li>
            <li> I purchased it a few weeks ago to replace an approximately 2-year old Sonicare elite that my cleaning lady threw in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical a bit with the high price tag of Sonicare sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Think long and hard about purchasing this toothbrush AND keep your receipt AND register it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very expensive product to have such a shots live.</li>
            <li> * New design prevents saliva and water to form behind the base that     required weekly clean up     </li>
            <li> Made my gum bleed a couple of times (bad bleeds, enough to make a cup of water red), I tried different settings.  </li>
            <li> While it may sound like a lot of money to pay for a toothbrush, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> After a little less than a year of use it shorted out and I could hear a hum when I turned it on</li>
            <li> I have been using the FlexCare for a little less than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> no area for gunk to build up.&lt;br /&gt;+The UV base provides a clean, closed compartment to store your brushes, in addition to cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> they said they base the warranty off the purchase date not the new brush date so this will only work as long as the warranty you get.</li>
            <li> You have to buy the expensive sonicare replacement heads and these heads are designed to not last too long.  </li>
            <li> the attached sanitizer does not clean like i would have imagined.</li>
            <li> My gums no longer bleed, teeth feel polished everyday, and notice a slight whitening effect.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal as Sonicare has improved the condition of my teeth as I now have less problems at the dentist.</li>
            <li> If you want to disable Easy Start for whatever reason, put the toothbrush on the charger base and hold the power button for 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> For first time users, it will probably tickle your mouth like crazy for a few days.    </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m more than lazy, I just hate flossing and almost never do it.  </li>
            <li> When they failed they got very loud and then quit altogether.</li>
            <li> This little handle packs a punch.</li>
            <li> I thought this was so that Mom, Dad, SuzieQ and Little Johnny could all use it?  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy it because of the cost but the sanitizer won me over.  </li>
            <li> Then I replaced that with a Sonicare Flexcare which lasted a little over 2 years before it stopped vibrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a little over a month</li>
            <li> Have owned for a little over a month    </li>
            <li> All the other Sonicare toothbrushes that I had in the past used NiCd rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about purchasing this toothbrush because of the price</li>
            <li> I noticed little chalk collection underneath the colored ring</li>
            <li> We are going to try Oral B, it is a little cheaper and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the issues.</li>
            <li> It does tkae a little getting used to with all the vibrations</li>
            <li> Well from my knowledge of how UV works (with a little help from wikipedia)</li>
            <li> But the price is a little steep.</li>
            <li> I have had my Philips Sonicare FlexCare for a little over a year, no problems until this week.</li>
            <li> purchased from amazon a little over 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have this problem with this little guy.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of getting used to after using a manual brush all my life.</li>
            <li> It tickles my lips a little and vibrates a lot.</li>
            <li> It stops in the middle and makes weak buzz.</li>
            <li> I did have a little of gum bleeding for about 3 days.</li>
            <li> That was a little over 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> After doing a little research I picked one up...      </li>
            <li> If there is one thing I wish could change a little is the price of the brush heads themselves,</li>
            <li> To understand why I didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll have to know a little about my mouth:  </li>
            <li> When I needed to replace mine, on the recommendation of my dental hygienist, and a little rebate offer, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> If the stems were just a little longer, allowing the heads to sit up off the surface, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say it takes a little getting use to with the Sonicare flex.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> A little.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant with the price</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit of splatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit of splatter.      </li>
            <li> My dentist said she never thought I would still have all my teeth due to past problems.</li>
            <li> &quot; setting with little breaks in which it&#x27;s suggesting you move to another quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> little toothpaste as it will foam quite a bit in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I kept getting cavities with traditional tooth brushes when I was brushing at least 5 times a day!</li>
            <li> head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive for a product that doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> But the fact remains that my junk replacement unit failed and the guy I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about and could describe the failure.</li>
            <li> The double set is very hard to find.    </li>
            <li> The newer models have the Li-ion which is supposed to mean that the brush will run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.</li>
            <li> The newer models have the Li-ion which is supposed to mean that the brush will run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy.  </li>
            <li> The plastic nodes area are fully melted and there is no way u can open this up without cutting it open etc.</li>
            <li> So, I have been using electric toothbrushes for a few years.</li>
            <li> That was a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Oral B is almost dead - it&#x27;s been 2 years, the battery will hold for a couple of days, but not over a week like it used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a few months - went for my cleaning and my dental hygienist noticed my teeth/gums were improving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months - went for my cleaning and</li>
            <li> It took me a few times to realize that the toothbrush was changing speeds because I had accidentally hit the button.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few month ago and use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is a fix for broken units where the steel brush post wobbles around only!</li>
            <li> The UV cleaner is gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> The product gets dinged one star for a design flaw -- the mode setting button is poorly positioned so that my finger inadvertently changes the mode while I am in the middle of brushing.  </li>
            <li> one star for what I feel is sham marketing by Philips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap spinning brush head, it&#x27;s just vibration.  </li>
            <li> Got here in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Worse still is that you have to switch it through four options to get it back to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After owning the FlexCare for about a year, the vibration and noise got increasingly worse, and then the metal post encased in a rubber sleeve finally broke, rendering the brush head inoperable.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t returned anything before on Amazon, and was dreading the process, putting it off for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often unplugged it and forgot to replug it in for a few days</li>
            <li> After about 30 seconds or so the head will vibrate on and off a few times, this is a signal to move on to another section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Quite a few people on here commented about how their thumb ends up turning \\&quot;off\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for approximately a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm 5 stars on this one.</li>
            <li> A coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I got the same story from two separate \\&quot;customer service representatives\\&quot; on two separate occasions: the toothbrush is broken</li>
            <li> Also, the sanitizer stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have it for few days</li>
            <li> -Round pins.</li>
            <li> I saw the traveller charger and it seem to be round pins too.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m using the Sonicare, I realize I&#x27;ve been missing out.</li>
            <li> a few minutes before that call.</li>
            <li> I understanding how frustrating it can be and would feel the same way</li>
            <li> I understanding how frustrating it can be and would feel the same way</li>
            <li> We hate going back to regular brushes, even for short times like camping trips.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve put the brush heads in it a few times and it seems to cause no harm</li>
            <li> This is the green button that you see on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> just worried that in a few weeks, months it also will have some glitzes.</li>
            <li> I did some research since I was confused with all the different models</li>
            <li> Today it just died, completely dead.  </li>
            <li> Today it just died, completely dead.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush head would not fit flush on the handle.  </li>
            <li> the brush was a bit heavy and cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I tend to brush longer than the longest cycle, so as soon as the timer automatically turns off the brush, I \\&quot;automatically\\&quot; press the power button and continue brushing without missing a beat.     </li>
            <li> Bottom line, save yourself the trouble and $ and buy the e-series instead.</li>
            <li> They also sent me a prepaid FedEx return label for the dead unit.  </li>
            <li> and tomorrow I will drop the dead set at FedEx.  </li>
            <li> Yes, Sonicare is not cheap...</li>
            <li> The recharge did not work after a few months and it took a lot of hassel to get it replaced (needed to go through Philips instead of Amazon).   </li>
            <li> After a few months it turns on and off by itself like a possessed toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This product is far too expensive to have to go through this.</li>
            <li> My sister bought one about the same time and it is broken as well.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve got now is a piece of toxic waste that can&#x27;t be recycled.      </li>
            <li> The replacement bulbs are also not cheap - $17.95 including shipping.    </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a few weeks ago and it has done wonders for my mouth care routine.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SANITIZER.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times -no problem.</li>
            <li> It took me a few brushes to get used to shifting directions without inadvertently rattling my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I still use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Without the green covering, I resorted to using a metal rod to poke at the button to get it to start.</li>
            <li> It is dead and I will be contacting Philips again.     </li>
            <li> , I brush twice a day, and I floss every few days.  </li>
            <li> I have a cleaning in a few weeks, I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this after the cleaning to tell you what my dentist has to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have problems with plaque and my dentist gets so annoyed with me - thinking that I do not brush properly.</li>
            <li> My old Philips Sonicare toothbrush lasted four years before the battery failed.  </li>
            <li> A few questions about Model, S/N, date of purchase and BOOM they send me a replacement in a week or two.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s completely dead.</li>
            <li> A few quibbles:  </li>
            <li> I expect that the brush will outlast the battery, so throwing it away is a waste.    </li>
            <li> Everyone always becomes accustom to the vibrations, and after a few brush cycles you won&#x27;t even notice it anymore.     </li>
            <li> Or rather I killed it..</li>
            <li> I think my biggest issue with Sonicare toothbrushes is that each one dies in about two years - just a few months after the warranty expires.</li>
            <li> Now I have abandoned the Flexcare and just use the manual brush to save the trouble.</li>
            <li> Within a week, it was completely dead.    </li>
            <li> Look forward to this everyday.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve had a few of these over the years.  </li>
            <li> One beep means you just disabled it</li>
            <li> I had been concerned by a few reviews that said it was noisy -- it was quieter than the Spin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Sonicare suggested to me by my dentist for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the bottom line, she&#x27;s not happy with the bristles being only 1/3 to 1/4\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to hold it closer to the base, but it isn&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have to replace the brush heads every few months though.</li>
            <li> Your teeth do need a few weeks to adjust to the vibration.</li>
            <li> but I just could not afford the Sonicare so to save a few bucks I got the</li>
            <li> Just makes me think that I wasted alot of money &amp; time on the Oral-B&#x27;s, even though when I had them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recharge the toothbrush until it is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with my toothbrush after a few months; it broke when I pulled the head off of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> might not happen after a few uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model has a break in feature that operates at reduced power for the&lt;br /&gt;first few brushings until you get used to the power.  </li>
            <li> I got the Flexcare a few months ago</li>
            <li> switch on the UV sanitizer failed on my old one after 7 or 8 years, so I bought another.  </li>
            <li> For all we know, it&#x27;s a waste of money to spring for that</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this junk, my teeth definitely seemed in worse shape.  </li>
            <li> The ultraviolet light \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; that comes with the model is worthless (the previous model didn&#x27;t have one, because it didn&#x27;t need it!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;- a small charger just slightly wider than the toothbrush</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s that the second toothbrush can&#x27;t get power from the main toothbrush base.  </li>
            <li> Our first one only lasted about 3 years, which isn&#x27;t toooooo bad, but it&#x27;s not great.   </li>
            <li> (The common cause for gums to recede is usually due to over-brushing).</li>
            <li> you read some other reviews, you&#x27;ll notice that these toothbrushes quitting after two years is a common occurrence.</li>
            <li> The recharger base has a nifty UV sanitizer cycle to keep your brush tip clean.  </li>
            <li> But once my base unit finally broke, I purchased the new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The new style brush heads are smaller, easier to put on and seem to keep a lot cleaner at the base where they connect to the handle.</li>
            <li> so I guess I&#x27;ll be looking for the less expensive one next time.</li>
            <li> At Dentist&#x27;s office they told me basically the same but Braun less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The bad: the first was bought in Dec. 2007 and died within a year.  </li>
            <li> My one disappointment is that I bought this with the intention of getting a $15 discount and it didn&#x27;t show up at the like normal and I&#x27;m hoping it is manufactured one and is \\&quot;in</li>
            <li> The only real negative I can see is the cost of replacement brush tips--around $20 for a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> the whole head vibrates, so it is very difficult to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three Sonicare brushes in the past few years.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush is very hard to the point where it almost hurts your gums.</li>
            <li> I usually end up with toothpaste on the brush head stem and the base, but it is a snap to clean.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up with toothpaste on the brush head stem and the base, but it is a snap to clean.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two of these units a little over a year ago, and recently one of the unit started making a weird noise.</li>
            <li> Although a little expensive, they last for years.</li>
            <li> And every few years I need the expensive deep gum cleaning treatment ($300.00+).  </li>
            <li> A point that may not be as obvious is that this toothbrush is meant to slowly die out or be unusable within approximately 2 years.</li>
            <li> Not only the box was not sealed... but the hard plastic inside had been broken (which means it has been opened and taken out) but also the battery had been charged and the small wire that holds together the electric cords had been messed with.    </li>
            <li> We store both heads in the sanitizer and run it after each round of brushing; tried running it once a day as stated in the manual but noticed some bacterial growth at the base of the brushes (where the color code rings snap on) after a few days, so went back to twice daily</li>
            <li> but, seriously, how hard is it to offer pink along with the blues and greens?).        </li>
            <li> and I had very little or no</li>
            <li> The next morning I still noticed that it was very weak.</li>
            <li> It tingled with a sensation that was strange and a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Lost or misplaced additional chargers are hard to find.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a two year guarantee on page 13 of the owner&#x27;s manual, so it lived up to the guarantee, and maybe that&#x27;s just how long these things normally last until they shake themselves to death, or else I just got a bad one.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for about six weeks and just can&#x27;t get past a couple of the design flaws.  </li>
            <li> The multiple settings, buttons, and LED&#x27;s on this thing are just useless gimmicks IMHO.  </li>
            <li> and I am a small person and</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before you spend the small fortune to buy one of these, try to find one you can hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li> The model is lightweight, not too noisy, sleek and small rechargable unit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the compact head since I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> , I have dropped it a thousand times, and for the past couple years I&#x27;ve shared it with my husband (the handle, not the brush, ew).</li>
            <li> I have bought over 10 Sonicare&#x27;s in the past 10 yrs for family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone thru 2 of these in the past 9 months.  </li>
            <li> GO GREEN!  </li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars as it went weird on me after having it about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I have had periodontal problems over the past year, and this product was recommended to me by my periodontist.</li>
            <li> (wow, I didn&#x27;t realize that sitting idly on my bathroom counter was so dangerous to toothbrushes).  </li>
            <li> There is also a small charger for travel (sans sanitizer.)</li>
            <li> Mine only came with one head, so I&#x27;m hoping that they are not too expensive.</li>
            <li> My ill feeling towards Philips only affirmed with this incident.</li>
            <li> Once I started using it, I&#x27;m not sure how I ever survived without it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they don&#x27;t just give you two of those.</li>
            <li> they finally said &#x27;oh sorry we have already determined you don&#x27;t have a warranty anymore.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> It comes with a small charger for when you&#x27;re traveling, and a case for the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the sterilizer, it usually goes on sale for as-cheap or cheaper than the one without it.   </li>
            <li> This product is not for the faint of gums, and should be used only as directed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I had been using the Sonicare Advance for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I actually get sad after it auto-shuts off after the brushing cycle,</li>
            <li> There must be something wrong with the brush because this should not have happened in only 4 years.  </li>
            <li> There must be something wrong with the brush because this should not have happened in only 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy person when it comes to dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Have used a Sonicare brush for the past 4-5 years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the issue is</li>
            <li> I keep changing the mode when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth usually in the morning when I don&#x27;t have time to be mucking about with the thing.</li>
            <li> There is only 1 flaw, and that is with the sensors on the handle - it is difficult to brush you teeth without changing the setting.</li>
            <li> This model is difinitely an improvement to my past model.</li>
            <li> Only wish replacements were not so expensive.  </li>
            <li> have used sonicare in the past, and bought them for my family and friends for birthdays and holidays...</li>
            <li> Inspection of both Sonicare found a small screw (approx 3/8\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a stickler for trying to give my teeth that \\&quot;slick clean\\&quot; feeling, and this brush seems to do it every time.</li>
            <li> but I was unable to find it in my local area.  </li>
            <li> My husbands just started doing the same thing and unfortunately his isnt covered under warranty any longer.</li>
            <li> In the past week my brush no longer works like it used to</li>
            <li> This makes it easier for my wife, who has small hands, to use.  </li>
            <li> I have used the disposable electric toothbrushes in the past, but nothing close to this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rotodent for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am returning it and buying it from a local store.</li>
            <li> The only con we have is that it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> It is useless to brush the horizonal surfaces, definitely cannot brush any part and the gumline of the inside dentition.</li>
            <li> it was packed into a relatively small box and the heads even have a plastic cap to slip over the bristles when you&#x27;re not using the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of it was packed into a relatively small box and the heads even have a plastic cap to slip over the bristles when you&#x27;re not using the toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually in a hurry</li>
            <li> After going to this I can report no more cavities since the switch.  </li>
            <li> I must confess to being a lazy flosser.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that the replacement brush heads are needed almost every three months and they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve utilized Sonicare tooth brushes for the past 10 years,  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve purchased and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sonicare, not much more to say than that.</li>
            <li> The massage is formulated for your gums, so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any benefit to this being in your toothbrushing routine.</li>
            <li> The lady on the phone at Philips hung up on me, I got no help and I am not satisfied with the toothbrush or the customer service.</li>
            <li> No more gunk collecting inside my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> This brush will Destroy plaque!  </li>
            <li> There is a small metal shaft that the brush head is mounted on that provides the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; vibration when you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> That is unacceptable for such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure where to turn to now.</li>
            <li> Now the base charger is completely flat with a little peg sticking up in the middle.</li>
            <li> Black gunk built up where the brush resided in the charger &amp; in the thin plastic molding groove on the brush &amp; had to be cleaned once every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the positive reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Positive:   (1.)</li>
            <li> To start:  I was very unhappy with this brush for the first year I owned it, until I saw my dental professionals and they changed the way I brush.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the replacement brush heads are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Its a great brush and the package I bought included a hard carry case, recharge combo/UV base and a small travel recharge base.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my hard to buy for husband this past Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the Oral B electric toothbrush in the past but never really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Makes the toothbrush pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> This was annoying at first, but I got used to it.  </li>
            <li> This was annoying at first, but I got used to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to make the switch from the manual youth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the verdict will be in the longrun, but I feel that if I continue to brush for at least two minutes, there won&#x27;t be a difference.  </li>
            <li> A year ago I bought the new one and it irritated my gums so badly</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no good reason why I should be unable to personally replace the battery/batteries in ANY device manufactured after, say, the year 2005 (and that&#x27;s being generous).</li>
            <li> Previously I owned 2 Sonicare brushes, which lasted approximately 7 years each, with continuous 2x per day use.  </li>
            <li> Its nearly impossible to explain the sensation of the Sonicare, but it truly cannot compare it to my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> And the brush heads are long enough to keep gunk and toothpaste suds from making their way between the head and the base.  </li>
            <li> I wish the brushes were a little less expensive, but I would still buy again.</li>
            <li> I just wish the replacement brushs are little less expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have a hard choice with picking Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The brush was so hard and the noise unbearable.  </li>
            <li> It would not be hard for two people to use this.  </li>
            <li> But with the FlexCare, I don&#x27;t need to (and am not SUPPOSED to) brush hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit comes with a hard plastic case for travel, a sanitizer/charging station.</li>
            <li> I scrubbing too hard...</li>
            <li> (they no longer made them and brush heads were hard to come by).</li>
            <li> I tend to brush too hard, and the Sonicare alleviates that problem.</li>
            <li> *  heads hard to find, and</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time figuring out what the designers were thinking of when they designed brush heads that can&#x27;t withstand the vibrations of the hand units.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person who brushes too hard and whose gums are receding then this is the toothbrush for you.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time clicking the \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot; button, but now that I&#x27;ve had it for a while</li>
            <li> maybe I am hard on them?</li>
            <li> I also learned it doesn&#x27;t even have a setting to alert you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever go</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to lug around the large charger and UV sanitizing base.</li>
            <li> I understand that it entirely depends on where you hold the base, but unless you are gripping the base really hard (which by the way, you shouldn&#x27;t be!)</li>
            <li> They seem a little pricey at approximately $10/head.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was bad luck getting two duds early on.</li>
            <li> Too bad the expensive part of the unit is such low quality.</li>
            <li> Call me a sucker for gimmicks</li>
            <li> Has the workmanship gotten that shoddy?  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use the unit twice a day, meaning at least 4 brush head changes per day.  </li>
            <li> After reading a couple of the negative reviews, I learned from their mistakes (I think).  </li>
            <li> Some reviews including Amazon suggests that this is common.</li>
            <li> Will totally recommend it to my Teeth Crazy friends.</li>
            <li> Still, it sucks that I had problems so soon after purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Still, it sucks that I had problems so soon after purchasing it.</li>
            <li> and it keeps the brush heads in the protective case so that they are not catching germs by being exposed.</li>
            <li> What I DO agree with wholeheartedly is the complaint about nonreplaceable batteries (thus the four stars vice five).</li>
            <li> The vibration in the handle and brush head is also quite minimal for a sonic toothbrush, and I do not find it uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> But again, negative part abt</li>
            <li> Some complained that it will turn mouldy.</li>
            <li> (I have to wait at least 16 hours after I put it on the recharger in order to use it again.)  </li>
            <li> Lately, when I go to the dentist, however, the dental hygienist always keeps mentioning these Philips toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> * - If I could give this thing negative stars, I would.  </li>
            <li> Very nasty.r giving you a nasty mold growth that&#x27;s as wide as the door.</li>
            <li> Of course, now it&#x27;s probably too late to return this overpriced piece of junk.</li>
            <li> so that was a bit confusing until I figured out what the deal was.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s complaint is that it just shuts off after all four quadrants are \\&quot;done\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for at least 10 years, and like the work it does.  </li>
            <li> couple of people have complained about accidentally hitting 1 of the 2 buttons on the handle while brushing.  </li>
            <li> A couple of people have complained about accidentally hitting 1 of the 2 buttons on the handle while brushing.  </li>
            <li> Customer service unhelpful, warehouse emlpoyee was rude.</li>
            <li> Lately, I decided to go ahead and give it a try</li>
            <li> With negative points however, the 5 timings are an overkill.</li>
            <li> and I give it five stars without complaint.  </li>
            <li> amazons shipping sucks though.</li>
            <li> - at least the brush still works...    </li>
            <li> the dentist lately-</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t matter if it works if it&#x27;s not handy.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing negative</li>
            <li> This week at least.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Elite does away with that complaint.  </li>
            <li> unit isn&#x27;t overly noisy, at least to me.</li>
            <li> have one &#x27;complaint&#x27;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Phillips will not replace my broken Sonicare with the cheaper Essence or even the earlier Elite, although I would prefer one of those products.  </li>
            <li> I do not own one, but perhaps it is time I got one as well.</li>
            <li> but I want to warn you how delicate the unit is.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to get at least 2-3 years of usage before replacing it.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Philips customer service and they are sending a replacement handle, so at least there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s slowly getting rid of plaque buildup that I thought my dentist would have to scrape off.</li>
            <li> As we all know, rechargeable batteries slowly lose their charging capacity throughout the life of its use (it&#x27;s called memory loss).</li>
            <li> The brush slowly lost vibration power even after it was fully charged until it just stopped vibrating all-together (over a two-week period).  </li>
            <li> Within a year it started to vibrate slowly, and now it turns on and off automatically.</li>
            <li> so I have to give this a product a THUMBS DOWN!!!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare package I purchased here at Amazon came with:     - a small charger just slightly wider than the toothbrush  - a larger charging base with UV sanitizer (to kill stray bacteria accumulated on the head)  </li>
            <li> No more with this brush!  </li>
            <li> No more buying batteries!</li>
            <li> all this over a few toothbrushes!!</li>
            <li> Both of them lasts no more than 1 yr!</li>
            <li> When I told them what I had been told by the other guy, the response was that he was wrong, that no one at Philips would ever say that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 06/23?2009, My unit failed the other day, just stopped working.</li>
            <li> The other two are useless; I&#x27;m sending them to warranty service.</li>
            <li> I mean, it was something I did every day, but</li>
            <li> No more gunk!  </li>
            <li> See what I mean about thinking of everything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say this and mean it all the time:  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is why are the toothbrushes so very expensive?</li>
            <li> Only one real negative: replacement brush heads are too expensive.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the induction charger; no exposed power contacts between the base and the toothbrush body.</li>
            <li> I consider it is a failure.</li>
            <li> The awful thing is, it breaks down so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the UV sanitizer is all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, but it is reassuring that when I&#x27;m sick I (theoretically) don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing the toothbrush heads.     </li>
            <li> They took a customer unhappy with a non functioning product and converted me into a life long Philips fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry to say this, but I buoyed 3 sonic care toothbrushes six months ago, and only one of them is still working.</li>
            <li> This is a very expensive toothbrush that should last for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Braun Oral B electric toothbrush for years and my dental check-ups were not better or worse.</li>
            <li> One minor disappointment:  </li>
            <li> Programming the brush for the mode that you like every time you pick it up is not hard, but it&#x27;s really annoying.  </li>
            <li> The person I spoke to then tells me that I am one of the unfortunate ones and compares it to buying a lemon car; in other words...TOUGH LUCK FOR ME!  </li>
            <li> and they sent a new base.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation is to get the less expensive models.  </li>
            <li> So now I figured I had a serious problem here.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved my Sonicare but hated the way gunk and crud would build up under the screw cap that secured the brush head to the base unit.</li>
            <li> : We will take your feedback seriously, and I will assure you that, I will forward it to the concern department.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : We will take your feedback seriously, and I will assure you that, I will forward it to the concern department.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ridiculous for a $200 product  </li>
            <li> Is there anything to justify the ridiculous cost of these replacement heads?</li>
            <li> , you need a serious reality check.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sad that this stopped working, especially since they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> I hope no one else is having this problem but 3 out of 3 toothbrushes that ended up faulty is a bit ridiculous, and Sonicare wont help you after the warranty.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re saying to yourself</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re saying to yourself</li>
            <li> This design inevitably lead to a build up of gunk on the bottom of the brush and on the inside of the charger unless you completely dried off the toothbrush before placing it into the charger base.</li>
            <li> The handle has a serious design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, Sonicare has serious quality issues.  </li>
            <li> I will probably re-buy (the less expensive, no-frills model)</li>
            <li> So to celebrate getting their braces off, I bought them one too on Amazon...MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I think if i had to do it again, I would opt for one of the less expensive models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush less than a year now, and it just started turning off and on randomly by itself.  </li>
            <li> The new brushing modes make it virtually impossible to brush your teeth wrong.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have to replace the little effer once a year.</li>
            <li> If you ever turned this on with the cover in place and sitting on the counter in a hotel room it is a little startling at four am.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a product go bad like this multiple times).</li>
            <li> Too bad it only lasted 3 months...  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not one of those demanding \\&quot;customer always right\\&quot; type of people, I understand the nature of running a profitable business, but this is just not fair.</li>
            <li> The replacement has now failed after a few months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any of the irritating tickling vibrations common on the sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> So your offer is still not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So your offer is still not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good considering</li>
            <li> When on the charger, it made loud annoying beeps while attempting to charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+The charger base on the old Sonicare was also recessed.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does come with two brush heads and caps, a charging base, a travel charger, and a soft carrying case.  </li>
            <li> Although i was looking forward to a new Philips Sonicare toothbrush, it was extremely frustrating to continually have the brush separate from the base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Sonicare toothbrushes that made my hand go numb, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I mean, seriously?!</li>
            <li> It reaches the hard to reach spots and keeps my dentist from lecturing me!</li>
            <li> This means either I have the worst possible luck or Philips cheaps out on their seals and the thing isn&#x27;t remotely as watertight as it should be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that this $120 toothbrush only lasted 2 years</li>
            <li> but the other does not fit snugly on the shaft in the base.  </li>
            <li> When something goes wrong (and it usually does,) you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
            <li> They have both failed within the past two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I cannot find a complaint, but our dentist probably could!</li>
            <li> I will never own another Tooth brush again!</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive because of the small size of the toothbrush head, not believing the \\&quot;hype\\&quot; and, not to mention, the steep price for a mere toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Decent but EXPENSIVE brushes AND VERY LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE who replaces defective products with OLD products that crap out soon afterward!</li>
            <li> Soon after getting this my husband came down with a cold</li>
            <li> We have very hard water here so the calcium deposits always gathered in the corners</li>
            <li> Considering how much I paid for this model I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed as I thought I had found the brush that would meet all my needs, travelling, small size and weight plus the cleaning capacity of the previous sonicares.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how tough the customer service routine is to get a replacement ...</li>
            <li> Unlike my last Sonicare toothbrush, which lasted over 10 years, this one has been very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting addicted to the dentist</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It has gotten worse over time.  </li>
            <li> I assumed after two years it was broken</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s product to stand behind said product.  </li>
            <li> Worse still is that the switch is sizable and takes  almost no pressure to actuate.  </li>
            <li> I switched because I was tired of the gunk in the area where the toothbrush meets the handle.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t broken.  </li>
            <li> nothing has broken yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have to pay the $ to prevent my receeding gum problems from going worse.</li>
            <li> Two units, both with broken sanitizers.</li>
            <li> One with a broken motor and one with a broken charging mechanism.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts approximately 10 days for two people.    </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made this product so that if you try to replace the battery by removing battery compartment from the body of the toothbrush it destroys the circuitry of the toothbrush rendering it broken and unusable.</li>
            <li> but alas</li>
            <li> This is no longer the case with this model since there is no plastic skirt and no plastic plate behind the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Customer service is poor.  </li>
            <li> Then one day, I picked it up to use it and it was broken.   </li>
            <li> but I was getting tired of cleaning it and</li>
            <li> My problem is the two of them that I&#x27;ve owned have both broken.  </li>
            <li> Now 2 years, in it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the cleaner base attachment for the brush head</li>
            <li> After 6 or 7 of these steps the representative stated they would send me a replacement within 7-10 business days, since the product appeared to be broken and I am within the 2-year warranty period.  </li>
            <li> This is irritating and frustrating at a time when I have not yet had my coffee.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t use all the features, but alas, I have and do.  </li>
            <li> Both died the same death - waking us at night buzzing nosily on the charging base.  </li>
            <li> So they stand behind the thing, but</li>
            <li> Update to the below: I&#x27;ve been on hold for 35 minutes and counting, trying to get warranty support for my broken toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I just HATE to go back when its time...</li>
            <li> In 6 months mine has broken 2 times.  </li>
            <li> technology behind Sonicare deserves some mention.  </li>
            <li> a larger charging base with UV sanitizer (to kill stray bacteria accumulated on the head)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> so when your boyfriend spends the night and uses your toothbrush and it secretly grosses you out</li>
            <li> I thought the sanitizer was an unnecessary addition.</li>
            <li> This product might work well at the beginning but the handle unit has a problem that the company will not stand behind nor fix....</li>
            <li> gets gunked under the heads worse than these models.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 of these brushes now and both of them have broken after about 1 year of use.</li>
            <li> Being tired and not thinking, I figured that it was maybe because the battery was not charged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery.</li>
            <li> another video game</li>
            <li> worse part is that the 2-year warranty, advertised in the description, cannot be verified unless one keeps the receipt.</li>
            <li> not extremely happy about the cost of the refills, that never seem to be on sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not proud of it.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Terrible customer service and warranty support - brushes failed in under 2 years - but sonicare would not repair - even though i registered the product and gave all supporting documentation.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this new model.  </li>
            <li> I am leaving it plugged into the sanitizer base and not using it in any strange way.</li>
            <li> They are now sending me a new base - again!  </li>
            <li> finally got my $10 rebate on this bad boy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not fair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric toothbrushes from time to time and was always disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the difference in how my teeth looked and felt after a few weeks of using the SoniCare.  </li>
            <li> The biggest thing is that now that with the pop in head you don&#x27;t get the build up of nasty gunk like you did in the old screw heads.</li>
            <li> Once that happens, the water-tight seal is broken and the unit is rendered useless.  </li>
            <li> I finally gave in after a very painful dental procedure to fix the erosion of my gum line which was caused by aggressive brushing.</li>
            <li> It now takes two hands to brush my teeth -- one to hold the toothbrush and the other to keep pressing the toothbrush end into the base to keep it from falling off.</li>
            <li> Instead of screwing the brush head down onto the base</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to quit using my brush because the refills were too expensive for my tight budget :(</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an Advance 4000-series, for three reasons: battery was dying, gunk in head was awful, the base was getting calcified and difficult to clean even with CLR.    </li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed that only one of the brushes was replaced.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed when after 10 short months, my $140 toothbrush stopped working.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the switch to this electric because I couldn&#x27;t break the bad habit of brushing too hard at the gumline.</li>
            <li> Now I know how electric toothbrush can stop working in 2 years, I will not buy another expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, there wasn&#x27;t an inexpensive brand I have not tried.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am now in the market for another unit....</li>
            <li> Ive heard the les expensive brand will do the trick, I can imagine so.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- expensive replacement heads</li>
            <li> I am sorry I didn&#x27;t get one sooner.  </li>
            <li> and I am unable to get between them.</li>
            <li> STILL VAGUE ON WHERE TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT BRUSHES AND I&#x27;M</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon</li>
            <li> So, I go to the Phillips/Sonicare website and log in and report another failed unit; however, now there is no email support; you must call in.  </li>
            <li> Not a viable option when they are so expensive to begin with.      </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have my reciept</li>
            <li> makes a weird clanking noise and then it just stops working.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this company.....</li>
            <li> The non-disposable battery hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> If you buy this you will not be sorry.    </li>
            <li> and no one has died here yet) at random.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, your unit is out of warranty and we don&#x27;t provide support.  </li>
            <li> At their price, it seemed a bit expensive in my opinion, not to mention the one they were selling didn&#x27;t match what they had on display</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realise how flawed a manual toothbrush is and how it cannot do what this unit can until you&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realise how flawed a manual toothbrush is and how it cannot do what this unit can until you&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> but what is wrong with this model?  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we went through 2 of them in 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> Your expensive tooth brush will break and Phillips is no longer replacing them.</li>
            <li> It failed in a year.</li>
            <li> but boy was i wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one and it has the sanitizing feature which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending over $100 for a tooth brush</li>
            <li> but i know with the brush head on it was making horrible rattling noises before the battery thankfully finally died&lt;br</li>
            <li> Water/Toothpaste would get into the brush head and turn all yellow and nasty.    </li>
            <li> Sorry guys, but</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Advance toothbrush heads had a plastic skirt that was twisted on.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with lifetime guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but the wife wanted this.</li>
            <li> Make the batteries non-interchangeable so that when the batteries fail, the unit is trash.    </li>
            <li> Unit fails to turn on, and works intermittently.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine in April and the unit failed in November.</li>
            <li> It also turns itself on periodically, and I must say the random buzzing while I was in the shower took me by surprise.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the design them to fail after 2 years (conveniently when they are out of warranty).</li>
            <li> I requested a replacement from Amazon, and was promptly told \\&quot;sorry it is over the 30 days...</li>
            <li> They are unable to get any bulbs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched the internet, unable to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this toothbrush because it has a lot of characteristics I don&#x27;t like: needs recharching, expensive consumables (replacement brushes),</li>
            <li> After 3-6 months the connection between the motor and the brush head fails leaving it useless.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t risk my expensive toothbrush</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t risk my expensive toothbrush</li>
            <li> Once the threadlocker fails, the toothbrush is useless.</li>
            <li> This was very annoying and gross to look at.</li>
            <li> Heck, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the sonicare models, as they are all improvements over the manual sticks you have been using.</li>
            <li> I purchased the FlexCare in January of 2011, after my Elite randomly stopped working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shawn: I am sorry but we can not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : This is unfortunate for your company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shawn: I am sorry but we can not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : This is unfortunate for your company.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by Sonicare&#x27;s packing quality control or their response to this problem.    </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The rotating OralB ones are lame from what I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I do a lot of traveling, and the item being damaged could be blamed on the careless acts of the TSA.</li>
            <li> Random people comment on my &amp;#34;white teeth&amp;#34; and believe me...</li>
            <li> It was quite an expensive item</li>
            <li> If felt clunky inside my mouth, and the vibrating felt almost useless.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was quite a bit skeptical about the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> What am I doing wrong?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with this expensive brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lost that on a business trip</li>
            <li> Weird...</li>
            <li> Not acceptable for how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> And believe me, when it&#x27;s 4am and your toothbrush starts buzzing like crazy from the other room, it is REALLY ANNOYING.</li>
            <li> It is a very expensive purchase when the battery life is so poor.</li>
            <li> Negative:  (1.)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t water from the toothbrush seeps under the sanitizer door giving you a nasty mold growth that&#x27;s as wide as the door.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, scum and mildew build up on the heads and the base they sit on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Opening the toothbrush will also seriously mar the base.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately prone to getting these annoying and very painful sores for no other reason than bad luck. :(  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s driven me so crazy</li>
            <li> but that feels awkward to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never realized how dirty my teeth still were after using manual of battery powered toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment is the Elite had 5 30-second periods</li>
            <li> If you have a cold or sore throat, you can sanitize your brush before using again.  </li>
            <li> I thought my dentist was crazy for recommending this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I sanitized after each use and didn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my cold longer because of my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have 19 capped teeth and, even though I was afraid the thing would vibrate my caps off, I can already tell that coffee and tea stains are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> And indeed, it took what was basically tar off my teeth, but it made my teeth, gums and tounge numb when I was finished.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid I&#x27;d break it, banging around in packing/travel.  </li>
            <li> but this is really disappointing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even offer to recycle your useless model!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong?!?  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> dentist is sad because it works too well - no cavities to fix!</li>
            <li> I was really sick and tired of cleaning the gunk off the base, and from the inside, and in between the dome and the brush stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always shocked by how dirty my gums and teeth feel after brushing alone.</li>
            <li> This goes from annoying to expensive in the blink of an eye.  </li>
            <li> It is very expensive</li>
            <li> It is very annoying to say the least.  </li>
            <li> It is very annoying to say the least.  </li>
            <li> , I needed to come every 3-4 months for \\&quot;scaling and planing\\&quot; and that got to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is now worthless and in the trash can.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are very expensive IMO.</li>
            <li> The break occurred inside the base both times just below the brush head connection rendering the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; aspect of this brush useless.    </li>
            <li> The continued failures of the base unit make this an expensive proposition.</li>
            <li> However I am very sad that after 16 months it kinda fell apart.</li>
            <li> And I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I do not floss because my teeth are so close together that it&#x27;s nearly impossible</li>
            <li> The battery is &amp;#34;hard wired&amp;#34; inside and access to the battery is impossible for practical purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nearly impossible to over brush at the gum line with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Was my Oral B that bad?</li>
            <li> The bad:  </li>
            <li> The hardware quality is BAD.     </li>
            <li> When the batteries go bad, you have to throw out your Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s just bad luck and purchased this flexcare model.</li>
            <li> understand warranty periods exist for a reason and perhaps I have really bad luck on just sonicares (I&#x27;m a gadget nut</li>
            <li> Be warned they have really bad customer service.  </li>
            <li> The bad again</li>
            <li> Now for the bad.  </li>
            <li> It might even go longer, but it&#x27;s probably bad for the battery to drain it all the way.</li>
            <li> when the bad effect happen after 28 days.  </li>
            <li> I seem to have bad luck with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Too bad for me.</li>
            <li> And the one bad point:  - position of the \\&quot;program selector\\&quot; button.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with cleaning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bad luck at</li>
            <li> Bad oral hygiene, I know.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if we just got a lemon, or if it&#x27;s a bad design.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush in the hope that it would reduce the frequency of painful cancer sores.  </li>
            <li> Was sick of all the cleaning in the dentist&#x27;s chair</li>
            <li> I am also a fan of the uv sanitizer because I am also currently sick &amp; don&#x27;t ever like to keep a toothbrush that can prolong my illness.</li>
            <li> Or threw out a brush head ($$$) after getting sick?  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed by this product and paid a lot for it and it sounds as if the manufacturers know about this problem.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recenlty wrote Sonicare to tell them how disappointed I am in the life-span of the sonicare toothbrushes we&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Harry: [...]  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I fyou are planning on buying an electric toothbrush you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed for ~$145 the brush broke before the battery wore out.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this model because the UV thing stopped working after a month.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very disappointing for us to have to buy another one after buying 3 which all turned out to be faulty.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I lost my receipt and couldn&#x27;t prove it was still under warranty, so I was out over $100!!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds stupid</li>
            <li> in a million years thought i&#x27;d use an electric toothbrush b/c i thought it was a stupid idea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll trade noise, which I hate, for in tact</li>
            <li> Sanitizer on base to eliminate bacteria</li>
            <li> I hate manually brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> , I would hate to think of ever giving it up.  </li>
            <li> It made a vibrating/pulsating morse code when I put it on it&#x27;s base to charge.</li>
            <li> It made a vibrating/pulsating morse code when I put it on it&#x27;s base to charge.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t even take the base with me).</li>
            <li> The metal piece that attaches the base to the head has become detached within the base.</li>
            <li> If you hear two beeps followed by one beep the charger base is working.</li>
            <li> The vibration on it was crazy insane.  </li>
            <li> The base of the sanitizer/charger has a groove where you can tuck away some of the power cord</li>
            <li> Philips should have designed the base of below where the toothbrush stands with a slope so water won&#x27;t creep under the sanitizer door.</li>
            <li> Philips should have designed the base of below where the toothbrush stands with a slope so water won&#x27;t creep under the sanitizer door.</li>
            <li> There was a slim gap between the base of the brush head and the control/handle unit.  </li>
            <li> Their warranty policy is specifically designed in a way that the product will crap out after the warranty expires.  </li>
            <li> but using the serial number on the base of the handle</li>
            <li> We purchased two of these - one with the UV cleaning base and one with a standalone base.  </li>
            <li> And this one has a sanitizer on the base</li>
            <li> At that point, it was worthless.</li>
            <li> guess it gives philips another reason to invent something i didn&#x27;t think i needed--a toothbrushing shield/guard to protect my mirror from all those annoying toothpaste spit spray dots.  </li>
            <li> One thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a separate base or stand for the handle.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss and do it infrequently</li>
            <li> there is the charging base.  </li>
            <li> 2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  </li>
            <li> Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     </li>
            <li> If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    </li>
            <li> Now the failures are annoying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m moving up from a sonicare advance, which is their base model.</li>
            <li> Philips redesigned the base with the flexcare.</li>
            <li> The one flaw, in my opinion, and that is that when you are holding the base there is a button that often accidentally gets pressed and it changes the type of cleaning mid-cycle.  </li>
            <li> This tended to build up with all kinds of crap.</li>
            <li> Assuming water must have made it inside the base</li>
            <li> The cheap-cheap ones have bulky handles and crap</li>
            <li> Then, I found that garbage tends to collect in the toothbrush heads and handle base, which bothered me a lot.  </li>
            <li> will result in your toothpaste lining the base of your sink instead of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I NEVER KEPT THE BASE PLUGGED IN.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it has a sanitizing unit attached to the base and it has indicators on the brush handle showing the charge.  </li>
            <li> I hate going to the dentist</li>
            <li> Bought one in Dec 2009 for $100+, and the shaft went bad 2 months ago, shaking very badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very annoyed with Sonicare!!  </li>
            <li> After about 10 uses it became nasty and dirty and just disgusting.</li>
            <li> If you want to spend a lot of money on a bad product, get a Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> I had a nasty case of mold on the base.</li>
            <li> and I hated it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes since 2004 and I have yet to be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality of this model.</li>
            <li> replacement heads can be a bit expensive!!!</li>
            <li> Of course, I made the terrible mistake of taking the toothbrush out of my mouth during operation...</li>
            <li> That is not the worst part though.  </li>
            <li> Pathetic.</li>
            <li> I stopped using mine when I got a horrible check up</li>
            <li> no where for nasty goo to form.  </li>
            <li> This is a pricey unit, and the replacement toothbrush heads are outrageously priced, even here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush still works, but it&#x27;s now insanely noisy and shakes something awful.      </li>
            <li> Just annoying that all!!</li>
            <li> I am scared to use it now even though it will still take a charge because I don&#x27;t want it shocking me or turning on again all hours of the night.  </li>
            <li> : and it is making a horrible rattling noise&lt;br /&gt;Harry</li>
            <li> Very nasty.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need the burning, awful tasting, mouthwash.     </li>
            <li> Bacteria grew in them that made the toothbrush absolutely disgusting!  </li>
            <li> That being said it is a VERY expensive product!!!!  </li>
            <li> Now it buzzes horribly and stops when touched to the teeth.</li>
            <li> die a terrible uv death, you bastards!&#x27;</li>
            <li> to those nasty, nasty microbes.    </li>
            <li> Terrible!!!  </li>
            <li> My mouth is fresher longer and flossing is not as disgusting.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, it is a piece of crap!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good equipment the only thing it needs is a brush that can clean the teeth better in the curves.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare since my mom bought me my first one for Xmas after I had moved away. It broke, the button caved in but I love how clean my mouth/teeth feel after using it (compared to a regular manual brush). Once you go.. sonicare... you never go back. Well, I certainly didn&#x27;t want to. I do wish this model came with two handles, but instead my wife and I just take turns and switch out our own heads. Awesome brush, but honestly i don&#x27;t use the &#x27;sensitive&#x27;, &#x27;massage&#x27; or &#x27;Max Care&#x27; options so I guess I&#x27;ll be looking for the less expensive one next time.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans well, but only lasted me 2 years, I do also replace the brush heads every 3 months or so, and I traveled with it once for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that this $120 toothbrush only lasted 2 years + the brush heads I replaced, definitely too costly. Now I know how electric toothbrush can stop working in 2 years, I will not buy another expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My electric toothbrush holder died after 2 years.  For the money I expect a product to last longer.  I did like it while it worked and my dentist could tell my teeth were in better condition (I brush too hard with regular tooth brushes).  I would not buy again though due to the price.</li>
            <li> Replacement love this product.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this model after my old elite bit the dust, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist after each use.  The customer service crew couldn&#x27;t be friendlier or more helpful - very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare rechargeable toothbrushes since they were introduced.  No problems with ANY of them.  This system with the Sanitizer is the best one yet.   No Bulky holder for the toothbrush that gets filled with...and has to be   cleaned weekly, and the compact brush heads are great for smaller mouths  and control when brushing.  Flex care is the best.  All my Sonicare Batteries have held up. I think it may be user specific for those  that complain about the battery The battery has always served me well when I use it on the road.  The noise? All electronic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried are noisy.  Without my Sonicare, I&#x27;d be cleaning my teeth in a glass.   I&#x27;ll trade noise, which I hate, for in tact teeth anytime!</li>
            <li> So, I have been using electric toothbrushes for a few years. I have tried various brands; you know, the ones when you purchase another toothbrush when the battery dies because its too much of a hassle to get to the battery. Needless to say, there wasn&#x27;t an inexpensive brand I have not tried.     My routine visits to the dentist have been less than desirable. I have had cavities and a root canal. What prompted me in considering the FlexCare stemmed from a close, self-examination of my teeth and gums and I was displeased.     I booked an appointment to the dentist but it was a TWO MONTH wait time and I needed to do something ASAP. So, after research, the reviews really spoked for themselves. I searched Amazon and used Google to get the low down on the best at home cleaning options and mostly all pointed to Sonicare products.     I particurlarly chose this brand do the sanitizing feature. Call me a sucker for gimmicks but I am a huge germ-a-phobe. Plus being able to have two brush heads in the sanitizing unit allowed for me to use different brushes during the morning and evening...another plus!     The unit itself allows for multiple cleaning options: (basic clean, sensitive setting, message setting, 1 minute clean and 3 minute clean).     The performance of this toothbrush is unmatched. The power actually caught me off-guard. Of course, I made the terrible mistake of taking the toothbrush out of my mouth during operation...HUGE MESS. The first two brushes were noticeable but by the third day, I handled all settings with no problems.     In two weeks of usage I could see a difference in my teeth. A natural whiteness appeared, my teeth FELT clean, and my gums and tongue have actually benefit from usage. My hope is that with continued usage by the time my dental appointment arrives, I will not need root scaling/planing and that my plague build-up will be minimal.     Obviously proper oral health and regular dental visits are the best method. However, for those of us thatfeel off track, you first two steps is to get this toothbrush (and don&#x27;t look back) and find a dentist you feel comfortable with and create a plan to regain optimal oral health.     I have no \\&quot;cons\\&quot; on this product. I know many were not happy with the non-replaceable battery. I purchased this unit that gave TWO Flexcare toothbrushes along with two cleaning heads. If I can get 5 year usage, I will be pleased.     I would recommend users couple the FlexCare along with the Waterpick Ultra Jet (another excellent product). Tom&#x27;s of Maine makes excellent mouthwashes that do not include alcohol or saccharin. Colgate Total appears to get the highest reviews for cleaning and post-cleaning protection. I also use Sensodyne&#x27;s Pronamel toothpaste.     I cannot reiterate enough that with the power the FlexCare provides, I cannot imagine any other brush really doing an effective job at cleaning. I will definitely come back and following up after my second dental dentist to discuss improvements with using the FlexCare.     If you are hesitant in buying, just think dropping this amount of money on a toothbrush will likely push you to to upkeep a regular brushing habit. LOL     Gave it 5 stars because the performance is unmatched. Considering the higher price, most cannot afford to have this even though it should be attainable and because of that, overall I would rate 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never owned a Sonicare, you will probably find this toothbrush to be really noisy and much heavier than a normal toothbrush, but that&#x27;s because it actually cleans significantly better than a toothbrush, leaving you with that \\&quot;just got a dental cleaning\\&quot; feeling -- versus those other vibrating/rotating brushes that are basically designed for the lazy brusher and don&#x27;t really clean any better. (If you&#x27;ve owned an earlier model, you&#x27;ll find this one is lighter and quieter than those. It&#x27;s worth the upgrade!)    It&#x27;s not loud enough to wake up my wife while I get ready in the morning -- whereas my electric shaver is louder and will wake her up.    As for battery life, I&#x27;ve been using this model for 9 months with no problems. It can easily go a week between charging (even now), and I&#x27;ve never needed the travel charger that it comes with (but it&#x27;s nice to have one should I be going somewhere for more than a week). I&#x27;ve read the manual, and it is true that the battery cannot be replaced once dead, but I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be able to get at least another year before that happens. The battery seems as good today as it was when I first opened it -- wish I could say the same for my laptop and cordless tools.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about getting an electric toothbrush for years.  I decided that for my birthday I would treat myself to this one.      The first decision I had to make was a rotating head (Oral B) or back-and-forth (Sonicare). I went by word of mouth and reading reviews.  Surprisingly, everyone I know has a sonicare toothbrush.  The second decision was whether or not to get the bells and whistles or a basic brush.  I liked all the different settings this one offered.  I have sensitive teeth and was worried about agitating my teeth.  It helped that it was on sale for the same price as the one without the sanitizer.  I have actually been able to switch to regular toothpaste instead of sensitive toothpaste.    My only concern was of the reviews that mentioned the toothbrush being loud.  As a newbie, I&#x27;ve found it to be quite manageable.  I can brush my teeth in the morning and not worry about my boyfriend waking up.  The most difficult thing to figure out was how to keep all the toothpaste in my mouth will transitioning the brush around my mouth.  The brush head is small enough to keep your mouth closed and still maneuver around.    Overall, I&#x27;m kicking myself for not making the purchase earlier.  I&#x27;m getting addicted to the dentist clean feel.  I now brush 4 times a day instead of 2.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I can&#x27;t say enough about this toothbrush...  First, though, my teeth have been a mess for years.  This is mostly my fault due to a fear of dentist for a variety of reasons (including the time when the dentist inadvertently stuck me in the arm with a novocaine needle) which kept me from the dentist&#x27;s office for a long time.  My wife finally convinced me to go to a dentist, and I found a terrific one.  Anyway, after a lot of work, my teeth are finally nice and healthy, and I bought this toothbrush - Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer - to help keep my teeth in top shape.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  After every use, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned, and it&#x27;s actually a lot of fun using the thing.  I usually start off with the regular \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; function taking care to brush each \\&quot;quad\\&quot; section in my mouth (I usually do this twice), followed by the \\&quot;Message\\&quot; section to go over my gums.  The end result is a squeakly clean, refreshed mouth that feels great.  If you get this toothbrush, you may experience some tingling around your gums when you first start out, but you&#x27;ll quickly get used to it.  Oh, and I also like the onboard sanitizer to keep the brush clean and germ free.  This is truly a wonderful product if you want to keep  your teeth strong and healthy, and to give you a smile that&#x27;ll light up a room!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using electric toothbrushes for years as I feel they are far superior to manual ones. At the recommendation of my dentist recently, I decided to give the Sonicare a try. The design is different and the brush is a different shape, more like a traditional toothbrush. The rapid vibration takes a bit to get use to but there is no denying the exceptionally clean feeling after the 2 minute timer cuts the power cycle. It is the closest clean to the \\&quot;6 month\\&quot; Dental cleaning I have experienced. I recomment this product for it&#x27;s ability, design and features although I am unsure what difference the \\&quot;UV light\\&quot; sanitizer really makes. There are plenty of features to utilize like the \\&quot;quadrant timer\\&quot; which alows you to break down the 2 minute timer into 4 sections for the most effective and even brushing. The brush IS very pricey but consider this product if you really care about your dental upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Amendment****  2 1/2 years later and this toothbrush system is still working flawlessly. Awesome investment!  : )</li>
            <li> This Philips Sonicare FlexCare is an update to my previous sonicare.    The massage cycle is a treat to my gums. I like the fact there are options to cleaning and massage cycles.  The sanitizer is a plus.  I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I had the Intelliclen system I was happy with it in till I learned that sonicare no longer made brush heads for it what ever reason which was stupid but whatever I think it was mainly because they wanted people to upgrade.... So I Bought the 900+ flex-care after the first time I&#x27;m glad I did... This little handle packs a punch. it has to be the most powerful sonicare Ive ever experienced with all the options as well ? where could I go? Some people say it&#x27;s noisy I do not see how this is. It is just has loud/quite as any other sonicare So I do not know what they are talking about.. I think they best Option really is the Quad-placer I&#x27;m glad they kept that on there. I personally like it and surprised no one else is even talked about it. Plus having the U.V. Sanitizer on board is nice only takes 10mins to run a cycle. the whole unit really don&#x27;t take up a lot of room if you have a typical sink. though if you have something like a pedestal you might need a shelf or something because it wont fit. It dose come with two brush size&#x27;s I personally only the bigger one it also come&#x27;s  with a smaller one. I really hope Sonicare plans on keeping this one around longer then 4 years unlike my last one. If you are looking for a Top notch rechargeable toothbrush you would be crazy not to buy this one..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Sonicare toothbrushes in the past and feel like they are the reason I&#x27;ve such healthy gums.  As a physician I&#x27;m very aware that healthy gums are one of the most important things for HEART health, too!  So I really have valued my Sonicare brushes.  And at the age of 58 I have perfect gums and perfect heart health, inspite of being overweight and sedentary.    However, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this new model.  First off the brush head is really small.  I cannot believe the difference in the amount of gunk that remains between my teeth after using the unit the full cleaning program.  I&#x27;ve actually gone through several cycles and the trash remains.  If I look in my makeup mirror I can actually see it!  Now don&#x27;t you think two full cycles with a Sonicare should get that out???  I guarantee my old one would have.      So, I have to floss more diligently than I have in years now.  It seems to me that this unit cleans tooth surfaces just fine, but that is not what I use an electric toothbrush for.  I want the gum stimulation, which is adequate by virtue of the sonic vibration--you don&#x27;t need that silly \\&quot;massage\\&quot; setting.  And I want really excellent crud removal from between teeth, which I find inadequate with this unit.    As to the brush sanitizer:  I figure if that nasty sludge that used to build up in the handle of my old Sonicare didn&#x27;t kill me, surely I don&#x27;t need an infrared cleaner for the brush head!  Perhaps if I had gum disease, or some disease spread by oral contamination, I&#x27;d think it was a good idea, but frankly?  I think it&#x27;s unnecessary.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, been using it for a year now and I love it. My dentist recommended the switch to this electric because I couldn&#x27;t break the bad habit of brushing too hard at the gumline. This brush gets my teeth \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; while being gentler on my gums, with much less sensitivity overall as an added bonus.  For those used to small toothbrushes (size 30), the compact head works nicely. The full size is much too large for me, but works perfectly for my husband. We store both heads in the sanitizer and run it after each round of brushing; tried running it once a day as stated in the manual but noticed some bacterial growth at the base of the brushes (where the color code rings snap on) after a few days, so went back to twice daily and all was well.  The travel charger, case and head covers are handy - no more of those awkward, giant &#x27;snap in&#x27; travel toothbrushes!  The unit is pricey, and having to change out the heads every three months means another $30 or so per person a year, but for us the benefits have been worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I looked forward to receiving this toothbrush after reading reviews and the product description.  I have used it for about six weeks and just can&#x27;t get past a couple of the design flaws.  First, the on/off switch is in a poor location.  I keep accidentally turning the toothbrush on and off while brushing, even when I make a conscious effort to avoid the switch.  Second, the toothbrush throws toothpaste everywhere when running.  My mirror is continually getting splattered with toothpaste and the toothpaste continually dribbles down the brush and handle when in use. I have not had these problems with other electric toothbrushes. Unfortunately, I am now in the market for another unit....</li>
            <li> A few years ago - in my quest to find an electric toothbrush per my dentist&#x27;s instructions led me to stand in front of the products meticulously comparing one vs. another, did it do this that and the other, price point, etc. Oral B won for 1 reason, price and I had a coupon at Costco and their replacement heads were cheaper. That was a few years ago. I was under the impression that all electric toothbrushes were created equally. Although my teeth&#x27;s health improved, there are still issues. My last cleaning was very intense at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Oral B is almost dead - it&#x27;s been 2 years, the battery will hold for a couple of days, but not over a week like it used to. The search for the next toothbrush started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have a hard choice with picking Sonicare. I see the demo/advertising whatever at my dentist. I also knew I wasn&#x27;t happy with OralB - because my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean, and I knew that it was definitely not getting into all the contours of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use with my Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;I felt like a light bulb exploded in my head. It was ridiculous how clean my teeth felt, as if I just had them cleaned and polished at my dentist. How is that possible with only 1 session? Was my Oral B that bad? Maybe this was a fluke. A few more days went by, my teeth stayed with that smooth clean feeling. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s so different about it - the brush head for one. Oral B has a circular head, it spins with use. With the Sonicare, it oscillates back and forth, mimicking real tooth brushing motion. There are contours of the brush so it gets between the teeth. The bristles are stiff to clean my teeth but gentle enough to get into the gums w/o causing bleeding. Oral B brush heads were rough and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for small mouths, hard to reach areas/crevices and for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has options for sensitive and regular or whitening. I like that it&#x27;s timed so I know I&#x27;m doing the right amount. The toothbrush will shut itself off after 2 minutes.  It&#x27;ll be good for kids too, so they&#x27;re not doing a swipe and say they&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, very glad I got it and can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and notice not only are my teeth cleaner, but they are truly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a few months - went for my cleaning and my dental hygienist noticed my teeth/gums were improving. She asked me what I did differently and told her I switched toothbrushes. HA!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE my toothbrush!nt. The toothbrush will shut itself off after 2 minutes.

            <li> Each time I clean my teeth the brush end shoots off into my mouth (it stays on the body of the Sonicare for about 5 seconds). It&#x27;s driven me so crazy I can&#x27;t use it. I wish I still had my cheap Sonicare. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes since they were first introduced. If you&#x27;ve never used one, you will be amazed at the huge positive difference they make in your tooth and gum health. Using a Sonicare twice a day preceeded by flossing, has resulted in perfect or near-perfect gum checks every dental visit.     This model builds on their Philips&#x27; expertise, and works even better than the original models.      The pop-off heads are a huge improvement over the screw-ons, as many other reviewers have said.     My only gripe is that the mode/routine button is right where I have been used to holding the handle with my thumb. It took me a few times to realize that the toothbrush was changing speeds because I had accidentally hit the button. I&#x27;m slowly learning to keep my thumb away from it; it&#x27;s not enough of an issue to downgrade my rating.</li>
            <li> i NEVER thought i would pay this much for a toothbrush!  and i/ve gotta tell ya..... ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!  I wish i would have had it forever ago...  I/ve had the $6 spinbrush pro and was over buying batteries for it... so in an effort to be more GREEN i thought why not get this one..&lt;br /&gt;Because EVERYONE i know that had one LOVED IT!  and now i/m one of them.  DONT HESITATE!  GET IT NOW!!!!!  You won&#x27;t regret it.  Happy Brushing..</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. I love it. It works great and I use it on my daughter too. Sadly, I have to replace the little effer once a year. It just stops working. Phillips is good about sending a replacement but the second time I got it replaced they said they base the warranty off the purchase date not the new brush date so this will only work as long as the warranty you get. I guess such is life but you should know before you buy. PS, use the chat tool on philips website when you need your replacement, it is great!</li>
            <li> I had the older &#x27;e&#x27; series of sonicare toothbrushes, and this is a great update in respect to the charging and the yellow stuff that grows in the head area. The brushes (as of right now) are actually cheaper for this brush than the older ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this is that the silver button that changes the routine is on the area where you would naturally put your thumb. I found myself changing the settings mid brush.</li>
            <li> Definitely digging the tooth brush.  A little pricey but has done as advertised so far.      Was hoping it would come with more than one normal head and one small one since my gf and I both were looking for our own head but extras aren&#x27;t too pricey on amazon.  Recommended</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very noticeable difference when using a Sonicare. I previously used an Oral-B automatic and thought that one was great but the Sonicare is much better. You feel the difference, also you don&#x27;t apply any pressure when cleaning your teeth, basically just guide the brush and it does all the work. The Oral-B doesn&#x27;t work in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sanitizer is also a major plus as I feel like I&#x27;m always using a clean brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush six months ago on recommendation of my dentist. It didn&#x27;t matter how much I brushed or flossed, I was still having issues. So, I broke down and decided to spend the money. Today, I went to my 6 month check up and the hygienist barely had to do anything. She said I was doing an excellent job. I am so happy because I&#x27;ve had already a couple of oral surgeries and sure don&#x27;t want to go through it again. Spending $150 now, will potentially save me thousands in surgery. Best purchase ever!</li>
            <li> A SonicCare toothbrush is definitely a change from a normal brushing. It is at first a bit hard and surprising to use for people not accustom to it / first try - especially, if other parts than the bristle touches your teeth, the sensation is close to a drilling machine at the dentists (so avoid contact of the brush plastic extender with your enamel). When handled properly, the end result is a definite fresh and crisp feel: your teeth feel super-smooth and this, in a few mnts of handling (a result you cannot achieve in the same amount of time with a standard brush). I use the timer and it tells me when to change area. However, set it to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; as the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode was far too strong and may get your gum to bleed. Other than that, I have not used my regular brush since I purchased this item (it is more efficient to use the Sonic). The battery charge last about a week unplugged for a normal usage (2/3 times a day brushing). Finally, use the small brush: I was tempted to use the largest one being accustom to standard tooth brush but the smaller one is best fit for electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I received this product faster than anticipated and so far it has worked well. We&#x27;ll see what the results are during my next dentist visit.</li>
            <li> I had the original sonicare which served me well for many years till the electronics quit.    Got this new flexcare but I am disappointed.  First of all it is not as vigorous a vibration as the original so it does not feel like it is cleaning as well.    That is not the worst part though.  There is a defect.  Perhaps just mine or perhaps systemic.  If I press more that just a little the vibration stops.  Sometimes I barely put any pressure at all.  It has gotten worse over time.  I can get around it by putting my finger on the back of the brush stem so it does not move back and press up against whatever it is inside that stops the.  These things are sealed so I don&#x27;t want to crack the thing open and try fix it.    Considering how much I paid for this model I am very disappointed.  My recommendation is to get the less expensive models.  Either the one that takes the same brush heads or the one that uses the screw on angled brush head.  The multiple settings, buttons, and LED&#x27;s on this thing are just useless gimmicks IMHO.  I guarantee you the only setting you need and will use is the normal one!    The UV sanitizer is perhaps a bit more useful but still not necessary.    One other thing with sonicare in general.  You have to buy the expensive sonicare replacement heads and these heads are designed to not last too long.  The newer ones even more so IMHO.  The razor manufacturers play the same tricks but I digress.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I have just had them cleaned by a dental hygienist everytime I brush with my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  I also like the sanitizing attachment, instead of just shoving it in a drawer and hoping it stays clean.  After reading that flushing a toilet can spray water particles 6 feet, I like my toothbrush in a covered sanitizer!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY IT ! The Sonicare toothbrush is good, but THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS !    Bought one in Dec 2009 for $100+, and the shaft went bad 2 months ago, shaking very badly. Called up Sonic Care Customer Service. They confirmed it&#x27;s still under warranty, sent me a replacement unit, and asked me to sent the defective one back in the same box, and I did.    This replacement brush stops working today, after only 2 months of use. It just hums but does not vibrate when turned on.    Called Customer Service, and they REFUSED to replace this replacement unit that they just sent me 2 months ago, claiming that the 8-digit number on its bottom (08-08-28, I guess for Aug. 28, 2008) shows that is out of warranty.    Asked to speak to a supervisor, and got Corey R. on the line. Cory confirmed that \\&quot;080828\\&quot; means that this replacement unit came from a production batch of hundreds of brushes made on Aug. 28, 2008.    I asked Corey why they replaced a defective unit under warranty with one that was made in Aug. 2008, that goes out within 2 months, and for which they refuse to replace because it&#x27;s out of warranty.     He said they normally don&#x27;t do that. But he doesn&#x27;t have the records of the replacement unit they sent me.    He still refuses to replace the \\&quot;replacement unit\\&quot; because it is itself out of warranty now ! Don&#x27;t you love this warped and amazing logic?    Morale of the story? Decent but EXPENSIVE brushes AND VERY LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE who replaces defective products with OLD products that crap out soon afterward! For which they refuse to replace, because the replacement itself is now out of warranty ! So you have to shell out $100 for a new one !    Not only am I NOT buying another expensive Sonicare brush, am making sure that I get this message out far and wide on the Web to alert other consumers.    No longer using Sonicare in Houston ;-)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It is the second one I purchsed. The original toothbrush lasted form many years and provided excellent checkups. I even take it with me on vacations.</li>
            <li> if you have ever used a regular electronic toothbrush, this is 10x that.  the whole head vibrates, so it is very difficult to get used to.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month and I&#x27;m just beginning to use it more than once a day because it almost tickles your mouth TOO much.  If I knew how it would have been, I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten this one.</li>
            <li> I have never had a Sonicare toothbrush that didn&#x27;t break down.  The first one I had was an older model with the cup tops, it broke down in the second year.  My wife&#x27;s Sonicare of the same model broke down within the first year. Last September I bought the newer model, Sonicare Flexcare, with the UV light; it broke down in less than one year.  The price was $126.  A replacement tooth brush is about $10 [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]].  Kinda high.  There is no excuse for such appliances that quickly break down, particularly at their high cost. (Is this truly planned obsolescence?) The batteries are not removable and they are likely the cause of the problem that Sonicare has yet to address. Since the last Sonicare broke down within one year of purchase, I called their customer support and they are sending me a replacement handle. I would not buy this product again and I am looking for a lower cost replacement electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Sonicare that suddenly died so I knew what I was getting: an exceptional toothbrush that cleans your teeth way better than a manual one does.  My dentist  recommended the Sonicare  over other electric toothbrushes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the others aren&#x27;t as good.  I have no hard data that this the Sonic system  is better than other pricey electric ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all I wanted was a toothbrush, and one that took the same brush head as my old one did as I have 4 unused brush heads bought as replacements for both my husband and me.  The only model that my replacement brush heads would fit is the one with the \\&quot;sanitizer,\\&quot; which I think is entirely unnecessary and which,  of course, added to the price of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips makes different style brush heads for different models of their Sonic care system.  It seems to me to be a way of making people buy new replacement brushes when their old ones get worn.  You have to be very careful when buying a Sonicare of any model to replace an old one.  If you aren&#x27;t, you may well end up having to throw away any replacement brushes you already have.  Since they don&#x27;t specify names or types of brush heads, you have to examine the pictures closely to figure out which brush heads each model requires.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few month ago and use it every day. People have noticed my smile is brighter and ask what I&#x27;m doing to my teeth. When people see it in my bathroom I get lots of questions about it! Yes! It removes stains! Yes it makes your teeth feel like that just-went-to-the-dentist feel. I love the attached sanitizer, as I am somewhat of a germaphobe! Ive heard the les expensive brand will do the trick, I can imagine so. I think your paying for the santizer and fancy settings, which are convenient! (timer, max clean, go clean, etc</li>
            <li> My son in law asked for this for his birthday.  I thought I might have gotten him something a little more exciting but this is what he wanted.  He just loves it!</li>
            <li> This is maybe the 4th Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned. They&#x27;ve all been great. I&#x27;ve replaced them with newer models as the batter died. This is the latest in that chain and continues to improve this excellent product.     It&#x27;s worth mentioning that, although my teeth \\&quot;feel\\&quot; much better after brushing with a Sonicare, the evidence suggests they are no better than manual brushing: [...]    Regardless I&#x27;m a customer for life, it&#x27;s a cheap luxury.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought! The first one was great! So good that now two other people I know have one from me! When you go to a detist &amp; get your teeth cleaned? How really clean your mouth feels? Well that&#x27;s what the Sonicare does each time you brush! The toothbrush is informative too! Three green/yellow LEDs keep track of the battery power level. You have various cleaning modes too! A very well thought out toothbrush. The ultrasonic brushing cleans everything clean. You mouth would only feel cleaner if a professional had just cleaned it! The quality of the equipment is excellent. None of the cheap made-in-China-construction. Carefully crafted to give you best qualitity instrument. A beautiful blend of electronics &amp; well thought out dental health. Well worth the money. Only complaint is why are the toothbrushes so very expensive? Don&#x27;t see any constructon in them that justifys the nosebleed price. They do work excellently, however is Philips really making an outrageious profit on them? All-in-all a product well worth using if you want to keep your teeth really clean!</li>
            <li> No matter the product, it is only as good as the Customer Care behind it.  Even the best of products occasionally have a quality issue, i.e. the proverbial \\&quot;Lemon\\&quot;.  Rest at ease, your oddarid having a trouble free products are very good since I am the one who received the rare troubled Flexcare toothbrush.  It simply ceased to work on 2 occasions within the first 18 months.  No problem, the remedy was immediate and very much to my satisfaction.  Therefore, despite the inconvenience, I can \\&quot;wax eloquently\\&quot; about the excellent customer care I received.  Aside from all of that, it is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have had one before, but the brush would not stay on the handle, so it was time to order another.  I love this brush and the options it has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these over the years. An innovative and terrific design and product. Consumer Reports gave it and the Rotary  thumbs up. I bought the rotary Braum for a test. Forget it. CR missed this one by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The one I have now is a HX6932 with the sealed top to keep the crud out. It broke outside of warranty so I bought a new one. For a tool that&#x27;s used 2-3 times a day I&#x27;m a happy camper. My shop tools should be this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So I cut it open for a post mortem exam. A tiny screw came loose that clamps the vibrating steel brush rod to the guts. This is a fix for broken units where the steel brush post wobbles around only! Drill a 3/16\\&quot; hole in the case 1.5\\&quot; below the end of the steel brush rod. The on/off switch is facing you. Get a tube of Locktite blue from your local auto parts supply store and put a drop on the loose Phillips screw before re- installing. Then plug the hole with Goop marine glue from Lowes. Good as new.er I hope.No warranty here especially if your clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Everybody write Phillips service and tell them to have their China supplier use Locktite. I have no connection with Locktite. I&#x27;m just an Engineer. Actually using a screw for this ap is totally STUPID.Lots of ways to do this at half the manufacturing cost. I think an ex GM engineer designed this part. At least it sure looks like their work. Did marketing do this on purpose to sell more units? ? Hmmm.</li>
            <li> The handle stopped working about a year after I purchased it.  Philips sent a replacement.  That stopped working just after the warranty for the original handset expired (they don&#x27;t reset the warranty after they send you a new defective handset) and they told me there was nothing they could do.  So I spent $176 plus the cost of replacement brushes on 2 defective handsets and they don&#x27;t even have the courtesy to reset the warranty for a new device.  Pathetic.</li>
            <li> We purchased this toothbrush in March 2010 and in April 2012 had the problem I&#x27;ve read about in other reviews -- the metal shaft that the brush heads attach to became loose, causing a really loud noise when operating the toothbrush.  We didnt notice any lessening of brushing quality, but did start thinking of buying a new one.  Just the handle is almost $100 and we assumed we&#x27;d just missed the 2-year warranty ..... Still, I called Philips customer care number (800-682-7664) just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And guess what?  Because we had registered the product, we have an extra 6 months on the warranty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips sent a replacement handle right out (they do send a prepaid label and ask you to mail back the old one) and we got to keep the $130 we were about to shell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and will continue.  This is a really good model and compared to the older Elite:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Slimmer&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaner head replacement (just the tip of the brush now)&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive mode&lt;br /&gt;- Sanitizer on base to eliminate bacteria&lt;br /&gt;- 2 week charge (great for vacations in Europe when charging is an issue - my old one only charged for 48hours I think!)&lt;br /&gt;- Great customer service from Philips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- expensive replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;- these toothbrushes don&#x27;t seem to last much beyond 2 years anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall definitely worth the great cleaning you get.  Though there are some good combo packages on the Elite through Costco (with extra handles and bases), for us it is worth staying with the newer model for the additional modes and features, and the gunk-free head replacements!</li>
            <li> Great product, much better than the Braun. I am happy that I made the switch. The dentist was impressed with the results too.</li>
            <li> I have owned four Sonicare toothbrushes over many years.  First the original I picked up in the early 90&#x27;s.  Lasted for many years, actually cracked on the threads in 1996 and was replaced for free, I paid a nominal s/h charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to get the new model with the smaller head design around 2003/2004 so I gave my dad the original one, which he still uses today!  After about two or three years the new model simply wouldn&#x27;t charge.  Was told it probably had water damage and was out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked up a another new one around 2006.  In 2009 that one stopped taking a charge.  I was offered nothing from customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this model in 2009 and now it has stopped taking a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two had the exact same problem.  First it started turning itself on randomly.  If you ever turned this on with the cover in place and sitting on the counter in a hotel room it is a little startling at four am.  This continued until battery was fully discharged and then will not accept a new charge.  The first one to suffer this fate I had stored on the charger every day. The most recent one I decided maybe that was the problem so I only charged when battery got low.  Same end result.  Again I get the water damage/out of warranty line from customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a toothbrush goes they are the best.  This model has a great design and really gets your teeth clean.  The UV cleaner is gimmicky.  Used it a few times but noticed it increases bristle wear and they aren&#x27;t cheap. Different modes do nothing for me personally.  Like the travel charger base as I travel alot and often for more than two weeks at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orginal one that still works 20 years later, was not a Philips product.  My history coincides with great product and customer service until Philips buys them out.  I simply cannot believe that 20 years later we have gone backwards in rechargable battery technology.  Maybe they have a marketing plan toforce consumers to buy a new one every few years.  Great for Philips bottom line, not great for the consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what am I going to do?  Love the benefits of using the Sonicare but do I want to shell out $$ every three years.  Philips has definetly found a way to make money on this product!  I will be ordering the easy clean for $60 soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I rate this?  Well, the brush is clearly five stars.  Philips would get zero stars but I still love Sonicare toothbrushes, so I settled on four stars.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist and they recommended this product to me.  I thought I was really brushing my teeth until I used this product.  My mouth is healthier and the sanitizer is great.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but at least it is as good as described here in Amazon.com; the only reason I give it only four stars is that I&#x27;m still waiting for the advertised $40 coupon from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicare Flexcare brush for only 3 weeks, my dentist was astounded by the improvement in my gums just in a one month period.  He had recommended the Flexcare, even though I was using another well known electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;m certainly glad I switched.  It&#x27;s easier to use, my teeth and gums feel cleaner, stains are gone and it is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush - boy do I wish I knew then what I know now!  I have some pretty deep pockets and I know if I had been using this toothbrush they wouldn&#x27;t be so deep.  My teeth feel as clean as they do when the dentist does them!</li>
            <li> Thanks to my dentist for having one of these in his waiting room for his patients to play around with.    He also uses one at his home so he assured me that with my sensitive teeth I would have no problems. I could always use the sensitive setting or even the massage one.      I love it! My teeth feel like I have just had them cleaned at my dentists office. No sensitivity problems. It is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush I had a different electric toothbrush before this is by far the best one i&#x27;ve used.  You get the feeling of going to the dentist for a teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  My teeth are so clean feeling and shiney.  I am sorry I didn&#x27;t get one sooner.  I love the timer on it so I know I am brushing as long as I should be and the different levels of time.  Super easy to use and I am a small person and the full size heads are not too big for my mouth.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how happy this has made me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Talk about cleaning your teeth, this is the \\&quot;bee&#x27;s knees\\&quot; as they say.  Honestly, I am very please with it at this point.  I love the UV sanitizer as well... an excellent concept! I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, this is a great product.  I purchased it a few weeks ago to replace an approximately 2-year old Sonicare elite that my cleaning lady threw in the garbage. :rolleyes:  I like the new style brush heads -- easy to snap on/off (2 of us share the brush) and they don&#x27;t build up all the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; of the older version.  Battery seems to last much, much longer.  I use the UV sanitizer about once a week; I have no problem getting the two brush heads (both large) in place.  I have no idea how well it sanitizes, though; I&#x27;m not a chemistry lab.    Now to the reason for the 3* review.  The product gets dinged one star for a design flaw -- the mode setting button is poorly positioned so that my finger inadvertently changes the mode while I am in the middle of brushing.  So all of a sudden the vibration diminishes, and then it will go to \\&quot;massage\\&quot; mode, which is a lower frequency pulsing.  I&#x27;ve tried holding the brush differently, but it&#x27;s not comfortable.  The button should be disabled while the brush is in operation, if not moved to a different location on the handle.      I&#x27;ve also dinged the product one star for what I feel is sham marketing by Philips.  When I first purchased my Sonicare elite several years ago, they said to replace the heads every 6 months.  Then at some point, all of a sudden, they&#x27;re telling you to replace them every three months.  Has the workmanship gotten that shoddy?  Has some major study come out telling everyone to replace their brush every three months?  No, it&#x27;s just a ploy to sell more brushes, I imagine the margins are *very* high on the replacement heads. I doubt they cost more than a dollar to manufacture.  (To be fair, I doubt Philips is the only one who has done this -- Arm &amp; Hammer does it on their baking soda boxes as well, now you&#x27;re supposed to put a new box in the fridge every 30 days -- used to be every 90 days.  Ugh.)  But in any event, I&#x27;m not falling for this, and I feel the companies should be held accountable.  Somy part is to lower the rating by one star...</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I replaced another Sonicare with this one because the old one was dying.  This one had the sterilization feature that I wanted as well as two heads.  It works great for my husband and I.  I like the quick 1 minute cycle for a quick brush.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> After having used 2 other models for a couple years each and then breaking, I was a little nervous about spending a lot of money on their top model.  I have to admiot it was worth it and this is better than the 2 older models I had because it has a slimmer brush wand and also has speeds settings to chose from.  I wish the brushes were a little less expensive, but I would still buy again.</li>
            <li> I really wonder if these are good for your gums. I suspect they are not. I stopped using mine when I got a horrible check up</li>
            <li> I have tried the Oral B electric toothbrush in the past but never really liked it.  It was messy and didn&#x27;t seem worth the bother.  My periodontist recommended the Sonicare, so I gave in and bought one.  Wow, when I&#x27;m done brushing with the Sonicare, my whole mouth feels intensely clean and my teeth are as smoothly polished as they get after a cleaning at the dentist.  It&#x27;s a night and day difference from the Oral B.  Yes, electric toothbrushes are by nature messy, but this one is worth the bother.</li>
            <li> In the past, I used an Oral-B electric toothbrush, and I liked it quite a bit when I first got it.  It cleaned better than a plain toothbrush, and did a lot of the work for me.  I also used a Crest Spinbrush, and didn&#x27;t really find it to be nearly as good as the Oral-B.  It served its purpose, but it only did a moderate cleaning.  There wasn&#x27;t enough power to really get a great cleaning from it.    Then my dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare line of toothbrushes.  After looking at them, I decided on the FlexCare w/ UV Sanitizer for three reasons:  1) lots of cleaning options, 2) comes with two brush heads, 3) UV sanitizer.  (I guess you could also say the reviews and dentist&#x27;s recommendation played a role in the choice, too.)    I had no idea how well this brush would work until I first tried it.  Talk about a HUGE difference!  It&#x27;s not a cheap spinning brush head, it&#x27;s just vibration.  You may not think that some simple vibration will clean well.  But MAN does it work!  (This is similar to the sonic cleaners they use for jewelry and such, except for your teeth.)  With the FlexCare, I don&#x27;t work nearly as hard as I did with either of my other brushes, and I get a MUCH better cleaning from it.  This is one incredible brush!  Oh, and that tingly feeling in your lips and gums is kinda weird at first, but you&#x27;ll learn to love it pretty quickly.  It&#x27;s the feeling of \\&quot;clean\\&quot;!  And once I&#x27;m done, I pop the brush head into the sanitizer for a nice, clean brush the next time I use it.    I haven&#x27;t made too much use of all of the cleaning modes.  I regularly use the standard \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, which is good for everyday use.  I tried out the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; mode, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  It gives you more time to massage your gums or clean additional places, I guess.  I&#x27;ll probably never use the 1-minute \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; option, but it&#x27;s nice to have if you&#x27;re strict about brushing after meals and take the brush with you on the go.  I have not tried the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; option.    I like that the brush heads don&#x27;t twist to lock onto the brush.  You just push them down until they slide right onto it.  Great design.  And the brush heads are long enough to keep gunk and toothpaste suds from making their way between the head and the base.  I&#x27;ve yet to really clean between there at all, as it doesn&#x27;t need it.    Last, but not least, I love the little things on this brush.  I like the battery level indicator.  My Oral-B never had one, so I only knew if it was running low when it would slow down.  Now I know how much battery I have left.  (Not that I think I&#x27;ll ever come close to draining it.)  It comes with a soft travel case for keeping the brush and heads in, and a includes compact charger for travel that doesn&#x27;t have the sanitizer.  (An extra charger!  Sweet!)  The main unit has a rubberized handle grip to help you hold onto it with wet hands so it won&#x27;t slip.  And a 2-year warranty is nice.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll last much longer than that!    Bottom line:  This is quite possibly the most awesome toothbrush ever invented!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to anything else.  It&#x27;s THAT awesome.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our hygenist. Since my husband and I have both had sinus infections this winter, the sanitizer has been wonderful. you can make sure your brushes are clean and sanitized and will not transfer germs back into your mouth. As for the Sonic toothbrush, it makes my teeth feel cleaner than they have ever been. My teeth are very close together and I am unable to get between them. With the Sonicare food stuck between my teeth comes out with no problem.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush back in 2007.  The first two years it worked fine, but then all of sudden the brush heads started slipping off of the brush into my mouth. So I bought replacement heads (for way too much money)and the same happened with those three.  I assumed after two years it was broken so I bought a new one.  For the first three months it worked fine.  Then, again, the brush heads started to slide off again.  Again, I bought the replacement pack of heads.  They all started to slide off. The second one in my pack CHIPPED MY TOOTH.   So now I figured I had a serious problem here.  I called customer support to see what the problem was.  They told me that miraculously I was the only person who had ever contacted that particular support staff with the brush head problem.  That I was the reason stating that I was taking off and replacing the brush heads incorrectly.  How can that be if they only fit on one way?   She said if I had kept my receipt then they could move the case to the escalation team.  Sadly, not thinking I was going to have problems with a $100 toothbrush, I didn&#x27;t keep it.  My mistake.  I trusted a multi-million dollar corporation and it&#x27;s product to stand behind said product.  Oh well, I would recommend a safer $15 spin-brush.  At least those won&#x27;t fly off into your mouth.  Or, buy a $3 regular brush.  It was good enough for generations before us!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 5 years now and am currently on my 3rd brush now with the Flexcare(For the record, I replaced my last 2 brushes due to upgrades, not product failure.) That being said, this one is by far my favorite for one VERY important reason - NO MORE GUNK in the brush heads.      I have been relcutantly cleaning my Sonicare heads thoroughly after each use for years now, and still managed to get mold etc in them.  No more with this brush!  The head has been completely redesigned (even though the brush portion itself is basically the same) and no longer requires daily \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; to keep it clean.  For this reason alone, the brush is definitely worth the price.  Outside of the new design, the brush has a few new features, but nothing too noteworthy in my opinion.  The new brush head design is what really makes this brush better than their other offerings.</li>
            <li> GREAT NEW PRODUCT, PHILLIPS HAS ADDRESSED PROBLEM WITH EARLIER MODELS THAT IS KEEPING IT CLEAN. STILL VAGUE ON WHERE TO PURCHASE REPLACEMENT BRUSHES AND I&#x27;M NOT SURE A MODEL NUMBER HAS BEEN ASSIGNED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to add to what others have said, but go into any store that sells Sonicare toothbrushes and you will immediately see that this model is much slimmer and more comfortable to hold. The brushes are slimmer, too, and the unit just has a nice, futuristic look to it. It also comes with a travel charger and a nice carry case, including plastic covers for the brushes.    I was using a Braun electric toothbrush, and it was still running well when my dentist recommended I switch over to the Sonicare.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to note whether it&#x27;s a lot better, but it is a lot more invigorating and I have a feeling my next visit to the dentist will be much better.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I just got this toothbrush and I can&#x27;t believe how great my teeth feel.  They are as smooth as they are when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office!    The vibrations were a little weird at first but they&#x27;re pretty easy to get used to.  The sanitizer is a great feature too.  The germs in the bathroom give me the heeby geeby&#x27;s (sp?) so I like having the toothbrush head locked away in the sanitizer with the UV light blasting away the germs.      If you haven&#x27;t tried an electric or sonic toothbrush before, you really have to try this.  You won&#x27;t believe the difference it can make - I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for over a decade now.  No complaints about the performance of this product, just the short lifetime.  I had previously owned the larger models (now called Essence), and each lasted around 5 years.  When the last of these died, I decided to upgrade to the newer FlexCare model.  It&#x27;s lighter weight and extra modes were great.  But it has now died on me, just one month after surpassing the 2-year warranty.  Disappointingly short lifetime for the price of this model.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Sonicare, but will try the lower priced R710 -- same lightweight design &amp; ProResults brushes as the FlexCare, but under $100 (of course, you lose the extra modes, but I can live with that).</li>
            <li> Best option for healthcare thats been released yet.  Compared to any other toothbrush/sonicare, this toothbrush really just takes care of business.  Try out Maxcare and you will see...</li>
            <li> My teeth feel polished all day long. Sure it is a bit noisy, but the smart timer makes it impossible to brush incorrectly. My gums are now extremely healthy, and I don&#x27;t expect any cavities in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed in the nonreplaceable battery. I feel as this is built in obsolescence. Was it not enough to buy a $200 toothbrush and $25 3 pack of heads every so often? This could have been avoided, but then Phillips would be losing $ on the next brush we buy.</li>
            <li> This is the best oral hygiene you can buy without going to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Brushing your teeth with this thing is like going in for a routine cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;After use I feel like my teeth are smooth as glass. My dentist recommended this; and after a follow-up I was told my teeth were very clean + plaque free. I find this product 100% worth my dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV sanitizer is a fantastic breakthrough idea for the toothbrush as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy any Sonicare model, buy the FlexCare.</li>
            <li> Just had a 6 month dental check-up and the dental hygienist noted an overall improvement since I began using the Sonic Flexcare Toothbrush.[[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]] My teeth are whiter, gums are healthier, and she noted an overall improvement in tooth enamel.    The battery lasts for days before recharging which makes it nice for traveling; but, also included, is a small recharger to take on longer trips.     This product has made such a big improvement in my dental health that I plan to purchase one for each of my adult sons.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is absolutely amazing! Various modes are convenient and effective! In a hurry? Select \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; for a quick yet thorough cleaning! Charges fast! Relatively quiet! I expected a loud buzzing but no, it&#x27;s not loud at all.     Buy this now! It will change your life!</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this Sonicare toothbrush.  Good reports from my hygienist since using this electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but seems to do a good job.  It helps you reach the two minute brushing goal.  Will have to wait until the next cleaning to determine if it has prevented the build up of plaque.   It uses less toothpaste and after brushing you teeth seem really clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product. I am amazed how easy this toothbrush is to use. The impressive part of this product is the ultrasound cleaning of the brush itself!  The best product by far.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, the &#x27;soniccare&#x27; experience is far above any brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can honestly say that I can feel the difference this toothbrush made versus my old (non sonic) electric toothbrush.  My dentist recommended that I get a sonic toothbrush since I have mild gingivitis.  When I went back 2 months later she said that things were looking better.  I believe the toothbrush made a big difference.     My only criticism is in regards to the price.  I think some of the less expensive soniccare toothbrushes would do just as good of a job at a lower cost.  The UV cleaner is fine.  It&#x27;s easy to use but I&#x27;ve never had an issue in the previous 28 years when I didn&#x27;t UV clean my brushes.  I never use the additional settings that the brush offers either.  You can set it to either the normal &#x27;clean&#x27; setting, &#x27;sensitive&#x27;, or &#x27;massage&#x27;.  There&#x27;s also another setting for &#x27;go care&#x27;, or &#x27;max care&#x27;.  I can&#x27;t remember what go care does but the max care sets the toothbrush for a normal 2 minute clean as well as a 1 minute gum massage setting.    In summary, if you want all of the additional features it&#x27;s a fantastic toothbrush and probably worth the additional price to you.  If you want a straightforward toothbrush without all of the settings or cleaner I think you could save some money and get one of the other soniccare brushes.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was to replace our original Sonicare that lasted for 14 years! This model is lighter in weight,sleek works very well and you know the brush heads are sanitary every time you use it! We love it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush.  It is easy to use and does a great job cleaning my teeth while stimulating my gums!</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for 10 years.  After the battery died, I read the Amazon reviews  before making my recent purchase.  The FlexCare 900 Series Sonicare was a perfect selection for me.  The FlexCare multiple cleaning choices, the sealed brush/unit connection and brush cleaning system are  excellent feature improvements. The operation noise is minor compared to my older model.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist; saved $30 over other online sources.  Got here in just a few days.  A great product that actually has us brushing more than ever.</li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare FlexCare.  My teeth feel very clean after brushing - just like I&#x27;ve left the dental office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s hygenist recommended this toothbrush to me at the end of last year. It took me until June to buy it and then until just a couple of weeks ago to actually start using it. Well, it&#x27;s fantastic and I can&#x27;t write enough superlatives about it. Just don&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy it and use it!</li>
            <li> it does good job BUT the control buttons are too easy to press accidentally. they should have left room for your fingers to wrap around the handle while brushing. the attached sanitizer does not clean like i would have imagined. it is iffy at best.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare brushes for years and love them.  My wife decided to get me their newest model. The thing looked great, felt good in my hand and seemed powerful enough to do the job.  I liked the option to be able to set it on max care to get the teeth done and the gums massaged.  The go care option seemed to make sense for the quickie midday brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the design flaw.  The switch to change the brushing options is right where anyone with a good sized hand is going to hold the thing.  I NEVER get through a brushing without changing the setting from clean to sensitive (which my teeth definitely aren&#x27;t).  So I have to stop the thing and reset it.  Worse still is that the switch is sizable and takes  almost no pressure to actuate.  Worse still is that you have to switch it through four options to get it back to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you spend the small fortune to buy one of these, try to find one you can hold in your hand.  You can hold it at the very end and not have this problem but that feels awkward to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may go back to my old one and ditch this.</li>
            <li> I used Braun electric for a year, and there is no comparison. The Sonicare is the very best. The way the brush is designed helps also. Your teeth feel so clean, and you get better dental visits.</li>
            <li> Great product.  We both love it.  It is a pleasure not to have to clean the olds.  Like the options on it as well, though sometime you can hit one of the options by mistake.</li>
            <li> The FlexCare works fantastically. My teeth have felt cleaner and looked whiter consistently since I began using this brush. I&#x27;m not sure that the UV sanitizer is all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, but it is reassuring that when I&#x27;m sick I (theoretically) don&#x27;t have to worry about replacing the toothbrush heads.     I don&#x27;t use the massage setting much, and never use the sensitive setting. When I want to use the massage setting, though, it is nice to have. The power behind the brush on the normal setting and the massage setting is really great. The brush feels like you are in control of it, more so than the bulkier versions I&#x27;ve had in the past.    Really, I can&#x27;t recommend this brush highly enough. Sonicare changed the way I brush my teeth so much that I could hardly survive with a manual brush. This brush is another step up, and I don&#x27;t know that I could ever go back to the Elite models after using it.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was the IntelliClean model. I hated it. It was huge for one thing, like holding a tree limb. I could never find replacement heads or the toothpaste that was supposed to go in it either (not even at the Wal Mart I bought it at!) except online.     This however, is an exceptional toothbrush. I love it. Sorry Amazon but I bought it new on Ebay for $109 after shipping. It&#x27;s very small and not near the hassle to keep clean like my other one was. I&#x27;m still experimenting with the different cleaning modes but I really like the variety offered, particularly the massage mode. I also love the fact that it came with one large brush head and an addititonal small one that I can reach the backs of my back teeth with. I really like the idea of the UV cleaner too. I hope it is working but it at least gives me some piece of mind that I won&#x27;t be having a bunch of flu germs procreating on my toothbrush ; )</li>
            <li> Great product, the Dentist likes my teeth and asked me what toothbrush I was using.  I have used Sonicare for over a decade.  My third Sonicare toothbrush.  I like the new cleaning compartment.</li>
            <li> Like others, I have been a Sonicare user for years and years. After owning the FlexCare for about a year, the vibration and noise got increasingly worse, and then the metal post encased in a rubber sleeve finally broke, rendering the brush head inoperable. Philips sent another.  Approximately 8 months later, same thing. They shipped another.  I am now about to experience the exact same thing -- the head is vibrating wildly and making horrible noise.  I can tell the metal post is about to give way again. I guess I will make another support plea and see if they keep sending a new unit. My husband and I use the unit twice a day, meaning at least 4 brush head changes per day.  Apparently the toothbrush cannot handle this.  It&#x27;s a shame, because it really is a great toothbrush when new.  When I needed a new toothbrush for our cabin, I decided against the FlexCare and just purchased an Elite. Much cheaper and none of the headaches.    UPDATE:  July 2, 2010 -- yes, Phillips/Sonicare did, yet again, replace the failing FlexCare that I spoke of in my initial review.  Now, the 3rd (or is the 4th) unit is experiencing the exact same problem yet again -- the metal shaft seeming to come apart inside the rubber sleeve.  When you go to remove the brush head, the rubber sleeve turns into Gumby and s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-s out until the head finally comes loose.    So, I go to the Phillips/Sonicare website and log in and report another failed unit; however, now there is no email support; you must call in.  No problem.  So today I call, and they tell me that the problem is MY fault -- that this toothbrush is not built to withstand frequent head changing.  HUH?  He said it&#x27;s my fault, because my husband and I change out the heads each twice a day so that we can both use the toothbrush.  Why, then, do they provide different colored rings for the brush heads?  I thought this was so that Mom, Dad, SuzieQ and Little Johnny could all use it?  Nope.  He said he could send me a $15 rebate coupon ifI could send him the original purchase receipt.  Wow.  His solution was that we each need our own FlexCare toothbrushes and not remove the heads so frequently.  Great.  Not a viable option when they are so expensive to begin with.      Bottom line:  great toothbrush; nothing beats it, but be prepared to replace it frequently, as its lifespan is less than one year, if you intend to use it between/among more than one family member.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this new sonicare, I loved it!  I had an older model, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. The different modes are nice, too.  The smaller brush size (sold separately) works better, especially for the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Then, it broke.  Just sputtered on and off, no matter how many buttons I pushed, or curse words I called it.  I hadn&#x27;t returned anything before on Amazon, and was dreading the process, putting it off for a few days.  Brushed my teeth with my finger. The wife and kid had a backup toothbrush, but I&#x27;d used mine to clean my rims. Great. However, once I sent the intent to return, in hours a new one was on it&#x27;s way.  Made it to the house faster than the first one.  I noticed a couple of days after that Amazon had found problems with the first shipment.&lt;br /&gt;My second one has been going strong for a couple of months now, and still doing great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I splurged on this purchase--I replaced an older sonicare toothbrush I had, and the technolgy of the FlexCare has been much improved.  My teeth feel smooth and clean just like after a dental visit &amp; are noticably whiter.  My teeth even feel cleaner all day long.  Treat yourself--and SMILE!</li>
            <li> It easy to use, once you read the Manual, but be careful not to push it hard against your teeth and gum.  The stem of the brush is \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; that its older model.  When it comes to noise, yes it is noisier than the previous model.  I hope the noise means more effective vibrations that break down the plaque.</li>
            <li> I received one of these for Christmas from my best friend, and I swear I will never go back to a normal toothbrush. The Sonicare does the work for you, times you so you can cheat or skimp, and gets my teeth cleaner then I&#x27;ve ever seen or felt. In fact, I&#x27;ve been a smoker most of my life and a heavy black tea drinker, and the Sonicare has removed all stains from my teeth. I love brushing with this so much, I regularly use the \\&quot;pro-clean\\&quot; timer, and still could keep brushing! Get one now!</li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare FlexCare. It is much easier to hold than my old Sonicare toothbrush. I also like that the beep for the QuadPacer is louder, so that I don&#x27;t have to listen as carefully to tell when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> I hate manually brushing my teeth. However I dont mind now since I have one of the best electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The product was just as advertised.  Makes a big difference in my daily routine.  Can&#x27;t wait for my next check up to see how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> I think it is great.  I feel like I have had my teeth cleaned at the dentist every time I brush.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my peridontist.  Great product, helps keep teeth and gums clean and in good condition.  Speed feature great for sensitive gums.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I just upgraded from the Sonicare Elite which I&#x27;ve had for several years.  I chose this model because of the redesigned handle and the sanitizer.  The design of the handle and the way the head/brush attach is greatly improved over the Elite.  Now there is no place for water to collect under the brush and no where for nasty goo to form.  It also has several new features including a massage function and the UV sanitizer.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews on here that claim this brush is louder than other Sonicare models but coming from the Elite I think that this one is actually quieter.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and I would highly recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best investment I ever made in a toothbrush.  I had the original Sonicare but it eventually died and I bought a Braum.  Let me just say that it was like brushing my teeth with a rock.  The brush was so hard and the noise unbearable.  Also, the charging unit was big a bulky and I spent around $100.00 for it.  After two weeks, I could not stand it anymore, my teeth hurt and I took the entire thing and threw it in the trash.  I was reluctant to spend this much on another toothbrush, but being that I loved my old Sonicare so much I went for this model as it has the massage feature for the gums (love this!!). The model is lightweight, not too noisy, sleek and small rechargable unit.  Also, there are a few modes to use (extensive brushing, quick, sensitive, etc.) and it is so simple and easy to use (I am no good at reading and following directions).  If I could give this 50 starts I would.  Love it, need I say more?</li>
            <li> You have to know why your gum is bleeding first, if it&#x27;s plaque, check that you eat healthy diet, that&#x27;s also another reason to get plaque growing and is not told in the commercial advertisements. Make sure you eat enough green vegetables and fruits. Then this instrument will work just fine for you.</li>
            <li> Long time user of Sonicare products.  This version is an excellen product with usual home charger, but also comes with smaller charger for travel including a travel container for the brush and portable charger.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is much superior to the Oral-B we phased out.  The Oral-B&#x27;s \\&quot;action\\&quot; was increasingly useless, perhaps because the replacement brush heads were becoming poorer in quality over time.  The Sonicare has a very vigorous, and seemingly very effective, brushing action (the next visit to the dental hygienist will tell the tale).  There is a bit of a hazard, though, in using this machine.  The brush head does move in a very energetic way, and it is made of hard plastic.  When the back of the brush rattles against the other teeth (the ones opposite of the ones you&#x27;re brushing), it is not merely an annoyance, it can chip a crown.  This goes from annoying to expensive in the blink of an eye.  Philips has not taken the design responsibility to put a soft rubber/plastic on the back of the brush head, so you will have to take care on your own.  Another design shortfall is that there are two buttons on the handle of this model: one for on/off; one for \\&quot;mode.\\&quot;  The mode button is actually more readily accessible than the on/off.  As a result, when you are brushing you will often inadvertently change the mode.  Nothing but an annoyance, not nearly at the level of the chipped-crown thing, but it is something that should have been seen to in the design stage.</li>
            <li> The brush works well.  Has several options, including a timer for those who are particular about brushing for the recommended 2-3 minutes.  Quick clean mode for brushing on the go.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush.  Whenever I go to the dentist for a cleaning.. I am always told how clean my teeth are.. I recommend this toothbrush to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and my kids like to use it too.  Definitely is an significant improvement vs. a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my first high-end toothbrush.  Both my wife and I have whiter teeth (after a couple of weeks).  We actually noticed are teeth getting brighter.  After reading a couple of the negative reviews, I learned from their mistakes (I think).  After each use, we rinse the handle and head.  Then, we towel them off.  There is no gunk, no mold, nothing.  My brush head looks brand new after three months of use.  On the downside, it is a bit noisey and tickles a bit too much at firstl.  You do get used to it.  I set mt brush on the MAX CLEAN and it beeps when I am supposed to move to the next section of my teeth.  At the end of the day, I do love it.  Also, let the battery run all the way down, then recharge it.  It will last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare Toothbrush for about a year and I love it.  I was a little hesitant to buy it because of the cost but the sanitizer won me over.  My teeth and gums feel healthier and I really like that I can clean  my toothbrush regularly in the sanitizer. There is room to put 2 toothbrushes in the sanitizer so this works great for 2 people.  The charger does hold a charge for days.  I&#x27;ve often unplugged it and forgot to replug it in for a few days and I&#x27;ve never had the toothbrush quit running.  I&#x27;ve very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was a 4000 series Advance model. That lasted about 3 years before the battery stopped charging.  Then I replaced that with a Sonicare Flexcare which lasted a little over 2 years before it stopped vibrating. I had to resort to manual brushing motions to use it.    Some reviews including Amazon suggests that this is common. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have my reciept and it&#x27;s no longer under warranty.    Should toothbrushing really cost this much? Or are these products still in its developmental stage?    Customer support tells me that there&#x27;s no known issue with these toothbrushes which only means there hasn&#x27;t been any updates or improvements since. So you&#x27;re most likely to run into this same problem with your recent purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Dentist recommended over Braun. We will see at next dental visit.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before so I carefully reviewed all the brands, reader comments, consumer research reviews, etc.  I had settled on the Sonic Elite, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled to hear about the messy part (I planned on buying the silicone cover to help alleviate the problem).  I realized the next evolution of the product was out, and expecting to use the toothbrush for many years to come, decided to pay the extra money for the top of the line version.  Not having used an electric toothbrush before, I expected to be wearing a lot of toothpaste the first not around, but not so.  No problems. The toothbrush is very light and easy to manipulate in the mouth.  I have been using the compact head since I have a small mouth.  Given some of the other review I was somewhat concerned about the noise, but it is not an issue.  It is a low-toned buzz, far quieter than an electric razor.  No one in the next room would even hear it.  My teeth look much whiter, even after the first time (I&#x27;m a coffee, tea, and cola drinker)and they always feel dentist clean.  The Flexcare Sonicare has been a pleasure to use and to keep clean.  I&#x27;ve had it a little over a month and I love it, I would hate to think of ever giving it up.  It is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 2014:  This is still working great, the battery does last as long (New-the battery lasted a little over two weeks.  It is now down to a week).  It looks a little rough (I understand the whitening toothpastes do something to the finish), but the toothbrush still does a terrific job.  I&#x27;m still very satisfied and will definitely purchase a new one when mine ultimately dies.  I think five plus years of daily use is very good.</li>
            <li> OMG!! I have had Sonicare&#x27;s for years.  and everytime one is nearing its end of life, i get another.  This one, by far, beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;it has a toothbrush type for strong or gentle, a massager, and best of all&lt;br /&gt;you sanitize your toothbrush everytime u use it and it sits there till next time...love the product. Will totally recommend it to my Teeth Crazy friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Philips Sonicare fan since I got my first electric tooth brush for aprx $100 (on sale!) at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in 1997! My Series E toothbrush is still going strong and I have never had a single problem with it. I have traveled with it, I have dropped it a thousand times, and for the past couple years I&#x27;ve shared it with my husband (the handle, not the brush, ew). I&#x27;ve used it for nearly 14 years every single day and I&#x27;ve had good oral health for years! I love it! But the overall appearance of my toothbrush was... kind of old, and gross. I was really sick and tired of cleaning the gunk off the base, and from the inside, and in between the dome and the brush stick. UGH! So gross, so done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered getting the [[ASIN:B000AMRII0 Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush]] because of the price. But then I read the review &amp;#34;Pay more for the better design&amp;#34; by College Jane and I decided to go for this one, the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer. &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t really care that I got a sanitizer but I wanted THIS toothbrush - plus, it came with TWO brush heads. It was the best deal since I would&#x27;ve had to get extra replacement heads right away with the Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush. I love the multiple settings! I&#x27;d had oral surgery the week prior to ordering and I was excited to try their Sensitive mode (it&#x27;s great by the way!). I love the thinness and how light it is! Not to mention how quiet it is. It makes brushing much easier and pleasant, especially when you have stitches in your mouth and can barely open your mouth. The GoCare is perfect after meals. My husband loves this upgrade as well. He started sharing my old one over a year ago and his oral health improved immediately! But his favorite things about this new toothbrush? How clean it stays, and the sanitizer. My favorite? How much whiter my teeth are! I can only hope this brush lasts me as long as my old one did (I&#x27;m storing the old one just in case). I do not like the reviews that complain about loose brush heads and dead units within the first year. They don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Dec 2010&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago the toothbrush stopped charging. It made a vibrating/pulsating morse code when I put it on it&#x27;s base to charge. After a week it was dying, and the brushing power was only getting weaker with use. I called the warranty number (1-800-682-7664) and they sent me a new handle (with a new brush head and travel charger included). Super easy. Still, it sucks that I had problems so soon after purchasing it. This can&#x27;t be a good sign. I hope this one lasts longer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10/21/2015&lt;br /&gt;My toothbrush began doing the vibrating pulsing thing again, but this time it was every second or so, for a couple days...then it died and wouldn&#x27;t charge. I called the number above and after a little troubleshooting they were kind enough to offer a replacement even though the warranty was expired by 3 years - just as a one time courtesy! It really made my day! So happy with Phillips customer service! My last brush lasted way many more years and I hope this new replacement will go the distance for another 3-5 years before I have to buy a new one. Love these electric brushes!just in case).

            <li> i love this toothbrush.  i tell everyone i know about it.  my teeth are so super clean, even my dentist said they were the cleanest teeth he&#x27;s seen in a while.  well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this years ago. Was sick of all the cleaning in the dentist&#x27;s chair so got this and it really leaves you with the same feeling as when you come out of the hygienist&#x27;s office.  Has a ramp up feature that will go up to maximum power after two weeks.  My teeth feel incredibly clean!</li>
            <li> Caution if you plan to buy this model. I went through THREE of these over a 14-month period before downsizing to a hopefully sturdier Essence. I will credit the company for customer service (they provided me with free replacements when the first and second models broke down during the year-long warranty) but I knock the FlexCare&#x27;s design for lack of durability. You will know the end is near when you start hearing a loud rattling noise during brushing. A week or so later, the brush no longer works.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Flexcare: The Perfect Toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About six months ago I decided it was about time to upgrade my toothbrush. It had treated me well, but the battery was no longer holding a charge for more than 60 seconds, and the heads were getting harder and harder to track down. Using Google and Amazon, I was quickly able to determine that the heavy hitters in the power toothbrush playing field were the Sonicare Flexcare and the Oral-B Triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare is Sonicare&#x27;s flag-ship model. Earning its moniker from the multiple cleaning modes feature, this lithium battery powered device is the Mercedes of electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, the Triumph is Oral-B&#x27;s \\&quot;Most technologically advanced toothbrush.\\&quot; It&#x27;s claim to fame is what Oral-B calls SmartGuide technology. Wirelessly, it transmits brushing feedback data (pressure, time, etc.) to an LCD screen. A bit over the top? Perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both models offered top-of-the-line features and each had earned near 5-star reviews on Amazon. After reading through some of the reviews and pricing out each model I decided to take one last step before making my final decision: ask my dentist what they recommended. To my surprise they didn&#x27;t have a preference. I was instructed that either model would work great, so long as I brushed at least twice daily and flossed nightly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing the two-handle Sonicare Flexcare bundle with UV sanitizer. One handle for me, one for my girlfriend, and a super cool UV sanitization chamber to play with! Aside from the two handles (handle is really just Sonicare lingo for toothbrush) the box also contained: two travel pouches, one travel charger, and different color rings used to personalize each toothbrush. The colored rings certainly come in handy when two people living in the same household use the same model toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts after six months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent. The Flexcare feels very solid in-hand. The buttons are all sealed, easy to press, and the head slides on and off with little effort. The charging station is fairly compact and interfaces well with the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use:&lt;br /&gt;Pressing the mode select button will move through all available brush modes. Including: quick care, max care, massage, clean, and sensitive. Press the power button (with the toothbrush in your mouth!) and the Flexcare goes to work. After about 30 seconds or so the head will vibrate on and off a few times, this is a signal to move on to another section of your mouth. Sonicare calls this feature \\&quot;Quadpacer\\&quot; and claims it helps promote even cleaning. After two to three minutes the brush shuts itself off and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps you honest. Turn the toothbrush off before the brushing cycle ends and you are only cheating yourself out of a thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple cycles. I tend to use the quick care (one minute) cycle in the mornings and in the evening I switch off between the normal clean cycle (two minutes) and the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; cycle (three minutes).&lt;br /&gt;-Newly designed head. Made to resist toothpaste build-up, it is easily removed for cleaning/sanitizing. The included heads are also very soft and extremely comfortable to brush with&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life is amazing. We&#x27;re talking upwards of two weeks used 2 to 3 times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-Splatter! Don&#x27;t think about taking this thing out of your mouth while it is on, if you do micro droplets of toothpaste will go everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;-Cost. Price is high, but then again you can&#x27;t really put a price on healthy teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;What really triggered me to write this review is how pleased I have been with this toothbrush over the past six months. Yes, three minutes feels like an eternity when brushing your teeth, but fire up your cell phone and read news/twitter updates/email/etc. and will go by in no time - the beauty of multitasking! What does my dentist think? At my last cleaning I was told my brushing could not have been better. No plaque, no tartar, and most importantly, no cavities. I wholeheartedly believe if everyone brushed with a toothbrush like this, dentists would lose a great deal of business! Hats off to Sonicare for making an excellent product that needs no improvement.

            <li> I have bought over 10 Sonicare&#x27;s in the past 10 yrs for family. This metal prong on this unit broke after 18 months, and it was out of warranty, so I had to buy another. I bought the same one again, and after only 3 months the metal prong is loose. I don&#x27;t recommend this model.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me to get an electric toothbrush for the last 3 years and for some reason or another I have just been putting it off thinking that it&#x27;s another expense that I just didn&#x27;t want to deal with.  Well, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking but now that I have finally broken down and bought one, it is the best thing ever and I wish I would have purchased it sooner.  I asked for recommendations from friends and everyone said Philips Sonicare.  I decided to get the sanitizer version because it was only a little bit more and came with 2 different brush options.  I think that I could live without the sanitizer but for the little extra it&#x27;s a great bonus.  would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It give you that \\&quot;clean from the dentist\\&quot; feeling at home! A lot of features if your willing to take the time to remember, so I keep the manuel handly until I have it locked down. Nice to have the toothbrush sanitized when you have a cold.   Nice product.</li>
            <li> I received this for for my birthday last year, and I love it. It cleans my teeth so well, and I like that it does the self-cleaning thing. It even has a timer that tells you when to go to the next section of your mouth, so you don&#x27;t overdo it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Worked ok first year, then I have had to replace it  T H R E E  T I M E S  so far in 2010. Problem has been the same all times; when placed in the charger it turns on and off continuously all by itself. See it for yourself in the youtube video ([...]).  FIRE HAZARD!!! After it starts doing this it only works intermittently and then finally dies permanently. The new one lasted 13 months. The replacements only last two months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was initially very pleasant and the replacements cost me nothing. H O W E V E R, Philips initially refused to provide a third replacement because I did not have proof of returning the previous two defective units!  Keep in mind the units were both returned within one week of receipt replacement using the PREPAID label provided by Philips. When I pointed out that Philips PAID for the the return shipping and therefore would have its own proof of return, I was told that was a different department and that it was MY RESPONSIBILITY to provide Philips with the return tracking ID.  I am not optimistic about this product&#x27;s reliability. If you look through the reviews, you will see others have experienced my exact same problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush soley based on the reviews on this site, as it was rated highest. It is truely one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. I was buying it for both me and my husband and was considering buying 2 (1 for me and 1 for him), but no need! Sharing works out great, and there are 2 spots in the UV holder, so both of us can store our toothbrushes in there. The toothbrush guides you through brushing, prompting you every so often to move on to the next \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; in your mouth. I found that really helpful - my husband doesn&#x27;t really pay attention to it and does his own thing.    Quite a few people on here commented about how their thumb ends up turning \\&quot;off\\&quot; the unit while brushing because of it&#x27;s placement. I would like to say this... That has never happened to either of us. I understand that it entirely depends on where you hold the base, but unless you are gripping the base really hard (which by the way, you shouldn&#x27;t be!), there is no way you will push the \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; button.    Overall, awesome purchase. Our teeth are cleaner, and definitely whiter!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this toothbrush cleans, but I&#x27;m don&#x27;t like that it broke a little more than a year after I got it.  The center shaft got loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used manual or cheap battery powered toothbrush my entire life so when my dentist recommended the Sonicare FlexCare I was a little skeptical that it was just going to be another cheap electric toothbrush with a much higher price tag. But I decided to fork up the hundred dollars to buy this product and I have never been happier! This toothbrush really massages your gums and cleans your teeth better than any other cheaper battery powered brushes out there and it leaves your mouth with a clean fresh feeling that I have never felt in my life! The UV sanitizer that comes with this product is just a added bonus that I enjoy having because I have always worried about the bacteria build up on brush heads. My recommendation to you is that if you are looking for a new toothbrush, and I know you are because you clicked on this product, then buy this toothbrush and enjoy all the oral health benefits that come with owning a sonicare.</li>
            <li> I will be on my 3rd of these brushed in less than 18 months.  The first one the shaft somehow got disengaged from the motor which seems to be a common problem with this unit.  The next one somehow got water inside it.  It stopped working and was only turning on intermittently so I opened it up to see for myself and there was tons of moisture inside all over the electronics.  Somehow the seals around the top must have leaked.  I purchased a replacement handle only on %bay, b/c I really like how the brush works (when it&#x27;s working).  If it breaks I&#x27;m going to change to Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering buying one of these don&#x27;t - yours will break too eventually probably only weeks to months after buying it.  Get another brand and save yourself the headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update - April 2013.  The third replacement unit I got has been working fine for over a year.  Maybe it was bad luck getting two duds early on.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Flexcare&#x27;s brushes but the toothbrush itself only lasts a few months.  I&#x27;ve gone thru 2 of these in the past 9 months.  There&#x27;s no indication of why they just stop working, I&#x27;ll be brushing my teeth and the toothbrush makes a weird clanking noise and then it just stops working.  I&#x27;ve tried to reset them but to no avail. Oral B&#x27;s products are much more reliable, but their brushes are way too hard compared to the Sonicare.  But I can&#x27;t afford to throw this much money away every few months for this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll have to go back to my old reliable Oral B toothbrush, but I&#x27;m gonna really miss the softness of the Flexcare brushes.</li>
            <li> At my last dental checkup, the hygienist said the buildup was excessive and that I should now start having cleanings three times a year rather than twice.  She recommended using a power toothbrush as well, but made no brand or model recommendation.  Based on the reviews on Amazon, I chose the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable with Sanitizer.  I was amazed at how smooth my teeth felt the first time I used it.  The best feature, other than the thorough cleaning itself,  is that the program ensures you brush for the proper length of time and that you spend an equal amount of time in each of the four quadrants of your mouth (top inside, top outside, bottom inside, bottom outside.)         A couple of minor complaints:  1.) The travel charger doesn&#x27;t fit into the travel case; only the toothbrush itself fits.  2.) Each time you turn on the toothbrush, you must re-select your program.  It doesn&#x27;t remember the program last used.         I have used the cheapie battery powered brushes and there is no comparison.  This is a completely different thing. The difference is in the degree of cleanliness achieved.  Overall, I really like this device and would never go back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I love it....you feel the difference and it&#x27;s great to travel with!!!!!  You cant go wrong with this company.....I just wish the replacement brushs are little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning and my dentist agrees!!  It does a much better job than a convential toothbrush or other electric burshes. Product is easy to use and the sanitizer is a great addition.  Reasonably pricedas well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I have had it for about a month now and I just love it.  The 2-minutes always end too fast for me.  I could brush my teeth longer with this awesome toothbrush.  I notice the difference in how clean my teeth feel after each use and I believe they are actually a bit whiter just from brushing.  I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but cheaper than dental repair work!</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested.  Is a very good product and it seems to do better than my older one, I&#x27;ll find out at my next cleaning.  Others commented about hitting the adjustment buttons while using.  It has happened to me a few times but you can learn to avoid it and if you hit it by mistake, just hit it again to restart, the timer continues from where you left off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for about 10 years now. I have always loved my Sonicare but hated the way gunk and crud would build up under the screw cap that secured the brush head to the base unit. Gross! But once my base unit finally broke, I purchased the new Sonicare. The new design is really cool and no more gunk and crud build up since the screw cap is gone. Also, the new toothbrush sanitizer is awesome. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about my new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had an older version with a battery that finally gave out, so this was a nice upgrade.  It is lighter and though some others suggest the features are not necessary--I like them.  The quick 1 minute choice is nice at times, but others times I take advantage of the longer 4 minute cycle.  The UV light is interesting, if it actually works to sterilize--very nice.  It would not be hard for two people to use this.  Unlike the old screw on type, the brush pulls off and is easier to manage (and keep clean).  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars cause I just don&#x27;t tend to give things superior but I wouldn&#x27;t disagree with those who did.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a wedding gift for some friends, and they&#x27;ve told me that it&#x27;s worked out very well for them! The only down sides that I&#x27;ve heard: if you turn the toothbrush on either free of your mouth, or if you happen to open your mouth while brushing, it has a tendency to splatter - but that makes sense considering the motion the brush takes. Secondly, it&#x27;s a bit loud, but again, this seems to make sense considering what the brush is doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it sounds like a great tool :)!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush in early 2009.  It is my first electric toothbush, and now I can never go back to a manual toothbrush.  It is much more convenient and easy to use than a manual toothbrush and provides far better results.      The one issue with this toothbrush is that it isn&#x27;t very reliable long-term.  The original broke after 9 months, and the replacement just broke as well.  Thankfully, Philips customer support is pretty good.  They ship a replacement toothbrush to you within a few days rather than requiring you to first ship in your broken toothbrush.    As long as Philips continues to provide a two year warranty, I would buy this toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on a recommendation from my dentist.  I had recently undergone significant periodontal work, including lots of laser treatment, significant enough to have the procedure done under anesthesia.  Afterwards, the office recommended using a Sonicare toothbrush.  I was reticent, as my only experience with electric toothbrushes was from many decades back, when such things only used an exaggerated up and down brushing motion.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.  However, to say I was blown away with what this thing does is understatement.  From the first time, I felt like I got a better cleaning than I got even from the dentist.  My wife agrees.  I have nothing but superlatives to say about this  toothbrush.  Well, except for the cost.  This is a pricey unit, and the replacement toothbrush heads are outrageously priced, even here on Amazon.  However, the cost is well worth it if it keeps my teeth and gums in the shape that the product appears to be capable of.  I can only hope that the problems I&#x27;ve read here about the toothbrush not holding up for the long haul won&#x27;t be something we encounter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush! Both my wife and I use it as it has a holder for two brush heads.  I also love that it has the UV sanitizer to kill off germs and it keeps the brush heads in the protective case so that they are not catching germs by being exposed. The toothbrush itself cleans very well and I can already see my teeth becoming whiter from its use.</li>
            <li> Works really good but you have to get use to it.  Would never go back to a power brush.</li>
            <li> I never realized how dirty my teeth still were after using manual of battery powered toothbrushes.  I always thought I was brushing good and that my teeth were clean until I tried this toothbrush!  I loved it so much I bought a second one because I go back and fourth between two houses and I couldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my FlexCare for a little more than four months and I am very happy with it. Hopefully it will have a long life and I will prosper from it! I am so far, anyway.  Like some other reviewers, I have a real problem with plaque. And I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I do not floss because my teeth are so close together that it&#x27;s nearly impossible (even the dentist has commented on this). Nor do I visit my dentist nearly as often as I should. As a result, I have been fighting gingivitis for years. Now that you know a bit about where I&#x27;m coming from, here are my comments concerning the FlexCare:  1. When I used a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush, my gums bled EVERY SINGLE TIME. This is probably due, in part, to the fact that I brushed too hard, trying to get rid of the freakin&#x27; plaque! But with the FlexCare, I don&#x27;t need to (and am not SUPPOSED to) brush hard. The brush does all the work, and it does it without mangling my gums. My gums don&#x27;t bleed, yet my teeth feel so much cleaner than with the manual, it&#x27;s downright amazing. In fact, it&#x27;s slowly getting rid of plaque buildup that I thought my dentist would have to scrape off. (Please don&#x27;t think you can get away with not going to the dentist because of this; I&#x27;m just telling you what I, a chronic dentist-avoider, am experiencing!) I&#x27;m convinced that the next time I go in for a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office, I am going to be able to maintain that cleanliness for a LOT longer with my FlexCare than I ever could with a manual toothbrush.  2. I have not changed my toothpaste, yet I am convinced that my teeth are at least twice as bright as they were before I started using the FlexCare. I can only assume that there is a sort of polishing side-benefit to using it. Huzzah!  3. I have not yet had any problems with the chargers, the sanitizer, the brushing attachments or the handle itself. All seem to work just fine. However, please remember that I have only had it for four months. If I eventually have a problem with it, I will try to remember to post an update.  4. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the sound or vibration, unlike some other reviewers. In fact, I kind of have to laugh a little at those who complain about the noise it makes. I mean, seriously?! Have you looked up the definition of &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; in the dictionary? Not to mention you&#x27;re using it INSIDE YOUR HEAD. What did you expect? Unless it&#x27;s making you deaf or genuinely malfunctioning, I don&#x27;t understand why that&#x27;s a serious issue.  5. What I DO agree with wholeheartedly is the complaint about nonreplaceable batteries (thus the four stars vice five). There is absolutely no good reason why I should be unable to personally replace the battery/batteries in ANY device manufactured after, say, the year 2005 (and that&#x27;s being generous). I cannot think of any good excuse for the folks at Philips designing it this way, unless it is a money-making scheme. For shame, Philips. Get with the program! GO GREEN!  6. Which leads me to my second and last complaint: the price is pretty high, particularly when you factor in the nonreplaceable battery. However, I may change my mind about this when I find out how much it saves me in dental bills ... not to mention how much &amp;#34;chair time&amp;#34; it may save me when I&#x27;m AT the dentist&#x27;s office!  Bottom line: I think this is a great toothbrush. I would buy it again.  May 4, 2010 UPDATE: Still going strong! Still happy with the product, and would still buy it again. Rock on, Philips!  Feb. 9, 2011: Still working like new. Very happy customer.  April 29, 2012: No problems. Great product!  March 7, 2015: Still working great. Sometimes the sanitizer compartment won&#x27;t turn on without some fiddling, but otherwise no complaints. The non-disposable battery hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> I bought Sonicare because of an indication from my dentist. I had never heard about such a device before, and decided to try it nevertheless. At first, the brush vibrations were tickling my gums. I insisted for some days and soon became used to the vibe feeling - not a big deal any more. And what a big difference it makes to the feeling of a clean mouth! Brushes enter comfortably between teeth, and the 30-second intervals are well fit for the the cleaning! And, as always, Amazon provided a quick delivery, and took care of the import taxes to Brazil.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 12 year old son for him to brush better and has worked wonderfully.  He brushes twice a day withouth being told.  The different options gives him choices.  He loves the massage option.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever bought! I did some shopping around and this is the best deal out there. I am thrilled with how my teeth feel after using this plus the brush is so much better then my old sonic which had the bigger brush. If you buy this you will not be sorry.    GREAT product!! Great price!!</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars as it went weird on me after having it about 6 months.  It started turning itself on and off like a ghost was pressing the button (I don&#x27;t have any ghosts as this house was  built by me about 10 years ago and no one has died here yet) at random.  I called customer service and explained the problem.  After a  few questions, the gal just told me to package it up with all the components and ship it back to them.  (I had the original packaging by chance.)  They shipped me a brand new unit in a couple of days.  Yes, I was  out shipping (the old unit back), but it was worth it.   I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the new unit.  As to does it work, I think so, although my gums don&#x27;t feel that much better.  If you do get one, realize the first time you use it, your gums will freak out; it kind of tickles, but it is not a comfortable feeling.  That goes away the second or third time you use it as your gums develop a tolerance for the vibrations.  I like the unit, and I use it on the 1 minute cycle.  Don&#x27;t put a lot of toothpaste on your brush, and make sure you have it in your mouth before you turn it on (otherwise expect to clean up toothpaste on your walls or wherever).</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth very well, but expect to buy a new unit once every 18 months.  My first one had the on/off button wear through and stop working.  Luckily I had bought it at Costco and was able to return it.  My second (current) now has a problem where the brush won&#x27;t stay on.  Even a new brush pops off every few seconds.  I have cleaned the brush thoroughly and can&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s coming off.  Apparently just a quality issue.  And my call to Phillips?  Sorry, your unit is out of warranty and we don&#x27;t provide support.  Please give us another $150 and we&#x27;ll talk to you for another year.</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist recommended I purchase an electric toothbrush on my last visit from their office.  At their price, it seemed a bit expensive in my opinion, not to mention the one they were selling didn&#x27;t match what they had on display (they had the one with the sanitizer on display).  When I got home I did some research online and found a great deal at Amazon.  The brush came with the Sanitizer for a few more dollars than my dentist tried to sell it for without.  It also came with a charger, two brush heads, a travel charger and travel case.  If you&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before it feels a bit funny at first but you will quickly get use to it.  But make sure you read the brief instruction manual BEFORE you use it so you will know how to use it, how you use it and make sure you get the best clean for your teeth.      After using the toothbrush for a week, I found my teeth are much cleaner, those places in the back of the mouth are much easier to reach and with the customization, I know I am brushing my teeth, every time, for the right amount of time (per quadrant).  I think using an electric toothbrush contributes to easier flossing as well.  This was a great investment at a great price!</li>
            <li> I really love the Sonicare toothbrushes and this one is no exception. I like its simple, easy-to-use design, and I also like the look and feel of the toothbrush. It leave my teeth feeling so so clean! I gave four stars instead of five, because for some reason, no matter how thoroughly I brush back there, I can always feel just a little bit of leftover plaque that I end up removing when I floss.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my older, well-used Sonicare toothbrush.  I looked for the best option and found it at Amazon.com.  This toothbrush is loaded with features that really make sense for someone with an active lifestyle and does a fantastic job--easy to use, efficient, and clean.  Love it !!!</li>
            <li> Several of the comments have said that the buttons on the front get bumped too easily and you find yourself changing brushing modes even when you don&#x27;t want to.  I suppose if you grip the toothbrush in a closed fist that could happen.  It&#x27;s never happened to me, as I grip it lightly down the side grip pads.  Another comment said there was a concern with mold in the UV unit.  For that to happen there has to be standing water.  I always dry the toothbrush off before putting it back on the stand - no mold issues.  This is not my first Sonicare.  I switched because I was tired of the gunk in the area where the toothbrush meets the handle.  This one doesn&#x27;t do that.  I haven&#x27;t decided yet how useful the sanitizer is, since it kills invisible stuff I think it&#x27;s there to make you feel like your toothbrush is cleaner.  Overall, it was definitely worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a humming bird flying around inside your mouth, but best brush ever!</li>
            <li> I have had periodontal problems over the past year, and this product was recommended to me by my periodontist. I have had an Oral B for years, but I was getting stains on my teeth between cleanings. I purchased the [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]] since this is the model my periodontist suggested. (They liked the idea of the UV Sanitizer). I bought it immediately after my last cleaning to see if it would keep my teeth clean. It has worked really well, and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use extra whiteners, since my teeth are whiter also. I do use the clean mode most of the time, but I have also used the massage mode occasionally at night to get the extra gum stimulation. I am very happy with this product. It is worth the money for me, my teeth feel really clean all day.</li>
            <li> The Phillips FlexCare Toothbrush with Sanitizer is an excellent product offering several teeth cleaning options that provide a near Dentist cleaning experience. The newer ergonomic design that this electronic toothbrush has feels much more natural in holding while brushing. The battery holds a little over a one week charge (single user). Charging and sanitizing is an overnight operation. The toothbrush is very easy to maintain for what little maintenance there is for it.  While others in my family are using earlier models without problem, I finally made this purchase because of redesign and upgraded options which are detailed in the products description.    Pro: Terrific slimline design, Longer time between battery recharging, More functionality, Virtually maintenance free. Also provided is a handy travel kit with separate portable charger.    Con: None to report at this time. Have owned for a little over a month    Buy Recommendation: Buy, without hesitation.    Price: I placed it in cart and monitored daily until price fell to just over $100, without rebates.</li>
            <li> Took my brushing to a new and better level.  Noisey, but hey.  Not sorry about purchase, I can see it&#x27;s effects in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Have owned a Sonic for about five years. Got it because my dentist said the oscillating action this model has was good to not only brush the teeth, but that it would scrub away plaque from between teeth and along gum lines better than my old &#x27;up-and-down&#x27; electric or regular toothbrushes. Great purchase for our family</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use the Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes We are very pleased with how well the toothbrush cleans  our teeth.  It took me two weeks to learn how to use the brush without spraying saliva all over the bathroom.  You must keep your lips closed as your mouth fills with saliva.  The on off switch is maddening for me.  It requires entirely too much pressure to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after a lot of internet shopping and from Amazon as they provided the best price.  The sonic toothbrush kit had two brushes as well as a travel charger and travel storage kit.  Haven&#x27;t had it very long but it seems to do a good job.....</li>
            <li> I have purchased different types of electric toothbrushes and not one measures up to the Phillips Sonicare FlexCare!  I have braces and since day one, I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush for better cleaning, less flossing (sensitive gums;bleed easily), and overall better care of my teeth and gums. Since using the FlexCare, my orthodontist and dentist have been raving about how well I take care of my teeth; truth is, I brush just like everyone else!! It REALLY feels like you just left the dentist after brushing. I dont have plaque on my teeth through out the whole day, even through multiple meals. It has a massage feature which helps my teeth move faster after getting my braces tightened, a sensitive and clean feature for regular brushing (personal preference - sensitive), a go-care feature for when youre in a rush and just need a quick brush, and max care if you have some time. I absolutely love the sanitizer feature, its like using a new toothbrush head every time. Thank you Sonicare for this wonderful product, it has shortened the time of when I get my braces off by 3 months!! THANK YOU!! :)</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a bit more, the cheaper, less complex head and the UV sanitizer are well worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I bought this toothbrush in the summer of 2009. After 10 months or so the rubber backing started to peel off from the top back of the toothbrush - we trimmed it several times but it looked awful. Then after 14 months the brushing mechanism became very loose to the point where I don&#x27;t think we are getting the same clean as we did previously. I contacted Philips about this since we had paid $189.99 plus shipping and taxes for the toothbrush and we expected it to last much longer than 14 months. The rep at Philips said they cannot replace the toothbrush due to wear and declined to offer me any solutions. We considered buying another one - we liked the brushing features, the overall design and size plus the sanitizer - but have opted to go for an Oral B this time instead. Hopefully it will last us longer than this one did.</li>
            <li> I love my new electric toothbrush!  I highly recommend it.  I feel like I just went to the dentist every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This unit replaces my Sonicare Elite that I&#x27;ve had for 5 years.  I&#x27;ve used this Flexcare model now for 2 months and love it. With this model I can sanitize the now slimmer heads on a regular basis.  The only drawback on this model for me is that it&#x27;s too tall for my medicine cabinet that does not have adjustable shelves (about 8 1/2\\&quot; while on the charger). Working on a solution for that.  I don&#x27;t have any problem recommending this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This particular brush was recommended by our dentist.  I purchased one for myself, and two as gifts.  One of the best decisions!  Love it! Should have done this long before....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely pleased with Amazon</li>
            <li> Love my new Sonicare!  After using your teeth feel like you just left the dentist.  Have heard about all the germs that are on your toothbrush so the sanitizer is a great feature.  While it is expensive, I think it is certainly worth it and trust that it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I am heartily impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the look of the product is great. The handle is slim and not as bulky as others I&#x27;ve seen on the market when I&#x27;ve looked at electric toothbrushes before. The rear of the handle is rubber backed which is perfect when you&#x27;ve wet hands after your cleaning cycle. The buttons are easy to press and feel sure and solid in the case. The LED&#x27;s are bright and show up well in a lit bathroom allowing you to choose your desired settings with ease. The additional colour rings to differentiate cleaning heads are perfect (the colours are pastel and not garish at all, in keeping with the overall design).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with two cleaning head types, compact and regular. I opted for the regular and it felt fine and fitted between my gums and cheeks easily, something I was very conscious of when the unit was vibrating against my teeth! The travel pouch will no doubt come in useful and the brush caps will stop the head becoming dirty. There is also a travel charger so you don&#x27;t have to take the more bulky UV sanitizer unit with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV sanitizer is an excellent idea and extremely easy to use. You just place the brush head inside and turn it on and after a ten minute cycle, where a small window glows magically, the brush head comes out clean and ready for the next use. I had a dry run at cleaning this unit and changing the bulb and it is all very easy to disassemble and reassemble so I have no worries when I need to do it for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three main programmes to use, Clean, Sensitive and Massage.. I opted for massage where the brush cleans for thirty seconds and then massages for fifteen seconds of each part of the cycle (there being fours parts in total, outside top teeth, inside top teeth, outside bottom teeth and inside bottom teeth. This is known as the quadpacer feature). It felt extremely comfortable and after a few minor teeth chatters as I got used to holding the brush at the required angle, it cleaned my teeth wonderfully, but more of that in a moment. There are also two timing settings, Go-Care and Max-Care. Go-Care is for those times when you&#x27;re in rush and only have a limited time to brush your teeth and Max-care is the full works. A longer timed session, made easy to time with the above mention quadpacing feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally for the overall cleaning experience. I am highly, highly impressed. One reviewer here said this item is teeth licking good and I can completely agree. I too find myself licking my teeth after a clean and find they stay smooth and shiny for hours afterwards. You don&#x27;t realise how flawed a manual toothbrush is and how it cannot do what this unit can until you&#x27;ve tried it. It feels a little loud to me, but I&#x27;m not used to an electric toothbrush, and my girlfriend insists it isn&#x27;t that bad, which makes me feel it must sound louder in my head! It&#x27;s more a high whine than anything else and not that excessive. I found it tickled my palette almost unbearably the first few times, which has eased a little, and I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t be so bad once I get used to the unique and ticklish sensations. My teeth are smooth and shiny and my mouth feels fresh. It almost makes you want to brush your teeth and it is no longer a chore to do a couple of times a day, but something that is actually quite pleasant. I can only hope that feeling remains. Highly recommended indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.used to holding the brush at the required angle, it cleaned my teeth wonderfully, but more of that in a moment.

            <li> I bought the FlexCare to replace my Elite, which I loved.  The FlexCare has some nice new features (e.g., massage and sensitive settings and sanitizer) but I found the instructions inadequate in learning how to operate the various settings.  My biggest disappointment is the Elite had 5 30-second periods so you could brush all over with the last 30 seconds.  The FlexCare stops after 4 30-second periods and you have to start it again to do an \\&quot;all over\\&quot; brushing at the end then stop it yourself because it will just go through the whole 2 minutes again.  I have been using the Sonicare for about 6 years and love how clean it gets my teeth and gums and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a manual toothbrush.  My regular six-month dental check-ups/cleanings have definitely improved since I started using the Sonicare (e.g., a lot less tartar build-up).</li>
            <li> WOW....sleeker design than my previous Sonicare and so much better having the sanitizer attached and not a separate device. Best part of the new design? The fact that you don&#x27;t have to clean the inside of the unit anymore!!!!!! The new toothbrush just snaps on and you don&#x27;t have to unscrew the brush head. No interior cleaning--what a pain that was!! Performance of the toothbrush is far superior as well. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses the Sonicare and has been for a long time. We have bought versions at the dentist but also at Amazon. Everybody likes the smooth feeling that brushing your teeth with the Sonicare creates. I also like that the charge of the brush lasts a week. I travel sometimes and always take the Sonicare with me.     The one thing I don&#x27;t like (and why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars): I don&#x27;t understand why a replacement brushhead has to be $7 or so.     One of my favorite products overall!!</li>
            <li> I had not been to the dentist for many years so 6 months ago when I did go, I had a lot of dental work to be done. Luckily, I was sedated and the work was completed in one visit. The dental assistant recommended this specific tooth brush with sanitizer as a great way to maintain my teeth. I found that Amazon offered the best price around for the toothbrush and refill brushes. I love this toothbrush! It thoroughly cleans my teeth, is easy to use and holds a charge for a long time. I like having the sanitizing feature as well. At my recent check up, I was told my brushing has been effective because I had no cavities or extensive plaque build up. I credit this tooth brush for my new found tooth health!</li>
            <li> Likes: Easy brush head clean up.  Sleek design.    Dislikes: Unreliable    I&#x27;ve had two of these models.  The first one stopped working at all after 6 months.  The second one makes noise, but doesn&#x27;t vibrate (I&#x27;ve had it 8 months).  I&#x27;ve followed the instructions from Philips customer service on how to reset the toothbrush but it still doesn&#x27;t work.  My old-school Elite was more reliable than this dog.    I won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth and gums are really clean now.  I primarily use the \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode, but will change to \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; about one a week.  And the \\&quot;Go\\&quot; is really nice for between meals or if I&#x27;m in a hurray.  It keeps charged for several days so I don&#x27;t have to keep it on the charger.  I use the UV about once a week to really combat the germs.  I am so happy I finally invested in one.  And my dentist is proud of me too!</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare toothbrush stopped working after one and a half years, and philips sent a free replacement.  However, that replacement stopped working after only five months (wow, I didn&#x27;t realize that sitting idly on my bathroom counter was so dangerous to toothbrushes).  Philips will not replace the brush a second time, so I am going back to a normal toothbrush.  This thing is not built well, the cheap components break too often.  Avoid this brush, it will become a pricey paperweight.</li>
            <li> That is the sound of clean. I have an electirc brush and now the Sonicare. I can tell a difference. My one disappointment is that I bought this with the intention of getting a $15 discount and it didn&#x27;t show up at the like normal and I&#x27;m hoping it is manufactured one and is \\&quot;in the mail\\&quot; (lol). Still happy I have it though.</li>
            <li> This is my first battery operated toothbrush. I Love Love Love it. I have always had a problem with plaque build up, not any longer. I was amazed at the amount of build up this sonic brush removed in the first use. After one week my teeth felt like I had gone to the dentist and had them cleaned. The best part is that I spend less time brushing and get a much better result. [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare FlexCare is an outstanding purchase. As compared to a manual tooth brush this product leave your teeth \\&quot;Dentist Clean\\&quot;. The massage function on the brush is a great gum stimulator. It took some getting used to, but the clean feel and the obvious whiter appearance makes this product well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for approximately a month so I can&#x27;t comment on the durability or long term quality yet.        What I can comment on is the performance of this toothbrush. Up until this purchase I had been using a Braun Oral-B rechargeable for the last 10 years. I loved the Braun and I loved that it lasted so long with no problems at all. I loved the Braun so much I recommended it to my roommate who was searching for a new rechargeable toothbrush. The only problem was that she went through 3 Braun&#x27;s in the last 2 years and even the third one was failing on a regular basis.  There was no way I could purchase another Braun and trust it was going to work.       So, after much research, I settled on the Phillips Sonicare FlexCare. As I said I can&#x27;t comment on the durability or long term quality but the performance is amazing. My much loved Braun NEVER worked this well. I was shocked by the difference in how my teeth looked and felt after a few weeks of using the SoniCare.  I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush that left my teeth with that smooth feeling you get after a professional cleaning at your dentists office until using this product. My roommate was so impressed with my love of this toothbrush she purchased one for herself last week.  I can say that she absolutely loves hers as much as I do mine.       The good: Great cleaning, comfortable grip, the brush timer is very handy (although I think it should be programmed with times for chewing surfaces instead of just front and back tooth surfaces), the battery is lasting over 2 weeks before needing recharge, comes with two different sized brush heads so you can choose which is more comfortable for you.      The bad:  This baby is gonna rattle the windows, so to speak, the first several times you use it (I highly recommend taking advantage of the &#x27;ease in&#x27; functions it offers until you get used to it), doesn&#x27;t come with a pink color code ring (I know it&#x27;s not really a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; but, seriously, how hard is it to offer pink along with the blues and greens?).        As long as I have no problems in the future with the quality of the product I&#x27;m a firm 5 stars on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and really like the different brushing cycles. I know I&#x27;m getting a better cleaning; can&#x27;t wait to hear what my dental hygenist has to say.</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist are very vigilant about gum disease; each visit they give plenty of ideas for better flossing and brushing based on where you might have trouble spots. Gum disease is more serious than first thought--it can be associated with heart disease so it pays to take care of your gums and teeth, not just for a pretty smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hygienist recommended this particular model during my last visit. \\&quot;I have an Oral B electric brush\\&quot; I mentioned. \\&quot;Ah, THIS toothbrush is different. It&#x27;s the next generation.\\&quot; Then the hygienist whipped out a demo brush, a lighted model of teeth and gums and gave me a very interesting presentation. The sonic action of the brush breaks down the film built up by plaque bacteria. The shape of the brush gets between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got the unit, I notice that areas on my back teeth that are hard to clean (get plaque build up) are getting cleaner. Areas that build up tartar are feeling as smooth as if I just had a professional cleaning. I still floss, of course (since the brush won&#x27;t get between teeth the way a thread of floss can) but overall, I look FORWARD to brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of settings on the unit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean--a 2 minute clean with three beeps to tell you to move from quadrant (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right) 30 seconds per quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;2. Gum Care (the 2 minutes plus an extra minute to stimulate gums)&lt;br /&gt;3. Refresh  A short brush&lt;br /&gt;4. Sensitive (toned down for sensitive teeth)&lt;br /&gt;5. Massage --gentler gum massage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a hard plastic case for travel, a sanitizer/charging station. Now, the charging station is clever; not only can you keep the unit at full charge (recommended for effective use) but the sanitizer holds two brushes and it&#x27;s right there so that after you brush, you can pop the head into the unit and press a button to activate the UV light. There is also a small charger for travel (sans sanitizer.) The brush itself is quite attractive; brushed chrome front with all kinds of lights to show the setting (chosen with an oblong button below the on/off button) and a green charging indicator--three full-on lights indicating that the brush is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush looks like Phillips did some thorough research to see what you and I want in a hi-tech toothbrush (easy to read indicators, multiple settings, sanitizer build into to charger) and what dentists want (better breakup of plaque film, fluid driving between teeth for more effective cleaning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is worth every penny. Right now, I go for an extra cleaning a year to my dentist (for which I pay, my insurance only covers two per year) and I&#x27;m hoping this will allow me to drop one of the visits if the home cleaning is more effective than before. And the \\&quot;just went to the dentist\\&quot; feeling twice a day is pretty luxurious. Big thumbs up for this toothbrush.inds of lights to show the setting (chosen with an oblong button below the on/off button) and a green charging indicator--three full-on lights indicating that the brush is fully charged.

            <li> Excellent product. Definetly worth the money. I bought this about a month ago and love the just from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this system over all others, and I can see why after using it.  It feels like you just had your teeth cleaned every time you brush!  Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  Now, with the price cut in half, I could afford 2 of these for everyone in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sterilization chamber holds 2 brusheads of either size and angles them towards a sanitation UV lamp (254 nm) - the cycle runs 15 minutes which is sufficient to kill anything on the bristles after use.  I&#x27;ve had my brushes over a year now and still am using the origianl lamp.  You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened (then it goes out) - plus the philips logo lights up from the UV inside but blocks the harmful rays from escaping by flourescing in the UV glow of the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  My dentist recommended it to me, and I recommend it to anyone who doesnt&#x27;t want to see their dentist as often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:  It charges using an induction charger - meaning there are no exposed wires.  A coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush.  When they are in close proximity (2\\&quot;) they couple energy from the AC line to the brush under charge.  This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  The system has one li-ion battery.  Once it expires, philips provides a mechanism to use a screwdriver to remove the battery before throwing away the toothbrush, thus guaranteeing you will buy another one.  It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  It&#x27;s like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear&#x27;s top load models in efficiency and economics.t.

            <li> Bought this thing years ago and still use it.  Great product which makes my dentist happy too!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these units a little over a year ago, and recently one of the unit started making a weird noise. I called Philips&#x27; 800 number and Philips sent me a new unit 2 weeks later. The only thing I would complain about is that the original unit was made in the USA, but replacement unit was not and there is a noticeable difference the replacement being weaker.</li>
            <li> I love this brush I would of had one many years ago If I knew what I know now. i m glad i have one it makes my mouth feel really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I dont know how to fix it. The hardware quality is BAD.     You cannot open it by yourself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any complaints whatsoever. It works great and the sanitizer is a great addition. Add all that into the price, and it&#x27;s a winning combination!</li>
            <li> It worth every penny! Every time I use it, I feel like I just had my teeth cleaned by a dentist. It has a built in timer too. I specially love the UV clean option, and it&#x27;s much quieter than other brands. This is a great product. Rechargeable! No more buying batteries! I love it.</li>
            <li> This was probably my fifth sonicare toothbrush so I decided to treat myself and go for the best one.  It is an amazing product.  It keeps my teeth bright and clean and I love the sanitizing ability.  I obviously have been a long time fan and I have to say that they just keep getting better.  My last one lasted for years and years.  I usually use the clean setting but I use it twice.  This has worked well for me for years.  If I had a fire, I would grab my sonicare toothbrush and my sonicare face cleaner first.</li>
            <li> After rave reviews from family and friends that own one, I decided to purchase a Sonicare for myself.  I only wish I had done so sooner.  Love the way this product performs and the results.</li>
            <li> This product replaced my previous (Oral B) and the speed of this toothbrush is much faster. I have not tried the \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; feature yet because I have only had it a short time. I took it with me on a two day trip and it kept its power (I didn&#x27;t even take the base with me). Mine only came with one head, so I&#x27;m hoping that they are not too expensive. I definitely like this product so far since it is far better and seems to clean better than my old toothbrush did.

            <li> Sonicare products are going down hill.  It is the most expensive unit I owned.  The unit died yesterday.  Not charging, made odd noise.  Looking for alternative to Sonicare since 1998!</li>
            <li> I have had this for 10 months, head got loose and noisy, didn&#x27;t work. Yes, they replaced it (took 2 weeks) but what is wrong with this model?  Should work for years. BTW, great when it worked.</li>
            <li> Update 12/20/11:  I contacted Philips in July 2011 and they sent me a replacement brush head. It worked fine until 12/15/11  (5 months), and then broke down. It did exactly the same thing my original brush did. What can I say about this product? first one worked for 8 months and the replacement worked for 5 months. I contacted Philips AGAIN  and they are going to send me a new one. Let us see how long this will last. My ill feeling towards Philips only affirmed with this incident. I don&#x27;t know how they can continue to manufacture these defective products. I like to hear from some more users of this product.  July 2011:  I bought 5 of these tooth brushes in November of 2010, kept one for myself, and gifted the others to my brothers and sisters. It has been working great since that time,but this week one day, it kept turning off after a few seconds of use, and when I placed it on the charger, it would make the awful noise, beep, beep, beeeep, beep, beep, beeeep. Now I know  it is going to die within a few days because exactly the same thing happened with my Sonicare Healthy white brush (dual brush) a year ago. I bought that brush from costco, and it failed within 9 months or so, and I returned it to costco and got full credit for it. Then I started reading the reviews, and some people said that the Healthy white tooth brush is a defective model and the flexcare plus is a great one to get. So I bought 5 of them from Amazon in November 2010, gifted 4 of them, and mine just failed after  8 months of use (I am the only user mind you). I am sure Philips is going to replace my unit because it is well within the warranty period (2 years) but it is such a hastle and I feel cheated with this unreliable product. But while it worked, I have no complaint, it cleaned my teeth squeaky clean and my mouth felt so fresh. The awful thing is, it breaks down so fast. And now mine broke down, I am sure I am going to hear from my brothers and sisters also about the failure of their brushesreal soon (probably within a few weeks). It is a shame that Philips is getting these product manufactured in the cheap chinese factories instead of in Germany which is renowned for the quality and reliability of its products. Tomorrow I am going to contact the Sonicare customer service and give them a ear full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 1-2 weeks and can already feel and see a difference. My teeth are cleaner and more polished, and my mouth feels cleaner along the gumline and in-between teeth. The varying modes are nice; although, I find that I use the 3-minute mode most often to ensure a complete clean in all quadrants of my mouth. The brush heads are nice, although I prefer the larger one (standard vs. compact) to cover more tooth area. I have no problems fitting the sonic brush-head into my mouth, the extended reach is long enough to reach all the way to the back teeth and to clean the inside and outside of the teeth and along the gumline without having to open my mouth too wide. It is a very comfortable brushing experience overall. The vibration in the handle and brush head is also quite minimal for a sonic toothbrush, and I do not find it uncomfortable at all. The handle is also long, slim and easy to hold and maneuver. The on/off and mode buttons are easy to use and understand. The charger with UV sanitizer is also quite slim and fits onto my sink/countertop without taking up much room at all. The unit, overall, is really quite attractive. The UV sanitizer works wonderfully and accomodates 2 brush heads a time. I use my brush, then easily remove the brush head from the brush and put it in the sanitizer, close the door and hit the on/off button. The brush easily pops on and off the handle without any difficulty. I think that this brush could be easily used by a \\&quot;lefty\\&quot; or a \\&quot;righty\\&quot; and is something I wish I had when my right arm was broken! It would have made brushing much easier. The unit comes with 3 color-coded rings for households with more than one user, and a nice travel bag and travel charger. This is definitely a great unit, well made, and totally worth the money! I bought a set of 3 extra brush-heads, and plan to have/use this unit for many years to come!</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these two years ago.  In the past couple of months, both toothbrushes have come down with the exact same problem - the shaft that attaches the head to the handle came loose.  The toothbrush still works, but it&#x27;s now insanely noisy and shakes something awful.      The first toothbrush to come down with the problem got replaced free of charge by Philips.  Great.      The second one was determined to be out of warranty.  I got the same story from two separate \\&quot;customer service representatives\\&quot; on two separate occasions: the toothbrush is broken, it&#x27;s just out of warranty and there&#x27;s nothing I can do.  They did not offer to replace it.  They did not offer to repair it.  They didn&#x27;t even offer to recycle it.  They offered no course of action beyond sending me on my way, now disgruntled that I&#x27;ve spent $120 on a toothbrush that isn&#x27;t worth their time.    Shame on you, Philips.  For creating a product that won&#x27;t actually last.  Shame on you, Philips, for having customer service guaranteed to make people immediately run to competitors.    Send a message... do not buy Sonicare.  Make Philips design a product that will last.  Make Philips care about keeping their customers happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this product thinking that it would last a couple of years... I had a rechargeable Oral B for about 5 years.  It worked fine...it would not die but thought I should get something more up to date.  This Sonicare is less than a year old.. more like 7 months and has ceased to function in the fashion already described.  It charges but I get only a low hum when I turn it on.  I am back to the old Oral B which I was just about to throw out.   I am really disappointed by this product and paid a lot for it and it sounds as if the manufacturers know about this problem. Have they no shame?</li>
            <li> Wow!  I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to justify the price.  What an amazing toothbrush!  My teeth are slicker after one use, I&#x27;m now brushing the recommended length of time, I use far less toothpaste per year, and my gum health showed incredible improvement after only two weeks of use!  After registering the product the manufacturer offered a year&#x27;s worth of replacement heads at no cost too!  I&#x27;ll never switch back!</li>
            <li> This model is great until it fails. Unfortunately, we went through 2 of them in 1.5 years. The one we just tossed away was a replacement we received 6 months ago and it literally had a mind of its own - - it would turn on and off by itself when not in use and would wake us like an alarm clock! Meanwhile, it would die during use. When on the charger, it made loud annoying beeps while attempting to charge. Also, the sanitizer stopped working after a few months. The first one also failed within a year.  My husband has now switched to the Oral B Professional Series. It is much more dependable, although my husband really prefered the Sonicare, which didn&#x27;t vibrate as much and he thinks has a smaller head more comfortable for his mouth. However, after two tries at the Sonicare it really seems not worth the trouble to get one again as we expect we would have to deal with trying to return it within 6 months again. As to the return, Amazon has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush now for 2 weeks, it is true what most people are saying. The toothbrush has no equal. My husband and I share the power head, and we each have a brush that we put into the sanatizer.Even with the two of us using the power head it has more than enough stored power. The charging light is bright, but if you turn the power head to face the rear it takes the glare away and the unit still charges the same.</li>
            <li> This is the best possible way to brush your teeth.  It comes with two heads, one is larger than the other one but either one is fine.  The ultraviolet sanitizer is cool and keeps them clean and off of the counter!  PS I just saw this on E be ay why for lower price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> The best tooth brush ever!&lt;br /&gt;My teeth get that &amp;#34;dentist cleaning&amp;#34; feel every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Less cleaning at the dentist too!&lt;br /&gt;Really helps keeping plack build up away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace an older model (Sonic Care Elite) and it&#x27;s much better.  The three speeds are a much improvement over the Elite (one speed) and the sanitizer is an added feature that exemplifies itself.  Overall, a outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I am finally brushing correctly after years of trying to get it right by myself.  Teeth look and gums feel great!</li>
            <li> I knew this was a great selling prodeuct but wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the price. My dentist recomened it for me to aid in my oral care routine. Product was recieved on time &amp; in great condition. Once I started using it, I&#x27;m not sure how I ever survived without it. My mouth feels fresh from the dentist clean everytime I use it. My breath even feels fresher. I LOVE the UV sanitizer and travel case. Battery life it really good also. All around, great prodect @ a great price here on amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Amazon asked me to write a review of this product very shortly after I bought it.  But I thought it was too soon to judge, so I waited.  Now I&#x27;ve had the Sonicare Flexcare with sanitizer for something like 7 months and it hasn&#x27;t broken.  I had been buying Sonicare electric toothbrushes for years, but the ones I was buying were much larger and heavier than the Flexcare.  When I first saw and held the Flexcare, I thought it was going to turn out to be too flimsy.  It&#x27;s much smaller than all the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  Thank goodness nothing has broken yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that I like the Flexcare fairly well.  One big mistake that Sonicare made is putting the mode selection button right where your thumb goes when you are holding the Sonicare and brushing your teeth.  The mode selection button presses very easily and you will wind up changing brushing modes while you are brushing.  I can personally just about guarantee this. After awhile, you get used to avoiding pressing the mode selection button, though.  The mode selection button is right below the on/off button.  The on/off button is much harder to press, so you probably won&#x27;t shut off your toothbrush by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare is supposed to have a rechargeable lithium battery.  All the other Sonicare toothbrushes that I had in the past used NiCd rechargeable batteries.  The NiCd batteries lasted about 4 years.  When the batteries go bad, you have to throw out your Sonicare toothbrush.  I never did like that idea.  I don&#x27;t know how long the battery in the Flexcare will last or whether the whole toothbrush will have to be discarded when the battery does finally wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare brushheads seem to last just as long as the brushheads that came with the older Sonicare toothbrushes.  The Flexcare will get your teeth clean just as well as the older and larger Sonicare toothbrushes do.  I like the sterilization/charging unit that comes with the Flexcare.  This uses a replaceable ultraviolet light bulb.  I&#x27;m going to trust that the sterilization actually kills germs on the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/1/12:  I&#x27;ve had this Sonicare Flexcare for about a year now.  It&#x27;s still working as well as when I bought it.  I&#x27;ve replaced a couple of brush heads since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/24/12: Still working OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/18/14: No problems yet.  This is over 3 years since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 09/04/15: Product broke down completely.  Used it for about 4 years and 7 months.  The shaft that the brush head mounts on came loose completely inside the product.  Also, at least several months ago, some of the rubber on the product grip (on the back of the handle) started to peel loose.  One other thing: Either this model or another model extremely close to it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have owned the RS930 for less than 4yrs.  Under warranty the handle was replaced in less than 2yrs since the tip broke from inside.  Once again in less than 2yrs the on/off switch malfunctioned and the sonic action was not operating normally.  The problem progressed to where the toothbrush would not turn on.  Since the original product was purchased Dec 2009 Phillips would not replace the handle.  The manufacturer knows that this is a defective product and chooses to hide behind their 2yr warranty instead of doing what is right to maintain customers.  My RS930 Flexcare handle appears to be identical to this current model.  The bottom line is that this product only lasted for about 20 months.</li>
            <li> I bought a Sonicare ProResults package very similar to the one depicted here, from my dentist&#x27;s office in July 2008. I paid a very hefty price, even with the \\&quot;professional discount,\\&quot; because my dentist raved about the results. Well, I immediately enjoyed healthier gums but in less than two years, the handle broke. The prong that holds the head on it became lose and therefore ineffectual. I called Philips and arranged for a replacement handle. I was also asked to ship the old one back to the company, which I did. Things went smoothly for another year, until two weeks ago, when the lights started flashing crazily and the brush would only work sporadically. Within one day, it started going off on its own, sometimes in the middle of the night, even though no one pressed any buttons. Within another couple of days, the thing just died completely- wouldn&#x27;t take a charge, wouldn&#x27;t work at all. I called Philips again but this time was told that the warranty is only good for two years and that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to send a replacement. I asked about having it fixed for a fee and was told that they don&#x27;t do that. When the batteries die, they just want you to get another one. The rep then offered me a 15% discount on my next Sonicare. They don&#x27;t even offer to recycle your useless model! I asked what the life expectancy of the Sonicare toothbrush was and she said, \\&quot;three to five years.\\&quot; Well, I haven&#x27;t even had mine for three years yet. Guess what? My relationship with Sonicare is DONE. Why would anyone pay $120-190 for a toothbrush that can&#x27;t even make three years without a problem?? That can&#x27;t be fixed? Sonicare is a racket. I have a new dentist now and they recommend Oral-B, which they claim has great customer service and is better at getting behind the teeth. Oh, and the cost is a FRACTION of what I paid for the Sonicare. I admit that when it worked, I got excellent results from the Sonicare but I don&#x27;t think I have anything to lose by going to the competition at this point. Philips obviously doesn&#x27;t care about customer service at all.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I was looking for; the customer reviews are accurate--the Philips Sonicare Flexcare is worth the money. The sanitizer is a nice addition. I&#x27;m impressed with this product and I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to a manual toothbrush. My teeth feel cleaner than when I was using a manual toothbrush. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next dental appointment to see what my dentist says--I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be able to see the results.</li>
            <li> Probably the best electric toothbrush on the market, but unfortunately after less than three years I have over $200 worth of dead phillips sonicare toothbrushes. They both had the exact same issue; they stopped charging/working altogether. I tried several chargers to make sure it was the toothbrush itself that was dead, and this was definitely the case. I called phillips customer care and they couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t do anything without a receipt, which I don&#x27;t have. I even offered to send in both toothbrushes but they still wouldn&#x27;t budge without the receipt. S0..............buyer beware, even though they supposedly offer a 2 yr. warranty on their product, without a receipt it does not matter period. I realize this requirement is pretty commonplace but its pretty frustrating when a dedicated phillips consumer (my home is full of phillips electronics and other Phillips products) gets treated in this manner. Also, from a manufacturer/engineering perspective I would want to know why this same problem keeps popping up in two products over 2.5 years!!! I know, I know.... all this over a few toothbrushes!! Just annoying that all!! Obviously, I should have bought my toothbrush(es)from Amazon, no questions asked customer service all the time!!</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase investment I have ever made.  Twice a day  my mouth feels like I just had my teeth cleaned.  I would recommend the Philips Sonicare FlexCare with Sanitizer for everyone.  And a plus is I know my tooth brush is free from bacteria with the Sanitizer.  All round good feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I can just stand there and hold it against my teeth with a gentle touch and it does all of the work for me. I dont have to worry about...\\&quot;am I scrubbing too hard...not hard enough?\\&quot;     It has the built in timer which has been the best part for my teeth. I can tell you for sure that I wasnt brushing long enough before. Now I just set the timer to the time I want and I get a good even brushing on all parts of my mouth.     It&#x27;s comfortable in my mouth too.     This one also came with the UV sanitizer which I really like.     The toothbrush has a pause setting too..which a lot of people havent mentioned. I know I like to get more toothpaste in the middle of my brushing + I tend to produce a lot of saliva while brushing and the pause part allows me to take a second to spit and reload my toothbrush with more paste, etc. If you pause in the middle of a timed program...it will continue where you left off.       I guess I can say its a very SMART toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The article I purchased is working very well and it is what I thought it would be. I congratulate Amazon for its efficiency. I am buying more and more from Amazon as I find out how professional they are; so far I never had any kind of problems purchasing from its site and I am amazed at their efficiency! They are better than a regular store. Keepp it up AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 replacements of this toothbrush in 2 years.  These models are not as hardy as the old design.  Your expensive tooth brush will break and Phillips is no longer replacing them.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush over 3 years ago on the recommendation of my dentist.  I had never had an electric toothbrush before and didn&#x27;t like paying $100 but since dentist recommended, thought it would be a good toothbrush.  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush if I can help it.  This toothbrush is still in great condition and I have never had a problem with it. I only charge it about every 2 weeks.  Have never had a problem with mold anywhere on the bristles or handle.  I keep the cover on the bristles when not in use and I have never used the sanitizer. This one has 3 different settings and I use the sensitive one exclusively.  A friend at work said hers lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sonicare flexcare because the elite model I had died 1 month out of warranty. Customer service said nothing they could do about the elite. I figure it&#x27;s just bad luck and purchased this flexcare model. It&#x27;s a great toothbrush when it&#x27;s working, but fast-forward to two months out of the warranty and this one stops working all of a sudden. I&#x27;m not the type of person that is irresponsible with my things. I took good care of the toothbrush, never dropping it, abusing, etc. I called customer service and all they could do was say \\&quot;sorry.\\&quot; Thanks that helps. I spoke then with a supervisor and all she could do is apologize too and assure me she gets calls like mine all day. Great that&#x27;s real nice to know, I guess I won&#x27;t be purchasing another sonicare unless I know they can make a better unit. But my thinking is perhaps they build these to be a commodity rather than a solid great product. So if you&#x27;re okay with buying a new sonicare every two years, go for it, it&#x27;s an absolute awesome brush when it works. This models battery lasts for a long time and makes it great when traveling. But like I mentioned, prepare to purchase a new one every few years and get zero help from the joke of \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; Philips has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand warranty periods exist for a reason and perhaps I have really bad luck on just sonicares (I&#x27;m a gadget nut and I&#x27;ve never had a product go bad like this multiple times). But it&#x27;s ridiculous when they don&#x27;t have any type of support for out of warranty, I would be more than willing to pay for a repair or refurb unit at a fair price. So I&#x27;m not one of those demanding \\&quot;customer always right\\&quot; type of people, I understand the nature of running a profitable business, but this is just not fair.</li>
            <li> The device has incredible power and is lightweight.  With its multiple cleaning phases, I could never go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I used to have this 7500 Series and then its being recalled back and I get a replacement of 9551. Both of them lasts no more than 1 yr! They simply dont charged and i dont use them often! So with the waiting for the replacement 9551 + delay to service center, my 2yrs warranty period is up.     Earlier I have this mould problem growing on the rubber surface of both sonicare brushes. Now, I have decided to put this set in my studyroom.     Pros  -UV Santizer helps to &#x27;warm the brush&#x27;. I used it after I use the toothbrush. Guess it helps to reduce bacteria growth &amp; speed up drying of the toothbrush too.    -Sensitive mode that is much gentle than the previous generation and Clean function. Better for me with receeding gum problems.     -I am observing my gums for days now and swollen gum has subside but the in between of teeth area are slightly red. I will have to use floss daily to improve my gum problem.    -The whole package (plastic) is fully sealed up. The plastic nodes area are fully melted and there is no way u can open this up without cutting it open etc. This let u know u are getting a &#x27;100% clean&#x27; set. Hygience issue. Good!    -Sanitizing box have this translucent area where light will be emitted when the box is in use. The UV lights can cause damage to the eyes so I guess this is a good indicator to let one know its been in use.    -Brushes are different from 7500 n 9500 series. This flexcare series brushes are easier to be maintained. Dont have to push up the slots and wash the in parts attached to the brush heads. But again, negative part abt this is that u have to take out the brush head and wash that thin metal + inside of the brush to make sure saliva/toothpaste etc dont get stuck inside and starts to form white residue. I have it for few days and I didnt dry it thoroughly. So i saw white residue on the metal surface area of the handle. (Still acceptable)        Cons  -Dont really know when to charge it. Maybe the new lithinum battery means it can be charged anytime but I still prefer not to.     Manual mentione abt green and yellow battery indicator.. but i only see yellow-green color. Not 2 colors to indicate if the brush need charging.     -The UV sanitizing box and charger is joined together. U cannot seperate them. So the only way is to use Traveller charger. But I believe they are different unit? If the box cant work, can we still use the linked charger for charging?    -Troublesome to maintain the UV Sanitizing part.  The promoter didnt mentioned anything abt cleaning the UV sanitizer box. You have to take out some components, wipe it or wash it which I have to figure out later. Its troublesome &amp; I&#x27;m worried of breaking the parts.     -Light bulb might be damaged and have to get it from service center.    -Round pins. It doesnt come with a converter adapter like what I have when i bought 7551 series.   I saw the traveller charger and it seem to be round pins too. If thats the case, its not really a &#x27;traveller&#x27; charger. They should bundle the Sonicare 3 Pin Square PLug to this set for use at selected countries.     -The Open/Close button/door of the Sanitizing box looks flimpsy. I hope it can last.    -Rubber material like the Sonicare series. Some complained that it will turn mouldy. I have the same problem too. So I will try to wipe it dry after every use, put it in my studyroom now. No more in toilet. The rubber material coating is far more than the 9500 series i guess so I dont want it to look gross after 2yrs (provided the battery can last that long. Finger crossed).    -Dont have place for us to dry or seperate the brush from the handle!!! 9500 series has a brush stand but this dont have. They should have some hook or whatever for us to hook this to the back of the UV box or somewhere. Water and water vapour will form when the brush is kept secured to the handle daily and I believe it will turn black like what happened to my earlier series.    Overall, I dont regret buying this but wish its cheaper. However, I wish that the developers have been more thoughtful when they come up with some certain simple but important parts to make life easy for users.     I have a problem with brushing my lower teeth. I just simply cant get it right! so I have to pay the $ to prevent my receeding gum problems from going worse. Teeth and gum are something we cannot ask doctor to &#x27;replace&#x27; with. Nothing beats the &#x27;original&#x27; human parts.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with it. works very good, keeps me on track with my cleaning. Was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> This product comes with two brushes.  When the unit I purchased arrived I found that one of the two brushes was fine but the other does not fit snugly on the shaft in the base.  As a result, the brush makes a loud noise and eventually falls off the shaft.  When I called Philips customer service to discuss this problem, the representative said that it sounded like a defective brush, and that the brushes are not covered under the warranty.  She apologized but said that there was nothing she could do.</li>
            <li> I bought this 9 months ago and love it so far!  It gives a dentist-like clean everyday. It has a timer built-in, so you always brush for the appropriate time.  It also is great for building healthy gums.  I had the best dentist appointment after using this brush for 5 months so I am very happy with it.  I have convinced my whole family to buy one! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush and sanitizer for about a month. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. For years I used an Oral B product that I thought did a good job. Now that I&#x27;m using the Sonicare, I realize I&#x27;ve been missing out. I like the feature of the timed zones. It helps me to make sure I&#x27;m taking enough time with all four sections of my mouth. I&#x27;m very particular about my oral hygiene, flossing every day too. The Sonicare toothbrush makes my mouth feel as if I&#x27;ve just been to the dental hygienist for a cleaning. Good product and a good value.</li>
            <li> I owned an old Sonicare for many years. It was a great product.    After five years, I purchased a new one. This was after Philips bought the company. It failed in a year. They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better. The replacement has now failed after a few months. They refuse to replace it again.    What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like) a few minutes before that call. There I was told the replacement model they sent me had a known history of failures and they would replace it with an improved version. We started to get the replacement information and he found out I was a retail customer. He said he couldn&#x27;t do it and gave me a different number where, he said, they would take care of it. A that line (retail customer service) they told me that there was no problem with the unit and they would not replace it. This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures. When I told them what I had been told by the other guy, the response was that he was wrong, that no one at Philips would ever say that. But the fact remains that my junk replacement unit failed and the guy I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about and could describe the failure. There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.    Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them. Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun electric toothbrush for many years and was recently convinced to buy a Sonicare based on an article I read and my sister-in-law&#x27;s assertion that it is the best home cleaning devise available. With regards to the end result, I have no reason to doubt the recommendations. After brushing with the Sonicare my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with normal home brushing. In fact they feel near as sparkly as they do when stepping out of the dentist&#x27;s office.     My ONLY gripe with this toothbrush is the amount of noise that it makes. There is a fairly significant buzz that occurs when you fire it up. That is to be expected I suppose, given the \\&quot;Sonic\\&quot; aspect of the product&#x27;s name. However when the slightest pressure is applied to the teeth, the removable part of the brush rattles against the body of the brush with such gusto that I am having PTSD-like anxiety about the Milton-Bradley&#x27;s \\&quot;Operation\\&quot; like BUUUUUZZZZ that occurs. bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz BAAAAAAAA bzzzzzzz BBBAAAAAAAAAAA bzzzzzzzzzz.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about purchasing this toothbrush because of the price but it was the best thing i have ever done. After every brushing, your mouth feels very clean...almost like you&#x27;ve been in the dentist chair for a cleaning. It really is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I love my new Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush! The best part about the toothbrush is that it has a timer built into the device, and when it is done with working on one side of an individual&#x27;s mouth, it will beep letting that individual know that it is time to switch sides. It also has three settings on it: Clean, Massage, and Sensitive. All three of the settings work well, although I use mostly the Sensitive and Massge settings when working on my teeth and gums. There are only two downsides to this toothbrush:    1. It takes a long time to recharge the battery in the device. (I have to wait at least 16 hours after I put it on the recharger in order to use it again.)  2. It is a little loud. (Although I can put up with the noise.)    On my second trip to the dentist, the dentist said that she hardly saw any plaque on my teeth or gums, which means that the toothbrush is doing its job.    I was also very impressed with how fast the toothbrush showed up in my mailbox. My parents and I are now laughing that Amazon.com built a distribution center a couple of streets down from where I live!</li>
            <li> The initial new product I received failed after only one day.  However, I called the Sonicare customer service number and  was sent a replacement toothbrush, with a minimum of hassle, which has worked reliably and well for the last two weeks, meeting the expectations I had for the product when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This product has turned a routine activity -- brushing my teeth -- into a daily pennance.    It now takes two hands to brush my teeth -- one to hold the toothbrush and the other to keep pressing the toothbrush end into the base to keep it from falling off. On top of that, the on-off button is positioned so it is easy to press, so you have to keep turning the thing back on.</li>
            <li> I am NOT hard on my things. So, after one month of gentle use the sanitizer broke and won&#x27;t turn on. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in it, especially since my boyfriend&#x27;s did the exact same thing.  Two units, both with broken sanitizers. I did note later that it was built in China. That always erodes the quality. However, as far as the brushing part goes -- my teeth did not restain with coffee and wine as they usually do after the dentist visit, so it does a very good job brushing. Too bad the expensive part of the unit is such low quality.</li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of electric tooth brush and thought it was all a hoax but boy was i wrong. This is the best investment i had made towards dental care. It really gets you the clean feeling just like you have gotten out of a dental visit. Needless to say it works really well and does it&#x27;s job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few Sonicare toothbrushes over the years, but their latest toothbrush is a total junk.  I started using electric toothbrushes long before Sonicare came up with their first product - like 20 years ago, and might have been an Oral B.  So, it&#x27;s not like that I don&#x27;t know how to use one properly.  Their latest brush does not clean thoroughly at all and often I had to do additional brushing using a manual toothbrush.  After a few months of using this junk, my teeth definitely seemed in worse shape.  Finally, I tossed it out and bought me an Oral B product.  What a difference!  Very happy.    Philips customer service is also a joke.  I called them once on one of my prior Sonicare (maybe 2 brushes ago.)  Two of their reps gave me two different instructions on a same problem.  One of the instructions ruined my brand new travel brush handle.  Supervisor basically told me \\&quot;touch luck.\\&quot;  I still bought more of their products, because it&#x27;s just mo[[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]ney.  But, I won&#x27;t buy any more of Sonicare if their product ruin my teeth like their latest one.</li>
            <li> We have had other Sonicare products and this is the best yet.  Several different settings to give you the cleaning options you want.  Try the regular clean for a full cycle and then use the massage setting.  Makes the teeth feel super clean.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one and it has the sanitizing feature which is a plus.  One thing I did not like - it comes with one full size brush and one \\&quot;compact\\&quot; brush which is designed for a two year old.  You may need to go buy another full size bush.  Not sure why they don&#x27;t just give you two of those.</li>
            <li> What a fabulous product! My teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing. Plus it&#x27;s a no brainer because it has a quad timer, indicating when you should move to a different location in your mouth.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Works great but I&#x27;ve had two and neither one lasted 2 years before breaking down.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  No complaints.  I am hoping it continues to work like it has so far.  Have heard some horror stories that it dies as soon as the warranty ends.  Hope that isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> THe Philips Sonicare is the best electric toothbrush I have owned yet, has great features and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to everyone.  it is pricey but is a great value.  teeth never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s always taken pretty good care of my teeth, and am proud of a life-long record of (almost) no cavities. Lately, when I go to the dentist, however, the dental hygienist always keeps mentioning these Philips toothbrushes. Last time I went in for my biannual cleaning, I asked: \\&quot;so what&#x27;s the deal with these brushes.\\&quot; She explained that they&#x27;re not like the little cheapie battery-operated toothbrushes you can buy in the grocery store right next to the regular Oral-Bs and Reach toothbrushes. And she said they can simply get your teeth cleaner than even the most experienced and dedicated manual brushing.    I was skeptical, but thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. Man, was she right. The Philips Sonicare (FlexCare) is unlike anything else you&#x27;re likely to have used. In fact, it can be a bit intimidating the first time you put it inside your mouth, because the motor is so much more powerful than what you were probably expecting if you&#x27;ve previously used the kind of \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\&quot; you get at the store and have to put a AA battery into. Don&#x27;t worry, though: you won&#x27;t hurt yourself or take the enamel off your teeth. The removable, replaceable brush heads themselves come with bristles which are actually nice and soft - just like your dentist would likely recommend. It&#x27;s the motor action which is powerful. You control how hard you push down on your teeth, though - and you don&#x27;t need to push hard at all to get the full effect of the brush.    The two settings I use most often are the \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; settings; with these, the brush actually times you, allowing you to brush one each of four areas of your teeth (top front, top inside, bottom front and bottom inside) at a time. At the end of the time frame, the brush switches to a shorter \\&quot;gum massage\\&quot; action, then finally, there is a tone which is your cue to switch to a different area of your teeth, and the cycle begins again. After four of these (one for each of those four areas), the brush shuts itself off. You can also push the off button at any time (say, for instance, if you have to spit or speak with someone), and when you push on again, the brush will pick up right where it left off.    And the clean? Like nothing else you&#x27;ve experienced, except possibly the feeling you get right after you leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning. Well, you don&#x27;t get that \\&quot;scraped\\&quot; feeling, but that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s no scraping involved. But you DO get a feeling of clean that&#x27;s unlike anything you&#x27;ve likely experienced previously. On top of all that, the small UV chamber in which you store your brush-head during the day is an excellent idea. I&#x27;m not really sure just how much \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; would be on a regular toothbrush after a month or two of use, so I can&#x27;t give a measurable opinion as to how good a job the UV light is doing at killing potential bacteria. But it certainly can&#x27;t hurt, and if nothing else, the chamber provides a dust-free environment for the brush head, instead of just sitting in the medicine cabinet or in a toothbrush holder where it gathers dust all day.     All in all, the Philips FlexCare is a remarkable product, very well-built and well-thought out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Philips Sonic FlexCare is all about performance.    Arrived 2 days after placing order ... used for first time this morning and I&#x27;m HOOKED !!!!!</li>
            <li> Do your homework and research toothbrush reviews on the net. This toothbrush will last about 2 years then you will go to use it and the battery will not charge. A waste of money for something that craps out and stops charging all the sudden. Do not waste your money!!!!!! The sanatation devise is appealing, but think twice. We also have an Oral B toothbrush that has out lasted the life of the soniccare one. I highly recommend going with anything other than this soniccare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Be warned they have really bad customer service.  If the product just works great, however, if you receive a product that doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t bother calling their customer service, just immediately return the product.  I purchased the product in January and the light didn&#x27;t work.  I called their customer service and was told they would send a replacement.  It&#x27;s now March and I called back to see why I never received the replacement part.  I was told they won&#x27;t have the part until May and I can&#x27;t get my money back on the product because it&#x27;s been too long (of course, this is the time I&#x27;ve waited for the replacement part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be warned, it seems like a great product when it works, but if you have a problem there will be no support from the company.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush before it died. Lower rating is because it failed about two years after I bought it, right outside of the warranty period. The metal piece that attaches the base to the head has become detached within the base. Seems like a manufacturing defect, so I hoped Philips would have replace it anyway. Nope.</li>
            <li> I thought I would check these reviews and it seems that mine were not the only ones with short life. I first bought my Flexcare in Nov.2008 after using a Sensonic brush for 9 years (they no longer made them and brush heads were hard to come by). This newer SonicCare was a similar design, with the simple and MUCH cheaper brush replacements than the original SonicCare, so I bought it. That one quit working in August 2009 and SonicCare sent out a replacement free of charge. Now exactly 1 year later the new one has gone crazy turning itself off and on at will at any hour. It&#x27;s just under the two year warranty and now there&#x27;s another replacement on the way    The brush works great, Phillips will stand behind it for two years and the service reps are good: after that you are on your own. You can see how Sensonic went out of business selling one brush every 10 years, but you have to wonder how long Phillips can keep sending out free warranty replacements. I don&#x27;t know how many of these things they sell and replace, but it&#x27;s hard to think of that sad lot of trash going into landfills just to keep our teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes since my Oral-B electric died, but was hesitant to purchase one because they are more expensive and the replacement brushes are a bit pricey. After reading a lot of reviews, I finally gave in and I&#x27;m thrilled with it! There is no comparing my previous Oral-B to the Sonicare...the Sonicare is so much better. I tend to brush too hard, and the Sonicare alleviates that problem. I recently had my teeth cleaned, and my dentist commented on how great my gums are doing! I&#x27;m more than happy to pay a little more for the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes since 2004 and I have yet to be disappointed!  What&#x27;s even better about this product is the UV storage container. I absolutely love it because it makes my teeth feel so squeaky clean!  You definitely won&#x27;t regret purchasing this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending over $100 for a tooth brush but I will have to say it was worth it. The first time I used it I could tell feel the difference it made. I have been using it for about a month now and it has made a big improvement to the overall health of my mouth.</li>
            <li> We purchased a Philips Sonicare Flex Care with the Ultra Violet light. We had a Sonicare before but after 4 years of using it, it gave up, so we ordered the latest model. While waiting for the new brush to come in, we had to go back to manual brushing. You just can&#x27;t get the same clean feeling with that. We were very relived as our new Flex Care came in and we could start using it. What a difference. My mouth feels and is  so much cleaner, my gums are healthier it&#x27;s just an overall good feeling. We like the Ultra Violet light sanitizer. Great are also the features on this new brush. Deep clean, massage etc. We are very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner than using a normal brush. It is almost like having them cleaned at the dentist every time you brush. The different settings that change the duration and pulse of the vibrations are a great feature. The ultraviolet brush head sanitizer is great for knowing that your brush head is clean every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I had an electric toothbrush a number of years ago, and this is a big improvement.  The brush handle seems to stay clean.  It must have a new design as my husband&#x27;s comes apart and collects dirt under the handle - not so with this model. I would be grossed out if that were the case, so this is a BIG improvement.  I like the toothbrush sanitizer.  If you have a cold or sore throat, you can sanitize your brush before using again.  The battery lasts for quite awhile, not too sure how long; but I know I use it twice a day and have recharged only 2 or 3 times since purchasing a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> So I bought mine in June of 2008.  This week it broke in October of 2010.  It has started turning on in the middle of the night or day by itself and giving us almost a heart attack each time because we can never figure out what the sound is!  I am scared to use it now even though it will still take a charge because I don&#x27;t want it shocking me or turning on again all hours of the night.  I guess I will let it die. I am grateful for having the toothbrush for so long as I sincerely enjoyed this product BUT I was expecting to have it longer than 2.5 years after paying over 150 for the product! AND I just recently bought a set of new brush heads which cost me almost 40 bucks which now I can&#x27;t use!  Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I instant messaged with the company today to see if they would replace it and after 20 minutes of asking me questions and wasting my time they finally said &#x27;oh sorry we have already determined you don&#x27;t have a warranty anymore.&#x27;  I hope that wasted time is used to make the brush better in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I will take the other peoples advice on here and try a Oral B and a cheaper model for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the conversation below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wait while we find an available agent&lt;br /&gt;You have been connected to Harry .&lt;br /&gt;Harry : Hello Jennifer, welcome to Philips Consumer Lifestyle.

            <li> [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]This is absolutely the best of all-bar none and was very affordable.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC FOR REMOVING TEA STAINS .. PLUS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended to me by my dental hygienist to remove tea stains as I am an ardent tea drinker!  I have used various Sonicare products for many years and been happy with them .. but when the FlexCare came out it was recommended as even better as a stain remover .. it really does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review not just because it does a great job .. BUT because Phillips Sonicare REALLY stands behind its products!  Because I have had so many of the products over the years .. I have been lazy and have not registered this latest one when I purchased it.  Lately I noticed it sounded funny and then all of a sudden it just quit.  So I went on line to research purchasing a new one.  I wanted to get the same exact model .. I couldn&#x27;t remember the proper name .. went onto the Phillips website to get it .. read some reviews .. noticed that people said Phillips Sonicare was great about standing in back of their products .. called their customer service at  1-800-682-7664 .. told them how I&#x27;d never registered my product etc.  Lo and behold .. they STILL are mailing me out a BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT!  Now that is Customer Service!!  That is why I am taking a moment to type out this review .. they deserve a big THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to use this toothbrush. I know it sounds strange to describe a toothbrush as \\&quot;thrilling,\\&quot; but I am conscientious about getting my teeth very clean, and with a manual toothbrush, I was damaging my gums because I could not refrain from brushing too vigorously. However, this toothbrush quickly and easily gets my teeth cleaner than I could do with a manual toothbrush. And I find it very comfortable to use. In addition, the stand that recharges the toothbrush works well and is very easy to use. It reminds me of an Apple computer--almost a work of art; easy to use; very effective. If Steve Jobs designed a toothbrush, this would be the result.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. Except it&#x27;s rubbish quality. We have had two, one died after ten months and the other after a year. The Old Sonicares we had are still going strong.</li>
            <li> *Update* - If I could give this thing negative stars, I would.  I should have known better that to buy anything from Philips.  So I got a replacement from Philips and it was all good for a few months until it stopped charging.  So now I have two non-working toothbrushes.  One with a broken motor and one with a broken charging mechanism.  This thing is CRAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, but there is an issue where the motor dies after a year or so.  Luckily it was still under warranty and they are sending me a replacement, but that replacement doesn&#x27;t re-start the clock on the warranty so when it inevitably dies in a year I&#x27;ll be out of luck.  I read a lot of other reviews where people had the same issue, the motor slows and weakens then stops working altogether.  I asked Philips if they were doing anything because this seemed like such a prevalent issue, but they said it wasn&#x27;t enough of a known issue to warrant a recall.  A quick search online suggests otherwise, there are tons of people complaining about the same problem.  Philips has always made subpar electronics so I should not have been surprised.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this toothbrush for a year and a half and we love it. Our teeth feel so clean after every brush and our gums never bleed anymore, not even when I was pregnant. Dentist cleanings have been easier. We hate going back to regular brushes, even for short times like camping trips. We don&#x27;t find them to be too loud. The battery life is great, almost 2 weeks between charges. The sanitizer hasn&#x27;t been of much use, neither has all the settings. Gunk needs to be cleaned off the brush handle every couple of weeks. The brushes are light and easy to use. I have never used any other spin brush as comparison. I did have the old sonicare model and it died after just a few months, but these have worked great so far. I would make the purchase again.</li>
            <li> We bought this sonic toothbrush about a month ago.  It has performed without flaw so far.  We like the idea that it has a number of different settings that can  be used to provide for sensitive teeth, regular cleaning, or deep cleaning.  It comes with two different heads and has a sanitizing cycle with UV for keeping the heads clean.  The battery charge lasts approximately 10 days for two people.    This is our first automatic toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but a great improvement over manual brushing.  It is beginning to remove staining that manual brushing cannot.</li>
            <li> I bought this as present for my daughter.  She is well pleased with it;.  I&#x27;m thknking about buy one for myself.  I have had a Sonicare toothbrush for about 11 years.  Has been great for my gums.</li>
            <li> To start:  I was very unhappy with this brush for the first year I owned it, until I saw my dental professionals and they changed the way I brush.  Totally my mistake, but I was moving the head around way too quickly, and as a result, my dentist says the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; effect was not working.  When I changed how I brushed, the results were night and day better.    Pros:    *  gets very clean if used correctly,   *  sanitizer,   *  looks good,   *  charge indicator,   *  brush lasts a long time after recharging and charges quickly    Cons:    *  heads hard to find, and it is confusing which head you want (customer service says they should say \\&quot;Pro Results\\&quot; on them, but many websites show a pic with Sonicare on them (with matching model #),   *  two heads have been defective and they replaced the first but claim that there is no warranty on the heads!!!!  Ridiculous for a $200 product  *  battery in handle not replaceable    Caution:    *  Must hold the brush on each tooth for an extended period of time (have to brush this way to get really clean)    I brush the full two minutes and hold the brush on my tooth at the gumline... I have also watched videos online about this.  It&#x27;s different, but it works very well and my most recent checkups have been much better.  Maybe I should have known better, but I didn&#x27;t.  :)    The santizer is nice, very easy to use, and gives some confidence you&#x27;re keeping your brush head clean.  The indicator lights are very straighforward (slow blink still santizing, fast blink done).    All in all, highly recommend the Sonicare Flexcare 9630.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Sonicare Elite I had purchased at Costco about 2 years ago.  I really liked it over the Oral B because the Brush heads looked more like a traditional toothbrush and seemed to feel better in my mouth vs the round heads of the Oral B.    I had 3 big issues with it though.    1. It was very large and not comfortable to hold.  2. The vibration on it was crazy insane.  3. Water/Toothpaste would get into the brush head and turn all yellow and nasty.    I picked up the Sonicare FlexCare the other day and all 3 of these issues are taken care of.  Its slimmer, less vibration and the toothbrush head is much smaller and just slips easily on top of a metal rod.    I&#x27;m not sure if the UV Sanitizer thing is worth it, you can&#x27;t really tell if its killing germs or not but I&#x27;ve put the brush heads in it a few times and it seems to cause no harm so what the heck.    The old brushheads use to say they would last 6 months but the new ones are rated at 3 months.  I&#x27;m going to guess the price of the brushheads are cheaper now too because they are smaller and don&#x27;t have all the extra parts the older model has, I guess I&#x27;ll know in about 3 months when it comes time for a replacement.    I am sorta dissatisfied with the carrying case, it looks pretty cheap.  But it is nice that Philips decided to give you a small charge adapter that you can bring on a trip.    Overall Philips did a nice job on the upgrade.</li>
            <li> Great investment for your money and teeth.  I find myself using it more times throughout the day because it is so easy and it makes you feel like you just walked out of the dentist office.</li>
            <li> First use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a dark and stormy night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it actually wasn&#x27;t stormy, and it wasn&#x27;t technically \\&quot;night\\&quot;, seeing that it was two in the morning, but it WAS very, very dark.  Not a creature was stirring, not even my [[ASIN:B000TKHBDK Logitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse]], when I crept to the bathroom to try out my new toothbrush.  I had read all the instructions twice, and having waited the minimum two hour charging period, I was ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearlessly, I pushed the shiny button until a green light appeared beside the Max Care routine. None of that sissy \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; or \\&quot;one minute\\&quot; stuff for me - I wanted it all!!  With a steady hand, I wet the bristles and applied some toothpaste, then confidently pressed the green button......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..... and nearly jumped out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was noisier than I thought it would have been, or maybe it was all in my head, as no-one else seemed to have heard the sonic whine, even in the wee hours of the morning.  Starting with the bottom teeth, I gently moved the brush head in the back and forth motion as directed.  It tingled with a sensation that was strange and a little uncomfortable.  After 45 seconds of \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;massage\\&quot;, the Quadpacer signal indicated it was time for a change of location, as it did faithfully three more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The tingling will take some getting used to.  According to the booklet, the power will increase after this for 13 more brushings, by which time I will have grown to love the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;2. Toothpaste is flying everywhere.  I try closing my mouth, but then I can&#x27;t brush the front teeth properly. It&#x27;s running down my chin too.&lt;br /&gt;3. The standard brush head feels big in my mouth, I think I&#x27;ll try the compact head next time.&lt;br /&gt;4. My teeth really feel clean afterwards.  They actually feel \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot;.  Maybe this gadget works after all.&lt;br /&gt;5. I&#x27;ll let the charging process continue and play with it some more tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is now fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched over to the compact head, set it to \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; mode and turned it on.  It didn&#x27;t seem so loud any more, and the tingling wasn&#x27;t that bad.  I was able to maneuver the compact head a lot better, and not so much toothpaste escaped.  When using the brushing modes, the toothbrush turns itself off at the end of the brushing cycle.  I had just begun to enjoy myself, so I started it again, this time switching to Sensitive mode and Massage mode.  Way cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;1. This toothbrush gives you \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; with every brushing&lt;br /&gt;2. There are five options for personalized brushing - 3 modes and 2 routines&lt;br /&gt;3. It breaks you in gently to the new sensation&lt;br /&gt;4. You have a choice of two brushing heads with caps&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s easy to set up and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;6. There&#x27;s a gauge to tell you when it needs recharging&lt;br /&gt;7. It comes with a small charger for when you&#x27;re traveling, and a case for the toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;8. It has a UV sanitizer to zap any germs that dare to live on your brushing head, and may possibly be used to clean some models of the Oral B brushing heads you may be using in other toothbrushes.  NOTE: The manual says you should only clean Sonicare ProResults brush heads in the sanitizer, but the Sonicare website lists four types of brushes that can be cleaned. I don&#x27;t know which is correct.&lt;br /&gt;9. The base of the sanitizer/charger has a groove where you can tuck away some of the power cord so it doesn&#x27;t dangle in loops from the point.&lt;br /&gt;10. It looks professional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes some getting used to, particularly if you have sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;2. This is basically a one person model, especially if you want to use both brushing heads yourself, but it comes with color code rings, so that if two people are sharing, you can code the brushing heads and store them in the UV sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;3. The standardbrush is a bit big for smaller mouths&lt;br /&gt;4. Replacements for the compact brush aren&#x27;t yet available for sale, and heads need to be changed every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;5. The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t fit firmly into the charger base, and I had to check to make sure I put it on correctly.  The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t balance well standing up with the brush head and cap attached.&lt;br /&gt;6. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it in the long run when you consider the cost of regular professional cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush, and look forward to using it for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated: 4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards, September 29, 2007toothbrush doesn&#x27;t fit firmly into the charger base, and I had to check to make sure I put it on correctly.

            <li> Makes my teeth shine like a new penny</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is expensive but it pays itself many times over.     I agree with all of the reviews here, but there is one thing more I wanna add. This tooth brush can even wipe out your cigarette tar. I used to have some cigarette tar underneath my teeth and the only way to get rid is to go to a dentist, but after using this for about 1 month, I am very happy that 80% of those black stains are gone. This alone is already worth the value.     And the more i use, the more i enjoy brushing my teeth cause the sensation from the vibration seems like a good message.     I also realize that my gums are not as sensitive as before or rather my gum has become stronger. I notice this when I am able to increase the power of my \\&quot;waterpik dental water jet\\&quot; (i use this for flossing) from level 3 to level 4 without feeling ache. That is a very good improvement.     5 stars for this.</li>
            <li> My wife is very concerned about keeping her teeth cleand and flossed.  This was a present for her and she really appreciated it more than the usual gifts I get her.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush! It&#x27;s a must! If you still thinking about getting one - stop and get it!  I have mine for over a year now. The battery works just fine, I even recharge it twice a month or so.   I noticed that performance with new brushheads are much better, so it&#x27;s better change it every 3 minths as suggested.  As for Sanitizer - I use mine when I remember. For some reason I don&#x27;t really trust it.  I recommend this toothbrush to anyone! It&#x27;s truly one of the best thing I have for my personal use!</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare. Our first one only lasted about 3 years, which isn&#x27;t toooooo bad, but it&#x27;s not great.   I recommend getting the sterilizer, it usually goes on sale for as-cheap or cheaper than the one without it.   My husband really likes this style brush because it has various timed settings.  It comes with a small brush head and a large brush head, travel charger and a case.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for $40 from craigslist a couple months ago after hearing from friends how great electronic toothbrushes were. I started using it on a regular basis and at first it was great. I just charged it up every 2 weeks and it helped to clean those hard to reach areas like the back of your teeth and molars.     But after about a months use the blue line on the toothbrush head already begun to recede indicating that I would soon need a new toothbrush head. So I starting looking on the internet and to my shock and dismay I found out that a pack of 3 replacement heads costs anywhere from $23-30. If you do the math that&#x27;s $7.50-10.00 per replacement head. At first, you may not even bat an eye at this price and assume that the price is somehow justified by the technology in the toothbrush head, but when you take a close look at the toothbrush head you&#x27;ll see that the head has no moving parts and that it&#x27;s the handle that simply vibrates. What&#x27;s more is that the head uses probably 30-40% less material and plastic than a regular toothbrush which on average costs $2-3. So can someone please explain why something that should logically cost less since it uses less materials and uses NO radical new technology in fact costs 300%-400% more than a conventional toothbrush and why you would pay for such an overpriced product? Is there anything to justify the ridiculous cost of these replacement heads? Also if they were going to charge me $10 per replacement head I would expect to last at least 6 months-1 year but if you read the product manual, they suggest that you replace it every 3 months so you&#x27;ll end up doling out $40 per year just for the toothbrush heads.    Another issue that irked me is that when you look at the toothbrush handle and read the instruction manual you&#x27;ll realize that it is run by a rechargeable lithium ion battery. As we all know, rechargeable batteries slowly lose their charging capacity throughout the life of its use (it&#x27;s called memory loss). A point that may not be as obvious is that this toothbrush is meant to slowly die out or be unusable within approximately 2 years. How do I know that? Look at the manufacturers warranty on the product; Its covered under warranty for only 2 years.     So lets say that your toothbrush finally dies after 2 years due to a worn out battery. So an economical and logical person would find out how much it would cost to buy a replacement battery and replace it instead of dropping another $120 on a brand new toothbrush. You&#x27;d find out that you can buy a replacement rechargeable lithium ion battery for this toothbrush for about $5. So when you go to replace the battery in the toothbrush you would think you just unscrew the bottom, pop out the old battery and pop in the new one. WRONG! They&#x27;ve made this product so that if you try to replace the battery by removing battery compartment from the body of the toothbrush it destroys the circuitry of the toothbrush rendering it broken and unusable. This is called PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE which means that Philips intentionally made these toothbrushes in such a way that they will mostly break down within 2 years so that you&#x27;re likely to drop another $120+ every 2 years to buy another one of these overpriced vibrators. If you want more info on planned obsolescence take a look at this short clip: [...]    Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking &#x27;Well I&#x27;ve had my electric toothbrush for 10 years and it still works fine&#x27;. Yes, there&#x27;s always going to be an exception, but you have to realize a simple fact which is that the sole interest of these large corporations be it Philips who manufactures this toothbrush, General Motors or Apple is PROFIT. This means that they will intentionally produce products that are specifically designed to break down or be unusable/incompatible within a specific time frame so that you buy their products over and over again thereby taking more of your money and increasing their profits. If you seriously thinkthat these corporations sit down and try to figure out how to produce the most efficient and durable product and thereby have your financial interest at hand, you need a serious reality check.     So what can you do to discourage planned obsolescence and not be subject to these low quality and overpriced products? It&#x27;s actually quite simple; DON&#x27;T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS! You have to realize that every time you purchase something whether it be an organic apple as opposed to a pesticide sprayed apple or a T-shirt made in the USA as opposed to a sweatshop in China, you have a direct impact on these corporations profits and that you have the ability to influence their future decisions. You are the lifeline of these corporations and they depend on you, the consumer, to buy their products in order to succeed and profit. If we all collectively stop buying their products then I can assure you they&#x27;ll start to listen and begin producing the types of high quality products that we demand.</li>
            <li> Once I was young and foolish too like many of u out there. Then, came the DENTIST. Oh NO:((((  But, I am glad that I went to the dentist and she suggested the Sonicare. I wanted to try it the 1st time she recommended. But boy was I lucky, they didnt have any at that time in their office. So, I waited and finally I was blessed with this great Sonicare Flexcare. I have been so impressed and thankful, coz for almost 2-3 years I had been suffering with sensitive teeth, only people who has it will understand my feeling; and now I am almost free of sensitive teeth becoz of this little Giant Flexcare. Thanx to its different settings I dont even feel any noise while I brush like some does. It&#x27;s not that noisy. But, everyone has there own sense of perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I dont like about this is that when I tried to change the brushheads I noticed little chalk collection underneath the colored ring it came with and so I had to remove it. I dont know if they have done something about this or not, but I didnt have fun removing the collection . But other than that I really like this flexcare. and I even loved the idea of UV Sanitizer which I at first thought was stupid idea. But after using it for a while now, I think it was worth price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the best thing about this, u can buy this toothbrush from ur dentist&#x27;s office w/rebate for around 100 bucks. its not a bad deal at all i guess for the toothbrush with uv sanitizer, which alone sells for around 50 bucks i guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i would recommend it to anyone wishing to switch to electric toothbrush from manual ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye Bye Sensitive Teeth.</li>
            <li> So far we are very satisfied with the product. I have not had an electric toothbrush for years but this one seems to do a good job and our dentist recommended it. Easy to use, easy to charge, easy to keep track of which brush belongs to each of us.</li>
            <li> This product is not for the faint of gums, and should be used only as directed. Achieves maximum results in a ridiculously short amount of time. Has 3 different modes: clean, sensitive, and massage (which greatly assists when cleaning/flushing gums). This massage program is perfect to gradually reduce the symptoms of gingivitis over time. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep oral hygiene tip-top on a regular basis, or someone who is experiencing oral problems (such as recurrent bad breath, or food stuck between teeth). It also comes with two brush-heads a standard for everyday cleaning, and a compact head to use in order to help clear food from the rear of the oral cavity and greatly assist in localized stain removal. This version of the toothbrush comes with a UV Sanitizer to give you that fresh-and-clean feeling everytime you brush, literally! Hope you fall in love with this toothbrush as much as I did. :) Cheers!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I am extremely pleased with it. I owned an Oral B rechargeable brush for about 5 years and was happy with it; it was only after purchasing the Sonicare Flexcare that I realised how much the technolgy had improved. The selection of the various programs which vary in both length and intensity is very easy and the dividing of all these into four quarters, marked by a slight interruption, is a great help in ensuring an all-round cleaning. After brushing, the gums have a pleasant healthy tingling. I rarely use the Sanitizer which is not a particularly useful addition; a quick swill under the tap serves me fine.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]   I was going to the dentist to do a cleaning every 3 months for many years and after I started using the Sonic Toothbrush my dentist told me that I was doing so good that he was going to change my cleanings to every 6 months.  Thanks for such a wonderful product.  I am living proof that it really works.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush and ordered a replacement, as the head when in use vibrates of the handle. Amazon customer service were very understanding and helped a lot. Thank you and hopefully this new one work better.    David</li>
            <li> Just like Phillips, their sonicare is an extremely most valuable product.  It does cost more, but this is not about price but about the quality of the product.  For it&#x27;s cost, when you think of how many in a family it can be utilized by, the cost is greatly effective.  If there are five in a family, this can be used by each one.  The brushes are all different and can be color coded so you don&#x27;t use someone elses brush.    So what was $150.00 is more like $30.00 per person.  Quite a value.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as promised, leaving you with the feeling that you&#x27;ve done all you can to protect your gums and teeth.  It reaches the hard to reach spots and keeps my dentist from lecturing me!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is a real value.  It works exceptionally well and is light weight.  It meets or exceeds all advertised capabilities.</li>
            <li> Was deciding between Braun and Sonicare.  At Dentist&#x27;s office they told me basically the same but Braun less expensive.  I ended up making my decision based on aesthetics and good price for this product.  Have been thrilled.  Has been years since used an electric toothbrush.  Makes a huge difference!  My teeth feel like just left dentist&#x27;s office (and whiter).</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it.  Had gum disease and just got work done---dentist recommended the sonicare flexcare.  The price was high, but after reading the reviews and doing some research I finally bought this toothbrush.  I&#x27;m so glad I did, it is well worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> the flex-care from Sonic-care is even better than our orginal Sonic-care toothbrush, the vibration is very intense and soothing at the same time</li>
            <li> This is simply the best toothbrush ever!  Our teeth feel and look so much cleaner since using this and it is great for my arthritic hands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this brush for a little over a year, so I&#x27;m very familiar with it&#x27;s pros and cons.  Most everyone has gone over the benefits pretty well (it works great cleaning teeth, charge lasts a long time, etc) so I&#x27;m going to focus on the issues I&#x27;ve had.    * Gunky buildup under the brush head, and it&#x27;s hard to clean in there  * I still accidentally hit the poorly-placed mode button quite often, causing the brush to change modes mid-brush.  Mostly just annoying; the button should not have been placed here, or should not  be so easy to activate.  * Most significantly, I had to get the whole thing replaced just now.  The brush stopped charging properly, and started sounding some kind of error code (2 short buzzes and one long one, \\&quot;dot dot dash\\&quot;, over and over again).  Started spontaneously turning on sometimes to, like it&#x27;s possessed!    I&#x27;m only dinging it one star for all this because their support was great, I was able to get though quickly, and got my warranty claim approved in 5 minutes.  I&#x27;m very happy they have a 2 year warranty!  I would have been SOL with a one-year warranty...      I&#x27;d probably rate this 3.75-3.50 stars if i could, but 3 seems too low.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Toothbrush Sanitizer, has to be the best electric toothbrush in the market. With the brushing options, the auto shutoff sanitizer, and the ease of use, is well worth buying. I should have bought this model long ago.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me for years to try the Sonicare and I thought they were just trying to sell me something.  I finally got one two months ago and I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  My teeth feel so much cleaner than they did with a brush.  One of my kids had a dentist visit last week, and his teeth were much better than they used to be.    The vibration might bother you the first couple uses, but after that you&#x27;ll never want to use a regular brush again.  Four of us have been sharing the unit with no problems.  I just wish Sonicare would provide more brightly colored rings.  The dark blue is great, but the gray, light blue and light green look too similar to easily differentiate the heads.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have this item in the beginning.  After a couple of uses the toothbrush head came loose while brushing.  I turned it off and pressed the head down and took a good look at it.  Thought it was all okay after that then the next use, the same thing.  The vibrating became louder and sure enough, the head was loose again.  Maybe it has something to do with the vibrating or the head needs to lock on.  Perhaps the one I received was defective?  I&#x27;m not sure but I had to send mine back because it kept happening.  If I can get one that doesn&#x27;t do that I will be happy because it does a GREAT job of cleaning!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Of couse, I was a user of the previous version but alas after 5 years they battery would not hold a charge.  I bought two of these, one for me and one for my wife.  Sometimes when I travel, we both need our own unit.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews on this site prior to ordering the new units and I must say that I am a disappointed.  This is probably because my old Sonicare unit was very durable, despite the fact that the old screw on brushes and handheld unit got a lot of funky gunk inside of it and was disgusting to try to clean.    I was excited to get these new brushes and loved it for the first couple of weeks.  Then I went on vacation and took them with us.  After two days away, my brush head started getting loose on the hand unit and I had to be very careful not to exert any extra motion or movement.  It actually fell off a couple of times during normal brushing.    I know that the other reviewers are going to say that I should stop whining and go back to a manual brush, but, I loved my old 7300 series units.  I think that Sonicare did a great thing to upgrade the systems, but they are not as durable and practical as the old ones.    Sorry guys, but I am having a hard time figuring out what the designers were thinking of when they designed brush heads that can&#x27;t withstand the vibrations of the hand units.    I am going to try and check in with Sonicare and will update if things get better.</li>
            <li> This is just what my mouth needed!  I bought one for my husband first, then I just had to have one for myself.  I feel like I just left the dentists&#x27; chair each time I brush!</li>
            <li> Love how fresh and clean Philips Sonicare Flexcare Toothbrush makes my mouth, teeth and breath feel.  Makes oral hygiene fun, ranks next to godliness.</li>
            <li> I love every feature of this product. I especially like the sensitive setting. It applies pressure yet feels gentle to the teeth. The sanitizer is an extra feature my previous one did not have.   My old sonicare literally died after about 20 years of recharging.  If this one lasts even one half of that time, I would feel I got an excellent deal. My hygienist recommended it in part because the replacement heads are less expensive than most.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Sonicare Advance for the past 4 years. I see some nice improvements over that model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gunk doesn&#x27;t build up anymore. The Sonicare Advance toothbrush heads had a plastic skirt that was twisted on. That and the gap between the toothbrush head and the backing was a major repository of smelly toothpaste remnants. I often had to use hydrogen peroxide to dissolve the stuff. This is no longer the case with this model since there is no plastic skirt and no plastic plate behind the toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Thin, long toothbrush allows for better reach. The difference here is also very noticeable. Better maneuverability in your mouth means better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaped/Curved bristles allow for better cleaning. I feel that the curved bristles here also give me better coverage on my teeth. The old Sonicare Advance one had all of the bristles lined up. The Flexcare bristles are like a modern toothbrush with contours to match my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the 3 improvements above. Had I known about this sooner, I would have upgraded sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe (for which I am deducting a star) is the placement of the power on/off button. This is the green button that you see on the toothbrush. It&#x27;s positioned to easily turn on the tooth brush since it&#x27;s where your thumb would naturally rest. But this also makes it very easy to accidentally turn off when you are moving the toothbrush around and twisting your wrist. If tend to do other things when you brush your teeth, you might not notice the toothbrush turning off and will be depriving yourself of the recommended 2 minutes of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (3/11/09): I would deduct an additional star if this were possible here. I had a nasty case of mold on the base. I hadn&#x27;t used the UV sanitizer in a while, so the sanitizer door was closed for a few weeks. You really need to use a towel to dry off the toothbrush before placing it back on the base. If you don&#x27;t water from the toothbrush seeps under the sanitizer door giving you a nasty mold growth that&#x27;s as wide as the door. Philips should have designed the base of below where the toothbrush stands with a slope so water won&#x27;t creep under the sanitizer door. Very nasty.r giving you a nasty mold growth that&#x27;s as wide as the door. Philips should have designed the base of below where the toothbrush stands with a slope so water won&#x27;t creep under the sanitizer door. Very nasty.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my dentist, and although pricey, it&#x27;s worth it!  My teeth feel really clean. The unit has two size brushes, and as I have a small palate, the smaller size brush fits my mouth well. I like the UV sanitizer too. The vibration is intense, but I started with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting and within 1-2 weeks I was using the \\&quot;maxcare\\&quot; setting.    Some advice from other reviewers here came in handy: close your mouth so spray doesn&#x27;t goes all over the place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perplexed by the people who give this brush a low rating.  I&#x27;ve had mine since fall of 2009, and have had NO problems.  I use the sanitizer daily, and I leave the brush on the charger.  Sanitizer and battery both still fine.  Also, no problems with the brush coming off in use (I don&#x27;t use the colored collars).  The only minor issue I have is that the plastic coating on the back of the brush is peeling off.</li>
            <li> I like the different speeds &amp; the tanning bed for the brush (sanitizer).  Can&#x27;t go wrong with lifetime guarantee.  I am going to guess the ROI (lower dental bills) is less than a year.</li>
            <li> SUPERIOR CLEANING. WELL-MADE, EASY TO USE. FEELS LIKE PROFESSIONAL TOOL IN DENTIST&#x27;S OFFICE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I was given the suggestion of getting one of these by my dental hygienist during a recent visit.  So I searched around Amazon for info on the various models and read many reviews, most of which were very positive.  The only negatives I recall reading about this model were by some who felt it was noisier and/or has more vibration in the hand than some other Sonicare model they had used previously.  Not having experienced any product of this kind before, I&#x27;m in no position to make such comparisons, but IMO the level of noise and vibration is quite reasonable.  It does take a few uses to get completely accustomed to the experience, but the end result is remarkable.  My teeth and gums really do feel much like they do following a checkup at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I only wish I&#x27;d found this thing years ago!</li>
            <li> With six people in our family, we have tried every toothbrush/system available on the market.  Christmas of 2007, my eldest son asked for a new Sonicare system.  After researching and pricing the different Sonicare products available, I chose to get him this Flexcare system.  Since then, every member of my family has asked for it.  Our dentist noticed a difference, particularly with our gums and back teeth.  We love the sanitizer, and although I could be giving it undo credit, there have been no colds or sore throats since we have been using it.  We also like the different program modes at the touch of button for different brushing experiences.  We give it five stars and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years, ever since the first model. It is clear that this is the best on the market and my dentist will attest to that statement. While all models have done their job better than anything else, this one is the best yet. It is smaller, lighter and quieter while cleaning even better than the previous models. The battery charge lasts twice as long as the previous ones and the sanitizer is a great addition. If you like your teeth and wish to take them to your grave, your best chance is to floss and use a Sonicare every day.</li>
            <li> I have an immune disorder that causes problems with periodontal disease. My dentist recommended that I purchase the Sonicare Toothbrush with the UV sanitizer. I had an older version of the Sonicare Toothbrush years ago, and this new version is vastly superior. I love the slimmer profile and the UV sanitizer. The new brushing modes make it virtually impossible to brush your teeth wrong. I love the way my mouth and teeth feel after using this toothbrush. It truly is \\&quot;a just from the dentist clean\\&quot;. If this continues to perform the way it has so far I will be very happy. It is a little costly on the price, but definitely cheaper than major dental work. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants a whiter smile and healthier teeth.</li>
            <li> Thsi toothbrush really cuts down on the placque. Use the toothbrush for 4 minutes top and bottom and you will not have placque! love the uv cleaner attached to the base of holder, so you always have a clean brush to insert onto the toothbrush. This is the best Sonic toothbrush to be marketed to date.....</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush and I&#x27;m pleased to say it&#x27;s even better than the first or second.  Both my husband and I each own the Sonicare and we both love it.  Our teeth feel like we just came from the denist&#x27;s office and our gums are much healthier.  The timer is great because we know we&#x27;ve brushed long enough to keep our teeth clean and healthy.  Try it once and you&#x27;ll NEVER go back to any other kind.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but the wife wanted this. My teeth feel like i&#x27;ve just had a cleaning at the dentist office all the time! A little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the Sonicare by Phillips.  It performs wonderfully well  and it helps to keep my teeth squeeky clean.  Packing was great.</li>
            <li> i bought this toothbrush set per my dentist advice.&lt;br /&gt;truly love it as i get a thorough brush with the best results.&lt;br /&gt;the Consumer Reports and ADA rating are great testimony....</li>
            <li> It was delivered in the European version so I have&lt;br /&gt;to use a converter to plug it in in the US.  When I&lt;br /&gt;notified the seller they sent me a travel part which&lt;br /&gt;also was not for the US.  I just decided it was not&lt;br /&gt;worth the trouble and am using it the best I can.&lt;br /&gt;I will not order electrical products in the future unless&lt;br /&gt;I am familiar with the seller.</li>
            <li> The good: the toothbrush does a very good job of keeping one&#x27;s teeth cleaner than a manual toothbrush.  My wife has an OralB electric that she formerly used.  She believes the FlexCare does a superior job of cleaning.    The bad: the first was bought in Dec. 2007 and died within a year.  With the UV sterilizer it costs a whopping $140.  Plus the costly brush heads.    The good again: The first failed unit was replaced under warranty with no problems.    The bad again: The second one just died in May 2011.  Overall, we got 3 and 1/4 years of use from 2 units.    The ugly: Philips business model for the toothbrushes appears to be the same as for their Norelco shaving products - make a nice product that dies after a year or two.  Make the batteries non-interchangeable so that when the batteries fail, the unit is trash.    The conclusion: I am considering replacing the FlexCare with the Healthy White version, saving about $30.  We never really used the extra features of the FlexCare.  If I do buy the Healthy White, it is with my eyes open to the fact that it may only last 2 - 3 years, but hopefully provides comparable results to the FlexCare.</li>
            <li> The best one so far. I usually upgrade every few years, and the last one to be replaced was one of the Sonicare toothbrushes which I also liked. The new one with its smaller brush head and slenderer stem is easier to use.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare does a better job for me than any of the competing products.  My dental hygienist thinks so too.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare-but this model seems to have not been tested enough. On the first one I received the UV light wasn&#x27;t working. Amazon replaced that one and the next one on the toothbrush the brush head connector stopped working so the toothbrush head would just wiggle around. I&#x27;m on my third one and so far okay...it really does clean and I love the UV sanitizer-just worried that in a few weeks, months it also will have some glitzes.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. It&#x27;s the second Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned. I mistakenly plugged in my prior one to a 220 volt source while traveling in Korea. The old one handled only 110V. The new one featured here handles both 120 and 220V. Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is an Amazing toothbrush, with 40,000 strokes a minute it does the job!     I had no idea the 30 second noise sounded so \\&quot;built in\\&quot;. It&#x27;s like a pause in the brush head that makes an audible change in pitch to let you know to move on.    The toothbrush holds an ample charge, the brushing settings are okay they get the job done. My gums love the message setting. The UV Sanitizer is a great feature also. Nothing like knowing that -anything- drifting in your bathroom could also be drifting onto your toothbrush and into your mouth! This keeps the heads covered and cleans them for the next use!     Well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a good product that works as advertised.  Oral B has an alternate head that fits in narrower spaces if that&#x27;s an issue for you.  Customer service is poor.  When I had an issue with using the promised rebates, their response was to quote me the legalize and to make sure I understood why I was wrong.  That&#x27;s not customer service.  Based on that experience alone, I don&#x27;t recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Sonicare due to the recommendation of my Dentist.  Works much better than a standard toothbrush.  Good pricing compared against the big retailers.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My dentist she recommended this toothbrush which according to her would help my gengivitis. I did some research since I was confused with all the different models and I wanted to get a best buy - the best for my money.  As part of the research I called Philips and told them my intention to get it on Ebay. The young man adviced me to get it through Amazon, since they honor the warranty b/c they have no way of knowing who sells them on Ebay or where they get their toothbrushes.    Since I am so used to buying on Ebay, I continued my search with them and finally ordered the one I was sure was a best buy. I just made sure I&#x27;d check the reputation of the seller which was good and ask them if the box was sealed.  She responded that yes, it was closed and brand new...    I just received my best buy.  Not only the box was not sealed... but the hard plastic inside had been broken (which means it has been opened and taken out) but also the battery had been charged and the small wire that holds together the electric cords had been messed with.    Now I am left with doubts... I already contacted the seller telling her that I am contacting her before I write the feedback to allow her the chance to make amends but I am facing now a situation which I could have avoided had I listened to the young guy at Philips.    So, just so you know! Maybe, if I get lucky, it has NOT been used. YUCK!</li>
            <li> First time I have purchaed an electric tooth brush.  This works great and my dentist wanted me to buy an electric model from them until I told them I had purchased the Philips Sonicare, they were pleased with my choice as well as I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  Better than any other electronic toothbrush on the market.  You will feel a significant difference in cleanliness when you use this compared to a regular toothbrush.  The sanitizer also works great too.</li>
            <li> I returned to Sonicare after my Oral B Professional died (after several years of good service). I have to say that I&#x27;m probably back with Sonicare for good. This brush is not nearly as loud as the Oral B was, but it seems to brush even more effectively. It also has push on brush heads, which is a huge improvement over the old locknut design. The little sanitizer is nice to have when you have an OCD moment about brush cleanliness, however this would still be a great toothbrush without the feature.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, Love this product!! I have sensative teeth, and also felt that regular toothbrushes were not cleaning my teeth the way I wanted them too. About 8 months ago I asked my dentist what electric toothbrush he would recommend.  He recommended the Phillips Sonicare Flexcare rechargeable Sonic Toothbrsh. At first, i thouht it was too expensive and was not going to buy it.  I did some research and read some reviews that I thought were very helpful.  I liked the idea of having my toothbrush sanitized evertime I brush my teeth. Therefore, I purchased the sonic toothbrush with the sanitizer.  It was a little more expesive, but definetly well worth it.  It took about 3 times using it before I liked how it felt on my teeth.   My 3 children (ages 11, 10 &amp; 6) also use it, they love it as well.  My dentist and I have noticed how whiter my teeth are since I have been using this electric toothbrush.  I have since bought another one for the kids bathroom.  So, if you are searching for an electric toothbrush this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very annoyed with Sonicare!!  I bought their original electric toothbrush and loved it.  A year ago I bought the new one and it irritated my gums so badly I had to go back to the original toothbrush...thank goodness I kept it.  I attempted to buy new heads for the old model and they don&#x27;t make them anymore.  I called the company to complain but got nowhere with them.  I would like to know how many senior citizens were upset when they attempted to buy new heads and they weren&#x27;t available.  NOT EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY IS RICH LIKE THE CEO OF Sonicare!!!  Hence I&#x27;m on the search for another electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have owned this toothbrush for three years.  It is very expensive when you consider that you replace the brush head (~$7 each,) 4x a year. It cleans nicely but the light for the sanitizer burned out after one year of use (and we only used it maximum of once a week.)  They have a two year warranty, but we didn&#x27;t turn it in.  Then one day, I picked it up to use it and it was broken.   The top where you attach the brush head was loose and no longer vibrated.  Instead the body of the brush vibrated and as a lot louder.  Friends of ours had the same toothbrush and experienced the SAME thing!  We called Philips and there was nothing they could do but give us a 15% coupon off our next purchase.  We are going to try Oral B, it is a little cheaper and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of pricey but it was recommended to me by my dentist. Even though I am not big on spending that much on a tooth brush, I went with it. It&#x27;s still cheaper then to pay for dentures....in the future. And I love this brush. It has very good pressure control, which was my problem with the manual brushing. It&#x27;s a bit noisy but I can put up with it for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare products for years and have progressively moved up the product line.  This new Flexcare model is as they say, lighter, sleeker, smaller, but they did not mention its also louder than any other model.  I did a side by side comparison using my older elite 7300 and the new flexcare model is much louder and raspier than the older unit.  I called Sonicare today and they confirmed that the flexcare model is louder, but has less vibrations in the hand.  Big deal. I expected it to be much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dislike with the previous Sonicare models was the large screw-on brush head that would build up an ugly gunk on the inside of it, but no more, the brush head is completely new and similar to the Oral-B type. The brush head now just snaps on.  So say goodbye to the gunky,icky build up in the brush head and handle on the previous models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s a fantastic product but a little noisier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 05/01/2009:  the extra noise I first encountered has gone away.  Maybe Sonic care redesigned the brush heads? or maybe the brush just broke in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/23?2009, My unit failed the other day, just stopped working. Thankfully this unit has a two year warranty. Called Philips and they are sending out a brand new one free of charge. Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 02FEB2010: the replacement unit just broke.  Unit fails to turn on, and works intermittently. I think it&#x27;s a switch problem.  All of a sudden while sitting in my den, the unit started up by itself, scared the you know what out of me..!!!@#$%^@!</li>
            <li> This really is the evolution of the toothbrush. The only thing that might hold one back is the cost. I suppose a lack of electricity could hold one back as well, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this toothbrush is great. You really do feel the difference. Not only that, but my dentists repeatedly told me about how good these things are. They didn&#x27;t sell them either. Or at least my most recent one didn&#x27;t, and that was the dentist who really impressed me and I went out and got a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for around 3 months now and the biggest con so far is the noise. It&#x27;s not terribly loud, but it&#x27;s loud enough that you probably won&#x27;t want to use it around a light sleeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this thing lasts for at least a few years then I will be happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, the brush heads are somewhat pricey and the blue indicator bristle section seems to run out much faster than the recommended 3 months. I get the feeling that Philips wants me to buy and replace bristles far too often simply for profit.</li>
            <li> Totaly great!!! Just in a week my teeth were healthier and cleaner. It is never to late to start good hygene start today.  You don&#x27;t need the whitner when you brush twice a day either. Even on old stains it will take a bit but you can see the difference. If you get the water pic like I did you have the perfect clean mouth and no bad breath. You won&#x27;t need the burning, awful tasting, mouthwash.     Don&#x27;t even hesitate about the price because you will save in the long run by miles. And your mouth feels great.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this works. My teeth got noticeably whiter after just one brushing. Sure, it&#x27;s a lot of money for a toothbrush. But if you use this gizmo as instructed you won&#x27;t have to do anything else to keep your teeth clean. Buying it is a better investment than any tooth-whitening product.</li>
            <li> I have used a previous Sonicare model a few years ago, and most recently a Braun.  This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.  It is quiet and does not vibrate, has great features, and has a very high quality feel and appearance.  It is also nice to know that your toothbrush is clean every time with the UV cleaner.  I questioned the cost when I purchased, but now I believe it is worth every cent.  The actual cleaning is better than any other toothbrush I have used, and it is very easy to use.  I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now.  One final point - the new design is easy to keep clean.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been a very happy Oral-B (Braun) user for about the last 4 years.  During that time I&#x27;ve gone through 2 of their higher-end brushes.  I&#x27;ve never been one to bad-mouth Sonicare, because it&#x27;s a good brush, but I just preferred the smaller size of the Oral-B, along with the pop-off brush heads.  Now however, Sonicare has changed that with their new model, the Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this model because it was recommended by a dentist who said that the new Flexcare is not just a new style of brush, but that it actually has a greatly improved brushing technology.  So, I bought a brush online and proceeded to try it out.  Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used the Flexcare, it doesn&#x27;t even seem possible to compare it to my old Oral-B (which is only a year old.)  This brush actually seems 20 years more advanced, and that is not an exaggeration.  It has a bit of a high-pitch to it which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but the real story is in the vibration.  The brush seems to work exponentially better with 80% less vibration; it&#x27;s a dream to use.  I actually get sad after it auto-shuts off after the brushing cycle, something that I wish it didn&#x27;t do.  Also, and perhaps most important, is that it feels like it cleans my teeth better than my Oral-B.  After using the Flexcare for awhile, I went back to my old Oral-B, just to compare...  As soon as I turned it on, I couldn&#x27;t believe that I loved it so much, it felt like, and sounded like an antique in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different brushing modes on the Flexcare are really nice, but there is a small problem with all your options.  One thing I&#x27;d like to be able to do is to \\&quot;program\\&quot; the brush to do the 3-minute brushing mode every time by default (this mode does the brushing action and also the massage action.)  However, whenever you place the brush back on the charger, it automatically resets back to the 2-minute brushing mode.  Programming the brush for the mode that you like every time you pick it up is not hard, but it&#x27;s really annoying.  Sonicare: please fix this in later models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush comes with 2 chargers, one for home (with the sanitizer) and a travel one (without a sanitizer.) It also comes with a brush head cover, and a travel pouch to put the wand in.  These accessories will make traveling with my brush much more enjoyable.  I&#x27;ve never understood why more electric toothbrush makers don&#x27;t include or even make these accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-off brush heads (as compared to sonicare&#x27;s old screw on heads) are fantastic and much better than the Oral-B pop-off ones.  On my Oral-B I had to remove the brush head to wash out the gunk after brushing, but because the Sonicare brush heads are longer, very, very litle gunk gets in them.  That was a pleasant surprise.  Although, removing and attaching the brush head on the Flexcare wand requires a lot more force, which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The U.V. sanitizer is a nice gadget, but who knows how useful it really is?  In fact, there may even be some long-term immune system dangers by killing every bacteria/virus in sight, just like using anti-bacterial soap, but this is not the forum for that.  I used the UV Sanitizer a few times, but I don&#x27;t use it at all anymore because of what I believe to be a very real problem with all the anti-bacterial products out there these days.  Although, based on the few times I did use it, I could see where its utilization on a daily basis would be cumbersome.  If you brush twice a day, it becomes too much of a bother to remove the brush head every time and put it in the sanitizer.  The brush head needs to be aligned perfectly in the sanitizer and the door closed and snapped gently.  If you have big hands, putting the brush head into the sanitizer is more awkward, especially if you&#x27;re using the large brush head (FYI: the brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to see that Sonicare has FINALLY ditched the NiCad batteries and went to Li-ion batteries; what took so long?  This change means that the brush will now run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.  It&#x27;s also the reason that the brush handle is now smaller which makes it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love this brush, I do realize that the price Sonicare has marketed it at is exceedingly high.  If I were to buy it again, I would save $20 and get the one without the U.V. sanitizer.  Other than the high price and a little nitpicking on the brushing modes, I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  Oral-B has a LONG way to go to catch up to this Sonicare model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;Update 29 November 07&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush still continues to amaze me and I LOVE using it everyday.  I&#x27;ve stopped using the charging station with the UV Sanitizer and I now only use the \\&quot;travel charger\\&quot; for everyday use at home.  One nice benefit in changing to the very, very small travel charger was that I freed up some space on my bathroom counter, and the brush is easier to set down and pickup without the sanitizer being in the way.  I can&#x27;t understand one reviewer who said the brush doesn&#x27;t sit right or balance well on the stand.  Also, I have sensitive teeth and use a sensitive toothpaste, and the brushes&#x27; actions have not bothered me at all.  I&#x27;d buy this brush again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;Update 17 Nov 11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this brush for just over 4 years and it has performed admirably, until today that is.  Today it just died, completely dead.  There must be something wrong with the brush because this should not have happened in only 4 years.  I also don&#x27;t keep it on the charging stand and only charge it when it needs it.  It is very annoying to say the least.  I will be buying another because I do love it, but at nearly a hundred bucks, I&#x27;m not happy about it at all...  I&#x27;ve since adjusted my rating down a star because of this.  I hope that you have better luck.  By the way, my old old Braun brush that I talk about in this review?  Yeah, it still works... just saying...means that the brush will now run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand.  It&#x27;s also the reason that the brush handle is now smaller which makes it more manageable.    As much as I love this brush, I do realize that the price Sonicare has marketed it at is exceedingly high.  If I were to buy it again, I would save $20 and get the one without the U.V. sanitizer.  Other than the high price and a little nitpicking on the brushing modes, I really couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  Oral-B has a LONG way to go to catch up to this Sonicare model.    -------  Update 29 November 07  The brush still continues to amaze me and I LOVE using it everyday.

One nice benefit in changing to the very, very small travel charger was that I freed up some space on my bathroom counter, and the brush is easier to set down and pickup without the sanitizer being in the way.  I can&#x27;t understand one reviewer who said the brush doesn&#x27;t sit right or balance well on the stand.  Also, I have sensitive teeth and use a sensitive toothpaste, and the brushes&#x27; actions have not bothered me at all.  I&#x27;d buy this brush again in a heartbeat.  ------  Update 17 Nov 11  I&#x27;ve had this brush for just over 4 years and it has performed admirably, until today that is.  Today it just died, completely dead.  There must be something wrong with the brush because this should not have happened in only 4 years.  I also don&#x27;t keep it on the charging stand and only charge it when it needs it.  It is very annoying to say the least.  I will be buying another because I do love it, but at nearly a hundred bucks, I&#x27;m not happy about it at all...  I&#x27;ve since adjusted my rating down a star because of this.  I hope that you have better luck.  By the way, my old old Braun brush that I talk about in this review?  Yeah, it still works... just saying...</li>
            <li> I thought my dentist was crazy for recommending this toothbrush. Especially after he handed me a manual toothbrush for free in my sample packet. Well I bought and tried and LOVE IT! It does tkae a little getting used to with all the vibrations but I definitely feel like my mouth is more clean and I have improved dental health. My husband also started using it, there are two mounts in the UV bulbs cleaning area so it&#x27;s easy to share. They come with colored bands so you don&#x27;t mix up the heads.</li>
            <li> I will never brush again!  This is an excellent product and a bargain and once you use it, you will be hooked for life!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lazy person when it comes to dental hygiene.  Genetically I&#x27;ve been blessed with good teeth but my mouth chemistry promotes plaque and my gums suffer (deep pockets).  As a result I would require regular cleanings every four months.  And every few years I need the expensive deep gum cleaning treatment ($300.00+).  My dentist suggested I try the new Sonicare Flexcare tootbrush that he sells for retail. I said I would think about it and found the same model elsewhere for far less.  Anyway this brush completely turned around my dental health.  My gums no longer bleed, teeth feel polished everyday, and notice a slight whitening effect.  And no more plaque build up on the back of my lower teeth!  On my last dental checkup my dentist was amazed at the results.  He stated that I can go back to a six month cleaning schedule.  My gum pockets are back to normal!  This tootbrush is excellent!</li>
            <li> In the past I used one of those old Sonicare models, and eventually it broke, but this x mas I was given this model and I LOVE it! Your teeth will feel as smooth as glass after using it, like you have just gotten out of the dentist, or better! The UV sanitizer is awesome too, although Ive heard that the bulbs burn out eventually and they aren&#x27;t covered in the warranty. I have had no problems so far with the flexcare, and I would recommend this brush to any person of any age. The handle is also slimmer and more comfortable to hold, the design couldn&#x27;t be better! Your teeth are worth it, buy this product!    Update (July 12th, 2009): I&#x27;m still using the brush with no problems at all. I switched to the compact brush head and it fits my mouth much better than the full sized one. My sanitizer is still working, and I am still very satisfied with this product. It literally cleans your teeth so well that when you floss it feels as though you&#x27;ve already flossed because your teeth are so clean. I can&#x27;t even stand using a regular tooth brush anymore, and I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back ;)</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 is my first electric toothbrush. I have owned it for about a month and am very pleased so far. My teeth and gums feel great after brushing (I like the massage setting), and I am very satisfied with the how clean my teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and comes with an informative instruction manual.</li>
            <li> Have used a Sonicare brush for the past 4-5 years.  This one is a huge improvement.  It is lighter, quieter, much better brushhead design and the battery lasts and lasts (so far). Not totally convinced by the need for UV cleaning but this is very neat for storing our brush heads anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a Sonicare e-series for about a year before switching to the FlexCare model and I love it!  It&#x27;s easier to hold, lighter in the hand, and has smoother vibrations.  The best part is probably the ease of cleaning, since the FlexCare model has much fewer crevices to trap the gunk.  The UV cleaner is also a neat and very convenient attachment---I like that I can fit two brush heads in at once and it makes me feel healthier every time I use it.</li>
            <li> work perfect as it tells, my teeth are getting shining after buzz it. the carrier and charger support versatile voltage: 120v-240v which means it can work in US, Asian, and Europe, wonder philip product and would like to recommend to every friend.</li>
            <li> I started using UltraSonics consistantly when my Dentist asked how I was keeping my teeth so clean between checkups. Have always purchased Sonicare Ultrasonics.    This is a very good toothbrush with easily accessible features. Highly recommended. Some may feel price is high but I think it&#x27;s worth it for an appliance used this often.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare gives you that \\&quot;dental cleaning\\&quot; great feel.  The toothbrush handle is lighter and easier to handle than the original Sonicare style.      Now for the bad.  The toothbrush head would not fit flush on the handle.  There was a slim gap between the base of the brush head and the control/handle unit.  This then 1. Caused the toothbrush head to come loose and at times to pop off.  2. Because of the gap and the looseness, the brush cleaning selection malfunctioned.  While brushing in the clean mode, it would switch to the \\&quot;massage mode\\&quot; or the \\&quot;sensitive mode\\&quot;.  At first I thought I was accidentally touching the selection button by mistake while brushing.  But, I believe now it is related to the poorly fitting toothbrush head not seated properly and snug on the poorly designed/or manufactured \\&quot;metal rod fitting\\&quot;.    I contacted Philips Sonicare using their \\&quot;Live Chat\\&quot;.  After a short discussion of the problem and giving the rep. the model number and serial number of my unit, I was told a new Flexcare would be sent out to me and arrive in a week.  A return label will be included to return the defective toothbrush.    Philips has excellent customer care.  However, whoever is manufacturing these units are not doing a great job of quality control.  Chinese made? Says so on the box, but the Flexcare says that the unit was assembled in the U.S.    My original Sonicare was still working but I was getting tired of cleaning it and the brush was a bit heavy and cumbersome.  My original Sonicare was over 12 years old and still doing well.   Philips....you have a great product...please make a more reliable product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Sonicare toothbrushes over the years. There were minor problems with each of them. But, their effectiveness kept me coming back.  The first ones got cracks in them (their support people told me toothpaste with hydrogen peroxide caused them).  The more recent models I had (including the one that dispenses toothpaste) collected saliva in the heads and in a cavity in the handle.  Bacteria grew in them that made the toothbrush absolutely disgusting!  But, I knew Philips had to get that right eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the FlexCare Rechargable.  The problems of the past have been fixed.  My last couple of SonicCare&#x27;s withstood my toothpaste fine.  So, I&#x27;m expecting this one will too.  The handle has been slimmed down and there is no place to saliva to collect inside the toothbrush.  The addition of the UV Sanitizer is quite nice. And, even without the UV, it&#x27;s great to have a place to stick your brushhead so that it&#x27;s not sitting out on the bathroom counter all day collecting flying bacteria from the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several brush modes now.  I only use one- full power baby!  This thing gets your teeth cleaner than you can imagine.  I build plaque in a couple of places. Right behind my lower teeth in the front is one.  I was due for a cleaning at the dentist about 2-3 weeks after getting the brush.  The plaque is smooth normally, so I don&#x27;t notice.  But, a couple of days after getting the brush, it actually took some of the plaque off that the older brush was missing.  I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is quite expensive.  But, if you have the gum problems I potentially could have (because of the plaque build up), it&#x27;s worth it. I had a dentist keep telling me, I needed to come every 3-4 months for \\&quot;scaling and planing\\&quot; and that got to be very expensive. Since getting this Sonicares, my gum checkups have been stellar.  I&#x27;m on a normal six month rotation and the brush has, in actuality, saved me money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace,&lt;br /&gt;Brian</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush going back over 10 years.  I think this is the best one ever and totally worth the money.  I really hesitated before spending so much but am very satisfied that I did.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> UV Sanitizer:  I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years and I love, love, love them!  With frequent sinus infections, strep, pneumonia, bronchitis, and other illnesses, I&#x27;m all too grateful to have the UV sanitizer, and don&#x27;t mind taking a  fraction of a minute&#x27;s time twice a day to prevent re-infection and/or throwing away so many toothbrushes.    Sensitive teeth:  Having extremely sensitive teeth, I had my doubts when my hygienist recommended Sonicare, but was relieved to find it to be gentler than a manual toothbrush with extra-soft bristles.      Timer:  I tend to brush longer than the longest cycle, so as soon as the timer automatically turns off the brush, I \\&quot;automatically\\&quot; press the power button and continue brushing without missing a beat.     Twelve years ago I used to pooh pooh electric toothbrushes, but my first Sonicare quickly made a convert of me.  So, thanks to my dental hygienist for introducing me to Sonicare, and thanks to Philips for keeping a healthy smile on my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of two minds on this product.  On the one hand, it&#x27;s incredibly effective and, in my opinion, the best powered toothbrush out there.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the new, slim, snap-on heads as a great improvement over those gunk-collecting screw top types.  All of the other pluses mentioned by other reviewers are all true:  works incredibly well, Quadtimer is great, new head design is terrific, it&#x27;s smaller and slimmer than earlier models, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, and it&#x27;s a significant but, this is the third Sonicare toothbrush in our household that has died literally days after the end of the warranty period.  I&#x27;m so exasperated by this!!  It&#x27;s a lot of money to put out every two years for a product that should really have greater durability.  Given that Sonicare is a behemoth in this product market, has been doing this awhile, and gets a lot of feedback on this one major and frequent complaint, one would think they would have better addressed the durability issue by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose they realize they&#x27;re getting away with it, because people like me bite the bullet and give it another try simply becaue it works so stinking well.  Next time, though, I&#x27;m giving the newest generation Sonicare competitors another look to see if they&#x27;ve caught up.  It&#x27;s entirely possible they will.</li>
            <li> I probably wrote a review before...or not...but I&#x27;m not looking through seven hundred other reviews to find out.  I went to the dentist yesterday; after the hygienist finished,(this included the picking and probing and cleaning), she told me things looked really good.  I told her it could only be attributed to this particular toothbrush (never had a comment from her while using the Braun), brushing three, four minutes when I used it.  I have to say I don&#x27;t use with any regularity the side attachment to where the toothbrush is stored; there&#x27;s no particular good reason for my NOT using it.  But I always feel, after I brush, that my teeth feel really clean.  I recommend this particular brush, even in a less expensive presentation.  I think Phillips is really on to something with an electric toothbrush that works as effectively as this one does.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade for an Elite Sonicare I happily owned for a year. And I must say, this product has everything I missed from the last one: it&#x27;s perfect. My main concerns with the previous toothbrush was it worse than average Ni-Cd battery, it&#x27;s non-universal charger, and the rigidity of its 2-minute timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare improves in all these aspects:&lt;br /&gt;- Great Li-Ion battery: can recharge the toothbrush anytime without worrying about breaking the battery.&lt;br /&gt;- Universal travel charger: great to take anywhere. (especially for anyone like me living in a 220V country)&lt;br /&gt;- Plenty of brushing programs: I specially love the GoCare for when I&#x27;m in real hurry. I used to do a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; go care counting on my mind with the previous brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper brush replacements and the UV sanitizer are welcome additions. With this product I really don&#x27;t miss a thing, it&#x27;s the perfect tooth cleaning solution next to a professional inside your mouth. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, it seems to do a lot better job than my old sonicare toothbrush and is much lighter and easier to hold. and I love the santizer that assures me that I am not putting germs back into my mouth</li>
            <li> A dental hygienist recommended the Sonicare to me several months ago, I soon found several friends who had been using the product as well.  As these things always go, I put off the purchase for several weeks.  When I finally purchased and started using the Sonicare FlexCare RS930, I honestly wondered why I had not used the product before.  Simply put, it does a great job.      The design is great. I particularly like the induction charger; no exposed power contacts between the base and the toothbrush body. EVerything is sealed up and much easier to clean up in the wet world of the bathroom sink.  The UV sanitizer is nice too, keeps the brush heads out of the way as well as sanitizing them.    Speaking of the brush heads, both the standard and small size worked well for me.  New users: the vibrations of the brush do tickle until you become accustomed to the sensation; the small brush head definitely helps with that.   Within a week or so, you don&#x27;t really notice the vibrations and the larger standard brush is OK.    Finally the most important part; it does an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth. Definitely better than manual brushing and surprisingly superior to the electric rotary toothbrush I had been using.  I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> ive hade the oral-b and this thing smokes it. if your on the fence just buy it. the smaller size and the sanitizer didnt seem like that much of a big deal until you use it. p.s. it feels like you just got out of the dentist every time you brush your teeth!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush following a recommendation from a dental hygienist, who only said two words: \\&quot;Philips\\&quot; and \\&quot;sonic.\\&quot; So I was on my own trying to winnow down the wide array of models and features available online and at local retail stores.  I settled on this unit based on several positive reviews, its feature set, and the fact that for $5 more than the next model down, it came with the UV sanitizer feature.  Although that is an unnecessary embellishment, I thought what can it hurt to try it out for about 3% more money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using the Sonicare Flexcare for more than 90 days, and I have to say I am extremely pleased at its performance so far.  The sonic action really does leave my teeth and gumline feeling cleaner than I was EVER able to get them by manual brushing, and I have even seen slight improvement in my periodontal situation (some moderately deep pockets).  Of course I did start with a pair of very thorough periodontal cleanings 3 months apart, but my periodontist and hygienists agree than the Sonicare is an outstanding dental home-care maintenance tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features on this unit all work as advertised, and are actually handy.  I found the 14-use \\&quot;ramp-up\\&quot;, which slowly increases the brushing to full-power over about a week&#x27;s time, to be a good way to ease into the Sonicare experience, which can be startling for a newbie. This is a very powerful cleaning tool, unlike anything I have ever felt, other than at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I normally use the \\&quot;MaxCare\\&quot; cycle, 30 seconds of cleaning plus 15 seconds of massage on each quadrant.  The regular \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; cycle (30 seconds of cleaning per quadrant) is fine for the morning brushing.  The \\&quot;GoCare\\&quot; cycle (15 seconds of cleaning per quadrant) is fine if you&#x27;re in a hurry, or just want to touch up The \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; cycle will probably come in handy as I ease back into brushing following any future dental work or periodontal surgery. The \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; cycle is fine for some gum stimulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the feature that makes the toothbrush \\&quot;burp\\&quot;, a tiny pause and beep after each of the first three segments of a cycle, to be also extremely handy.  I don&#x27;t have to keep track of time, I just switch to the next quadrant when the toothbrush tells me to.  The brush heads fit perfectly, and do not seem to get any gunk underneath where they attach to the unit. I do take the brush head off and clean the mounting post about once every 8-10 days.  The battery seems excellent: the instructions say a full charge takes 24 hours, so when the battery indicator has been on one green bar (out of three) for a couple days, I put the unit on the charger after my evening usage, and leave it there for 24 hours, using a manual brush the next morning.  The charge has lasted at least 10 days per, so far, or at least 20 cycles.  It might even go longer, but it&#x27;s probably bad for the battery to drain it all the way. BTW, I do NOT keep the unit on the charger, but stand it up next to it. I believe it is better for the battery to \\&quot;cycle\\&quot; all the way up and most of the way down, rather than keep it fully charged all the time. Your experience and intuition may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sanitizer about once a week, putting the brush head in the little compartment after the evening brushing, firing up the UV light, and then wiping off the unit&#x27;s mounting post. The sanitizing cycle takes only 10-15 minutes, and shuts itself off automagically. So far, I have avoided any hideous mouth diseases (except for my pre-existing periodontal disease), but I didn&#x27;t contract any in my previous 55 years of non-sanitized toothbrush use, so I can&#x27;t say this UV sanitizing thing is too essential. Might be good if you shared the brush AND the brush head. (Yuck-o!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to buy extra brush heads for about $8.50 apiece for a 3-pack, cheaper than retail.  Philips also sent me one free one as a purchase bonus for signing up online with them. You&#x27;re supposed to change the brushhead every 90 days, but you can probably go 4-6 months between new heads without diminishing brushing effectiveness too much.  Since you actually do NOT need to press the brush hard against the tooth and gumline surfaces, the brush does not wear out and get ragged as quickly as a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding criticisms that this toothbrush spurts toothpaste and water all over, is difficult to use, make a deafening sound, is accidentally activated, etc, I can only say that some people clearly did not read the instructions carefully.  I have found NONE of these flaws and, if used correctly, the unit is fairly easy to use.  It should be held lightly but firmly, not clenched in one&#x27;s fist, taking care to keep your fingers off the various buttons on the front.  No \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; motion is required: simply moving the buzzing brush head over the tooth surface and gumline at about a 45 degree angle does the trick.  My teeth feel cleaner than they have ever felt, and seem to stay that way between professional cleanings. I have also noticed an appreciable increase in the overall \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; of my smile, an unexpected benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to the longevity of this product, but the two-year warranty should take care of any issues.  If it breaks in month 25 of my ownership, I will definitely buy another one- it&#x27;s still cheaper than dental work!  To possibly improve my chances for toothbrush longevity, I rinse the brush head and toothbrush body briefly under running water after usage, dry it lightly with a hand towel, and flick it a few times to shake the excess water off the brush head. So far, I am VERY pleased with this product, and recommend it unconditionally to anyone seeking to maintain and augment their professional dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEMI-DISCLAIMER:  My dad is a retired dentist (practiced 45 years) and had nothing to say about, or add to, this review.  I showed him the toothbrush, he felt the buzzing brush head with his finger, and said, \\&quot;Huh.  Might have to get one.\\&quot;head every 90 days, but you can probably go 4-6 months between new heads without diminishing brushing effectiveness too much.

            <li> I am very pleased with my sonic toothbrush.  I had bought a competative electric toothbrush that finally expired and decided to go back to Sonic.  I am extreemly glad I did.  There is a noticable difference.      I also am as always, pleased with Amazon&#x27;s pricing as well as the prompt service.    [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> This Sonicare replaced an older version.  It is so much better in that it cleans my teeth better and it has a charge indicator so you can tell how much charge is left.  I haven&#x27;t used the sanitizer yet.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well and prefer it over the Sonic Essence that I have had for a number of years.  The UV sanitizer did not work from the moment I received it.  I called the company and asked if there should be a sound coming from that unit, and they said no.  They were very willing to send me another and I returned the one I received from Amazon.  The new one works perfectly.  Very pleased with the service from Sonic.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after using the Philips HX5351 Sonicare Toothbrush for 4+ years. I always thought that the old Sonicare was a solid electric toothbrush but after using the flexcare for about a month I&#x27;m so glad I got the new one. It is much more compact and more wieldy than than my old toothbrush. The blue indicator is excellent for someone like me who forgets when to change out the head. The biggest thing is that now that with the pop in head you don&#x27;t get the build up of nasty gunk like you did in the old screw heads. My only complaint is that the brush is very hard to the point where it almost hurts your gums. I was hoping the bristles would soften up after a while but they still haven&#x27;t.    Also the Sanitizer is excellent. I don&#x27;t know how I ever used a toothbrush before it. I now truly know that my brush is clean and that there&#x27;s nothing gross secretly growing on my brush. I had read one review where someone mentioned that they don&#x27;t use the sanitizer because they fear that it&#x27;ll just leave the UV resistant bacteria like when antibiotics are used to much. Well from my knowledge of how UV works (with a little help from wikipedia) UV light isn&#x27;t like antibiotics and there&#x27;s really nothing that is UV resistant just because of how UV affects DNA. So there is no real need to worry about UV resistant bacteria. Apparently Biology labs use UV light to sanitize their workspace so I think that says something.    To sum up    Pros:  Compact so its easy to travel with  Sanitizer makes sure you&#x27;re not spreading filth on your mouth  Very strong, my teeth are already noticeably whiter  New heads are so much more sanitary and easier to use    Cons:  Bristles are a bit tough and will hurt when you first use it</li>
            <li> This is the first Sonicare toothbrush I have owned.  While it may sound like a lot of money to pay for a toothbrush, you will not be disappointed.  My teeth feel as clean as if I had just visited the dentist everytime I brush.  I highly recommend this toothbrush, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Cleans better than the Oral B I previously used. Used it for about two weeks and the battery is still not out (at low). Takes less than 7 hours for a full charge. Overall very satisfied with the product. But the price is a little steep.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonic Care Toothbrush for about 8 years.  When I upgraded to the flexcare I found the new features to be great.  I can customize the tooth brush every time I brush....dental and gum care are so very important.  A great buy to encourage thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> after brushing the teeth, it feels like you went to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> I finally threw in the towel with my standard toothbrush and purchased the Philips Sonicare FlexCare. I am very happy with my decision and can&#x27;t imagine going back to handbrushing. The previous reviews have covered the features of this extremely well thought out and designed toothbrush so I won&#x27;t repeat these.    I purchased mine in April and the unit failed in November. I almost threw it away expecting the typical customer service nightmare when I tried to make good on the 2 year warranty. Thankfully, I called Philips support 1800 number before reaching for the garbage. A customer service rep answered after 15 seconds. Long story short, they believe I had a bad drive unit and are replacing the brush with a brand new brush. They did ask me to mail back the defective unit once I receieved the replacement brush and postage paid shipping labels. WOW, I wish all my interactions with customer service department were this good. They took a customer unhappy with a non functioning product and converted me into a life long Philips fan. Other companies should take note.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, your teeth are really going to feel clean, but it has a very short life.  I&#x27;m very sorry to say this, but I buoyed 3 sonic care toothbrushes six months ago, and only one of them is still working. The other two are useless; I&#x27;m sending them to warranty service. It&#x27;s a very expensive product to have such a shots live. Will write again about the warranty service.</li>
            <li> I have had this since February 2009 and I am on my third one.  Every 6 months or so they stop working and I have to call sonicare for a new one.  So far they have been good about replacing it, but it is a hassle.  Not sure what the issue is, I&#x27;m not overly aggressive with it, just use it twice a day.  Otherwise it does work well, when it works.</li>
            <li> Love the slimmer design.....fits well in my hand and best of all, the disgusting build-up in the handle and under the brush is gone.</li>
            <li> I have had my previous Sonicare for about 7 years. It has not failed me. I was unhappy with its design, however, and had given it to my husband for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is much more sleek and easy to use. There is less of a chance of getting all goopy inside, which was my problem with the old one. Having the sanitizer makes me feel better about my toothbrush and its cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this kind of toothbrush for the first time, it will take some getting used to. But as for other of these types of brushes, this one is super.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips Sonicare products before, this purchase was because my last product finally gave out.    The new Sonic toothbrush that I purchased is as I expected it to be, Great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this toothbrush, it gave me the cleanest brush I ever had without going to the dentist office.  The variable settings are a great feature.  Since it is so expensive, my husband and I would share the toothbrush and use our own heads (using the same head would just be gross.)  We honestly thought the price tag was worth it and were planning on buying a second one so we didn&#x27;t have to always take turns.    However, 8 months after purchasing this wonder brush, it has developed a mind of it&#x27;s own.  It extremely loud and distracting when it is in use, don&#x27;t bother trying to listen to anyone talk to you unless they&#x27;re yelling.  It also turns itself on periodically, and I must say the random buzzing while I was in the shower took me by surprise.    We now plan on investing our money in a toothbrush that will hopefully last quite a bit longer.  My last electric toothbrush lasted over 3 years and it just doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to spend over $100 on a toothbrush that can&#x27;t even last year.  However,  if money is not an object for you, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is more gentle to the gum and I can feel the cleanness inside of my mouth. Light weight also helps.</li>
            <li> My dentist had told me to purcdhase one of these. I had purchased another one a few years ago but the the vibration was too strong. She told me to look for one with a smaller brush.  SO I took a chance and ordered this one.  I love it...I hope the results are as good as she(the dentist) expects. I feel as if my teeth are much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush and I only have to use a dab of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my dentist&#x27;s recommendation when my rotadent died.  This works fine, charges well, but I feel that the brush head is too large, and I don&#x27;t feel like it works as well as the small round brush on my previous toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll continue to use and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare is incredible!  I would recomend it to anyone, it cleans your teeth very good.  I purchase one for my husband and few months later I purchased one for myself.  It is definetely a great buy.</li>
            <li> In addition to the fact that I love my toothbrush, when the handle failed to recharge, I called Philips and, after getting all the pertinent info, they sent me a new handle in the mail. In today&#x27;s world of \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; electronics, Philips didn&#x27;t give a simple 90 day warranty...they give 2 full years from date of purchase.  Pretty good deal.  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase Philips products.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare.  The last one I bought didn&#x27;t last two years but the company replaced it, as it was still under warranty.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I have owned. It is an exceptional product, my dental hygenist always remarks how clean my teeth are. This new model is much better because it is easier to clean after brushing. It has more features which the old model did not have and the sanitzer is a plus. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product, shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to purchase.  My teeth feel really clean after using and the machine does all the work!</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the price. It&#x27;s much better than your regular toothbrush. My teeth feel much cleaner and my dentist visit have gone better.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use. I would recommend this product to anybody looking for a high end tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare products for three years now and this one is my second Sonicare toothbrush. The only reason I switched is because they stopped making the replacements brush heads for my older model. I hope this one has the same longevity. My only complaint about the brush is the placement of the mode select button. I keep changing the mode when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth usually in the morning when I don&#x27;t have time to be mucking about with the thing. It&#x27;s not every time and it&#x27;s probably mostly me just needing to change my grip on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so far and I only wish I had bought the second handle to take to the office.</li>
            <li> This was my second sonic care toothbrush. The first one lasted over 4 years and this one just crapped out in almost a year. It felt great when it worked and now it was just a waste of money. I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
            <li> I have had my Philips Sonicare FlexCare for a little over a year, no problems until this week. It died, no warning, just died. Am now trying to figure out if the 2 year warranty will be honored.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this Sonicare! It is great at first, but then breaks. I should have paid more attention to the reviews I read. I bought this Sonicare because I liked the idea of different settings and the UV sanitizing feature. What a ripoff!  In the beginnig it worked very nicely. However,the toothbrush stopped vibrating after 5 months, and even with meticulous cleaning, gunk accumulates at the bottom of the UV sanitizing box (Q-tips and bleach is the only thing to get rid of that). Of course, now it&#x27;s probably too late to return this overpriced piece of junk. But I will try to do it anyway. Thankfully, I still have my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My old rotary brush died, this one tickles and causes excessive salivation but I assume it is doing a better job than the old Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  My latest purchase was this FlexCare with sanitizer.  If the sanitizer does what it claims, it&#x27;s a nice feature.  There&#x27;s no way to tell besides having the brush head tested for bacteria, so I&#x27;ll take their word for it.    My problem is the two of them that I&#x27;ve owned have both broken.  The first lasted about 13 months, and the second lasted 16-17 months.  With the 2-year warranty, the first was replaced, but not the second.  Like most places, your warranty date doesn&#x27;t reset when you get a warranty replacement.      I will say that this is the first model I&#x27;ve had problems with.  For all of the others, I threw them out when the battery died.    So I&#x27;m giving up on Sonicare.  It&#x27;s just too much to pay for so-so quality. If Braun Oral-B doesn&#x27;t work out, I may try Sonicare again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was great until it stopped working.  Fortunately, it was only a year old and still under warranty.  They sent me a new one that also worked great for a little over a year then it broke as well.  Now I am out of warranty so I called to find out if I could pay a flat fee for a replacement toothbrush.  I was informed that once the product is out of warranty there are no repair options.  I was told to buy another one.  I love the toothbrush but can&#x27;t rationalize buying a third one...</li>
            <li> My husband and I had the older version of the Sonic Care toothbrush and liked it okay. We just replaced them a month ago with this newer version and really LOVE it! It is easier to keep clean, does a great job cleaning teeth, and you can sanitize the different heads too. We have used both the regular and smaller heads. Nice to rotate them on usage. Only complaint is the button that changes the \\&quot;speed\\&quot; is located where you hold the handle when brushing. So, sometimes you accidentally change in the middle of brushing and have to push it again once or twice to resume regular speed. Not terrible but it should be changed in the next design. Then I would give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I really liked the sonic toothbrush until yesterday when it would no longer charge.  This problem is normal for batteries, and normally easy to fix.   Then today I find out I can&#x27;t fix my $180 sonic toothbrush by replacing a $5 battery -- I have to spend another $180-$220.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in 2008. The first year it worked great; all the features were nice and dandy. But little do people here come back to review such products after years of use and let you know how it performs over time! Into my second year the battery died fast; the metal part where the brush attachments stick on completely BROKE OFF.  Philips Sonicare told me my warranty expired and they could not help.  Their warranty policy is specifically designed in a way that the product will crap out after the warranty expires.  I read online that Sonicare was engineered to last ONLY 2-3 years. Basically, Philips want us to buy $150 dollar toothbrush and $30 dollar brush heads every year? I hate when corporations like Philips exploit customers with intentionally designed inferior products that breakdown fast so that you will run and buy a new one.  Bye-Bye Philips. Just like your electric-shavers that broke down on me fast, so did your Sonicare toothbrush.  I will never buy from you again. Nor can I recommend Sonicare for such an expensive price if it breaks like a Chinese made toy!</li>
            <li> It was a great toothbrush. purchased from amazon a little over 2 years ago. Now 2 years, in it&#x27;s broken. Battery will not charge anymore. If you don&#x27;t mind spending $150 every 2 years to buy a completely new system, it&#x27;s great just REALLY expensive. caveat emptor. as soon as the warranty is over, time to buy a new one! because the old one will die.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sonicare user for a very long time but always hated how the older model was hard to clean the handle. We have very hard water here so the calcium deposits always gathered in the corners and I would have to scrub it out with brushes and hot vinegar or rubbing alcohol, it was a pain. This brush has a easy to wash handle that doesn&#x27;t have any crevices to collect junk. On top of that it has a basic clean, sensitive, massage, quick clean (15 seconds for section) and  max care that is like the usual clean but adds in 15 seconds of massaging at the end of each section (i use this one all the time). It also has the uv head cleaning holder thing. Pretty neat stuff and my teeth feel great. My only complaint would be that it would be nice if there was a special head for the gum massage instead of using the toothbrush but that really isn&#x27;t a deal breaker or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several versions of Sonicare, and this is the best I&#x27;ve used. There is only 1 flaw, and that is with the sensors on the handle - it is difficult to brush you teeth without changing the setting. Other than that, I&#x27;m very, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush!  My mouth doesn&#x27;t even feel this clean after leaving the dentist.  It really delivers on what it promises to do.  My teeth feel smooth after using it and it&#x27;s helped make them whiter (I didn&#x27;t even buy the plus white version, it it still made my teeth whiter).  My whole mouth in general feels a lot more healthy.  Compared to any regular toothbrush, spin brush or even an Oral B sonic toothbrush I had bought, Sonicare completely blows them away.  There&#x27;s no comparision.  This by far is the best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> its like coming back from the dentist every time. the only electric toothbrush that dentists recommend. everything is better. the UV sanitizer is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> I used to have a sonicare toothbrush and stopped using it because it was such a hassel to use and did not feel like it was worth it.  But now, I&#x27;m hooked again and enjoy brushing my teeth and the clean feeling that I get with it.  So worth it!    It&#x27;s easy to operate and has a long battery life.  But really, nothing beats the felling of nice clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much.  I recently had gum surgery and found the sensitive mode to be helpful in starting back using the electric brush.  My old Oral b brush used to keep running after the two minutes which I liked if I wanted to do more brushing.  The Sonicare one shuts off after the two minutes but I am getting used to it.  Otherwise everything is great.  I got this one because my dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I bought this new one to replace an 8-year old model. Checkups at the dentist have been a breeze since I started using Sonic Care regularly. Technology has come a long way since we bought the earlier model - love the new features.</li>
            <li> I had to have the first toothbrush replaced after about 6 months. The replacement only lasted less than 6 months. I think the problem with this one is that they moved the entire mechanism inside the handle. So instead of having the moving parts replaced every time you change your brush head every 2-3 months, the mechanism in this unit never gets changed. When they failed they got very loud and then quit altogether. I ended up going back to the E series. It is actually cheaper and I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years now with no problems (other than having to clean out the nastiness that lurks under the brush head). Bottom line, save yourself the trouble and $ and buy the e-series instead.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush for (incredibly) about 10 years and although it was still working, it seemed a bit slower. Knowing several new models have come out, I decided it was time to finally take the plunge and replace it. After checking online dental reviews, it appeared that Sonicare is still the best choice out there. I chose the Sonicare Ultra Flex since it was fully featured, and amazon had a good price and rebate on it.     Its a great brush and the package I bought included a hard carry case, recharge combo/UV base and a small travel recharge base. The brush body is smaller and much more ergonomic than my old model, and angled for easier use. It has an LCD panel and selector to chose several modes, including a shorter brushing cycle for quick freshen ups, and a gum massage mode. As others have mentioned, it will also be much easier to keep clean since the threaded head style of my old model (impossible to keep clean inside) is gone now replaced with a simple slip-in brush head that should have no such issues. Its a very nice brush, and my teeth have never felt cleaner (I can tell my 10 year old model had apparently slowed down a bit).    One concern was that the brush started out very quiet, but became very noisy in about 2 weeks. Those who have the brush might think this was when the brush speeds up after its gentle \\&quot;startup\\&quot; mode, but I had disabled that setting since I was already used to Sonicare. Customer service was excellent and sent me a replacement with a postage paid return for the old brush and it still runs normally. Seeing a few others report issues and failures, I hope this brush is as reliable as my old. I may be glad it has a 2 year warranty.      Assuming it turns out to be reliable, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush in 2007 and before the warranty was out it died. I called Philips and had to wait many months for a replacement handle. The new handle I received in 8/10 JUST DIED OUT AGAIN!!! I am leaving it plugged into the sanitizer base and not using it in any strange way. When I called Philips to complain, they did NOTHING! They will not replace the handle again because they only honor the warranty of the original purchase, not the replacement. No logic whatsoever. So I am screwed out of a working toothbrush. When it worked it was terrific, but I have to think many people are having this problem with the toothbrush dying out. My husband uses the Oral B and has had it for years with no problem. Buyer beware!!  I just found helpful info from a battery manufacturer who uses this brush. He says DO NOT LEAVE IT IN THE CHARGER. Let it go down to 10-15% charge before recharging in order to prolong battery life. If only Philips would tell its customers that!</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush, works great. Unfortunately after about 1 1/2 years the brush heads just start vibrating right off. Makes the toothbrush pretty worthless. For this type of money invest in a different brush. Not worth the price with only a 1-2 year lifespan.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant about spending that money on a toothbrush....till i used it!!  it is totally worth it.Your dental hygiene will improve dramatically and the sensation in your mouth cannot compare to the one you get with regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed using it.  However, there seems to be a battery issue.&lt;br /&gt;It kept turning itself on and I could not get it to cut off.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up putting in my garage until it ran the battery down.&lt;br /&gt;Had to get replacement after only 6 months from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own an older model Sonicare and its battery begin to wean and the brush heads always stayed junky. This model is difinitely an improvement to my past model. the different cycles that you can read on the handle is a plus along with the uv sanitizer.... I&#x27;m very happy with this product....</li>
            <li> I have to say I am in love with this little guy. I got it in the mail maybe 3 weeks ago &amp; have been a teeth brushing addict ever since. It is not as loud as I expected it to be and not nearly as annoying to my mouth as other brands. I know it sounds stupid but I suffer from migraines and some of the buzzing sounds &amp; vibrations from other brands seem to trigger them (my migraines) early in the morning. I have yet to have this problem with this little guy. My teeth are more than clean, they seem to be squeaky clean after using this. I am also a fan of the uv sanitizer because I am also currently sick &amp; don&#x27;t ever like to keep a toothbrush that can prolong my illness. No worries here, because I can sanitize the brush head after each use if I so please. I think it was a great buy for the price &amp; the fact that I am taking much better care of my teeth by using it.</li>
            <li> really worth the money...this is my second one...the first was recently \\&quot;played with\\&quot; by someone in the house and was broken.  I had managed to get about three years out of it.  With my first, according to the dentist there was much improvement in the health of my gums...and he asked me what i have changed in my oral health routine.  I had to use a manual brush for awhile. then the price of this model enticed me back...i am very statisfied with it...and so our my gums and teeth</li>
            <li> I have had my Sonicare for a couple of months now a love it!  My dentist suggested I purchase one and when I found the deal on Amazon for this product I jumped on it.  I look forward to seeing the results in my next visit to the Dentist, however, I feel some improvements already!  Not only do my teeth feel cleaner, but I am able to get some of the hard to reach places much easier than I could with a conventional toothbrush.  Can&#x27;t comment on the longevity yet, but it seems to be a very well made product and I hope to have it in working order for years to come.  Only wish replacements were not so expensive.  Overall, a great product so far though.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve love the sonicare products and have used them for many years.  My wife needed a new one and ordered this new model.  It worked for 4 months and then stopped working.  We ignored the other reviews that described similar experiences with short-lived products.  This is a very expensive toothbrush that should last for a couple of years.  There are too many reviews that indicate a high failure rate.  Ignore these reviews at you own risk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electrical toothbrush and I think it was the perfect decision to go for this model. Very elegant design, battery lasts about 1 month for brushing 2 min twice per day (I don&#x27;t have it plugged in all the time). The cleaning results are great while there&#x27;s no harm to the gums. Unit is easy to clean too and the Sanitizer is a nice feature. If you are not using it, it&#x27;s still nice storage for the 2 brush heads.</li>
            <li> I love this brush now that I am used to it. It does take a little bit of getting used to after using a manual brush all my life. It tickles my lips a little and vibrates a lot. At first the vibrating almost made my head hurt but once I got used to it that went away. It took me about a week or so to get comfortable with it. As someone else noted the beep between quadrants is more of a pause so that was a bit confusing until I figured out what the deal was.</li>
            <li> I researched articles on the web before buying the Sonicare Rechargeable toothbrush and this was the one with the highest reviews.  Actually, the sanitizer was not included in the review, but the Sonicare with the sanitizer was cheaper than the one without, so I got it.  Love  the Sonicare Rechargeable toothbrush.  Leaves my whole mouth feeling clean. I like the pulse indicator that  tells me when I have completed brushing one section of my teeth and it is time to go to another.  This toothbrush keeps me brushing my teeth for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li> We have owned a number of Philips products from shavers to toothbrushes and TVs. When something goes wrong (and it usually does,) you&#x27;re out of luck. There is no customer service. No response to phone calls, no answer to mail. Nothing.    We&#x27;ll never buy another product with the Philips label.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this type of toothbrush. I bought this one for my son. They work great and give your mouth that clean feeling like you just left the dentist office. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have to give a kudos to Phillips Customer Service.  I have used Sonicare brushes for the better part of a decade and never had a problem with any of the older \\&quot;first-generation\\&quot; units.  Since I decided to treat myself to an Christmas upgrade in December 2009 I have been very happy with this FlexCare plus model I purchased from Amazon.com.  I enjoy the sleek look and minimal heft and the UV sanitation option. I especially appreciate the cleaner base attachment for the brush head (the old models seemed to accumulate gunk and required constant maintenance).  Recently in May of 2011 the toothbrush stopped working and stopped charging.  It died on a Thursday.  On the following Saturday when I was off work and had time, I contacted Phillips customer service via their online chat option, because I generally dislike talking to customer service over the phone.  In under 15 minutes the courteous and helpful representative walked me through a series of diagnostic problems attempting to pinpoint the source of the malfunction.  After 6 or 7 of these steps the representative stated they would send me a replacement within 7-10 business days, since the product appeared to be broken and I am within the 2-year warranty period.  I had never sent in a warranty card or anything but using the serial number on the base of the handle I presume they verified purchase date. Today, Wednesday, a brand new entire unit was sitting on my doorstep when I got home from work.  It is an entire assembly, including a new UV/charger base, travel charger, travel case, and 2 new brush heads. They also sent me a prepaid FedEx return label for the dead unit.  So, now less than one calendar week from when the toothbrush died, I have a brand new set up and tomorrow I will drop the dead set at FedEx.  Great service, great 2-year warranty.  How can you go wrong?!?  Oh and plus, I often get compliments which validate the Sonicare efficacy from my dentist and hygienist, and also just friends and people I know.Yes, Sonicare is not cheap... but seriously, you only get one set of teeth, and Phillips really stands behind their product. GO FOR IT!!</li>
            <li> My 2nd unit is about 2 years old.  It turns on by itself and runs Intermittently when I turn it on.  My first unit was replaced through the warranty.  It lasted less than one year.  It kind of froze up...would turn on but barely move.  I&#x27;m about to call my dentist for a recommendation for another brand.  Sonicare could be a great product but just doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for the price.  Guess I won&#x27;t be buying any more $30 replacement brushes for this $130 unit.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  The built in timer lets you know when it&#x27;s time to move to a new section and the three brushing modes add to its flexibility.  When I first started using it I was constantly using the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting, but after a few weeks I have been able to use the regular \\&quot;clean\\&quot; setting thanks to less sensitive teeth and gums.  My teeth are definitely whiter after a month of steady use and my mouth has never felt better.    If you&#x27;re the type of person who brushes too hard and whose gums are receding then this is the toothbrush for you.  As for the UV cleanser.  I am on the fence about that.  I use it about once a week because, as people have stated before, being TOO clean can lead to your body being unable to fight off bacteria, or bacteria becoming more resistant.  So I clean it once a week and I figure that should do well enough.    Buying it on Amazon will definitely save you some money.  If you don&#x27;t need the UV cleaner then buy a standalone version.  Either way, this is a great toothbrush.    Pros: Flexible cleaning modes.  Good for people with sensitive gums.  Whiter teeth in a month.    Cons: Price.  UV Cleanser is an OK gimmick, not a deal breaker.  Could have saved some money buying only the brush.</li>
            <li> This was the best price I could find for this product which my dentist asked me to get. It is easy to use and does clean better than my previous electric toothbrush. It also held a charge well during a long trip and charged both in the US and Europe.</li>
            <li> The only other electric toothbrush experiences I had before this were the $5 Colgate battery operated from Walmart and the Braun 3D Excel (a Consumer Report favorite a few years back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The default setting of \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; was too intense the first time around. It tickled my gums and I could almost not bear it.  The second time around I use the \\&quot;Sesitive\\&quot; setting which was more tolerable. Try number 3 back on \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; and all was good, though it will still take a bit getting use to. The \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; mode is supposed to be the easiest on the gums but not as good with the cleaning so I didn&#x27;t even bother with that setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is real easy to maintain and clean or replace parts from the diagrams provided. LED for power is clear and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush pauses during brushing four times. Each time is a sign that you should be done with that quadrant so you can move to the next. No biggie, actually a nice feature. My wife&#x27;s complaint is that it just shuts off after all four quadrants are \\&quot;done\\&quot;. She prefers the Braun 3D Excel that sends you a beeping noise signalling the end but lets you keep brushing if you want. For me, I don&#x27;t care. I could always turn it back on if I really wanted to and do another cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel the cleanest with this new toothbrush and it better for the price!  But if it can help save me from dental work, which could easily run into the hundreds or thousands even with insurance, then so be it. Worth the purchase/gift and I&#x27;m sure the dentist will say brushing twice a day would make life even better.</li>
            <li> I have been using philips sonic toothbrushes many many years, during that entire time I never needed any dental work or fillings, infact I did not even need to visit the dentist. People would always comment on how beautifully white my teeth were.  When I did visit my dentist he said my teeth were in far better condition then he had ever seen, my brush needed replacing so I asked his advice, he did not like the philips sonic toothbrushes claiming oral B was the best and the only one they sold and told me to switch to oral B. Believing him to be an expert, I did switch to oral b, and oh what a mistake, because I paid alot of money for it I kept using it.  It will be of no suprise to hear that for the first time in that period of use I needed a filling for the first time in 17 years, and another filling came out all together, my gums became very sore from the oral b and I developed gingivitis, and my teeth were not as white as they were.     I was so pleased when the oral B broke (after less than 2 years of use).  I was back on the internet searching for my beloved Philips Sonic toothbrush, and found the best ever yet, yes the Sonic flexcare with UV sanitizer, I agree it is noisier, and for me I have to use the compact head, however the different modes for cleaning is really great for those with sensitive gums, and find the oral b too abrasive, I cannot stand the heads on the oral b either.  The Philips sonicare flexcare heads are better shaped and I find I can reach all my teeth, and there is no toothbrush on this planet that will leave your teeth and mouth as clean as this brush will.  Yes it is pricey, but dental hygiene is extremely important and for me I did not hesitate to pay the price as it is something I use everyday twice a day and know it actually works and does what it says it does.  I think they will bring out another model with 2 brushes inside and additional extra&#x27;s.  I think it is worth getting the sonicare flexcare without the UV sanitizer and buying the philips UV standalone sanitizer separately as the standlone UV sanitizer will take other brush heads as well.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for at least 10 years, and like the work it does.  It is the best I have found at keeping my teeth so amazingly clean.  However, they die every 2 years.  That being said it is a VERY expensive product!!!!  I am fortunate enough to be able to replace it, but don&#x27;t get hooked if you can&#x27;t....Also, don&#x27;t expect Customer Service at Sonicare to do anything, because they do not care!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush that came highly recommended by my dentist. Best price on line and and fast delivery. This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my hard to buy for husband this past Christmas.  We both were BLOWN AWAY by the quality, functionality, and price point for such and amazing product.  After brushing with this toothbrush, you teeth feel dentist clean.  Squeaky even!  I love this toothbrush and will repurchase for other family members! :)</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare toothbrush just gave up the ghost after just under a decade of use. Like most people, I was taken back first by the vigorousness with which it brushed my teeth, but over time became accustomed to it &amp; my mouth felt dirty when I tried brushing it with any thing else but my Sonicare. The few things that annoyed me with my first one was 1.) the replacement brush had to be screwed on &amp; off. 2.) Black gunk built up where the brush resided in the charger &amp; in the thin plastic molding groove on the brush &amp; had to be cleaned once every few weeks. 3.) the brush was larger and a bit cumbersome to maneuver around in your mouth to brush exactly the way you were supposed to. 4.) The price (&amp; wastefulness) of getting new brush heads every 6 months.  I ended up getting the premium model (as a gift) for a replacement &amp; I must say it is a significant disappointment. The only improvement over the previous model is that the brush head isn&#x27;t as bulky &amp; easier to use. Gunk still builds up both on the bed of the charger &amp; (now) on the underside of the brush (as well, since there is no screwing mechanism preventing water from running underneath the brush head). The brush head is easier to take on &amp; off (just pull it off &amp; snap it on), however I only ever had to remove the old one 2 or 3 times before it needed to be replaced. With this model, I need to remove the brush head several times a week because the brush bristles themselves collect mold where they meet the plastic part of the head. This never happened on my old model. I have a mold allergy &amp; this downside prevents me from giving it any more than 1 star. Not only is the black mold really gross, it&#x27;s actually in the part of the brush that goes in your mouth &amp; is impossible to entirely remove. The ultraviolet light \\&quot;sanitizer\\&quot; that comes with the model is worthless (the previous model didn&#x27;t have one, because it didn&#x27;t need it!). I tried (as suggested on another review) soaking the head in hydrogen peroxide 2x a week, but mold still remains in the bristles even after soaking for 24 hours. Any other extras that come with this thing, are really only their to pad the price. So, in almost every respect, this thing is a step backwards.</li>
            <li> My new dentist &amp; hygienist recommended that I purchase the Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  He said it will clean my teeth much better than a manual toothbrush and prevent my gums from receding.  I have used it for only 3 weeks and my teeth and gums never have felt and so clean.  I love the UV sanitation and always worried that my toothbrush was in an environment that would collect germs. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush...when it works.  Less than a year after purchasing this toothbrush, it suddenly stopped working.  I called Philips, and they sent me a replacement.  The replacement lasted less than a week, at which point the power button fell off, the toothbrush filled with water, and that one ceased working.  I am now on toothbrush number 3.  This product does a good job -- my mouth feels fresh and clean after using it, and I can never go back to a manual toothbrush after getting used to the superior cleaning of an electric toothbrush, but I would recommend buying an Oral-B instead.  Those last for ages.</li>
            <li> My UV light charger died within a couple of months. There is no way to replace that. Lost or misplaced additional chargers are hard to find. Cost for each separate item is $20 - $40. If something can be done about it, pls contact me at hibridr@me.com , would love to change my view on this service.</li>
            <li> Well designed with long battery life. Excellent at removing plaque and stimulating the gums. Of course you still have to floss, but you won&#x27;t believe how clean your teeth are after the first time and every time you use it.</li>
            <li> Sonicare continues to be the best toothbrush but the extra cost for the sanitizer is a bit much considering it is about a $15.00 value for the UV bulb.  If you are a gadget junkie and want the lastest OK, if not just get the value priced unit.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that this would be worth the price.  I&#x27;m here to tell you it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I wondered if I&#x27;d need all the features, all the doo-dads that come with this.  I&#x27;ve used them all!  The first time you get sick, you will be so glad to have the UV sanitizer!    My teeth were pretty yellow... now they look whiter and brighter, and they FEEL SO CLEAN.  My dentist actually recommended it due to my arthritis... easier to hold and to brush.  I got it for that reason, but man oh man, are my teeth glad!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because of so many 5 star reviews.  I used this toothbrush for about 45 days, and now I am returning to amazon for only 80% refund because it pasted 30 day return period.  Here is why I did not like this toothbrush  1. The toothbrush is powerful, but just push dirt up to near and under the gum.  2. Made my gum bleed a couple of times (bad bleeds, enough to make a cup of water red), I tried different settings.  Happened about after the 40th day.  3. My gum feels very loose now, probally because of the toothbrush being so powerful, and I don&#x27;t think that is a good thing.  4. Overall, Teeth are not cleaner, just pushes all the dirt to the gum, lossen gum, bleeding gum, I do not like this product at all, and feel ripped. no wonder its a 28 day guarantee... when the bad effect happen after 28 days.  UPDATE (2/12/2012)  It has been years using electric toothbrush and I realized the above experience is from the sudden switch to electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product.  When my old one from many years ago finally gave out, I tried to just use a regular toothbrush.  It is just not the same.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one of these toothbrushes about two years ago based on a recommendation from my dental hygienist, and I didn&#x27;t know they even existed in this price range until I saw this one.  I had a hard time clicking the \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot; button, but now that I&#x27;ve had it for a while I&#x27;ve come to appreciate some of the features my cheaper toothbrushes never had.  For example, I like the timed brushing cycles so you brush long enough, the interval timer so you spend enough time brushing each part of your mouth, the UV sanitizer, and the travel charger.  I don&#x27;t use all the different brushing cycles and modes - just the default 2-minute one.  This toothbrush is also a lot more powerful than the cheaper toothbrushes I had before.     The first one of these that I bought two years ago died recently, and I just got a second one last week to replace it.  There&#x27;s a two year guarantee on page 13 of the owner&#x27;s manual, so it lived up to the guarantee, and maybe that&#x27;s just how long these things normally last until they shake themselves to death, or else I just got a bad one.  Either way, I somehow expected it to last longer.  But in spite of my disappointment with the two year lifespan of my first one, the bottom line for me is that I liked the power and the features enough to buy another one.</li>
            <li> The recharge did not work after a few months and it took a lot of hassel to get it replaced (needed to go through Philips instead of Amazon).   Later the brush does not work anymore. It stops in the middle and makes weak buzz. It only starts to vibrate when I push hard against my teeth at certain angle.   Compared to the Oral-B toothbrush my wife is using, this product sucks and I ordered a new Oral-B toothbrush from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Sonicare fan for years.  My dentist has nothing but compliments when I go to my 6 month check-ups.  I bought this specific model in June 2010.  It&#x27;s now October 2011 and it just died.  The brush slowly lost vibration power even after it was fully charged until it just stopped vibrating all-together (over a two-week period).  My previous Sonicare model lasted more then 5 years and the only reason i upgraded is because I was having trouble finding the outdated tooth brush heads.  I&#x27;m extremely sad that this stopped working, especially since they are expensive.  I was expecting to have this brush for at least a few more years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three Sonicare brushes in the past few years.  The first was an older model with the screw on top.  It gathered a lot of distgusting gunk under the top so when newer models came out with the snap/slide on brush head, we traded up.  We purchased two of these - one with the UV cleaning base and one with a standalone base.  They have both failed within the past two weeks.  On one, the battery died.  On the other, it just seems to have shorted.  It will not turn on despite a charged battery.  Trying to dig back into the warranty info, but I&#x27;m thinking they were probably both just outside of warranty.    They work great, just frustrating to have to plow so much money into it.  I&#x27;ll be buying something new this week - maybe my 4th or maybe try Oral B.</li>
            <li> I seem to have bad luck with the Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had problems with this toothbrush since I can remember purchasing it.  After a few months it turns on and off by itself like a possessed toothbrush.  I called Philips to express my concerns and yes, they did send a replacement the first time but same thing happened again after a few months of using the replacement.  So I put another call into customer service and they said since my product is now out of warranty they can no longer help me.  The person I spoke to then tells me that I am one of the unfortunate ones and compares it to buying a lemon car; in other words...TOUGH LUCK FOR ME!  LOL!  Oh well.  In as much as I want to love this toothbrush, I can&#x27;t recommend it.  Looking into other options.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like a sonic toothbrush, but I got used to it quickly.  There is a program built into it to help you get used to it.  The only downfall is that it&#x27;s a little hard to get the back of my front top and bottom teeth, but other than that, no issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit in 2009, it became very loud and didn&#x27;t vibrate as effectively a year later. Philips replaced it free of charge. Now, a year and half later, the replacement unit has become annoyingly loud and does not vibrate as well as it did originally. I have anxiety about whether my dental hygiene is being compromised due to the unit&#x27;s degradation in performance. There should be a way to test these units to determine if they are operating up to standards as time goes on.  So, when it works, it appears to work well. But, beware, based on my experience, the unit appears to be designed to self destruct or degrade in performance just after the warranty period runs out. And, the warranty period starts the day you buy the unit - it doesn&#x27;t get extended another 2 years if they replace it.</li>
            <li> My Dentist reccomended I get this for my family. I had a friend tell me I would throw it out after the first use... I LOVE IT. First off, Its a little off putting to have a motor in your mouth going a hundred times a second, and vibrating the top of your mouth... It really tickeled, and I LOL. This thing oscilated very fast, If you can get over the feeling of the first time, the way your teeth feel after makes up every time for that first. Thi particular model comes able to setup for a new person to Sonic toothbrushes. It starts gentle, and after the next 14 cycles it will gradually step up the frequency... I think its the first try that will make or brake it for you. I tell you, your whole day, no matter what you eat, afterward, your teeth will feel great. The different cycles help people who are sensitve (less of a frequency). Theres others that are a timer, so you brush long enough. All in all, I tell everyone I know to get this, and only wish I had bought it sooner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used successive generations of Sonicare electronic toothbrushes for a number of years now and every generation has been better than the last -- and they have all been great, right from the beginning.  The one and only small ergonomic foible with this latest generation is that it&#x27;s far too easy to bump the control switch on the handle when I&#x27;m changing quadrants or moving from the inside to the outside of the teeth, or vice versa.  So, from time to time, I find the toothbrush spontaneously changing to an unwanted setting while brushing.  I think that this problem is abetted by the slimmer design of the latest generation, which makes gripping it a tad more difficult.  Not a big deal really, but just another little challenge the ergonomic folks should solve before the next version ot he toothbrush hits the market.  Bottom line -- I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else but Sonicare, it&#x27;s simply a terrific product.</li>
            <li> Our old sonicare toothbrush recently died so we decided to upgrade to this one.  It is by far the best toothbrush my wife and I have ever owned!  Here&#x27;s what it does; gets your teeth extremely clean.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]I have owned Philips Sonciare toothbrushes before and always liked them.  This one is the best so far.  Not only is it a superb electric toothbrush, my mouth feels like it does after a dental cleaning. This is comfortable to use, has preprogrammed cycles for different types of cleaning.  The ultraviolet cleaning is a thoughtful addition and maybe especially useful for families. In short, great product and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing thing.  I bought this based on co-workers comments and I have to be honest it hasnt disapointed.  Each brusshing feels like dentist clean!    Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I purchsed this product in January 2008 as a replacement to a much older version of a Sonicare product. It worked well for about 10 months. Then the vibration got weaker and weaker. The battery is charged and it sounds like it&#x27;s working fine. Now, after 11 months, it does not vibrate at all, even though I can hear the battery working. I&#x27;ll have to send it back to the manufacturer. This product is far too expensive to have to go through this. I do not recommend purchasing such a high-end toothbrush that has given others similar problems.  UPDATE: I called Philips customer service center, was on the phone for under 5 minutes, and they shipped a whole new unit to me. It arrived within a week. They prepaid a package to return the old unit to them. So while I still am disappointed that the initial product broke, I am very pleased with the ease of replacing it. Philips&#x27; customer service department was friendly, efficient, and apologetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older Sonicare model, the \\&quot;Essence 5300\\&quot; on which the switch was beginning to go out.  I decided to upgrade to a Flexcare model and am very glad I did.  The Flexcare has been a great improvement all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-New Lighter, Slimmer Handle&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the first thing you&#x27;ll notice if you&#x27;re coming from an older Sonicare handle, and it is a very welcome improvement.  The FlexCare handle is small and feels much better in the hand than my old bulky 5300 handle.  The unit is actually longer than my old brush, but that&#x27;s not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-New ProResults Brush Head system&lt;br /&gt;The new heads are great.  Sonicare moved the tuning fork from the head to the handle, which means smaller brush heads than on the old models.  A 3 pack of the new heads is the same price as a 2 pack of the old heads, making them actually a better deal for a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No More Crud in the Handle!&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with my old brush was that old toothpaste/drool/water tended to collected in the space where the handle connects to the brush head.  It would get all moldy and gross if you didn&#x27;t clean it out regularly.  Thankfully, this problem is completely gone with the Flexcare handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lithium Ion Batteries&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a long time for Sonicare to upgrade from inferior NiCd batteries, and they finally have.  With Lithium Ion, you don&#x27;t have to worry about battery capacity decreasing over time, or a memory effect.  The new batteries charge faster, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-UV Sanitizer Included&lt;br /&gt;UV Sanitizers for toothbrushes are relatively new to the market, and a great idea.  I always felt a little gross letting my brush sit out on the counter, even with the cover that comes with sonicare heads, and then putting it in my mouth.  Scientists actually recommend that a toothbrush be kept 3 feet from the toilet due to \\&quot;airborne particles\\&quot; from the flush - yuck!  A UV sanitizer will kill anything that might land on your brush, as well as things such as cold germs that might have come from your own mouth.  Using the sanitizer is easy, just pop the brush head(s) in, press the green button, and wait for the UV light to kill the germs.  I store my brush head inside the sanitizer until I need it next.  The Charger is integrated with the sanitizer, although a separate travel charger is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quadpacer&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a beep that goes off every 30 seconds while brushing, reminding you to switch to a new area of your mouth.  It has appeared in previous models (not my 5300 though), and is nice if you&#x27;ll use it, but I tend to go at my own pace as I focus more on problem areas in my mouth and less on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-5 Total Brushing Modes/Routines&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 selectable \\&quot;modes\\&quot;: clean mode: (2 minutes broken into 30 second segments), sensitive (a \\&quot;gentler\\&quot; clean mode) and massage (the brush pulsates for gum stimulation).  Go Care Routine shortines the standard 2 minute clean mode to 1 minute, while Max Care is a longer, 3 minute cycle that includes both clean and massage mode.  I set the brush on clean mode and tend not to use the other options, but some may find them useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-More Environmentally Friendly&lt;br /&gt;Although buying a new product of any sort will always have a negative environmental footprint, these new brushes are better than the old models due to their Li-Ion batteries, reduced bulk, and lower waste in the smaller replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear on this: a Sonicare toothbrush is a luxury product.  You&#x27;re paying a lot more up front, and you get to keep paying more every time you buy replacement heads.  Surprisingly, heads for Flexcare units are actually a cheaper than the older models; you get 3 Flexcare heads for the same price as 2 of the old heads.  The per head price is still several times what it would cost to buy a new manual brush; but for me the superior cleaningis worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise&lt;br /&gt;-Flexcare models are louder than older models.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is, and supposedly vibration has been reduced in exchange, but the noise can be too much for some.  The UV sanitizer also makes a quiet electric \\&quot;hum\\&quot; when plugged in with the door closed, even if the UV bulb isn&#x27;t run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Buttons can be depressed while brushing&lt;br /&gt;A couple of people have complained about accidentally hitting 1 of the 2 buttons on the handle while brushing.  It hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but for completeness I&#x27;ll include this as a possible con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a vast improvement over my previous brush, and has fixed most of the problems I had without introducing any significant new ones.  The fact that replacement brush heads are actually cheaper than on my old brush is a big plus.  I highly recommend the Flexcare brushes as a great upgrade to any toothbrush, electric or manual, that you&#x27;re currently using.has been reduced in exchange, but the noise can be too much for some.

            <li> I bought this item for my husband 1.5 years ago and it broke. My sister bought one about the same time and it is broken as well. The toothbrush just stopped working! make sure you register it when you buy, so you can get the replacement if it breaks within 2 years. I did not do this thinking it will be OK.</li>
            <li> Previously I owned 2 Sonicare brushes, which lasted approximately 7 years each, with continuous 2x per day use.  Based on my experience with the brand, I purchased this brush as a replacement when mine started deteriorating.  I&#x27;m blown away by the improvements in the brush.  This brush does not lose power, it brushes as long as you need.  The design of this brush is smaller than my last model, which makes it more comfortable to use.  In addition, it reaches all of the areas in my mouth, where my old brush needed to be supplemented with a manual brush.  Clean up is a lot better with this design as well.  My only recommendation is to become familiar with the owner&#x27;s manual.  It has multiple functions and I found myself brushing with the \\&quot;gum\\&quot; mode a number of times.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the older model I have had for many years.  The sensitivity settings on this are fantastic.  The sanitizer is great since it means I always have a clean brush, and it also keeps the cat from chewing on it when I&#x27;m not home :-)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has everything it says in the description and works great. I like the 30 second timer to make sure I get all of my teeth cleaned the same.  The sanitizer has worked great during the cold season.  I sanitized after each use and didn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my cold longer because of my toothbrush.  The one thing I would like to see added is a battery that can be replaced.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. Cleans teeth excellently and I love the sanitize uv feature.</li>
            <li> Apparently the cheaper models clean your teeth as well as this expensive model, which has bells and whistles that most people will never use. Our unit stopped charging after a year, so I chatted online (available 24 hours) with a Phillips rep who said I&#x27;ll get a new unit within 10 days.... Wow... that is exemplary customer service!!</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare HX6930 (replacement from the one I actually bought) and it just died. The vibrating metal tip just stopped working, and it seems like this is a known problem with this toothbrush. Just got off online chat with Philips who would not replace it and just offered me a 15% discount. What a scam. Save your money, don&#x27;t buy it. I am writing a letter to the CEO, but I doubt anything will change.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is my second purchase, and an upgrade from the first model.  The first sonic lasted 4 years.  I love this!  It&#x27;s like having your teeth cleaned at the dentist without any pain.  Your teeth will feel so polished and clean with every use that you can skip the cleanings at the dentist for a little if you want.  I didn&#x27;t go for two years and they thought I had had my teeth cleaned recently.  Ha!  Love this toothbrush.  And this one has a sanitizer on the base so my brush is always clean and enclosed when I get ready to use it.</li>
            <li> I had a basic version of the Sonicare for a couple of years and then the battery refused to recharge.  I bought the Sonicare Flexcare with Sanitizer and wished I&#x27;d gotten the basic model again.  One big problem is the extra button placed below the \\&quot;On\\&quot; button.  This button is to change the way the brush head vibrates, so you can get a kind of massage action.  The problem is that the extra button is too easy to press accidentally while holding the brush.  They should have placed it somewhere else.  Another problem is the Sanitizer.  Who needs it?  Seems pretty useless to me.  Advice: get the basic model and be happy.</li>
            <li> This is it, priced just right.</li>
            <li> This product, bought exactly one year ago, worked well for a couple months. Then, one day the handle stopped working overnight. Company sent a replacement handle that does not work at all. They are unwilling to refund. They will send a second replacement handle. Not sure how long this can go on. Seems their return policy is limited. I would not buy another Sonicare product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought our first SoniCare toothbrush in 2000 and each used it daily for 11 years before it died. We bought this newer version of the same brush and continue to be equally pleased with it after 6 months. I cannot find a complaint, but our dentist probably could! Hard telling how much this has saved us in dental bills over the past decade - it does a tremendous job and I look forward to the fresh clean teeth every time I use it!</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush is the replacement for our previous Sonicare brush. The previous brush had lasted 5 years before quitting. Our dental hygienist really believes in these brushes, especially for gum health. The Sanitizer is a plus. The new brushes are easier to keep clean and sanitary due to their design and the Sanitizer. It has a neat, clean look on the vanity. Very pleased with the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush system. I love the massaging settings, the cleaning settings are great. With the whole timing helper settings it makes it so easy to brush sufficiently. I normally just brushed randomly, with this I follow the directions and seem to do a much better job of it. Actually makes brushing something I look forward to. I noticed a difference in my teeth and the feel of my gums within a week of using this system. Very pleasant vibration.</li>
            <li> I orderded my sonicare here two weeks ago, and I ve been enjoying brushing my teeth. It&#x27;s my first time switched to sonicare and chose this model, all I can say is it&#x27;s DIFFERENT, and your teeth is going to be cleaned completely. I am going to buy another two for my parents and in law as Christmas gifts! PS, the free shipping came three days earlier, only took one day shipped to my city, that was a Huge surprise!</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great toothbrush but Philips really stands behind their products.  I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for about 2 years now and it had worked wonderfully for my family of 3 up until about a month ago when it stopped vibrating the brush head.  The toothbrush still vibrated but did not work correctly.  I contacted Phillips customer support via Chat.  I expected that since I was at the end of the 2 year warranty that I would be denied.  I was pleasantly surprised that within about 10 minutes of starting the chat Philips determined that my toothbrush was still under warranty and sent out a replacement.  This is the second Philips product I have had fail (the first one was a digital photo frame) and the second time that Philips has stood behind their product and sent out a replacement without hesitation.  I am really impressed by Philips service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product since it came out 3 years ago and it has performed well.  The replacement brushes are a bit pricey but this brush really performs.  I can take it on a travel excursion and the battery charge lasts for days.  I don&#x27;t even take the UV recharger on most trips.  You do have to spend some time cleaning the brush and the UV compartment from mouth gunk from time to time.  Overall it really is a good product.  It is expensive but over the years of use it is overall a good value for the benefits that it provides for you and your family.</li>
            <li> I agree it&#x27;s a great toothbrush but I constantly turn if off while using due to placement of on-off button. It&#x27;s right where my thumb is when I use it. Anyone else keep turning off unit?</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about a year ago at my dentist&#x27;s office.  I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning by itself and in the evening combined with a Braun/Oral B which is better at scrubbing off the plack on my molars near the gums.  It&#x27;s been good up till yesterday when it ran weakly for about 10 seconds and stopped and won&#x27;t run now.  Always kept it in the charger.  I&#x27;ve been reading the one-star reviews here on Amazon and I see that a lot of people have had the same experience as I.  I spent a lot of time on the phone trying various numbers I was given and never got a number that works for tech support.    Some Sonicare reviewers recommend similar brushes by Interplak and the Cybersonic 2.  I&#x27;m going to try one or both of these.  What I&#x27;ve got now is a piece of toxic waste that can&#x27;t be recycled.      It looks like the Cybersonic 2 is similar to and superior to the Sonicare: it cycles at a higher speed and lasts longer.  And the Interplak is similar to and superior to the Braun/Oral B brushes: each tuft rotates, rechargeable batteries are apparently replaceable and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sonicare unit a year and a half ago, and the unit stopped functioning after about 6 months, they replaced it, and now 6 months later I&#x27;m having the same issue. The brush handle still vibrates and holds a charge, but it seems as though the piece that connects to the brush has come disconnected from the motor. I had the same failure both times. They are sending another replacement to their credit, but it seems like 6 months is about the lifespan of this particular model.  The bulb only lasted about 2 months in the 1st unit as well, but has survived in my current unit.  I love it otherwise, I just wish the build quality matched the price.</li>
            <li> I am not able to purchase new toothbrush heads that stay on the handle when in use.  This is irritating and frustrating at a time when I have not yet had my coffee.</li>
            <li> WHAT CAN I SAY? MY OLD SONICARE WAS ACCIDENTALLY DISPOSED OF BY AN ORDERLY WHEN I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR A SURGERY LAST MAY. I SPENT NINE MONTHS WITHOUT ONE, SO I UPGRADED. SINCE I RECEIVED MY NEW SONICARE FLEXCARE LAST MONTH, I AM DELIGHTED WITH HOW MY DENTAL HEALTH HAS IMPROVED. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! ORDERLIES,.....YOU ARE ON NOTICE!!!!</li>
            <li> have used sonicare in the past, and bought them for my family and friends for birthdays and holidays... have been told it is the best gift i&#x27;ve given. after 5+ yrs of using my old one every day, the battery finally stopped taking a charge so i looked at all the new models and chose this one because i thought the new UV cleaner is a nice feature. i have really enjoyed using this since it arrived, my older model did not have any of the features on the handle so i am not too sure how to use them, or rather - what the differences are in the actual brushing... but even without knowing how to use those features, right out of the box (and after a charge) it works great. i would recommend sonicare toothbrushes to everyone.</li>
            <li> I paid $189 for the Sonicare Flexcare in November 2007. Now it buzzes horribly and stops when touched to the teeth. I contacted Sonicare and was told it is warranteed for 2 years. And Sonicare only expect their toothbrushes to last 3 to 5 years (less than 3 years for me).    Our first electric toothbrush lasted 10 years.    If you want to spend a lot of money on a bad product, get a Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new Phillips rechargeable toothbrush!  I tried two other battery toothbrushes and liked the process but knew I needed a rechargeable.  Although my lips didn&#x27;t appreciate the tingle for a few days, that has now gone away and I am able to benefit from the full cycle.</li>
            <li> I have owned two Sonicare Flex in the last 18 months from two different vendors.  One was bought from Sam Club and the other was from Amazon.  Both does the tooth cleaning well when they are working.    Both Sonicare Flex have the same problem: quit working after 9 to 12 months.  Both batteries were still hold charge, and the vibrating mechanisms were still working.  Inspection of both Sonicare found a small screw (approx 3/8\\&quot; long) that transferred the vibration to the brush was backing out completely.    It takes less than 5 min to pull the Sonicare Flex gut out and re-install the screw.  However, the design can be improved to prevent it from happening in the first place.  For a person that can not fix the issue, paying &gt; $120 a year on tooth brush is not acceptable.  [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used Sonicare exclusively for &amp;#62;10 years, and now so do our children. During this time, we&#x27;ve owned many models. My experience has been that the battery life has been reduced drastically during this time. This most recent purchase had a battery life of less than 2 years from the time we began using it, a common complaint you can read in the reviews for every one of their recent models. When you&#x27;re spending over $100 for a toothbrush, that&#x27;s simply unacceptable. Moreover, the design prevents the consumer from replacing the rechargeable battery only. The battery is &amp;#34;hard wired&amp;#34; inside and access to the battery is impossible for practical purposes. At best, this is consumer-unfriendly and at worst, it appears to be planned obsolescence in order to encourage repeat revenue from newer models. Philips could make any number of paths to improve the consumer experience here, including: inclusion of better batteries with longer lifespans, and/or a longer warranty of the battery, and/or redesign to allow a consumer easy replacement of the battery.  They haven&#x27;t.  Ask yourself why.</li>
            <li> wonderful! im a dental asst. and i bought this one for a freind and she loves it. We promote this Sonicare at our office. Great price</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and does a great job keeping our teeth healthy. The problem we have with it is that it only lasts about a year. The first one was replaced by Philips, but the third one, they said, was not covered, so we had to purchase it. The first two just stopped working. Hopefully this one will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I had the older sonic care but burned it out when I plugged it into a 220 line in another country.  This model works with either 110 or 220 and automatically adjusts.  This toothbrush is just as good as the other one - which means EXCELLENT.  Buy it and save your teeth.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush I have ever had, my teeth feel extra clean after I use this toothbrush. I would recommend it. I have not tried other sonicare toothbrushes, but I definitely reccomend it over an electric.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works perfectly, holds an extremely long charge, saves toothpaste and is very sanitary. After purchasing one, I purchased two more for my mother and sister. All of us seem to agree that this is a great toothbrush. It is also a solid improvement over the older generations as toothpaste and muck does not collect under the toothbrush head. This toothbrush is essentially perfection.</li>
            <li> Okay I love, love, love this sonic toothbrush.  It makes my teeth feel like they just been cleaned by my dentist.  It&#x27;s awesome.  Plus the UV light to keep the germs at bay is a great thing.  I say everyone should own this toothbrush and won&#x27;t be sorry when they shell out the cash for one.  Give it a try and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush just about 2 years ago. The battery is not functional, and there is no way to replace it. It is a very expensive purchase when the battery life is so poor. There are other options. I would not recommend this toothbrush for long-term use.</li>
            <li> I have never used anything for brushing but a manual toothbrush. This sonicare flexcare is quite expensive compared with other choices, but seems to be really effective without being abrasive. The tingling feeling on teeth and gums is unusual, but not unpleasant to me. I&#x27;ve always been a stickler for trying to give my teeth that \\&quot;slick clean\\&quot; feeling, and this brush seems to do it every time. I had a comment from my dentist after only a week or so of using the sonicare...he said, \\&quot;Well, something you&#x27;re doing is really making your teeth and gums look better.\\&quot;    I agree with a comment from at least one other reviewer about not needing all the options for different settings and timers with the brush, especially if they are adding to the price. I could get by with one setting, as the great sonic action seems to be the most needed feature. I use the sanitizer but I have no idea if it is doing any good.    Only one real negative: replacement brush heads are too expensive.</li>
            <li> I enjoy ever morning and evening that I use this toothbrush. The different settings are great, and when I&#x27;m in a rush I can set the toothbrush to clean in a fast amount of time.    I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush with Sanitizer.  After the first use, my teeth felt like they had been professionaly cleaned.  After only a couple of brushings, my teeth were noticeably whiter.  I visited my dentist a week later, and he remarked at how healthy my gums looked.  I feel like this system might save me from having to have serious dental work later on.  The sanitizer is awesome during this cold/flu season.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about reinfecting myself by using a contaminated tooth brush.  I am totally sold!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my adult son as a gift.  His dentist had recommended this because of his sensitive gums.  He is thrilled with its performance and the results.   [[ASIN:B002SEEILI Sonicare Flexcare Flex Care Plus + for GUM Gums Professional Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily for less than a year.  I agree that it does a good job of cleaning; however, the UV bulb in the sanitizer  did not last the year and I have found that replacement bulbs can only be purchased from Philips by calling them directly (800-370-6369).  I had to call their fulfillment center twice (the first time I was disconnected) with an average wait of around 20 minutes.    The replacement bulbs are also not cheap - $17.95 including shipping.    Something to be aware of before you invest in this product.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 months for me to convert to this as my primary toothbrush.  Took awhile to get used to the all the noise &amp; vibrating.  Proof that you get what you pay for came at yearly check-up time when my dentist asked...\\&quot;Do you use a SonicCare brush? You&#x27;re teeth are so clean!\\&quot;  Not sure if the UV cleaner is really killing any germs but the cleaning action gets an A++.</li>
            <li> This is now the 2nd Soincare FlexCare Plus toothbrush I have owned. The first was given to me as a gift a little over a year ago. It was my first electric toothbrush and I absolutely loved it. The UV sanitizer was an added plus, even though I&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s useful (other than making me THINK I&#x27;m using a cleaner toothbrush as a result). There are various settings for the toothbrush depending on how sensitive your gums are, or depending on what type of brushing you prefer. After using the toothbrush, I was convinced that my teeth felt much cleaner and smoother than they ever had when using a manual toothbrush. Once again, I know there are studies out there that state a manual toothbrush is as effective, if not more effective, than an electric, but I preferred the electric.    Despite the above glowing review, after about a year, the toothbrush stopped working properly. It would not charge properly and it would go on/off even when I hadn&#x27;t pressed the button. Upon further inspection, I realized that the rubber that insulated the electronics from the outside had become loose and as a result, water had damaged the internals. At that point, it was worthless. I bought another one because I found it at a great price, so hopefully I&#x27;m more successful with this one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone like me who is always yelled at for not brushing properly.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best solution for brushing because it apparently does everything by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That includes by the way disinfecting the heads, using the built-in UV light that it comes with on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a wedding present &amp; one of the best ones I received I might add.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical a bit with the high price tag of Sonicare sonic toothbrushes. Luckily, I found the Flexcare model on sale on Amazon.com at a much more reasonable price than the retail price in stores, so I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I bought it; money well-spent. (Amazon.com&#x27;s shipping is also very prompt.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Compared to other powered toothbrushes out there, the Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush is not very noisy. I actually think it is quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The best of all: the feeling of \\&quot;dentist cleaned\\&quot; teeth makes brushing enjoyable. Don&#x27;t know about the older models, but the Flexcare model (I got it with the Sanitizer intergrated) works so well. I no longer need to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; back and forth (thus reducing gum irritation), but still get very clean teeth after each sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The toothbrush handle is light-weighted overall, slim and easy to handle. The toothbrush plus UV Sanitizer whole system looks good on the shelf when it is charging. The brushheads are easy to remove and install. The standard brushhead is just the right size for daily use, not bulky like the manual toothbrushes nowadays. The compact head is also the right size for the hard-to-reach teeth areas. I also like the convenience of three cleaning modes and the intensity level variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I have used it for two days now and my teeth appear polished and shiny. The Flexcare model is not advertised by Sonicare as \\&quot;Healthy whitening\\&quot;, but I have a strong feel that eventually my teeth will soon become a shade or two brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) I used the UV Sanitizer once, and the brushheads appear \\&quot;dry and nicely warmed\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t know if they are actually sanitized, but there is no way to test that of course. (I only wish that the UV Sanitizer would have some kind of music / sound to let you know when the process is all done.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a very thrifty person like me to write this 5-star review for this toothbrush, I definitely believe it is worth every penny. The retail pricing is actually too high / inflated price tag, but if you can get it \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; at a reduced price, then go for it...Give it to yourself as a healthy treat!price tag, but if you can get it \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; at a reduced price, then go for it...Give it to yourself as a healthy treat!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare electric brush and I must say I love it! I use it twice a day and after two weeks can already tell that it was worth the money! So what are you waiting for BUY NOW!</li>
            <li> I love the soniccare toothbrush with sanitizer.  My teeth and gumshave never felt better.  This seller mailed the product promptly and it arrived earlier than estimated.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had my last Sonicare toothbrush for 7 years before it finally gave out on me. Rechargeable batteries do not last forever, so is life, however this new FlexCare toothbrush is even better than my last one. the LED display to let you know which mode you&#x27;ve switched to is awesome, the multiple modes is fantastic new touch to an already good item.     Plain and simple you can not get the same level of cleaning with a manual toothbrush, it is just not possible. I highly recommend the Sonicare products, but they are not for everyone, the light buzzing can be an annoyance to people who are easily annoyed, but with time even they can get used to the Sonicare system.    Unknown Soldier</li>
            <li> I was a bit hestitant to order this on-line but I was unable to find it in my local area.  I am glad I  made this purchase.  I love the ease of using the Sonicare Toothbrush right out of the box.  I am very happy with my purchase.  My mouth feels cleaner than using a regular toothbrush.  Great buy...Great Price!  Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Like going to the dentist at home</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing an electronic toothbrush, particularly considering the price. However, this product is great - my teeth haven&#x27;t felt as clean since I last visited the dentist, which was too long ago! It definitely takes a bit getting used to - but once you get over the initial period of getting used to it you&#x27;ll never want to use a manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product that should make your next dental appointment for teeth cleaning much easier.    It is a bit pricy but appears to be well built so it will pay for itself; I was really surprised at how clean my teeth felt after the first use.    With so many models to choose from with or without the UV light anyone can improve their smile at a price within your budget.    HH</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000V9ZJ56 Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush without UV Sanitizer]]    This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  My teeth feel like I just left the dentist office.  I&#x27;ll never be able to go back to a regular toothbrush again.  The vibration does take a little getting used to and it is a little loud but the pros completely outweight the cons with this product.  When I first saw the price I thought that I would be writing a review telling people that it is way too expensive....Boy, was I wrong!  I think this toothbrush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> First of all I know it sounds pricey but worth every dime.. The first time I used it I felt like I just had a cleaning, I couldnt stop running my tongue over my teeth.. it really does the job.. the design is sleek and I love the UV sanitizer for the heads.. Nice compact design for the bathroom and even a travel charger is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was one of these people who would buy the cheap electric ones for a couple of bucks. I figured how different could it be.. well believe me its like night and day.. I would recommend this HIGHLY</li>
            <li> This is my First Electronic brush and i am happy that i had made the decision to buy this. I have some unaligned teeths and there was some brown spots on 3 of my front teeths which don&#x27;t even go away from dentist cleaning. I am using this brush for now almost a month and they have disappeared from 2 teeth and 1 of them is fading away.     It takes a while to get used to it maybe because this is my first brush. the amazon price was little bit higher when i purchased and now i see the same in walmart for 94$.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun Oral B electric toothbrush for years and my dental check-ups were not better or worse. I saw a store exhibit of the Philips Sonicare Flexcare and was very interested. I also read the reviews here and finally took the plunge. WOW! The Flexcare is fantastic!! It cleans my teeth like a professional cleaning and leaves them so shiny. Also, I am amazed how effective the system is at getting rid of food between teeth that flossing didn&#x27;t get. I did have a little of gum bleeding for about 3 days. It was no worse than what happens with a professional cleaning. They are not bleeding anymore. This is a wonderful product that everyone should have. The $170.00 price tag is steep but it pays for itself compared to having crowns and fillings because the Oral B did not do its job. The UV sanitizer is a nice bonus. It keeps the brush head clean and dry and is much more effective than just rinsing. I made the move and glad I did it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome. You will pay more for this product, but will be very happy with the results. All the reviews I had read on this product were right on. You just can&#x27;t get a better result from any other product on the market. I am a sonicare customer for life, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> The truth is this piece is great. I am a 50 year smoker, my teeth are white. And getting whiter. Using peroxidide along with toothpaste to step it up. Exceptional cleaning, my mouth is a whole new place.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel smooth after each time you use it - just like when you leave the dentist office. It feels good on your teeth and gums. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are much whiter after using just a few weeks! I&#x27;ve also had no cavities since the purcahse. Although I must mention this recent experience:  I recenlty wrote Sonicare to tell them how disappointed I am in the life-span of the sonicare toothbrushes we&#x27;ve purchased. My husband and I purchased one for each of us and one as a gift for a family member. That was a little over 2 years ago. Since then mine started buzzing in the middle of the night and luckily was covered under warranty. My husbands just started doing the same thing and unfortunately his isnt covered under warranty any longer. We talked to my husbands sister (who we got it for as a gift) and she said hers quit working awhile back too. This is really frustrating as these toothbrushes arent cheap and I think it&#x27;s a bummer they only last about 2 years and then die out. I think the consumer should know they are spending that kind of money on a product that only lasts so long. It&#x27;s an amazing product but it&#x27;s very disappointing for us to have to buy another one after buying 3 which all turned out to be faulty. When I contacted Sonicare they told me:  Harry: I&#x27;m sorry for the inconvenience, but since its a technical device most of its life depends on how its been used and some time they fall faulty.  Me:I find it odd that 3 out of 3 toothbrushes failed within the first 2 years. How could we all be using the toothbrush in a faulty way?  Basically he just said that since it&#x27;s not under warranty there&#x27;s nothing they can do and ended the chat abruptly. He did give me this link to follow up furhter: Harry: [...]  I hope no one else is having this problem but 3 out of 3 toothbrushes that ended up faulty is a bit ridiculous, and Sonicare wont help you after the warranty. It&#x27;s like the design them to fail after 2 years (conveniently when they are out of warranty). I wish we could avoid buying these toothbrushes but they are so great for your teeth. I think consumers need to flood them with complaints if this is also happening to you. It&#x27;s just not fair!</li>
            <li> I thought the toothbrush was a bit more powerful then the units before it which made the clean feeling even better. The product works great and I loved that it came with 2 brush heads rather then just one size. I also love the UV cleaner because it makes a great storage place for the brush head and it also kills the germs.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush.  My first lasted for almost 10 years before the battery gave out.  This new one is even more fantastic than the old model.  I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it was possible, but it&#x27;s like getting a cleaning at the dentist every time I use it.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I had the Sonicare some years ago.  When I needed to replace it after years of \\&quot;service\\&quot;, I bought a Braun (because it was cheaper).  However, I found my teeth never felt very clean and I had to use a dental tool to clean around my crowns and around my back teeth.  I wanted to go back to the Sonicare and really liked the idea of the sanitizer (if you have ever researched all of the germs and bacteria in the bathroom, you&#x27;ll know why), but I felt the added cost was prohibitive.  I weighed the cost of this new Sonicare toothbrush against the cost of going to the dentist and decided it was a good investment in my overall health.  WOW!  I was GREATLY pleased with the new Sonicare with sanitizer.  I find it cleans my teeth outstandingly and even gets around my back teeth and especially my crowns.  I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a few weeks ago and it has done wonders for my mouth care routine. The toothbrush not only cleans my teeth a lot better, but keeps them clean for much longer as well, when I wake up in the morning it still feels like I just brushed my teeth! I would absolutely recommend that anyone should buy this brush and it will make your mouth care routine much more rewarding and guided.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Philips Sonicare Elite e9500 Custom Care Power Toothbrush]]  this is quite an improvement from the last one that I have used for several years.  My teeth feel very clean almost like a dentist has cleaned them.  would not do without. Rate a strong 5.</li>
            <li> It works great but with a short life.  It worked only 5 months and the shaft was dislocated.  I sent it back to Philips and required 2 weeks to repair.</li>
            <li> The new flexcare is smaller and lighter, but the vibrator mechanism is build-in the handle and doesn&#x27;t provide as much torque as the older model like the Advance. I have them both, turn them on and press the heads lightly on my skin, the Advance seems to provide as much as 40% more torques than the Flexcare. It is important because lack of torque will prevent Flexcare owners using heavy toothpaste such as Colgate Total, also, its bristles are not of same high quality like the Advance&#x27;s     Few positive improvements of Flexcare compared to the older model:     * New design prevents saliva and water to form behind the base that     required weekly clean up     * Lithium battery can be replaced if worn out.     * Light weight, easier to held thus more useful    * Smaller head makes cleaning in tight spot easier.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start by saying I hate brushing my teeth.  It was a chore which took time but I did it because I HAVE to (no one wants stinky breath).  I&#x27;ve heard so much about different mechanical toothbrushes and I first bought the Oral B version because it was cheaper and I really didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing much.  After brushing with Oral B I&#x27;d pass my tongue over my teeth and still feel some \\&quot;grit\\&quot;.  I then bought this Sonic set and let me tell you how much I ENJOY and look forward to brushing everyday (several time a day now).  I travel a lot and I love how I can take the toothbrush with the included travel charger and throw it in my bag knowing I will still get the Sonic clean feeling while I&#x27;m away from home and don&#x27;t have to use the crappy manual stuff.  Not to mention how I feel \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; with the attached sanitizer.  I don&#x27;t know if it truly works or no, but it does make me \\&quot;feel\\&quot; like it&#x27;s a clean toothbrush head during every brush.  I can not even imagine going back to manual brushing thank to this great invention!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVES IT!!!  This is amazing!  It is really awesome being able to sanitize my toothbrush.  I do it once a week!  Again this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of auto tooth brushes and did not care for them. I decided to take a chance and get it. No regets, the wife likes it too.</li>
            <li> Product just as described... does a fantastic cleaning job &amp; the UV sanitizer is so cool! Now that I have had electric, I could never go back to manual.</li>
            <li> We have had the toothbrush since December.  I had read reviews on many different \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrushes and am SOOO glad I chose this one.  I feel that I brushed my teeth real well with a manual toothbrush, but boy was I surprised on how wrong I was. My teeth have NEVER felt so clean. They are actually squeaky clean.  I do agree that its kind of noisy &amp; I sure did make a mess the first time I used it, but that being said, if you want great feeling and clean teeth, take the plunge!</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit in mid November and 45 days later the sanitizer quit working.  While I enjoyed the unit very much I have to give it a low rating as I believe that for items that cost as much as this should last longer than 45 days.  I requested a replacement from Amazon, and was promptly told \\&quot;sorry it is over the 30 days...go see the manufacturer\\&quot;.  Too bad for me.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush performs quite well. The battery and charger also work well. The sanitizer bulb burnt out in less than 3 months of daily use. Call phillips for replacement bulb to purchase. They are unable to get any bulbs. Customer service unhelpful, warehouse emlpoyee was rude. They basically told me to find my own source. I&#x27;ve searched the internet, unable to find a replacement bulb. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SANITIZER.[[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> Much lighter to hold than the previous Sonicare version.  Bristles move alot faster, leaving a fresher, cleaner feel to your gums and teeth.  After just one month of using the FlexCare, my hygienist said today she has seen an improvement from the last appointment six months ago.</li>
            <li> I really love this system!!! I have been using this for about 6 months. During the first 4 months I used it only once a day, then went to get my teeth cleaned. I asked how my teeth looked. She said that they looked really good and I had very little or no plaque build up. I am also very happy with the sanitizing portion of this system. It makes me feel very calm about the cleanliness of the toothbrush. I am so glad that I purchased this system!! And will purchase one again when this one breaks!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare FlexCare rechargeable toothbrush is lightweight, comfortable to hold, and comes with a variety of functions:  Just press a button to set it for a thorough Cleaning (too much vibration and tickling for me and it shakes the toothpaste off), Sensitive (perfect for me) and Gum Massage, which is great when you have extra time.  You can also set it for Go Care which is one-minute long, and Max Care, which is three-minutes long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has bristles of various lengths that get in-between the teeth  and feel quite soft.  The motor is quiet on the Sensitive setting, and won&#x27;t wake anyone else up.  The recharger base has a nifty UV sanitizer cycle to keep your brush tip clean.  There are three color bands to place on the brush tips, but it comes with only two tips.  (For this price, I would expect at least four brush tips, since they recommend a new tip every three months.)  The kit includes a handy, small travel recharger and a nice travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy my Sonicare and will continue to use it.  It&#x27;s good-looking, easy to use, does the job, and feels good.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> ok, so i lucked out and got to try this out free as a bzzz reviewer.  but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this is an amazing gadget.  here&#x27;s why:  1.  it looks pretty.  this does not rank high on my list of necessary attributes of my toothbrush, but i just had to say it.  and now the fact that it is, makes me happy.  2.  it&#x27;s easy to use, despite being packed with features.  won&#x27;t bore you with the details (which you can read above in the item description), but really, you have just enough options not to overwhelm you, but to suit your every dental hygienic need (short of a root canal or cavity filling, but you shouldn&#x27;t need them if you keep using this thing).  the 2 week \\&quot;ramp-up\\&quot; program that gradually increases the power for the 1st 2 weeks you use it is pretty cool.  3.  it sterilizes your toothbrush heads.  i keep reading those gross articles that talk about the bacteria growing on toothbrushes and flying through the air from flushing toilets and i had to just not think about it.  now i can think about it and say, &#x27;ha ha--i gotcha!  die a terrible uv death, you bastards!&#x27; to those nasty, nasty microbes.    4.  it&#x27;s fun to use.  which means i&#x27;m now a thorough brusher.  ok, so i NEVER in a million years thought i&#x27;d use an electric toothbrush b/c i thought it was a stupid idea.  but this thing makes me actually want to brush, and even gets me to brush for an entire 2 minutes each time!  my dentist would approve.  now if they could only do something like this for flossing...    the only drawbacks i see are:  1.  i totally agree with the whole messiness issue.  toothpaste spit goes flying everywhere unless i keep my mouth closed and even then, i drool.  guess it gives philips another reason to invent something i didn&#x27;t think i needed--a toothbrushing shield/guard to protect my mirror from all those annoying toothpaste spit spray dots.  i just make sure to change into my day clothes AFTER brushing.  hint:  ALWAYS always *ALWAYS* turn off the toothbrush BEFORE removing it from your mouth, unless you want the &#x27;snow-covered&#x27; look on every surface in your bathroom.  2.  it&#x27;s slightly more cumbersome to travel with.  but i don&#x27;t do much traveling anymore w/2 small kids.  and even if i did, i could just bring a regular toothbrush and leave my new treasured toothbrush safely at home.  3.  i guess i&#x27;ll have to buy refills.  which i&#x27;m sure will cost more than the 2 buck ones at the drugstore.  but did i mention my toothbrush is now pretty?</li>
            <li> I bought mine in August of 2009 from Amazon.  It worked fine until about a month ago.  It worked intermittently, then it would not work at all. Then all of the sudden in the middle of the night it started to turn itself on then off, then one night it never stopped.  I had to throw it outside just to get back to sleep!!!  Needless to say it is now worthless and in the trash can.  For the amount of money I paid for it in 2009 ($150) I would expect something that works for more then 1.5 years.  I won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I had an older version and needed to upgrade.  I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t use all the features, but alas, I have and do.  I love using the massage feature at night and I use the quick care when I&#x27;m rushing out the door.  I&#x27;m also glad that they have a sensitive setting too as sometimes my teeth and gums need that as well.  All in all, very happy with it and glad I purchased on with multiple options/settings.</li>
            <li> I have not received this product I purchased.I have been trying to contact someone in regards but without any luck.</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of the Sonicare Flexcare HX6930 toothbrush(s) about a year ago from Costco. I paid around $150, which included the UV Sanitizer, a few extra brush heads, and the travel charger.  There&#x27;s a lot to like about this unit&#x27;s ergonomics, but two glaring fault&#x27;s make all the good things about it unimportant. The unit does not allow battery replacement, and the high breakage rate (motor to brush head coupling) indicate a very problematic design. Both of these problems happened several months ago, and so neither of my brushes now work. I have spent some time on the net researching these issues, only to find out that my problems are certainly not unique, and that subsequent models (I was hoping for a fix) still have the same issues. It is obvious that Sonic did not place the same emphasis on reliability that they placed on such an elegant design. I cannot recommend this unit; The cost, lack of manufacturers commitment to addressing the design flaws, and continuing to produce newer models with the same flaws only indicate a profit over all else approach.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it!  My teeth look and feel amazing after I use it.  My old style tooth brushes and hand could never give me the cleaning that I get each time I use this.  Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Had mine for about two years now and it is still going strong. Battery life still last forever. I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times -no problem. Phillips, I will make deviled eggs for your next company picnic; I love you.</li>
            <li> At my last dental checkup, the dentist said I had early gum disease and needed deep scaling/planing. My hygienist, who did the scaling, recommended I start using a Sonicare FlexCare Plus. After shopping around, I opted for the plain FlexCare model, because it has all the same functions as the Plus--they&#x27;re just labelled differently. Also, at Amazon I was able to get this model with the UV brush sanitizer.  I was skeptical about spending so much money for a toothbrush, but the positive reviews, plus my disdain for periodontist visits, convinced me to try it. Upon arrival, I charged it for 24 hours before using it, during which time I thoroughly read the instructions. I suggest any buyer do the same, as this thing has a lot of settings and options.   Once I started brushing with it, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in how my teeth feel after using the FlexCare. I use the standard cleaning cycle, two minutes with a pause and beep every 30 seconds to tell you when to move to the next quadrant. My teeth feel noticeably cleaner and smoother after brushing with the FlexCare, pretty much like when you get them cleaned at the dentist. Can&#x27;t tell much difference with my gums, but given its speed when it&#x27;s operating, it obviously does as advertised--forces the toothpaste/water solution between your teeth and under your gum line to completely clean all the places you can&#x27;t get with a normal brush.  The FlexCare comes with two brush heads. The shorter one has a concave bristle surface; the longer one has a double-concave surface and has a larger set of bristles, and is supposed to do a more through cleaning job. I use that one; the smaller one seems better suited for a child.  The handle unit seems well made and carefully sealed against moisture. The weight is about perfect--just heavy enough to keep it stable when it&#x27;s running, but not too heavy to maneuver and hold for several minutes. It&#x27;s also well balanced.  At first, the controls and LED indicators on the brush handle seem confusing--but I&#x27;ve brushed manually for the last couple decades, so that&#x27;s likely just me. The power button is logically placed just under your thumb, and all you really need to do is turn it on and brush. The unit shuts off automatically. The only time you have to push another button is when you&#x27;re changing brushing cycles.  The handle comes set by default to the two-minute clean cycle, the 30-second beep cycle, and the startup mode--this uses a slower brush rate to start, and gradually increases over the first two weeks to the full speed. You can change the cycle with the handle controls, and the other defaults can be reset while the unit is in the charging stand. There&#x27;s a quick clean cycle and a gentle setting for those with sensitive teeth.  The two-week startup mode is a great feature, because this brush takes some getting used to. It vibrates so fast that it startles you unpleasantly if you touch the plastic shaft of the brush tip to your teeth while it&#x27;s running--which is easy to do. It took me a few brushes to get used to shifting directions without inadvertently rattling my teeth.  The FlexCare comes with a soft travel case and a separate travel charger--that&#x27;s a nice touch. They also include a set of three alternate snap-on color rings so multiple family members can easily identify their own brush tip. One thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a separate base or stand for the handle. Our bathroom counter space is limited, so I have the charger/cleaner on a shelf unit separate from our vanity. It&#x27;d be nice to have a small base that would hold the brush upright, rather than tossing it in a drawer or letting it lay on the counter. I don&#x27;t want to keep it in the charger all the time anyway, as it&#x27;s usually better to completely drain a rechargeable battery before recharging. But that&#x27;s a minor gripe.  The only real negative I can see is the cost of replacement brush tips--around $20 for a pack of 3. That can get pricey if more than two people use it. Each tips is supposed to last about three months. There&#x27;s a $5 coupon for these in the FlexCare box, and your dentist probably has the coupons available.   Overall, the FlexCare is worth the money--especially at Amazon&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s made well, comes well-equipped, has a lot of settings to choose from, and most important, it seems certain to do a great job keeping your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this toothbrush because it has a lot of characteristics I don&#x27;t like: needs recharching, expensive consumables (replacement brushes), additional features I don&#x27;t want (UV compartment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week, I have to say the results are amazing and I&#x27;m thrilled enough with the results to take the time to post this review. I am an ardent brusher (2x daily), flosser (1x daily), and mouthwasher (1x daily, after flossing), but this toothbrush does a better job than I ever did. All the feedback I&#x27;ve read about \\&quot;as clean as a dentist visit\\&quot; match my experience. What surprizes me most is that I&#x27;ve even noticed a decrease in \\&quot;morning breath.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this thing is a little scary at first because it buzzes like an orbital sander. I was really worried because I have rather tender gums with some receeding gum lines; I was surprized that this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt me anywhere.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It is easy to use.  The UV Sanitizer is great.</li>
            <li> Having owned the original Sonicare for about 4 years now I was impressed and then disappointed when my battery finally gave out, then I found the Sonicare RS930!    After doing a little research I picked one up...      Yes its a little pricey as most point out, but what is your only set of teeth really worth to you?  Thinking about that anything in the Sonicare line is inexpensive!  I read over every review I could find and as many pointed out it looks like some of the &#x27;annoying&#x27; issues have been corrected over the original model (mold/scum collecting under the brush head mount, handle sticking to the charger like glue at times!)    I have only used this brush a hand full of times since it is brand new but there is no doubt its a night and day improvement over the original Sonicare.  I really like the smaller size of both the handle and brush head, the brush head is much easier to move around in your mouth and reach the very back.  I am still up in the air on all the new &#x60;settings/cleaning modes&#x27; but I will definitely give them all a try.  The UV sanitizer is one of those things you really didn&#x27;t know you needed but the more I think about it it&#x27;s a must have and great idea!    If there is one thing I wish could change a little is the price of the brush heads themselves, yes they are cheaper then the other Sonicare models but at about $10 each they still seem a little high priced for what they are... even with that I have no complaints!    There is no doubt that my teeth feel cleaner then with the earlier model Sonicare.  Hands down this is a very big improvement over the original Sonicare and I would recommend to anyone who cares about their teeth!</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush a lot but the 2 that I bought for my family both stopped working - one 2 and a half years after purchase and the other 3 years after purchase. Both died the same death - waking us at night buzzing nosily on the charging base.  I called Philips but they won&#x27;t do anything about it because they are out of warranty.  (The warranty is 2 years.)  So, if you&#x27;re willing to pay $100+ for something that will only last you a few years, this toothbrush is for you. Back to manual brushing for us.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever purchased and used an electric toothbrush.  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. The initial investment might be a bit expensive but your oral care/health is worth the investment. My teeth feel clean and are more white than when I used a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrish for my husband never thinking it would come before we left for vacation.  To my suprise i recieved this the product within days!!</li>
            <li> Just like another reviewer posted, my overpriced toothbrush crapped out 10 days after the Amazon return policy.  Just like his, it lights up, but doesn&#x27;t vibrate even though the battery is fully charged.  I will have to send it back to Philips.  Save your money and buy 100 regular toothbrushes and you will be much happier.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best toothbrush I have ever had so far and have had a few of the earlier models and they were each better than their earlier versions so this is not a surprise. I also was very happy with the results I had with the Amazon service. I had delivery issues from the post office loosing my order and the replacement order went very smooth from Amazon though I had to call as the e-mail customer service needs some work.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job of leaving your teeth feeling clean.  I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness of the sanitizer, but I guess it gives you some peace of mind knowing your toothbrush is germ free. Also, I don&#x27;t really use all of the extra options that are on the toothbrush, but maybe one day I will.   It is definitely worth the money.  There is no comparison between the feeling you get from the sonicare versus a standard toothbrush.  I just hope it lasts long time.</li>
            <li> I actually received this toothbrush free as a product test over a year ago and I still use it everyday.  It is the best.  My teeth always feel so clean, like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  I love that the sanitizer cleans the brushhead after each brush.  I always brush my teeth now for the full two minutes.  It&#x27;s the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned and if this one ever dies, I&#x27;ll be replacing it with the same thing!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used other electric toothbrushes in the past, but always ended up switching back to a conventional toothbrush because I felt like they never cleaned my teeth well enough.  My dentist recommended I try a sonicare brush for an even better cleaning.  However, I waited for years to purchase one because I thought the price was too much and I figured I could do just as good a job myself.  Lately, I decided to go ahead and give it a try and I am sooo happy I did.  I immediately noticed a difference in the brightness of my teeth, and they were soooo clean, as if I had just returned from the dentist.  The sonicare brush also made it easy to get the teeth further back in my mouth really clean.  This is definitely a great investment and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.  I am in love!  Amazon shipped it within 24 hours too even though I selected the free shipping method.  It comes with a carrying case, extra charger for travel and two brushheads with covers to keep them nice and clean during travel too which I love.  This product deserves more than 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This was amazing product i used.</li>
            <li> Unlike the older Sonicare models, this one has a cheap rubber green button that disintegrates after 6 months of usage. Five months into my brushing, it started fraying, grew holes, and popped out. I tried using superglue to keep it attached, but it was hopeless - by six months it had broken off completely and couldn&#x27;t be glued back. Without the green covering, I resorted to using a metal rod to poke at the button to get it to start. Then the brush started vibrating even after I had turned it off (apparently it will work only with the green button!) Unfortunately, I lost my receipt and couldn&#x27;t prove it was still under warranty, so I was out over $100!! Now I see the same type of cheap rubber is being used for the Sonicare FlexCare model. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a fantastic job.  Between this toothbrush and flossing every other day my trips to the dentist are quick and easy.  It&#x27;s also nearly impossible to over brush at the gum line with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like my Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer very much. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush about a year ago for my wife. As far as cleaning teeth, it does an amazing job and the UV sanitizer is a nice bonus. However, after about 5 months, the toothbrush just stopped working - all it would do is emit slight buzz, like the motor is running but it&#x27;s not connected to anything.    Philips replaced the brush very promptly (the service was great) but unfortunately, after about 4 months, the replacement seems to have gone the same way as the original brush. It is dead and I will be contacting Philips again.     Maybe it was just really bad luck, because were it not for this reliability issue, the product would easily earn a 5-star rating. But based on our experience, it is tough to recommend it, especially given the pretty high price. FWIW, I have been using the Oral-B Triumph for over 3 years without a problem but my wife feels its cleaning effectiveness is inferior to the Sonicare. Guess we&#x27;ll just have to see how long the second replacement will last...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a month now and it&#x27;s still on the first charge.  I read a review that said he couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in vibration.  I&#x27;ve had other Sonicare toothbrushes that made my hand go numb, this one doesn&#x27;t. Much lighter.  Additionally, I really like the three brushing cycles 1-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> An excellent product that performs well. Much better than the Oral \\&quot;B\\&quot; I used previously. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is due to the unavailability of firm brushes. It seems that med. brushes are the only ones available.</li>
            <li> Although I balked at the price of the toothbrush, when I made up my mind to attack my dental problems the Sonicare Toothbrush was the first to come to mind. It is so worth the money. Everytime I brush I feel like I just left the dentists office for a cleaning. The vibrations seemed a little intense but after a few uses it wasn&#x27;t a factor anymore. I had a big problem with tartar and even a few weeks after I left the dentist, I could see the tartar building up again. With the Sonicare Toothbrush that tartar was gone in about a week and I don&#x27;t see it coming back anymore.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I love this toothbrush for all of the reasons listed in these comments. I bought my brush back in September of 2008. In the past week my brush no longer works like it used to and I&#x27;ve been using it according to instructions. I even replaced the toothbrush head thinking this might make it work better. The good news is that this toothbrush does come with a 2 year warranty. Still haven&#x27;t found a way to return the faulty brush but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> My gums are healthier, enamel are stronger, and no cavities etc. It&#x27;s great for the front of the teeth but I prefer manually brushing behind and on top of the bigger teeth in the back. It&#x27;s not a must have product.    Mines broke after 8 months; the metal prong where the brush attaches to broke off. I called Philips&#x27; customer service and said they&#x27;ll send a replacement within 10 business days. It&#x27;s covered under the 2 year manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> just so so, the head is small and stiff, don&#x27;t feel that its an improvement over a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare Flexcare w/ Sanitizer for exactly three days now.  With Optic White toothpaste I can already tell a difference.  It certainly gets the job done.  I have 19 capped teeth and, even though I was afraid the thing would vibrate my caps off, I can already tell that coffee and tea stains are disappearing.  The product seems to be well made.  It comes with two brushes, a sanitizer/charger, a travel case and a travel charger.  I especially like the sanitizer.  The head pops off the toothbrush easily and slips right in the sanitizer.  The sanitizing process takes several minutes but it&#x27;s good to know that there is something in my bathroom that is 99% germ free.  I enjoy the way my teeth and gums feel after I use the toothbrush.  Overall, I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to anyone.  ADDENDUM:  I have been using the toothbrush several weeks now and I have noticed that several people have commented on my teeth.  My sister asked me yesterday at Thanksgiving if I had something done to my teeth! ;)  I told her that all I had done was buy a new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We purchased this at the advice of our dental hygienist.  It arrived in time and was in good shape, just as advertised. Packaging was good and I am quite happy with the purchase. The system takes a little getting used to, but works very well. The oscillation of the brush head is a strange sensation on your teeth and gums, but once you get used to it the system works very well. We have noticed better reports each time we go in for cleaning.</li>
            <li> As a number of other reviewers have noted there are major reliability issues with this brush, and I have gone through 3 in the last year or so.  After 3-6 months the connection between the motor and the brush head fails leaving it useless.  Luckily I got mine through my dentist so I have no issues getting replacements through them, though each time I have had to wait 2 weeks.    As well as it works, for $175 canadian this thing is just not reliable enough, for that kind of money it should last at least a few years, not a few months.  When I can no longer get warranty replacements I will not be buying another one.</li>
            <li> I like almost everything about this product:&lt;br /&gt;Choice of settings: 1 minute setting is nice if you&#x27;re in a hurry, regular setting is just like my old Sonicare and the gum massage setting makes my mouth feel great when I have a minute extra.&lt;br /&gt;Also love the Sanitizer feature and the thinner size of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Got a great checkup after using it, including improvement in my gum pockets.&lt;br /&gt;Since no one has complained about the durability of this brush, I&#x27;m hoping it will last longer than some of the others that have had complaints about battery life and on/off button quality.&lt;br /&gt;Only minor issue I&#x27;ve had is that I have to watch how I hold it or I can accidentally turn it off while brushing.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my recent upgrade from my old model to this one. I don&#x27;t like paying so much for a tooth brush but the UV cleaner sold it for me.</li>
            <li> Stopped working just after the warranty expired. Very disappointing. Was good while it worked though.</li>
            <li> this brush has been in use for 5 years now and it is still trucking.  i think the dual brush unit from costco is a better deal for the same money, but this is a great brush.  i had to take it apart about 3 years in when the post for the head unit seemed to have come disconnected from the main unit internally, making the brush head very wobbly.  it was an easy fix to slide the guts out, put superglue on the post hole and then re-install the head piece.  2 years in it is very sturdy and still cranking.</li>
            <li> Since this is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, I have nothing to compare the Philips Sonic Toothbrush to excecpt the old-fashioned kind of toothbrush and a trip to the dentist. Using the Philips wins hands down. My teeth are much cleaner and brighter and I get a lot of the same results of getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist without the hassle involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though there are bells and whistles associated with this toothbrush, the instructions are easy to read and inderstandable to the electonically challenged, of whom I am one. For example, there is a Clean Mode, described as \\&quot;standard mode for sueprior teeth ceaning; a Sensitive Mode for a more gentle cleaning for sensitive gums and teeth; and finally, a Massage Mode for \\&quot;gum stimulation.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a UV sanitizer for sanitizing the brush head after each brushing that is easy to use and also a carrying case for the toothbrush when you travel.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I&#x27;ve been thinking about buying this toothbrush. The price was stopping me but I was still longing for it. Finally I came across it in a department store and with using a 20% off coupon I didn&#x27;t have to break my budget to buy this. I used it the same day and OMG I&#x27;m so happy I got it! First the noise and vibration alerted me tremendously. I was expecting my teeth to hurt.... but nothing happened. It was rather interesting feeling but not painful. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it pretty fast. I chose &#x27;sesitive mode&#x27; and it was rather short. Maybe it has something to do with the &#x27;breaking-in&#x27; feature of this toothbrush. It will increase the power and time(?) over the next 14 uses. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. My teeth felt wonderful, very clean. And UV sanitizer... I mean, how cool is that? :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have had three sonicare toothbrushes over the last ten years.  This is the best one yet.  Quieter, smaller, and easier to handle.  Only problem is I tend to hit the button that sends it into gum massage mode.  But this is minor.    Without this toothbrush my gums go wild.</li>
            <li> Before I start reviewing, I should mention that I bought the Special Edition package from Costco with 2 Sonicare brushes for about $170.  With this setup you can have His and Hers, one for mom and dad and one for the kids, one for home the other for work, or even one for home and one for vacationing.  Of course, Sonicare&#x27;s reputation precedes itself, which is one reason I bought these.  However, the main reason I chose this model is because it has a thin handle compared to other electric toothbrushes.  This makes it easier for my wife, who has small hands, to use.  The other reason I chose this model is the UV sanitizer; have you ever looked at plaque under a microscope?  Or threw out a brush head ($$$) after getting sick?  Also, the &#x27;Go Care&#x27; and &#x27;Max Care&#x27; settings are very convenient and take the guesswork out of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing in each area of your mouth.  After using it for a month now, I know my teeth are cleaner than when I used to use a regular electric Oral-B.  I recommend the Sonicare Flexcare to anyone who cares about their long-term dental health.  The price is reasonable considering the full 2-year warranty.  And if you can get the Special Edition with 2 handles, even better.  UPDATE 2/3/2012  These still work like new and will hold a charge for at least a month.  Very satisfied with this product.  Although the brush heads are still pretty spendy.</li>
            <li> I had been using Sonicare for several years now and wanted to get a newer model.  My old one wasn&#x27;t charging as easily anymore and I saw this model and thought I might like it better.  It does the job that I expected and the added feature of the uv sterilizer is nice especially after you have had an illness.  I hate to floss and do it infrequently but the brush helps to keep my gums in better shape.</li>
            <li> This is a very good brush. I was originally skeptical, and it took a lot of convincing from my dentist and from 3 rebates (1 amazon discount, 1 amazon coupon, 1 philips mail-in rebate) to finally get it. However after using it for a few weeks I am totally convinced and can&#x27;t imagine going back to manual brushing. It gives a real &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling, very smooth teeths to the tongue.  With negative points however, the 5 timings are an overkill. Two would be enough - the 3 minutes regular brushing and the minute additional.  The UV cleaner is fancy, but I have no medical-base opinion whether it&#x27;s really useful.</li>
            <li> I really like it!  It&#x27;s small and works great!  I always get the fresh out of a dentist chair feeling, but you get use to that feeling after a while.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ll ignore the fact that I found the two pack with an extra handle at Costco for $[...] more than I paid for this just three weeks after I got it for the purposes of this review, that has really pissed me off...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I had mixed feelings about this toothbrush.  I have used the disposable electric toothbrushes in the past, but nothing close to this.  So for anyone thinking of this as their first electric toothbrush, give this one a try for a few weeks.  I found out that they have a 30 day money back deal direct from the manufacturer (check to make sure it still applies before buying), so I figured I had nothing to loose.  I arrived at this one after at least 20 hours of reading reviews online and comparing models, so I&#x27;m positive that I got the best one on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first brush:  As I held the device in my hand and the toothpaste slid off (I guess I should have listened to the person who said to turn it on only once it is touching your teeth), I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if this device could take tar off a roof with how fast it vibrates.  And indeed, it took what was basically tar off my teeth, but it made my teeth, gums and tounge numb when I was finished.  I brushed for about 60 seconds (using a clock with a second hand to make sure I did 15 seconds in each quarter of my mouth) just to be sure I was following the recommended useage for this first time.  I almost returned it right then and there because of how numb my mouth became.  To understand why I didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll have to know a little about my mouth:  My dentist says that I have a plaque problem.  In fact, over the years (because I moved from place to place) I can remember four different dentists telling me that I should be brushing more and flossing more and coming more often.  I go once a year, I brush twice a day, and I floss every few days.  I have never walked away from a dental cleaning (even a \\&quot;full mouth debridement\\&quot; that I had a few years back which took an hour) without being able to still feel ridges at the edge of my teeth where there was still plaque built up (that&#x27;s right folks, I can feel my plaque with my tounge because it is so hardened on).  Ok, back to my story.  As I put the toothbrush head in the UV sanitizer and replaced the handle on the counter, I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t feel any plaque!  In one minute this has done more than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned, more than flossing, more than a full hour of horrible deep cleaning by a dental hygenist, more than four different dentists (and perhaps more when I was younger) could do.  This took all of my plaque away!  I have a cleaning in a few weeks, I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this after the cleaning to tell you what my dentist has to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why four stars?  Well, for two weeks my mouth felt numb after each use, which would have dropped my rating to two stars when balanced with the excellent results.  But after two weeks that started to fade and now I only feel a little tingle.  So I bumped it up to four stars because if you stick with it you&#x27;ll get used to it and not feel it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What other features does it have?  Well, the UV sanitizer was a great deal for me because I have always used one with my regular toothbrushes and I would have had to get one to fit whatever brush I got.  The sanitizer works great and I give it five stars without complaint.  The only thing I can&#x27;t comment on is its longevity, since I have had the cheaper ones break a lot, but hopefully this one is made well and will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the charging base.  This uses a new technology that I read about last year after CES which send electricity to the device just from being within less than an inch of the base top.  Try it, hover above and it will charge!  This is not only cool, it also means no metal to corrode in your bathroom.  The travel charger works the same, but my complaint there is that a lack of weight will cause you to need to position the cord carefully when putting the travel charger down or you wont be able to use it.  Also, the travel case doesn&#x27;t hold the charger.  However, for short trips I&#x27;m going to bring a cheap disposable electric in a travel sanitizer so I don&#x27;t risk my expensive toothbrush so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; travel case is a joke, being that it is made from canvas and very cheap, I give it two stars.  However, I didn&#x27;t expect much so I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is smaller than I am use to.  This was annoying at first, but I got used to it.  If it was larger, it would be harder to fit into smaller curves around the gumline.  Since it does the brushing for me (I just move it slowly back and forth, less than 50 strokes does my whole mouth), this isn&#x27;t a problem at all now.  The pro brush head is also designed well and it cleans great.  I will continue to use that head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the two complaints that I have aside from my initial reaction of numbness:  First, the battery is one of those that you have to use up before you charge.  That isn&#x27;t a problem, except that they should have put a charge button on the charger because I have to store it next to the charger instead of on it when I don&#x27;t want it to charge.  The second complaint is that the programs (which I haven&#x27;t figured out yet) clear whenever you stop using it or if you don&#x27;t turn it on for three seconds.  This means that you have to find your setting, move the brush quickly to your mouth, and turn it on, all within 3 seconds.  And the next time you use it, the brush has reset to its default.  Apparently they put money into designing these program modes but they don&#x27;t want you to use them.  I just ignore them because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, everyone needs this toothbrush!  I hope that dentists start to recommend it and readers start to buy it.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it!  Of course, there are major flaws and if another brand comes out with something better I will be quick to switch, so they really need to put in some more R&amp;D to improve these few flaws before someone else comes out with a product that does...l charger down or you wont be able to use it.  Also, the travel case doesn&#x27;t hold the charger.  However, for short trips I&#x27;m going to bring a cheap disposable electric in a travel sanitizer so I don&#x27;t risk my expensive toothbrush so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me.

            <li> I have owned several rechargeable toothbrushes for years and have been happy.  When I needed to replace mine, on the recommendation of my dental hygienist, and a little rebate offer, I decided to try this.  The brush head is great, I like the different cycles, and the sanitizer is an extra bonus and easy to use.  It seems this brush is simply easier to keep clean as well.  I highly recommend it.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads.     1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That&#x27;s what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.     They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)    2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don&#x27;t have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
            <li> For once I am looking forward to going to the dentist. I have problems with plaque and my dentist gets so annoyed with me - thinking that I do not brush properly. I decided to try the Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush and I am very pleased with the product. My teeth feel so clean and I just know that the plaque problem is over. I am brushing my teeth more often and for a longer period of time. The product is easy to use and the sanitizer keeps the brush clean and dry. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. In addition, I found that Amazon offered the very best price. I see my dentist in February and hope that he is pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my new Sonicare Flexcare with the Sanitizer. I had an older version but it died on me in months ago and I really missed that clean feeling. This one has all the bells and whistles on it of which so far I use 2 of. Soon after getting this my husband came down with a cold so I was very happy to have the sanitizer to help kill any germs if I did get his cold. Love this product and it is much easier to use than my old one - this is much lighter and easier to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> My old Philips Sonicare toothbrush lasted four years before the battery failed.  I bought this one as a replacement for the Sonicare Elite. This is clearly an evolved product (or is that intelligently designed?)    Good points:  - Handle is thinner and easier to hold.  - smaller toothbrush head is more comfortable  - easier to clean and to keep clean (no more gunky buildup inside the brush!)    Neutral:  - UV cleaning cabinet which holds a spare brush. Not yet sure if this makes a difference  - soft carrying case rather than hard plastic case    And the one bad point:  - position of the \\&quot;program selector\\&quot; button. I find it too easy to press the button that changes the cleaning mode while holding the brush.    So definitely a good replacement for the original.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Flexcare product is superior to another electric toothbrush we used for years.  It seems twice as effective.    I am convinced this product will ultimately save substantial dollars in dental care you will not need.  e.g. fillings, gum problems, root canals, etc.    The sanitizer is a great addition and will help with a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> i moved up from an other brand power toothbrush to this model which was recommended by my dentist for better plaque removal.    i usually don&#x27;t use all the modes that this toothbrush comes with, but i was comfortable even with the default settings right from the first time. it is NOT loud (for me) as some other reviewers complained and it is pretty compact compared to other sonicare models. although this comes with 2 brush heads, i imagine most people will end up using the compact one all the time. i like the uv-sanitizer function and use it all the time, but you can argue whether it is needed.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Toothbrush with Sanitizer is an outstanding product and excellent value. It took several days to get use to it, but then it was great. Excellent job in cleaning your teeth and massaging the gums.</li>
            <li> I have been hooked on Sonicare for over 10 years. I wouldn&#x27;t brush with anything else. It has improved the health and appearance of my teeth and gums immensely. Not one cavity in over a decade! I would (and do) recommend it often and give Sonicare as gifts.  This is my 3rd or 4th model. I like that it&#x27;s lighter and smaller and easier to clean.  The one problem I have with this unit is the postioning of the speed settings button. I find myself too often inadvertently changing it with my thumb while brushing, forcing me to turn the brush off and look at the settings button to return it to the desired setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other of the sonicare tooth brushes and like the way my feel after brushing BUT this particular series is a complete waste even though the positives are light weight and it&#x27;s travel ability overseas. If I didn&#x27;t change the brush every month, the bristles have spread apart and will not get the teeth clean. At about $10 a brush this is $120 a year for the brushes plus the $133 you will initially spend. I am really disappointed as I thought I had found the brush that would meet all my needs, travelling, small size and weight plus the cleaning capacity of the previous sonicares. If the tooth brush does indeed last for two years, it&#x27;s still a huge expense.</li>
            <li> This is a great improved toothbrush! I am totally impressed. You feel like your teeth are so clean and that you just came from the dentist. It does an excellent job. My teeth are sensitive but I have been OK with this product. Once you own this it would be very hard to go back to a manual brush. The clean feel just wouldn&#x27;t be there. I would think it would be great for children as it would do a great job of keeping their teeth brushed properly. We all know children and adults rush through the process to simply get it done. This item does the work for you. Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really do like this toothbrush and although my husband did not want me to replace my first one because it only lasted 3 years and is so expensive, I did get another one for $120. The only thing I question though is I noticed this is made in China and how could it cost so much?? Couldn&#x27;t they possibly manufacture these in the US for that price and still make a profit?? That is the only thing about this toothbrush that bothers me, but clearly I liked it enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> We are really enjoying this toothbrush. It vibrates and has a buzzing sound, but it is MUCH quieter than our previous toothbrush (rotating head model). It is quiet, just kind of an odd sensation if you are not used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush if you can afford it! The UV cleaner is very nice, but not essential, so you may want to get the brush by itself if cost is an issue. All in all, great product!</li>
            <li> Date: 12/06/2013 Today, about 1 1/2 years after purchase, the shaft came out of this unit while changing the brush head. I have a couple of these and in my experience, the shafts get wobbly/loose after a year or so. This is the first time one actually pulled out. If you call or Live Chat Philips saying you have a problem, the first thing they ALWAYS ask me is if the shaft is loose. Telling. The Sonicare is my favorite toothbrush. I don&#x27;t find that much of a difference in models. The brush heads are very expensive IMO. Now the failures are annoying BUT Philips has been nothing short of FANTASTIC in replacing these under warranty! No problems at all. A few questions about Model, S/N, date of purchase and BOOM they send me a replacement in a week or two. The old one must be returned.  So they stand behind the thing, but I can&#x27;t help of think it might be better for PR and the bottom line to up the engineering or construction. That&#x27;s their business so it is what it is. I&#x27;ll buy again as necessary.</li>
            <li> For a fair while, I just didn&#x27;t want to take this with me when traveling.  I&#x27;m clutzy and I was afraid I&#x27;d break it, banging around in packing/travel.  But I finally started bringing it because I&#x27;m totally ruined for manual toothbrushes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is fantastic, and I love the feeling of my super clean teeth</li>
            <li> The first few times that I started using the sonicare I felt like I had just come out of a professional cleaning at the dentist (or maybe it&#x27;s just that my teeth are sensitive...) either way I really liked that extra clean feeling every time I brush my teeth now.</li>
            <li> We initially purchased this unit almost 4 years ago back in 2008.  Since then, we have had the original and two replacement units, but all three we have had died.  Philips replaced the first two, but we received the third one more than a year ago so if we want another one, we have to buy it.  The problem is the piece that the head mounts on becomes dislodged/broken inside the unit from the mechanism that vibrates it.  The toothbrush itself is great when it works and really gets your teeth and mount clean.  Just plan on replacing it every 13-16 months.  We are now researching new ones and either will replace it with another Sonicare (this was our second) or go with something else.</li>
            <li> This new brush has far more power than the version I had, which was the version before the Elites (and Phillips&#x27; purchase of Sonicare).  It&#x27;s like putting a jet engine in your mouth (although it&#x27;s not painful or uncomfortable, as all these brushes sometimes can be for first-time users), and you can feel the difference on your teeth when you&#x27;re done.    I also like being able to have different modes of cleaning, for thorough versus on-the-run toothbrushing.  And it&#x27;s nice to have a way to clean the gunk that collects in the spaces in these brushes&#x27; handles and to sanitize them.  That&#x27;s apparently what the UV cleaning feature does, though I haven&#x27;t had the brush long enough to have a view of it.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes of various kinds have been around for a long time now - at least since the sixties - and manufacturers are having to get more inventive about adding features to keep consumer interest.  I have seen one advertised that electronically displays - on a device that you attach to your mirror - what pressure you are applying.  Is that really of any use to anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this new model, Philips have released a high-end (ie horribly expensive) product that has a host of useful features but none that can be dismissed as gimmicks.  You can adjust the type and strength of vibration, you have a timer that encourages you to keep brushing, a travel charger and a very neat UV sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent, but it is very noisy.  Also, the whole thing is designed as if for one person, with just two, different-sized brushes.  Of course, you&#x27;ll be able to buy extra brushes, but there&#x27;s no holder for them.  One reason for getting a brush like this is that it might encourage your gadget-crazy kids to brush their teeth more, so many people will require those extra brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it 5 stars because the quality and performance are so good, but you have to decide if you want to spend all that money on what, when all is said and done, is just a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Reeve.</li>
            <li> This is a quality, easy to use toothbrush that really does seem to get your teeth almost as clean as they are after a visit to the dental hygienist.  And this toothbrush does have some nifty special features including the sanitizer, travel charger, timer and three different speeds. As other reviewers have said this is a noisy gadget but for a few minutes every day it is tolerable.  Is it worth the rather hefty price?  I&#x27;m not sure but I think I&#x27;ll know after I get a report on the state of my gums after my next dentist&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rotodent for the past 5 years. You can only get it from your dentist office and I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with it but it&#x27;s the only electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used so I&#x27;ve had nothing to compare it with. The one problem I&#x27;ve had with the Rotodent is that because the brush is so small and round I was getting some staining on the surface of my teeth and had to alternate using the RD with a regular toothbrush, so since my Rotodent was wearing out I was very interested to try another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try the Sonic to see if I could avoid having to use two different brushes and especially because of the UV sanitizer which the Rotodent doesn&#x27;t have and is a wonderful addition. I love being sure that my toothbrush is clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience was a bit startling. On the regular setting the brush has a bit of a high pitched whine so since then, I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; teeth setting and that works just great. There are two different brush heads, a regular size and a smaller size one. The toothbrush also comes with a travel charger and a travel bag which makes it super easy to take with you on vacation or on work trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that my teeth feel cleaner then they ever have after I get done brushing with the Sonic (other than when the dentist cleans them), so if you&#x27;re looking for clean and healthy teeth and gums this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  You just don&#x27;t know how clean your mouth can be until you try one.  This model comes with some new settings, basically a quick version and a rather intense deep cleaning version that massages your gums.  It also has a travel charger and a brush cleaner mounted to the more stationary charger.  These are handy additions, but the real value is the toothbrush.  It&#x27;s the last toothbrush you&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
            <li> I had the Sonicare Elite from 5 years ago, and its battery ran out (they&#x27;re not replacable). I got the FlexCare and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s a little quieter, quite a bit smaller, and *much* easier to clean.  I use the UV cleaning but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really useful.  I&#x27;ve used the various modes (normal, max, massage, etc.) but don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re that important.  If they come out with a lower-end model without all the various modes, the UV cleaner, etc., at a much lower price, I&#x27;d recommend that over this model.  Still, over 5 years, the price of this model isn&#x27;t too much to spend on your teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great. It is smaller than the previous models yet seems even more powerful. Your teeth feel very cleaned and smooth. I&#x27;ve had mine for almost two weeks (2 x 2 mins a day) and the battery is still on 2 diods out of three. Great thing is that it has the travel charger for up to 220V. I don&#x27;t really use the UV sanitizer and could do without it as well as without all the bells and whistles for little less money but so far I am very pleased. I used to have the AA battery operated e3000 which is a sure \\&quot;self-destructor\\&quot;. I hope this one will last. My only complaint is about the second button, I seem to accidentally switch the modes while brushing because it is quite sensitive. Greatly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to receive this unit as a demo and I have been over the moon about it!  Up until a couple weeks ago, I was using a battery operated oral-b disposable toothbrush.  I had seen electric toothbrushes and I knew that dentists recommended them, but just couldn&#x27;t imagine what was so great about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks of using the sonicare flex care and I have to say, I&#x27;m a total convert.  When my flexcare eventually dies, I will immediately go out and replace it with the best sonicare has to offer because this toothbrush is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers are right... this brush does take some getting used to.  It will feel like an overpowered rocket in your mouth the first time or two you use it... but stick with it.  Your teeth will feel dentist chair clean every time you brush.  I&#x27;ve never been one to make brushing my teeth the biggest priority.  I mean, it was something I did every day, but not something I really focused on...and I had the sensitive gums to show for it.  I use the 3 minute max care cycle twice a day and truly find myself looking forward to brushing... no more \\&quot;ugh, i&#x27;m already in bed and don&#x27;t really feel like brushing...\\&quot; I also find myself flossing a lot more too...mainly because I really see the benefits this brush offers and figure I should do the best I can for my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first read the reviews, I didn&#x27;t really believe that the flexcare would make a difference whitening my teeth.  I&#x27;m pleased to say, I was quite wrong.  I already see a noticeable difference in just two weeks.  I also will do extra massaging on my gums in the mornings.  My gums are pretty sensitive and prone to bleeding when I brush with a normal brush, but while I&#x27;ve had a tiny bit of sensitivity issues (no more than when I brushed with a regular brush), my gums have not bled once since using this toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve used the 3 minute max care (includes 15 seconds of gum massaging per quadrant) every time I&#x27;ve brushed.  My model only came with a standard brush head, so I&#x27;m ordering the compact because I think it will be more comfortable for my smaller mouth.  I also like that it is very compact, making it quite convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience can be a bit messy, though I&#x27;m finally getting the hang of it.  You definitely need to have the brush in your mouth before you start it or you&#x27;ll end up with toothpaste all over you and your bathroom.  I usually end up with toothpaste on the brush head stem and the base, but it is a snap to clean.  I use the sanitizer every time I brush not because i&#x27;m a germaphobe, but because I&#x27;m drawn to things that are shiny and pretty and I love the litle blue light that shines through the sanitizer (yes, I&#x27;m a dork.  a dork who loves her new toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see what my dentist has to say on January 21 when I go in for my six month cleaning, but I already know it will probably be my best dentist visit ever.  Seriously, if you&#x27;re saying to yourself \\&quot;that&#x27;s all well and good, but only crazy idiots who are rich spend $180 on a toothbrush,\\&quot; know that until 2 weeks ago, I was right there with you. But this toothbrush ranks right up there with my TIVO (with whom I have a serious relationship!) in terms of gadgets that truly changed my life.  I smile more, I&#x27;m more comfortable about my smile, and I know I&#x27;m finally taking good care of my teeth.  who knew!?!?brush head, so I&#x27;m ordering the compact because I think it will be more comfortable for my smaller mouth.

            <li> I am so happy that I purchased this toothbrush. I cannot believe how well it cleans my teeth just like I left the Dentist office and I know with the programs that I am brushing longer than I ever have. My teeth also look much whiter and that is another reason to smile. I know this is an investment but it is so worth it. I used to use an Oral B battery operated but this is so much better. I will not use anything else ever again. The charging station is great, looks sleek and compact and there is a travel charger as well. I have had my toothbrush for about 2 months and I feel the investment was so worth it. If you are thinking about purchasing this I definitely recommending it.  Amazon shipped this so fast and it was bubble wrapped so well. I also purchased the 3 pk of compact replacement heads - personal preference for me.</li>
            <li> I was all excited to purchase this one and to disappointment I paid such a huge amount for a used product and that too a toothbrush!! Needless to say I am returning it and buying it from a local store. I can&#x27;t say much about the product itself since I never used it for obvious reasons but this is really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various Sonicare toothbrush models over the last 10 years or more. It has been my experience that this brand continues to improve with each new model. I&#x27;ve loved every Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned, this being my favorite so far. Once you&#x27;ve used a Sonicare a few times I cannot imagine going back to a regular toothbrush, nor any other electric toothbrush. My husband and I are both big coffee and tea drinkers, and every time we are complimented on our teeth I attribute it to our Sonicare toothbrushes. We don&#x27;t use whitening toothpastes or any other whitening products, but we do both use our Sonicare 2-3 times a day. On the rare occasion that I&#x27;ve been without my Sonicare I&#x27;m always shocked by how dirty my gums and teeth feel after brushing alone. It&#x27;s more noticeable the next morning after brushing with a regular brush instead of the Sonicare. My mouth feels much cleaner when I wake up after having brushed with the Sonicare the night before. The UV cleaner is fairly fast and I think it&#x27;s worth the investment. I still have all 4 of my wisdom teeth and so I like the compact brush heads vs. the standard b/c they can effectively clean the backs of my wisdom teeth which are usually hard to get to. One word of warning for those who haven&#x27;t used a Sonicare before: be careful not to slip up and press the power button before you get the toothbrush head into your mouth or you&#x27;ll end up with toothpaste everywhere!</li>
            <li> DO not buy this product. It lasted us 5 months..now it&#x27;s completely dead. I have no idea why the battery is not recharging. Amazon please contact me to see what can be done about this please.</li>
            <li> Had it for 3 weeks now.  Works fully as expected.  Meets my expectations thus far.  Really cuts down on the amount of toothpaste that I need to use (I did not get it for that reason).  After every brushing, my teeth feel like they have been polished.  Friends and the manual said not to press too hard, especially early on; I followed that advice and I did not have any problems with my gums hurting after first several uses.  Now, after 3 weeks, I press a little more because I am acclimated to it, and pressing more feels good.  I hope it continues to perform well for many yrs.</li>
            <li> Take my advice and get this for you dental benefits. It cleans the yellow right out of your teeth. Follow the directions and a year later you will have white teeth like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best toothbrush I have ever come across. It also has a built in 30 second reminder to tell you to switch to a new area of your mouth followed by an automatic 2 minute shutoff. The UV ray cleaner is a key feature that provides peace of mind that you are using a clean brushing tool free of germs and molecules. STICK THAT IN YOUR MOUTH!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has kept me out of the dentist office for repairs since I bought the first one 4 or 5 years ago.  I bought the newer model in July 2011 and liked it very much and especially liked the new design which keeps gunk from accumulating in the head.  When the new one began spontaneously turning itself on recently I contacted Phillips and they agreed to promptly send me a new one at no charge -- covered by the 2 year warranty. I arranged for the replacement in just a few minutes with a friendly Sonicare representative via Internet chat on their website.</li>
            <li> There is a screw in the brush head that works its way loose over time.  It looks like it was threadlocked in place.  Once the threadlocker fails, the toothbrush is useless. Retightening it will only buy you a little more time before it loosens again. I tried more threadlocker, but it didn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle just buzzes harshly, and the brush doesn&#x27;t clean well anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, scum and mildew build up on the heads and the base they sit on.  If the stems were just a little longer, allowing the heads to sit up off the surface, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the toothbrush will also seriously mar the base. even if you use the correct size screwdriver.  The plastic is just too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money this cost, it should have been better designed and lasted a lot longer.  And I just bought new brush heads too.  Oh well.  I&#x27;ll give Oral-B a shot.</li>
            <li> Wow - I read many of the reviews in detail before I decided to shell out the bucks for this expensive toothbrush and finally after a couple weeks of arguing with that voice in my head about how big a waste it would be - I took the big bite and ordered it.  Let me just say, the first couple times wasn&#x27;t all that enjoyable and like many others, I forgot to place it in my mouth before turning it on.  The plus side of that was my sink, counter, and mirror were cleaner for those first couple weeks than they had been in weeks.  Once I got used to the feeling though, I really started to enjoy the toothbrush.  The biggest drawback is that it has its own timer on when to shutoff - I feel like it needs to go for just a little longer - but not a big deal, I just hit the button again and brush until I feel I&#x27;m done - then turn it back off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend - teeth are actually starting to turn back to a whitish look rather than the coffee stained yellow.</li>
            <li> Have not had an electric toothbrush for about 10 years, but got the Sonicare after a dentist recommended.    Brush seems to clean better than manual brushing and you get used to the vibration etc.    A few quibbles:  Phillips should have the brush remember the last setting.  It resets to default \\&quot;Quick Clean\\&quot; 1 minute setting every time.    Don&#x27;t expect to hear the \\&quot;beep\\&quot; of the \\&quot;Quadpacer\\&quot;, (the timer that does 15 seconds per quadrant in Quick Clean mode, or 30 seconds in \\&quot;Max Clean\\&quot;) it really is just a pause.    The lithium battery is not replaceable.  Philips expects you to remove the battery for special disposal and toss the rest of the brush away, then buy a new one.   Since lithium batteries have a fixed life, the battery should be user-replaceable.  I expect that the brush will outlast the battery, so throwing it away is a waste.    Additional note 2/1/10.  Product quit working entirely in January 2010.  Phillips replaced it at no charge, even though it was well out of warranty.</li>
            <li> I know, I know, that much for a toothbrush? Really? The price is the biggest drawback to this toothbrush. But if you decide to take the plunge, let me tell you what you&#x27;re getting yourself into.     I&#x27;ve owned a sonicare for several years now, and I have always been impressed with the level of performance. I&#x27;m moving up from a sonicare advance, which is their base model. I was blown away by the difference between the advance and the flexcare. I knew it would be better, but not this much. In my review, I will compare it to the advance for a reference.     The Design: Compared to the advance, the design is much improved. The body is slimmer and therefore easier to maneuver around. The brush design was the best improvement. The advance uses a larger, more square shaped brush which makes it somewhat awkward to reach the teeth in the very back. The smaller, more rounded brush head on the flexcare makes it so easy to reach all of the teeth in my mouth. Also, the screw on brush head is gone. Yippee! The brush head now slides on and locks into place. With the screw on models, gunk and grime would build up underneath the threads which made me very queasy. I think my favorite improvement comes with the new design on the base charger. In the older models, the toothbrush would fit into the charger, so about an inch of the toothbrush was hidden while on the charger. This design inevitably lead to a build up of gunk on the bottom of the brush and on the inside of the charger unless you completely dried off the toothbrush before placing it into the charger base. This was very annoying and gross to look at. Philips redesigned the base with the flexcare. Now the base charger is completely flat with a little peg sticking up in the middle. The toothbrush has a complimentary  hole in the bottom for the peg to fit into. Now the toothbrush is completely exposed to the air so it dries out better. No more gunk!  Also, it would be pretty easy to share this toothbrush with someone else, assuming you have your own brush head :)    Performance/Features: Performance is great. Simple as that. My teeth feel dentist clean every time I use it. The brush has a couple different settings to fit your different moods, but the normal clean mode turns the brush on for two minutes, which is divided into 30 seconds for each quadrant. The brush signals each quadrant change by a split second interruption in the brushing action. I almost would have preferred a beep, but this works ok.     For the first 14 brush cycles, this unit ramps up on the intensity of the brush action. If you use a sonicare currently, you should have no problem adjusting to this. I didn&#x27;t notice any of the irritating tickling vibrations common on the sonicare brushes. If you&#x27;ve never used a sonicare, don&#x27;t worry too much. Everyone always becomes accustom to the vibrations, and after a few brush cycles you won&#x27;t even notice it anymore.     UV Sanitizer: It&#x27;s an interesting addition to the toothbrush. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works since I don&#x27;t have the means to test that, but you simply detach the brush head and put it into the UV compartment for a 15(?) minute cleaning cycle. A toothbrush that cleans itself, nifty.      Overall this is a great toothbrush. If you&#x27;re unwilling to spend the big bucks for this model, and I certainly understand, I would suggest getting the flexcare without the sanitizer or go for the elite model. Heck, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the sonicare models, as they are all improvements over the manual sticks you have been using.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Sonicare product. I \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; from the basic Sonicare model to this newest model. It is much lighter and feels a little more powerful than the previous models. It is compact and the cord storage and travel charger are really handy. While waiting for it to arrive, I went a week or two with just a manual toothbrush and I definitely felt the difference in terms of my overall oral health and \\&quot;freshness.\\&quot; (I am an efficient brusher manually, but it just does a better job. Period.)  I could hardly wait for it to charge overnight to get a good and thorough cleaning.     My experience is that the brushes do have a limited life, (just over two years and just after the limited warranty expires), before they die. I brush 2-4X a day. However, even knowing it will not last forever, I consider the price a worthy investment for the time I do get to use it and am happy to replace it every few years. I will be a lifetime user unless someone else makes something even better... so far, they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years. I must say it takes a little getting use to with the Sonicare flex. But when you do after a couple of days? It is the best toothbrush ever! My husband and I absolutely love it! My dentist can&#x27;t believe how white my teeth are for my age ( I am 58) and I don&#x27;t bleach them. And yes, I drink coffee and smoke. No stains on my teeth. The only con we have is that it is too expensive. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is my first time using electrical toothbrush, so far I am happy. Recoment this product, easy to take with you to Europe and use in 230 outlets.  ---------------  After a year of using, some parts could not stand regular wear. I use now Brown instead.</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  It is dramatically more effective at reducing plaque, tartar, stains, and calcified deposits than is a regular toothbrush.  It also is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to this toothbrush from the original Philips Sonicare because the design of the original was flawed in that the plastic backing of the head allowed bacterial and paste accumulation and made cleaning in the crevice virtually impossible. I wanted something more hygienic, and am very pleased with this purchase. Beyond the excellent reviews, this brush has a small head perfect for my mouth, and it is smaller and lighter. The battery holds a good charge (2wks from one charge) and I sanitize it once every 2wks when I recharge the battery. The features are fantastic - I especially like the GoCare 1min quick clean feature for after lunch or before outings. It comes with a very stylish and functional travel case and a tiny travel charger (though you won&#x27;t need it for a short stay, since it holds a charge for 2wks). Although pricey, it was worth every penny. I don&#x27;t see myself changing brushes anytime in the next 10 years. Highly recommended. No negatives.</li>
            <li> I never thought my teeth would be white again until now.  I used the Sonicare two times per day for the last three weeks and what a difference.  I go back to the dentist next week for a check up.  Although I have to warn you that it can make your gums bleed until they toughen up.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]    This is an excellent product that allows you to clean those \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places in your mouth. The settings allow you to clean your teeth with  regular and easy settings and massage your gums.  Only suggestion to improve is that the manufacturer should include two each of the regular and \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; brushes as opposed to the one each that comes with the product.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for a little over a month.  It does a good job, my teeth feel as clean as when they are cleaned by the dental hygienist.  The down sides of this product is the noise, the power and the different selections of operation can be changed while you are brushing your teeth.   You have to keep you fingers off the buttons while you are brushing.  Also do not take the brush out of your mouth while it is running.  It would be nice if the battery were replaceable. Of course mine is to new to be over concerned with the battery.</li>
            <li> This is once, twice, three times the toothbrush and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It works harder, faster and better than your old school tootbrush.&lt;br /&gt;- It has different modes and a timed course to tell you when to switch where you&#x27;re brushing.&lt;br /&gt;- The UV sanitizer is perfect for germaphobes and non-germaphobes alike.&lt;br /&gt;- It travels well and it&#x27;s worth all of the pennies you paid and will pay for replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this toothbrush greatly WHILE IT LASTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that for the money I spent, and the minimal daily use it got (two brushings per day by a single user.), the value just isn&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having bought two of these, and known another purchaser, none of our top end models has lasted long enough to engender confidence in the durability of the motors or mechanisms of Sonicare electric toothbrushes. Unless of course, you are grading reliability on lasting less than two years. The motors go bad, become a noisy racket, and thus, do not vibrate well enough to clean properly. Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement price for the exact same toothbrush without the charging station and UV Sanitizer (which I originally purchased as a package) is $149. from a third party distributor (not Amazon fulfilled). Other options to replace just the broken brush handle itself are not the most desirable because they come bulk packaged, which questions the authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the rate of failure these Sonicare toothbrushes have shown over three purchases (around 16-24 months), the cost of operation to own this toothbrush, along with the ongoing brush head replacements, is well over $10.00-$13.00 every month. And that is a permanent situation. Its like having a lease, with no option to buy. You can use it as long as you keep on paying, and paying, and paying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrushes are fantastic, but technology must exist to manufacture more reliable motors and mechanisms. Draw your own conclusions on why Sonicare does not offer that technology. I know I have.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dental hygienist.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  My teeth feel as clean as they do after a visit to the dentist.  It&#x27;s a little messy.  Count on toothpaste splattering.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush.  I had an old sonicare and I hated it.  Totally opposite with this one.  I LOVE IT.  The massage is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about two years now. I started off with the Elite model and have recently upgraded to the FlexCare. The best part of the FlexCare are its 5 timed brushing options: 2 minute clean, sensitive, massage, 1 minute (Go Care) and 3 minute (Max Care). I like to use the 3 minutes when I can and cut down to the 1 minute for a quick clean when I have to run out of the house in a hurry. The next best part of the timer is the quadpacer which gives a slight pause to help break up the time brushing into 4 sections. The UV sanitizing system seems like a good idea, just put the brush head in, push a button and UV light cleans any bacteria on the brush head. The new style brush heads are smaller, easier to put on and seem to keep a lot cleaner at the base where they connect to the handle. The travel charge is nice so you don&#x27;t have to lug around the large charger and UV sanitizing base. It also has a nice 3 light battery level monitor. My ONLY complaint so far is with the \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; soft travel case. My previous brush came with a hard plastic case that fit the brush head and handle perfectly. The soft travel case is just a cheap fabric bag to throw the brush in. Not a huge deal as Sonicare has improved the condition of my teeth as I now have less problems at the dentist. I believe this is because of the sonic fast pulsing of the brush head and timer that allows me to brush for the full recommended time. If you have never timed yourself brushing your teeth you might be surprised, sometimes 2 minutes can feel like an eternity, especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, the small piece to travel with, the fresh feeling after brushing, the timer to make sure I spend enough time everywhere. However, after less than 9 months, the sanitizer won&#x27;t turn on. So the big unit is sitting on the bathroom counter, taking up space and not doing anything.</li>
            <li> I feel like I go to the dentist every day. My teeth are whiter and slicker. It&#x27;s a little rough on sensitive teeth so you have to either get used to or go back to the mode for new users.     It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  I had a Sonicare toothbrush before I purchased this one that lasted 5 years...it died because I accidentally plugged it in overseas with just a plug converter and not a voltage converter and I fried it.  Good excuse to buy a new one!    This is also great for my kids.  The smaller brush head is perfect for my younger son while my teenager and I prefer the full sized brush head.  The sanitizer brings me peace of mind...who knows what it really does but it makes me think \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.    I highly recommend this product. I found the Amazon price to be the best...</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! Love the UV Sanitizer and the smaller brush head makes it easier to clean hard to reach area in back of mouth. This model is quite a bit lighter than some of the previous ones which makes it more comfortable. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this is a upgrade for me i like the smaller size. it is just as effective  in cleaning but i find it to be louder than before but one will get used  to the sound over time</li>
            <li> Really liked this brush, but a week ago it died in the middle of the night.. Or rather I killed it.. It started turning it self on and off and the third time it woke me, I took its life..it got exactly 2 years and 2 month old. I&#x27;m from Denmark and here we have 2 years warranty on all electronics, so i&#x27;m pretty pissed that it choose to die 2 month out of warranty. When I bought it I chose this over the cheaper ones, hoping it would last longer.. But no! I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because it was a good brush while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I bought the Oral-b Trizone 1000 hoping it will stay with me for longer..</li>
            <li> love love love this product.  It works great. My dentist could not believe the change in my teeth.  Brushing 2x a day does the trick and saves you money in the long run.  A must buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for 7 years and have had zero cavities in that time. Currently, I&#x27;m a happy owner of a diamond clean, which I purchased after this model stopped working. I purchased the FlexCare in January of 2011, after my Elite randomly stopped working. I think my biggest issue with Sonicare toothbrushes is that each one dies in about two years - just a few months after the warranty expires. The other thing I do not like about this model in particular is that the rubber/plastic near the brush head  insertion began to discolor/mold. I believe it stopped functioning because water got into the toothbrush when I scrapped away the rubber/plastic. However, I still use the UV sanitizer, so it wasn&#x27;t a total loss. For the time that it worked, it worked perfectly; my hygienist was always pleased.</li>
            <li> I love how clean sonic brushing is for the teeth.  Phillips customer service did not have a replacement part.  I purchased the Sonicare HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 in Oct 2011 with a 2 year warranty, and by January 2013 it was no longer effective (It does not vibrate properly making cleaning ineffective).  Customer service does not have the handle as a replacement part, so I am either forced to by a new set, or purchase the entry level White model.  The cheapest handle I could find was for $55.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I would not be as disappointed as I was the second time, except my first Sonicare brush, which was the White, also became ineffective after 2.5 years, and I chose to upgrade - Mea Culpa.  So in 5 years, I have spent $200 on Philips care products, but without the customer support, I will no longer purchase their products.</li>
            <li> The handle has a serious design flaw.  It leaks water into the unit causing it to short out.  Some people get a year or so before this happens.  I contacted Phillips about the issue as my replacement handle has also shorted out.  Please see my conversation below with the rep:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Philips Chat, you&#x27;re chatting with Shawn. How may I help you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn: Hello ryan. How are you doing today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan: Shawn, I purchased a new Flexcare system back in June 2010 from Amazon. The handle quit working and it was replaced under warranty in May of 2012. Now, the replacement handle has also quit working. The problem is that water gets inside the handle and shorts the electronics out. I know this is a problem your company is aware of because there are hundreds of reviews out there about this issue. Now that my warranty is expired, I am hesitant to spend the money to order another one. What are your thoughts on this issue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn: It seems that you are typing some text. Would you please send the text that you have typed so I know you are still connected with me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn: I aapologize for the inconvenience and will be glad to assist you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn: As your unit&#x27;s 2 year warrenty is expired, at this point of time, the best option that I can suggest to you is to purchase a new unit and to help offset some of the cost, we can offer you 15% off your total Sonicare purchase along with free shipping at our online store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn: If you are interested to buy the new Toothrush, should I go ahead and help you with the 15% discount code?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan: But why should I have to replace the toothbrush every 1.5 years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn: The expcted lifetime of the product depends upon the usage and the way it is maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan: So you have this lifetime vs. maintenance schedule posted somewhere?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn: I do understand your concern Ryan, I wish I could help you more on this but at this point of time I can only suggest you to buy new Toothbrush with the 15% discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan: The HX6921/02 is on Amazon for $119.95 free shipping.

            <li> Good toothbrush for it&#x27;s entire short life of seventeen months.  I expected it to last longer than it did but it did not.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this toothbrush, my dentist and hygienist have both commented on well my teeth and gums are doing.  I love the three settings and the carrying case makes it easy to take with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> My wife and I received one of these for a gift about 5 years ago. She still uses it to the present! I must admit, I was not too excited about the gift at first. But once we began to use it, we knew it was a great gift! The results were notice by our dental hygentists. The system and my trusted brand of toothpaste make my teeth feel so much cleaner than any other toothbrush I have ever used (manual or electric/battery operated). An ultraviolet light cleans the brush heads after each use or when you choose to do so (two at a time). The brush heads can be identifled with color-coded rings per user. There are several modes, which may be selected to clean teeth. Has a timer-type mode, which may be valuable in teaching the kids to brush. We have not had to make any repairs. Only have purchased new brush heads as needed. They seem a little pricey at approximately $10/head. However, coupons and price specials can ease the stress on the wallet! Excellent system! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Having used this product for a month now and gotten over the intense tickling it originally caused I am very happy with it.  Use is easy and I like the sanitizer also.  A good buy for the money. I would recommend its use to anyone who has difficulty brushing all their teeth with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> The whole package is expensive, even more is the replacement brushes. The compact head is much better than the standard. However, the design of the brush is only good for brushing along the gumline outside and reaching the last back teeth. It is useless to brush the horizonal surfaces, definitely cannot brush any part and the gumline of the inside dentition. I consider it is a failure. I needed to use manual brush to do the main job. Now I have abandoned the Flexcare and just use the manual brush to save the trouble. I may want to look for Oral B&#x27;s new smartguide model. Sonicare does have problem in brush design all the time since inception.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this brush for a month now.  Because it comes with 2 separate brush heads, 2 people can use it.  Neither of us remotely misses our old \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brushes. As with any new product, the FlexCare took a little bit of getting used to, but now it is quite comfortable and our teeth feel extraordinarily clean.  Yes, it is loud, but it&#x27;s not a significant drawback.</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B Sonic Complete was holding less and less of a charge, so it was time to look for a new brush. I&#x27;ve used just about every type of high-end electric toothbrush, going back to the original InterPlak. I&#x27;ve also owned Oral B ProCare, SonicCare Classic and Elite, and the Oral B Sonic Complete.  I can say without a doubt that this is toothbrush system produces the strongest vibrations ever. My teeth feel exceptionally clean after brushing with this.      Two things I really like about these model.  First of all, there&#x27;s a battery meter. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve started brushing my teeth and have other models quit on me half way through. I only like to recharge it when the battery is very low -- that is to prevent rechargeable battery memory. The other thing I like are the selectable modes.  The Go Care provides a quick 1 minute freshen up. And the Max Care provides a deep 3 minute session with alternating massage and clean modes.  The UV sanitizer is there if you need it. Personally, I think it&#x27;s a marketing gimmick  for paranoid germ fearing suckers. It lights up pretty. The only reason to use it you want to share your brush with someone, I guess. Or you brush your dog&#x27;s teeth with it.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself several months ago and loved it so much i bought one for my husband for Fathers Day. Awesome</li>
            <li> The product is fine. there is some noise coming from the uv sanitizer even when it is not on. easy fix unplug it. amazons shipping sucks though. if you want it you might as well pay extra for shipping because it will take 3 weeks to get to you with the free ship. I won&#x27;t buy anything else from here. order one for your self and watch your toothbrush go from kentucky to pennsylvania to ohio and then finally to you. I don&#x27;t know how that reduces the shipping costs but, WHATEVER amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my cleaning visits to the dentist alot shorter. Makes my teeth &amp; gums feel really refreshed &amp; clean. Love the UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> 11/13/09 - I had older Sonicare and after years of use/abuse it finally died when it hit the floor one too many times.  I got this new, slimmer model.  After using it for probably 9-10 months, the metal prong that fits into brush head became loose and noisy.  I read other reviews here of similar issue and lengthly replacement times.  I called Phillips/Sonicare Customer Service.  They were courtious and very helpful.  After telling them I had no receipt (my sister had got this new one for me) and guessing it&#x27;s age, they asked for the code on the bottom.  They said they could tell it was still within warranty and that they&#x27;d get a replacement out to me.  TWO DAYS later I received new unit in the mail!  And package tube had new label for me to return broken unit back to them.  The whole (short) process from beginning to end was truly exemplary customer service!  I have loved my Sonicare tooth brushes and was very relieved that they stood behind their product and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used an electric toothbrush in the past, but this one was recommended by my dentist&#x27;s hygienist, and I decided it would help me reach the hard-to-reach back teeth.  I&#x27;ve been happy with the product.  It&#x27;s pricey, and the smaller of the two brush heads that came with the machine seems too small to be of much use (and the replacements are expensive), but I would recommend this product to anyone who can afford to pay $170 for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the flexCare with the sanitizer as a replacement for an old Sonic Care A model:  Advanced.  My old Sonic Care wore out (batteries ceased to hold a charge). I am very happy with the FlexCare!!  It is much lighter than the old a-series.  I note that initially the FlexCare was a little noisey, but, this noise went away after a few uses.  My teeth feel smooth and very clean.  I am so glad I purchased this brush. It feels good to my gums and my teeth feel great!!!!!    I wanted the sanitizer after watching a news report about the amount of E-Coli found on surfaces and items in the bathroom.  The brush head is used for 3 months,  giving it plenty of time to accumulate the bacteria that is found in feces (E-Coli). I noted in another review that the reviewer was concerned about too much sanitizing and use of anti-bacterials.  However, the need for the sanitizer is real due to the nature of the type of bacteria floating around most bathrooms.    All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great toothbrush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The FlexCare replaces my old Philips Sonicare Advanced model, which lasted me over 8 years!  I&#x27;ve had the newer model for well over 6 months and it works exactly like the previous model, but with some marked improvements.  The much smaller and simpler FlexCare brush heads make for a much cleaner experience, especially if you travel and have to remove the head to put it in the travel case.  The different cleaning modes are a nice touch (the Massage mode is quite effective), but I find the standard cleaning method to be more than enough.  And the simplified charger connection makes keeping the charger clean that much easier, and allows for a much smaller travel charger.      But those improvements, as significant as they are, pale in comparison to the Sonicare cleaning experience overall.  You literally feel like you&#x27;ve left the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning (sans the pain, of course) every time you brush your teeth.  If you&#x27;ve never had a Sonicare, or gone with a cheaper electronic toothbrush, you owe it to yourself to buy one.  And if you are an Advanced user and want a simpler experience, the FlexCare models are great.  To be honest, I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months and never had to use the sanitizer feature, so if you want to save the money, you can buy the lower model and still get most of the benefits.  Either way, I highly recommend checking this out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicares for about 10 years.  Totally hooked and could never go back to a regular toothbrush.  You really can feel a significant difference in how clean your teeth feel.  I&#x27;m on my third one now, as eventually they do lose their charge and it just becomes an annoyance (especially if choosing to travel without the charger).      Going from the Elite to the Flexcare, the Flexcare has a much improved design with narrow handle, very attractive blue and silver trim, ridges on back for better gripping, and most significantly a head which easily pops off for santizing and you never have to deal with the issues of what builds up inside it where it connects.  (Apparently these replacement heads cost less, so that&#x27;s good.)    Performance-wise, I honestly find them exactly the same.  Didn&#x27;t feel any difference in the intensity or quality of vibration/cleaning.  Was not jonesing for a santizier, but now that I have it I figure I might as well use it daily.  Who knows if it makes much of a difference.    The one flaw, in my opinion, and that is that when you are holding the base there is a button that often accidentally gets pressed and it changes the type of cleaning mid-cycle.  (There are 5 different cleaning choices but I have no use for any except the standard 2 minute one.)  This seems to happen about every other time I brush.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gripping it particularly hard - I think that button is just very soft.      Price seems exorbitant.  I missed the inventory at Costco and bought the double set for myself and my husband on Ebay.  The double set is very hard to find.    So overall, would highly recommend Sonicares, but this one might be overpriced because it&#x27;s the newer model. If you already have one, I would say you&#x27;ll be fine with the one you have, and suggest perhaps waiting until the price comes down more.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare, been using them for 10 years or so. Purchased this one 1.5 years ago and this week it started buzzing (low level alarm) in the charger. I called Sonicare (Philips), they asked my name and are sending me a new handset with no further action on my part. I&#x27;m a fan of companies that stand behind thier products - and I&#x27;ll be buying more Philips products in the near future.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!!  It is a tad loud compared to my previous one, but I still love it.  I usually use the quick clean mode because the other one seems like it takes forever.</li>
            <li> Which is not often.  Seriously, Sonicare has serious quality issues.  I had two of these, one lasted longer than the other.  One Sonicare brush lasted nearly 2 years and died *just* within warranty okay, I thought it was a one off.  Then I got this one and this one lasted *way* less time as in it died within 6 months.  All I ever did that was \\&quot;out of the norm\\&quot; which I use loosely is when I changed the heads, I gently swabbed it with alcohol to clean the filth that had accumulated where the brush mounts.  I had done this exact same thing with every other electric toothbrush I have ever owned and had no issues doing this (even with the previous sonicare) until this one gave me the issue.  This means either I have the worst possible luck or Philips cheaps out on their seals and the thing isn&#x27;t remotely as watertight as it should be. On another note, i&#x27;ve had huge issues with other philips items such as earbuds and whatnot.  But on the other hand, if you are fine with the reliability issues, it is a great toothbrush and made my teeth feel incredibly clean when it worked so if you have the money for frequent replacements, go for it.  Just don&#x27;t get a stockpile of replacement brush heads since you probably won&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I have been using some version of the Sonicare toothbrush for many years...This new Flexcare with the sanitizer just takes it to a new level. My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I have had various sonicares for +/- the last 15 years, and this is BY FAR the best!  I LOVE the ability to change modes, and to have a longer brush time if you want!  Even better still is the UV sanitizer - it&#x27;s WONDERFUL!  No more slimey gross mess!  Great imporvement on the brush/head design, so that no more water gets trapped in there and gets all moldy and gross!  Seeing HUGE results with my 8 year old in just one week of brushing - SO worth the $$$.  It&#x27;s an investment in your smile - and that lasts a lifetime!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush on Sept 9, 2007 and it died, almost to the day, on Sept 9, 2010. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I would expect a $179 item to make it longer than 3 summers. Brushing my teeth with this device has cost me $60 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance goes, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been more or less happy with this toothbrush than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried... And as I&#x27;m famous for leaving electric toothbrushes in hotel rooms, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. One plus is the skinny top part that does make for less goop collecting by the base of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sanitizer is a gimmick, as far as I can tell. I stopped using it after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased the HX6932/10, FlexCare with Sanitizer for around a $150 2 yrs 6 months ago at the recommendation of my dentist.  It produced such fantastic results that even my dentist was surprised.  For cleaning and dental hygiene effectiveness, I highly recommend this product.    However, I could only give it three stars because the agitator shaft broke six months after the two year warranty expired.  The only option is to throw the unit away, with its batteries, in the landfill.  I&#x27;ve regarded Philips has being irresponsible in their approach to consumer products.  FlexCare is an outstanding product, but did not last as long as it should have, in my opinion.  Nor does it have removable/replaceable batteries.  Having said that, I will probably replace it with another one, since the results were so impressive.    One more point:  Some reviews I&#x27;ve seen say that battery life is abysmal.  I have not found that to be the case.  I run the battery down to zero once a month, and two and a half years later I can still get well over a week&#x27;s worth of use out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> Update to the below: I&#x27;ve been on hold for 35 minutes and counting, trying to get warranty support for my broken toothbrush. (Figure I may as well write this as I wait.) I guess that gives you an idea of Phillips&#x27; customer service...      I absolutely love Sonicare toothbrushes and have used them for nearly 10 years, always getting rave reviews at semi-annual dentist checkups. In short, these are the absolute best toothbrushes for dental care. Every time you use it, you feel like you just stepped out of the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning (except there&#x27;s no pain!)    When I purchased my Flexcare in September 2009, I&#x27;d owned three Sonicares before (two Advances over a several-year period, each lasting 3-4 years, which in my mind is OK, and one of the battery-operated ones for extended travel, since the older models didn&#x27;t have dual-voltage chargers).    The Flexcare was the best of all of them so far, both in streamlined design, charger size, dual-voltage capability and brush head design.    However, after 11 months, it began turning on by itself in the middle of the night. Within a week, it was completely dead.    I hate to give such a great product only one star, but to pay that much for something and have it last less than a year is inexcusable. We&#x27;ll see how tough the customer service routine is to get a replacement ...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love brushing my teeth with this toothbrush! I used to think electric toothbrushes were a huge waste of money because I never had any problems brushing my teeth without one, but I finally decided to try one out after hearing so many great things. It really takes the brushing experience to a whole new level and I feel like I just came home from the dentist after each use. Typically I am pretty frugal and don&#x27;t like to spend that much money on something that seems so trivial, but Sonicare really makes you feel like it&#x27;s worth the high price. The toothbrush itself is enough, but all of the included accessories are of fantastic quality as well. The different modes are a great feature as stupid as they may seem, but I love using the timer function depending on what kind of brushing session I am looking for. At night I typically turn it to MaxCare for a solid 3 minute clean, whereas after lunch I just go for the quick 1 minute GoClean. I have not used the UV cleaner as much as I thought I would, and I am not going to get out a petri dish to test its effectiveness, but if it works half as well as the toothbrush it&#x27;s worth price and also looks nice on the counter. Just be careful not to open your mouth while brushing, that takes a little while to get used to. Other than that, I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so pleased with a product in my entire life.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist. My brother is a dentist and he gave me a sonicare flex+   It really changed me and I never use a manual toothbrush anymore unless I absolutely have to and without my sonicare. It&#x27;s powerful and all you have to do is stand there and let the brush do all the work! I&#x27;ve used Oral B before. Did not last long until I went back to my manual brush. Oral B and other brands are not as powerful. Trust me, I&#x27;ve used like 3 other power brushes. They were sub par, so I don&#x27;t even remember what brand they were.</li>
            <li> Thanx! It came quite earlier than expected and brand new! Gr8 service! Will use again!</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace a very old Sonicare that finally stopped working. The new one is lighter and smaller, and the performance is great--our teeth get really clean. We also like that the new brush head design uses much less plastic and metal, so there&#x27;s less waste. On these two points, it gets five stars. But why is it that companies nearly always tack on a bunch of bells and whistles and don&#x27;t quite design for the way people really use the product? We don&#x27;t see any real need for the massage and sensitive settings and just use the standard one. The go-care (about one minute instead of two) can be helpful. What&#x27;s really annoying, though, is that while the brush is running, the silver button is too easy to touch, so we end up in the sensitive or the massage modes unless we&#x27;re careful to hold the wand at the far end. We have used the UV sanitizer, but, of course, there&#x27;s really no way to tell how well that works. The little travel charger, which we used on a recent trip, is handy, but it would be nice if it had a couple of pegs to store the brushes on. Normally, the brushes are evidently meant to be stored within the sanitizer, and the sanitizer run every time the brushes are used. But we prefer to just leave the brushes out in the air most of the time and also not have the charger (most likely) sucking electricity constantly. The brushes do stand up on their own on the counter, although they&#x27;re fairly easy to knock over.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the positive reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Two brush heads included with two places to store them in the UV tank, therefore allowing two people to use one brush, which is awesome. My old electronic brush made my gums bleed - this one seems to be more powerful but is very gentle to my gums. Battery charge lasts for a long time (two people could share this brush for a week without charing). Battery charge meter is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Read many of the other reviews &amp; decided to purchase this product. Might be a bit noisy but doesn&#x27;t bother me or my husband. And yes, sure does make my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist!</li>
            <li> Look forward to this everyday.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this toothbrush. I have had a lot of problems with my teeth, and this has slowed it down. Even my doctor has commented on how well my brushing has been. A lot less problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend everyone gets this toothbrush, it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> replaced an older model, was really impressed by the updates and options. I know there are others out there, but why change a good thing. AMAZON had the best prices too, as usual!</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve had a few of these over the years.  if you have not had one, get one.  dentist is sad because it works too well - no cavities to fix!</li>
            <li> When my old electric toothbrush died, I went back and forth on whether or not I should spend the money on this expensive toothbrush. Let me tell you... I am so glad I spent the money on it! After using the toothbrush, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist. The different modes are great, but I usually use maximum care. I love the built in sanitizer. My only regret is that waited 2 weeks before deciding to buy it!</li>
            <li> Philips Sonci care is really great. If you use it your gums and teeth will love you.</li>
            <li> While I have been satisfied with the OralB toothbrushes I have been using for years, the dual voltage recharger on the Sonicare got me interested as I do alot of foreign travelling.  I just love it.  The UV sanitizer is great and my mouth feels wonderful after the 2 minutes of brushing.  The travel pouch comes in very handy along with the brush covers.  I heartily recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was told about 2 weeks ago I had to get a better toothrbush or else by my dentist. I am so freaked out about going to the dentist. I had a bad experience with cleaning and I just HATE to go back when its time...I dread. So now Im back on track and need to get busy. Follow ups, ect before I have dentures before Im 40. I have done the right thing to make sure my teeth are not just pearly white...I make sure I take care of them too. This brush from my dentist was cheaper but here the prices are GREAT. Amazon is the way to go for anything I want these days. So to Sonicare thanks for getting my teeth back to where they are suppose to be and AMAZON for taking the time out to have such a VARIETY of brushes by Sonicare cause Im hooked.&lt;br /&gt;This is indeed the best brush ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but the Sonic toothbrush is a different experience!  I am learning to keep the wand from touching my teeth since that is annoying.  Otherwise I like the toothbrush.  It has several settings for duration which is helpful. Good to have a travel charger, also.  I recommend putting the toothbrush in your mouth before you turn it on.  If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll find out why I suggested that!</li>
            <li> This works great with no complaints. Someone mentioned that it is a bit noisy. A little. Another mentioned the non-replaceable battery. We have a Braun unit that we have used daily for 10 years and it still works! The induction charging technology is worth it. Buy one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare Advance since 2001. They are, in my opinion, top notch toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, people were such a fan of my Sonicare FlexCare that they stole it from the dorm bathroom when I went to get my toothpaste. When I discovered the loss, the first thing I did was to go online and immediately purchase another. (I ended up purchasing the FlexCare without UV, which other than having a lime green handle and no UV, is functionally identical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other toothbrushes rotate- this is a million steps above. The bristles clean deep. It&#x27;s easy to use and has several modes. The normal clean is a 2 minute, 30 second per side (lower front, lower back, upper front, upper back) program. Then there&#x27;s GoCare (15 seconds each - good if you want to do a brief brushing after a meal or something), MaxCare (3 minutes, 45 seconds each - 30 seconds normal, 15 doing a pulse). Sensitive turns down the power a bit, and oddly enough, I&#x27;ve never tried massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush will start you off easy. If you are a regular flosser/good brusher, or you own an older Sonicare, you probably don&#x27;t want 14 days of gentle ramping up. If you want to disable Easy Start for whatever reason, put the toothbrush on the charger base and hold the power button for 5 seconds. One beep means you just disabled it, two beeps means you turned it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, time for some pros and cons vs. the ancient advance I had:&lt;br /&gt;+This brush is much smaller and the rubber is more ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;+The old brushes were bulkier too, the newer brushes are better. Additionally, the older brushes had exposed magnets, which would easily detach. Newer brushes do not.&lt;br /&gt;+The old handle had a recessed area. This tended to build up with all kinds of crap. This newer model is not recessed, and as per the manual&#x27;s recommendation, you should wash out the bottom of the brush and the top of the handle (where you attach the brush). This probably goes without saying, but don&#x27;t submerge thehandle...&lt;br /&gt;+The charger base on the old Sonicare was also recessed. This newer model is just like the brush handle- no area for gunk to build up.&lt;br /&gt;+The UV base provides a clean, closed compartment to store your brushes, in addition to cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;-The newer brush heads are notably more expensive than the older ones.&lt;br /&gt;-I paid a similar price for my Advance, and got a second brush with hard travel case. This comes with a travel charger, but no second handle, and only a soft case.&lt;br /&gt;-My dentist doubts the need for the UV cleaner and advises people to buy the FlexCare without it. Better safe than sorry, and I got the UV cleaner model on sale, so it was the same price anyways.&lt;br /&gt;-Just like older models, there&#x27;s no removeable battery. If it stays at home, no big deal, but if you travel...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily recommended, great toothbrush. Sonicare support is also amazing- a friend of mine had an Elite that just died a couple months after the two year warranty expired. Philips took him at his word and shipped him a brand new brush for free- no need to send the old one back. That&#x27;s customer service, in my book. Also, my Advance of 8 years worked fine- I just heard the newer models were better and opted to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for about two weeks.  It was an upgrade from one of those cheaper Crest Spin brushes.  It has worked just fine and the automatic timer feature is really nice.  I was also pleased to see it comes with two charging cords.  One for the larger base unit, and a minimal charger cord that is easy to pack for traveling with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the brush action irritating at all when using it and noise was not an issue. I had been concerned by a few reviews that said it was noisy -- it was quieter than the Spin Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it does a great brushing job.  It was easy to feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace my previous generation sonicare which finally died after nearly 10 years.  The brush itself is great, much smaller and easier to attach to the base, and the kit includes a travel charger which is handy as well.  The UV sterilizer seemed like a gimmick, but I had a coupon for this one, so it basically was a free add-in.  Too bad it only lasted 3 months...  They claim 10 years - what a crock!  Of course, it&#x27;s not covered under warranty either, and Philips doesn&#x27;t even sell replacement bulbs!  Good to see a company stand behind their product - at least the brush still works...    Advice?  Sonicare is good, but don&#x27;t bother with the UV sterilizer...  you don&#x27;t need it, and it won&#x27;t work for very long anyway.</li>
            <li> Although i was looking forward to a new Philips Sonicare toothbrush, it was extremely frustrating to continually have the brush separate from the base.  After several weeks of hating to use the Sonicare, and even returning to an old fashioned toothbrush, I contacted their on-line customer service.  Apparently both brushes that came with my Sonicare were incorrect models!  As a \\&quot;one time concession\\&quot;, the representative agreed to send me one replacement brush.  Now the brush works fine, I enjoy cleaning my teeth but I am very disappointed that only one of the brushes was replaced.  Not impressed by Sonicare&#x27;s packing quality control or their response to this problem.    [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brushing system seems to work very well!    The \\&quot;downside\\&quot; is that older people (who have trouble keeping their hands somewhat steady)  can&#x27;t get the operation down very well.  They hold the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; too tightly &amp; make what should be a easy job, difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric toothbrushes from time to time and was always disappointed with them. recently my hygienist told me to try this one and at first I was put off by the price. I&#x27;m really glad that I bit the bullet and bought it. I am completely satisfied!!    My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have and with the sanitizer i feel more comfortable about using it even though I have a cold right now.    A really great product!!!</li>
            <li> Had the last model, think called elite, and it worked great for 3 or 4 years until it died in India.  Wasn&#x27;t brushing out of the Yamuna or Ganga river water either.  The new model is easier to hold, has soft brush for gums as well as teeth.  It&#x27;s lighter. These features may not be important but together, despite recommendations I can brush in 30 seconds or less if pushed.  Makes mouth and gums feel good.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was amazing, but unfortunately it broke within a year so I have to give this a product a THUMBS DOWN!!!</li>
            <li> I researched this tooth brush and have been an enthusiastic fan for the 10 months since purchase.  Very disappointed when after 10 short months, my $140 toothbrush stopped working.  I will probably re-buy (the less expensive, no-frills model) but this is a big blow to my budget.  I originally bought the model with the sanitizer but that never worked well and I soon gave up using it.  Save your money for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Toothbrush is amazing. I am an adult with braces and the only thing that makes my mouth feel clean is brushing with this brush. I am a regular dental patient and always get compliments on my well taken care of mouth. I highly recommend buying one of these, especially is you are not so keen on flossing daily.</li>
            <li> Bought this on July 7 2008. Today is August 5 2010. Chatted with philips support. The product has a 2 year warranty but because mine is older than 2 years they cannot help me. Really? One month out of warranty and you can&#x27;t help. So much for buying Philips products from now on.    BTW, the item worked great for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product!!  It breaks and Phillips keeps telling me that I will get a replacement in 7 to 14 days every time I call.  They LIE!!  Do NOT believe them.  In 6 months mine has broken 2 times.  They tell me they are sending me a new unit.  The next time I call when it doesn&#x27;t come, they tell me it is on back order.  Then the whole cycle starts over!  Do NOT believe a word these people tell you!  It is a good product as long as it is WORKING, if it works!  For the money I have tied up in this thing, I could have bought manual toothbrushes for over 30 years!!  Do NOT BUY Phillips Sonicare!  Buy the competitors product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be an excellent product.  Cleans better than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve every had.</li>
            <li> Great! A very nice product! Love it! You can buy it that will not regret! Very good product for sure!</li>
            <li> I love to brush my teeth with this tooth brush....Your mouth never felt so clean..I have tried other electric tooth toothbrushes and this one by far is the most professional to use.  I also love all the features it has.  If youre looking for a good tooth bush then look no further you wont be disappointed..</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I have used in the past few years.  The first one I had was an older model but gave similar results.  I used the previous model for almost 2 years while I had braces and for each of my semi-annual checkups at the dentist, the dental hygienist was amazed at how clean my teeth were even with braces.  The previous model ended up breaking as the buttons got corroded, and stopped working, but given how well the toothbrush worked at cleaning my teeth I decided to give Sonicare another chance.    I&#x27;ve now had this model for almost a year and a half now and it looks like Sonicare really worked to improve their quality.  After using 3+ times daily for 1.5 years, I have not noticed any wear on the buttons and am confident this will last.      In addition to an improvement in quality, the flexcare model uses the smaller, ProResults brush heads.  Previous Sonicare models required a large replacement head that I always thought was a huge waste and very environmentally unfriendly.  The ProResults brush heads use what looks like half as much plastic.  It would have been nice if Sonicare passed some of the materials savings onto the consumer, but the replacement heads seem to be about the same cost from what I remember.    I also really like the addition of the UV Sanitizer.  I&#x27;ve read research that this may be more of a gimmick than anything else, but nonetheless I like the ability to \\&quot;quarantine\\&quot; my brush head away from whatever germs may floating around in between brushings.  Additionally, the two brush head holders in the sanitizer make it easy for two people to share the Sonicare and have their individual brush heads.  This is one way you can offset the high cost (relative to a normal toothbrush).    I am 100% satisfied with this Sonicare and I recommend it to all of my friends.  I also bought one for my father recently and he has nothing to say but good things as well.      I have always believed there are good things to spend money on and products that improve your health definitely fall into that category.  I continue to get great feedback from my dentist and the Sonicare is the main reason.  It makes perfect sense to proactively take good care of your teeth/gums in order to prevent future issues.  Not only will any dental work as a result of poor dental health be much more expensive than this toothbrush, but there&#x27;s always the chance that whatever damage is done cannot be reversed.  Do yourself a favor and buy this toothbrush now to save yourself a headache (or toothache) later.</li>
            <li> This is the second electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned and mostly love it. It is a little more powerful than my older one from a different brand and the multiple options are great. I don&#x27;t use the UV sanitizer very often since it seems a little gimmicky but it&#x27;s nice piece of mind and someplace enclosed to store the brush head.    My only complaints would be that stuff can dribble down under the brush head while using it, necessitating its removal and cleaning after every use. My older brand never had this issue and kept everything off the body of the device. The other thing is the mode button underneath the power button is way too easy to activate, just the simple act of picking it up can trigger it if your not careful. About 30% of the time even after owning it a few years I still end up accidentally triggering the quick brush mode because that button is way too soft and easy to hit.</li>
            <li> I have had the original Philips rechargeable toothbrush for many years and when it came time to get a new one, I went again with my dentist&#x27;s recommendation and selected this FlexCare model. The battery life is excellent (so far about 2 weeks on its initial charge), the slimmer design is easier to hold and maneuver, and the 3 selectable &#x27;speeds&#x27; are very useful. Top notch product!</li>
            <li> I have only had this toothbrush for two days now and I have to say that I am in love already. I wish I would have invested the money in my oral care when this first came out because it is worth every penny. The feel of the brush takes some getting used to the first time (only because the vibration really tickles) but once you get used to this you will have the best cleaning experience of your life. Day two and my teeth are already whiter, and they feel fantastic! Thanks Philips, I am sold for life!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after one of my other family members told me how great it was.  The massaging action and different brush heads insure my teeth feel \\&quot;just out of the dentist\\&quot; clean!  The UV cleaning system is good too, I have seen too many TV shows that tell us how much bacteria are on our toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have had no less than 10 Philips Sonicare tootbrushes over the years for our family. I don&#x27;t know if it is the best clinically but these things always break at some point and Philips Customer Care is amazing. I will keep giving them my business as they deserve it.</li>
            <li> Your Dentist is like your Mom and Dad:  really, they just want what&#x27;s best for you.  Of course, sometimes what&#x27;s best isn&#x27;t always what&#x27;s practical.  I&#x27;ve had the Sonicare suggested to me by my dentist for a few years now.  At this last checkup, my dentist spotted a problem area where brushing just can&#x27;t reach:  the very pits of my molars are pretty deep.  When I thought about the price--and complete lack of fun--involved in getting my head drilled, I decided a hundred bucks was worth the investment to avoid a cavity.  The last filling I had was twice that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare comes with its own small charging base.  It&#x27;s really simple to set up and with daily use the battery should last for a couple of weeks.  Battery life depends on how you use it, and the nice thing about the Sonicare is that you can change your mind any time:  there&#x27;s \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot;, which will run the brush for a minute, and \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot;, which will give you a full 2 minutes of time.  I tend to do Go Care in the morning, Max Care at night.  You can also adjust for \\&quot;I want you to focus on cleaning\\&quot;, \\&quot;I have sensitive gums\\&quot;, and \\&quot;I&#x27;m really in the mood for a good gum massage\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m typically more no-nonsense than that and just focus on cleaning.  One drawback is that the battery is not replaceable, so I&#x27;m not sure how many charges the Sonicare is good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology behind Sonicare deserves some mention.  This isn&#x27;t an &#x27;electric toothbrush&#x27; - I still work it across my teeth and gums like a normal toothbrush.  The difference is that the head pulses and emits sonic waves that shake the microscopic ick that you&#x27;ve accumulated right off your teeth.  The vibration doesn&#x27;t rattle your head or make your eyes water:  it sounds like you&#x27;re gargling with a lightsaber, but the feeling amounts to a mild vibration that leaves your gums tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I had an electric toothbrush, it was heavier than the Sonicare, despite being much shorter.  It had a shorter stem where the Sonicare&#x27;s attachment head is long and slender, and I had a tendency to drool messily down the thing--while the Sonicare doesn&#x27;t cause me that problem at all.  The Sonicare brush comes with one of each head:  a large and a small.  Both have long stems but one has a smaller run of bristles for smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using my Sonicare for two weeks now, the effects have been noticeable:  it&#x27;s not just the odd sensation that my toothbaste has almost taken on the texture of whipped cream...it&#x27;s also that my mouth feels clean like the Dentist just got through with it.  Even with \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; and \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; settings, I don&#x27;t have that achy, itchy gums feeling that a Water Pik turned on full can do.  Instead, I have this odd sensation that this is what good brushing should feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare package I purchased here at Amazon came with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- a small charger just slightly wider than the toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;- a larger charging base with UV sanitizer (to kill stray bacteria accumulated on the head)&lt;br /&gt;- the connector plug&lt;br /&gt;- two heads for the brush&lt;br /&gt;- a travel carrying case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of it was packed into a relatively small box and the heads even have a plastic cap to slip over the bristles when you&#x27;re not using the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about your teeth, the Sonicare will help you do what you need.  Whether you&#x27;re OCD-obsessive about teeth and gums or you just want to have clean teeth without a lot of effort, this is definitely worth the investment.  The only downside is that the battery is not designed to be replaceable--but if I get even two years&#x27; daily use out of it, I think I&#x27;ll still call it money well spent.is long and slender, and I had a tendency to drool messily down the thing--while the Sonicare doesn&#x27;t cause me that problem at all.

            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this toothbrush!  My teeth feel cleaner than when using a manual brush.  I expect a much more positive six month check-up.  I have been giving the Sonicare Toothbrush as gifts since receiving mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some bad luck at the dentist lately- hello root canals and cavities- so I figured it was time to upgrade to a newer toothbrush. This one is like the Maserati of toothbrushes- it&#x27;s pretty vigorous and with the three speeds its like a constant party in your mouth. Or a relaxing day at the spa. Your choice.    The sanitizer thing that comes attached is kind of weird- doesn&#x27;t seem that necessary to have but still kind of cool so when your boyfriend spends the night and uses your toothbrush and it secretly grosses you out but you don&#x27;t want to say anything.... problem solved!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go for the sanitizer option, it breaks after a couple months, but the brush itself is AWESOME. Sonicare all the way, don&#x27;t buy the knock-offs or the battery powered ones in the store. This is worth it!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush, is hands down the best! I have gotten them for everyone in my family. However, this was before I mine died 9months, and I replaced the first one and the second one died under 3 months. Now I am on number 3. Hopefully it will last. If not, then Phillips and I have a problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush last year at Target where it was normally $189...the grandkids both have braces, and they loved it.  So to celebrate getting their braces off, I bought them one too on Amazon...MUCH less expensive.  The timer is great for kids...they brush longer, and like the \\&quot;tickle\\&quot;...it&#x27;s great with orthotics...wish I&#x27;d found it sooner.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Electric Toothbrush is easy to use and thorough. I get better ratings on my dental cleanings and checkups</li>
            <li> I purchased the Phillips Sonicare Flexcare Toothbrush three years ago.  This toothbrush takes some getting used to at first.  You sort of get a tickling sensation when you first use this brush if you are not use to sonic-type toothbrushes.  It was almost unbearable at first but you get used to it quickly.  As I stated I have had this brush for three years and it is still running strong.  My dental check-ups have been much better since I began using this toothbrush as well.  This toothbrush does come with two brush heads and caps, a charging base, a travel charger, and a soft carrying case.  You have a few of settings on this including a one minute short setting, a three minute extended clean, and a message setting.  Overall this toothbrush has been a big plus for both my husband and I.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. Costco has the beat price</li>
            <li> I picked this unit because of the UV light to use on to clean the  brushes.  The first charge lasted 2 weeks, not bad</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one of these my theeth look amazing best thing ever! Worth every cent!!!  I will never own another Tooth brush again!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I was a little hesitant with the price but I have zero regrets. I&#x27;m so happy I went with this instead of the Oral B Braun one I used to own that last only a few years and this one by far blows it away in so many ways. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the toothbrush. I am so thrilled I even spent $62 and got my daughter the kid one. She loves brushing her teeth with it also.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush. I love the feel of my teeth after brushing. I love that it holds charge for so long. I love that it comes with a travel case and sanitizer. Great buy for the health of your teeth and for convenience and brushing options.</li>
            <li> Even though I thought this toothbrush was rather spendy, I ordered it anyway after reading other reviews.  I have been very happy with it.  I like having the choice of what kind of brushing I would like, rather than no choice brushing like the regular Sonicare brushes.  I did like having it on sale and wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it at the regular price.  Since I like it so well, I guess it is worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying that I am very happy with Sonicare in general and the replacement toothbrush I purchased was the same make and model.    That being said...I bought this toothbrush to replace the basic model that I lost after 4 years of use. I loved that toothbrush and never had any issues with it. Assuming that the newer model must be better I did some research and ended up going with the Flexcare model. The variable brushing speeds are a nice touch and I get great use out of the Sanitizer. After a little less than a year of use it shorted out and I could hear a hum when I turned it on but the power never made it to the brush head. Assuming water must have made it inside the base I turned it upside down and left it alone for a few days. When nothing happened I left it alone again but this time let it charge for a full day hoping that it needed more juice. Nothing changed so I ended up ordering another one and am hoping it will last longer.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works so well, and even my daughter likes to use it.  I like the ultraviolet cleaner, too.  It is a little strange getting used to it at first, it \\&quot;tickles\\&quot; your teeth.  But you get used to it, and my teeth look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I usually dont update items till the old one becomes unusable.  Amazon.com had such a great deal on this brush I couldnt resist.  This brush takes up less space on the counter.  I had a separate sanitizer and brush before.  Now theres no water to use for the sanitizer either!  The brush handle is smaller and the brush heads are easy to remove.  Thank you Sonicare and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Years ago, I was diagnosed with Peridontal disease. My old Braun electric toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t doing the job and a friend recommended the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer. I absolute love it! In fact, I use it three times as much as I did the other toothbrush, because it makes my mouth feel so clean after using it. The Sanitizer is fantastic and helps to eliminate germs. Even if you don&#x27;t have problems with your gums, you will want to consider this product. There&#x27;s nothing better than getting a great review from your dentist and this toothbrush will give you that satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of these tooth brushes. This is the second set of this exact model I&#x27;ve bought. Use it for the suggested times and your teeth will feel as clean as they do when you come home from the dentist everytime. It&#x27;s that great. For first time users, it will probably tickle your mouth like crazy for a few days.    Now the BUT. This is my second purchase of the same version. Why? The battery in my unit died. Maybe it got fully drained? I dunno, it just wouldn&#x27;t recharge or hold a charge. I was pretty bummed as it was only 1 year old. I vowed never to buy another one and just used a tooth brush for the next year. Then I realized I was the one suffering for my own pride here. For the 150 bucks or whatever I could replace it once a year for awesomely clean teeth. And hopefully mine was just a fluke.    Still, the overriding problem is they don&#x27;t have a replaceable battery pack. I was in Europe at the time and couldn&#x27;t send mine in for service so I just tossed it. This product would be 5 stars if they respected their customers and allowed them to replace the battery. As it is, all they respect is your wallet and want you to buy more when it dies.</li>
            <li> I had heard of this toothbrush first from a friend of mine and then from the dentist who cares for my teeth.  I&#x27;m delighted with it because it cleans all of my teeth so well.    I was very impressed with my experience in purchasing it from the Amazon website too because the process was easy.  I like being able to check different vendors and to read the feedback provided before actually purchasing a product.  I received my toothbrush within the time specified and it was in the condition it should have been as a new item.</li>
            <li> metal shaft vibrates loose in one year, sent me another , same thing came apart. sonicare replaced first defective one, within one year same thing happened again.  This product is clearly defective and sonciare knows it.  They would not replace another one.  Only if I had a receipt within 2 years.  They said the life span of their product is 3-5 years.  I got about a year.  Should have used the right parts.  Don&#x27;t skimp.  Will never buy sonicare again.</li>
            <li> My teeth are cleaner  LOVE the timer feature, don&#x27;t use the UV light.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my dentist said I should buy a $120+ toothbrush but my sensitive gums weren&#x27;t happy with my harsh brushing. I always feel like my teeth are cleaner if I brush harder and I&#x27;m usually in a hurry so I kind of tear up my mouth with a normal toothbrush. I decided to get it. After all, I like gadgets and this can be just another gadget. Fired it up for the first time and although it was a strange sensation at first, when i was done, my mouth felt cleaner than when I go to the dentist.     I thought it might just be the first time, but every time since then i get the same clean feeling. My teeth have never felt cleaner and the way it stimulates the gums, my mouth actually feels healthier too.    On top of all that, the multiple programs that let you know when to change sections in your mouth and then automatically turns off it is awesome. I also love that I know my toothbrush is sterilized after every use. I can&#x27;t say enough about this toothbrush. I have gotten 4 other people to buy it because I like it so much.    Point is....BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its amazing, you can get the clean that you get at the dentist at home with this product! I love this tooth brush, it comes with a sterilizing home for your brushes, with enough room for two heads. It has many different features for brushing. I would totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Had the intelliclean system (toothpaste flows to brush)...but they discontinued it, so it was time to go with new system.  Satisfied with new smaller brush and UV cleaning.  Even brushing with just water seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty old fashioned, and the idea of getting a fancy toothbrush seemed ridiculous until I started getting some tooth decay and the dental bills arrived.  That got my attention!  After going to this I can report no more cavities since the switch.  Going with this system was a great choice, and I quickly grew accustomed to the feel.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to the old manual method of brushing after experiencing this technology.  Was a great idea!</li>
            <li> My Sonicare toothbrush did a great but the internal battery lasted (3) months. Yes months! Terrible!!!  You can&#x27;t replace it! Can&#x27;t get your money back!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. The price was very fair, and the packaging was very nice as well. Thank you</li>
            <li> I thought the sanitizer was an unnecessary addition. I do not need a UV emitting compartment to kill the bacteria on my toothbrush. That&#x27;s just overkill. However, the toothbrush is excellent and a lot better than my previous electric toothbrush. My teeth have felt cleaner and my dentist is a lot more complementary of my teeth these days. Highly recommended. If there is a cheaper version without the UV then buy it. But it&#x27;s still with the prive even with the UV.</li>
            <li> My friend uses this and said her dentist said her teeth were basically clean of plaque and gums in great shape so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Gave it to my 22 yr old for Christmas.  She&#x27;s a fanatic about her teeth and making sure she keeps them forever.   After trying the first time - she said it literally shakes her brain.  After 3 weeks of use she says it still shakes her brain and she doesn&#x27;t feel like her teeth are as clean with this as they were with the regular tooth brush.  When asked why she said - write that review and tell them that if they&#x27;re going to make a toothbrush then the bristles should be longer.  That&#x27;s the bottom line, she&#x27;s not happy with the bristles being only 1/3 to 1/4\\&quot; long and it doesn&#x27;t seem to give her a clean feel. Being creatures of habit, it could possibly be subconscious.  She&#x27;s continuing to use it though....and considering a second clean with the regular brush.  Defeats the purpose in saving time but whatever it takes...right?</li>
            <li> takes some time to get used to using this coming from a normal toothbrush, but it works way way better. Simple design and very easy to use, you can feel it instantly working easier and better than the cheaper rotating brushes. my friend bough the felxcare+ and I bough the flexcare, overall, save the extra money and just buy the flexcare.</li>
            <li> I had my first Sonicare for 6 years..and loved it.  Decided to see if their upgraded technology was worth the money..even though my old one still worked like a charm.  Well..it was worth every penny I can say.  Better performance, love the sanitizer unit to use, and the battery does not want to die.  Took the handle and brush on a 9 day vacation, no chance to recharge...and it worked flawlessly and powerfully the whole time!!  It does a superb job on your teeth and gums....</li>
            <li> Our dentist finally put enough of a guilt trip on us that we decided to spring for a Sonicare toothbrush.  We&#x27;re so glad that we did!  My wife loves the sanitizing function of this model (she&#x27;s a bit of a germ-o-phobe) so that is a nice option to have.  This little unit works great and is a terrific value.</li>
            <li> I love this Sonicare Toothbrush for several reasons.  First, I love the timer that tell you how long to brush each quadrant of your mouth.  I used to skimp on time, now I know I&#x27;m doing it correctly.  I really love that you can get two different size brush heads.  My husband likes the standard size brush, but it&#x27;s way too big for my mouth.  The smaller brush makes it possible for me to reach all my teeth effectively.  However, the best part is what great checkups I get.  I must confess to being a lazy flosser.  In fact, I&#x27;m more than lazy, I just hate flossing and almost never do it.  When I go for my checkups, I always hear what a great job of flossing I&#x27;m doing!  I owe it all to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the last four years. As many reviews mentioned, this cleans great and the regular toothbrush is no match for this one. The only con is that the replacement brush heads are needed almost every three months and they are expensive.  Mine started vibrating uncontrollably in the last few days. That is bad, but considering the quality of electronics these days, I am happy this lasted four years. I hope my next purchase would be equally good.</li>
            <li> I like my Sonicare.  However, it seems that the unit lasts between 1-2 years, which I think is due to wear-and-tear and/or water damage over time.  I&#x27;ve been through 2 sets, on my 3rd one, which I think will be need to be replaced within the year.</li>
            <li> if you love your smile please buy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought this in 2010 and still using it every day.</li>
            <li> Exactly one month out of the 2 year warranty, the toothbrush died on me. Phillips offered me 15% off their online store and nothing else. It&#x27;s not exactly surprising to see how many others had the same thing happen. Is there a self-destruct chip on a timer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think it&#x27;s a great product when it works. I don&#x27;t have the heart to give it a 1 star review despite what happened. In fact I will probably buy another one (what am I going to do with the stash of brush heads I have?) at a place with an iron clad return policy- Costco. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to happen again.</li>
            <li> The best brush I have ever used and still using it everyday. Both my dentist and Endodontist recommended it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare. I can&#x27;t imagine brushin my teeth without it.  I had the previous one for 10 years and the buttons got worn out - but totally expected after so many years.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I am astonished at this!  It is just like getting your teeth professionally cleaned every day and night!  As you get older, you need to purchase this to avoid any gum recession or to improve the gums, as I have found!  Terrific price also!  I love it!</li>
            <li> this toothbrush was one of the best investments. i&#x27;ve had it for years and it&#x27;s still going strong. keeps my teeth and gums healthy and clean. no complaints from my dentist!</li>
            <li> much better job than manual brushing</li>
            <li> This product might work well at the beginning but the handle unit has a problem that the company will not stand behind nor fix.... I had one unit go out in 13 months, they did replace it but when the replacement unit went out in 18 months then they said it was out of warranty and could not replace it... For the price of these units they should last longer that 18 months...</li>
            <li> When the commercials say \\&quot;straight from the dentist clean\\&quot;, its no joke. This bush is wonderful. My dentist even notices the difference. I like it because it has programmed brush times, so I actually brush for longer using the set times. It is great for my gums too. Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for many years.  Although I liked the brushing action of the old design, I hated the design of the brush head itself because the screw-in head became all gunked up and nasty if you didn&#x27;t take it off the motor and clean it regularly. Otherwise, they were virtually indestructible.  Those who use the old design know what I&#x27;m talking about. Only time I had to replace them was when the sealed Ni-Cad battery died and failed to keep a charge, usually lasting about 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then they took a page out of Oral-B&#x27;s playbook and changed and simplified the brush head design whereby they are inserted onto a metal post like the Oral-B design rather than screwed on. Now it is much easier to change and keep the brush head / inter-connect area clean. I also like the fact that they switched to lighter Li-Ion battery and the charge seems to last longer.  The brushing action also feels more powerful than the old design. The UV sanitizing chamber is bit gimmicky but at least the science behind it is sound. I love the Sonicare brushes in general.  The reason I deducted 3 stars is because with this particular model, I had 3 units fail prematurely in less than 2 years where the metal post retaining the brush head had come off the main body.  Once that happens, the water-tight seal is broken and the unit is rendered useless.  Being a dental care professional, when I called the Philips service center to address my concerns, their reply was perfunctory at best and only emphasized the fact that my warranty had expired.  Therefore, I&#x27;d be weary of recommending this particular model; I&#x27;m not certain if they improved or corrected this design weakness with FlexCare Plus.  I would consider a newer model without the UV chamber for less money or DiamondClean model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I&#x27;ve been using DiamondClean model for about a year and half now without any issues.</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare with NiCad battery finally couldn&#x27;t give me enough charge for one brushing so it was upgrade time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This LiOn powered model easily lasts 3 or more weeks of daily brushing, is thinner and the new head style (vs the old vibrating magnet style) feels like a more focused brushing.  I&#x27;m totally sold on daily use of a Sonicare (along with flossing of course), as the dental hygienist has almost never found plaque in the years since I began using one, and my gum health has been great.  (Gum recession necessitating surgery by a periodontist first got us on Sonicare about 6 years ago.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this FlexCare unit is the mode switch&#x27;s location and sensitivity.  If I hold the device the way that I&#x27;d like to, my index finger too easily brushes against the mode button and the mode changes.  I&#x27;ve learned to hold it closer to the base, but it isn&#x27;t comfortable.  Hence, 4 vs 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have had Sonicare brushes for at least 15 years - bought the first one from my dentist, and it lasted forever.  However my last 2 brushes died in less than 3 years, but after the 2 year warranty!  I expect a top of the line, Flexcare to last longer than 2 years and 5 months - this company has perfected planned obsolesence - beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve used this particular model for over 4 years! My teeth are very healthy because of them.  It does it&#x27;s job and is very durable. I have to replace the brush heads every few months though. Buy it! Definitely worth the value!</li>
            <li> I got this a couple of weeks ago and it is hands down better than my old oralb sonic complete.  My wife loves the compact brush and the other is perfect for me.  On the first use it was obvious this was a superior product.  My teeth just felt clean.  I have had problems with sensitive and bleeding gums for years and since switching to this toothbrush the problem has gone away.  The regular mode gives you plenty of time for each quadrant and the quick clean is perfect for that hurried morning, it still gives a good and still has quadrant timer so you get an even brushing. I thought the price was a little high but now that I have used the toothbrush for a little while it was worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The timer function is very useful.  This little machine cleans my teeth far better than a regular, manual toothbrush.  And with the timer, I know I&#x27;m not scimping on one or another area.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t last forever (must register on Sonicare&#x27;s website!). I didn&#x27;t use all the different \\&quot;modes\\&quot;- I have sensitive teeth but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode. Your teeth do need a few weeks to adjust to the vibration. I wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for the UV sanitizer- it makes the bristles brittle so I rarely use it. I always need more than the 2 minute timer allows- I wish they had a model without the quadpacer. I buy a big pack of heads at Costco but only replace the heads every 4-5 months and take them off the brush to clean the connection every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper \\&quot;HealthWhite\\&quot; [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] cleans just as good but the battery needs to be charged every other week (I don&#x27;t leave it on the charger)- the higher end models have a much longer battery life. If you get a cheaper model- I would recommend the ones with the smaller heads and handle profile like this one. The cheap-cheap ones have bulky handles and crap gets gunked under the heads worse than these models. The rotating OralB ones are lame from what I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through 2 of these exact same models- my dad never used the one I bought him so after my first one burnt out in 2 years I stole his back lol. They lasted about 2 years each- maybe I am hard on them? Now I bought the cheapest \\&quot;HealthyWhite\\&quot; (without the sensitive setting) which lasted a little over a year before making loud grinding noise (the head starts to wobble). But this time I had registered it on Sonicare&#x27;s website (extends warranty to 2.5 years) and they just sent me a brand new replacement (actually an upgraded model) free of charge after a quick webchat! I wish I would of kept track of the first 2 I bought but out well- I&#x27;d still buy one every year for $80 a pop because they work so great.</li>
            <li> It worked well for the first year. The UV light burned out quickly but as I&#x27;m not a germaphobe I didn&#x27;t mind then the toothbrush stopped working and sonicare wont just sell you the handle. The force you to buy the entire product again. I&#x27;ll be switching to Oral-B&#x27;s product this time around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it.  I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to my teeth.  Sure, I brush regularly but not for very long, and certainly not following the suggested charts of up and down and side to side for two minutes or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That fact has sometimes bothered me, I suppose.  I wonder about how much whiter my teeth could be.  I wonder if maybe I&#x27;m inadvertently allowing problems to begin.  But that laziness thing.  It overpowers the worry and so I&#x27;ve gone my life with only the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But something bit me, and I decided to sink my teeth into something a little bit more helpful.  I love gadgets and I was hoping that just that fact might be enough to get me to pay more attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered the FlexCare.  And I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of key things are important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it easy to use?  Absolutely.  There are about five different settings but it&#x27;s pretty clear which each do and why a person would use them.  Also the most standard setting is default.  So just turn it on and start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better it reminds you how to brush.  Thirty seconds in each quadrant--top front/back, bottom front/back.  The brush pauses when the thirty seconds are over to remind you to move along.  After two minutes it turns off.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier to use or to use exactly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first electric toothbrush so I wondered how my teeth and gums would respond.  No worries there. The brush has a 14 use warm-up to get to full power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second factor is whether it works. It absolutely does.  My teeth are whiter after a week.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t matter if it works if it&#x27;s not handy.  Not only is it easy to use and works great, it comes with a handy travel pouch, and is a breeze to use regularly.  I actually (embarrassed to admit this) got a little giddy this week when I remembered, \\&quot;I get to brush my teeth.\\&quot;  I want to use it.  The laziness has been vanquished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included UV light completes the package, helping make this toothbrush consistently clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not noisy at all.  Easy on the mouth.  Not even a little bit of splatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very much worth buying.  My teeth haven&#x27;t been this happy with me for a long time.y at all.  Easy on the mouth.  Not even a little bit of splatter.      Very much worth buying.  My teeth haven&#x27;t been this happy with me for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the first Sonicare brush I have ever tried and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not trying them sooner! The manual action of brushing teeth can get tiring sooner or later, leading to non-brushing. That, of course, is the quickest road to the dentist&#x27;s, a place we all know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after trying this toothbrush, I&#x27;m very pleased to know that the number of trips I will be taking to the dentist will soon rapidly diminish. Brushing with the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush is a positive joy. I can choose from several modes (including GoCare, for when you&#x27;re on the run, or MaxCare, when you have more time); I can even choose a nice, easy gum massage mode. These people have thought of everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice package with two brush heads, one smaller and more compact than the other, several easy-to-understand manuals and a travel case and a travel charger, plus the main charger which houses a UV sanitizing unit. See what I mean about thinking of everything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first brush with the Sonicare was an interesting experience because I wasn&#x27;t expecting the feeling of a hypercharged, intensely vibrating bristles--I used the MaxCare setting. After I got used to it, I could actually feel the plaque-busting going on. Afterwards, I felt around my teeth and the gums felt great and very clean, even between the teeth without flossing. I&#x27;ve never felt better after a brushing, even with the Oral B electric brushes I&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest recommendations if you want good, clean teeth and lesser visits to the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve utilized Sonicare tooth brushes for the past 10 years,  The Flexcare is the best model to date.  The max care mode which includes brushing and massage works great.  I can actually see bits of plac when I rinse after brushing.  The UV cleaner is an added bonus.  I highly recommend this appliance.      malaprop</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!    I have never owned a sonicare toothbrush before but I have owned other rechargeable brushes and battery-powered brushes.  Never before has a toothbrush made my teeth feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning!    I love the sanitizer feature too.  I&#x27;m a bit of a germaphobe so even though I can&#x27;t say for sure that it works, it at least makes me feel like my brush is cleaner.  I love the fact that it is timed and shuts itself off once you are done.  I think I do a better job of brushing with that feature.    The unit is much more compact than I expected and not nearly as loud as I expected.  The vibration of the brush does tickle a bit but you get used to it.      If you are looking for a high-quality brush that will give you dentist-clean teeth, I definetely recommend the Sonicare FlexCare!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is just what you need to scrub your teeth and massage your gums.  It is light and thin also.  Used with a whitener in toothpaste, works really well.</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this thing cleans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV Sanitizer adds a high-tech functionality to the whole package, even though I cannot vouch for its effectiveness.  I have always alternated between two manual toothbrushes, thoroughly rinsing each brush after use and letting each totally dry in between use, and I never had any issues with hygiene from contaminated brush bristles (heck, doorknobs, public drinking fountains, kitchen sink sponges, and shaking peoples&#x27; hands can carry far more germs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Excellent 5-fuzzies feature ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ The unit&#x27;s design makes it easy to clean off toothpaste residue, there is not much vibration in the handle, and given the vigor of the brushhead&#x27;s action, I do not mind the \\&quot;bumblebee on steroids\\&quot; sound of it.  All of the different cleaning modes are highly useful for different users.  It has a nice sleek look to its design - this is the toothbrush that George Jetson would be using before he starts his 3-hours-a-day workdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies feature ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ My first minor nitpick is that the brush should remember the cleaning-mode setting that you used last.  I always use its MaxCare setting, a nice mixture of teeth cleaning and gum massage.  And so instead of just applying toothpaste and turning the unit on, I have to first move the setting down to MaxCare each time before turning on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ My second minor nitpick is that at $170, the brush is a bit pricey for what it is.  Yes, one could reason that it is worth the dental health benefits.  But along with the $8 replacement brush heads, I image that Philips is making a tidy profit from their premium Sonicare model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ My one major nitpick is that I see absolutely no logic in designing the brush to have a non-replaceable battery (other than purely for Philips&#x27; marketing/sales purposes of planned obsolescence).  In this age where too many people throw too many things away, and where our nation&#x27;s landfills are increasingly cluttered with plastic grocery bags and plastic water bottles being thrown away, this is a disposable product that could have been designed to not be disposable.  I would have the same major gripes if Black&amp;Decker designed their rechargeable cordless string trimmer and cordless drills such that I could not replace those batteries and I had to throw away the entire string trimmer or cordless drill after the battery could no longer properly recharge, or if Motorola&#x27;s cell phones did not allow you to replace its lithium battery and required you to buy a new cell phone after its battery wore out.  The cylindrical shape of the toothbrush would be perfect to use with two high-powered (and widely available and inexpensive) 2700mAh NiMH AA rechargeable batteries that one could insert into the barrel of the body, without too much added bulk added to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;௫ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush works great and my teeth always feel awesome after using this!purposes of planned obsolescence).

            <li> I tried a little different version of this toothbrush, the Elite 7300, and it just didn&#x27;t compare.  This brush has less vibration, and the battery is many times better.  It has a lithium ion battery that should last several years.  I had the other brush for a month and it only lasted a month before the charge time was already diminishing.  I can use this brush for about a week on a charge.  The sanitizer is great too!  It rids your brush of bacteria that can grow on your toothbrush head.  I would recommend this to anyone!  It takes a bit to get used to (if you&#x27;re coming from a standard brush), but a few days into it, you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever used another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonic care for years, but this is the best one. Easy to maneuver and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that yes the sonic power &amp; sound kind of scared me. Finally built the courage to use it &amp; wow this thing rocks! I have been using Oral-B 8850 which had a waterjet that I thought was way out of control I could never get it to calm down, even the lowest setting was out of control, but the good thing about that model is that it had a pressure sensor, if you brushed too hard it would stop. Of course I purchased it because it was my first electric brush but I just could not afford the Sonicare so to save a few bucks I got the Oral-B. Then a while later I upgraded to the Oral-B Triumph because it had the lcd, but it just looks better than the 8850, the 8850 is a way better brush than the 9400. I have not been happy with the 9400 so I have been thinking maybe I should just get a Sonicare. I always think about that video clip that shows them vibrating in the water &amp; how the Oral-B barely moves the water &amp; the Sonicare goes bananas! Well I had read the reviews before I purchased &amp; remembered the tip to put the toothbrush in my mouth before turning it on because this thing splattered toothpaste like if the main artery had been slashed on the side of my neck with just my mouth barely open LOL I am sure with time I will get used the scary sound &amp; tingling sensation. My mouth feel very clean. Just makes me think that I wasted alot of money &amp; time on the Oral-B&#x27;s, even though when I had them I did like them alot better than a manual toothbrush, having a Sonicare now makes Oral-B barely a step above a manual toothbrush. If you are a person that has always used a manual toothbrush and are contemplating getting an electric toothbrush for the first time, I know the Sonicare costs more that is why I first purchased the Oral-Bs but now that I have the Sonicare I would tell any friend or stranger that it is well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I love our new Sonicare - my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentists!</li>
            <li> Love it! it gives me a clean feeling after each use. The timer helps a lot since I tend to rush everything. That means if the timer doesn&#x27;t go off, I know I have to keep brushing till it goes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even put it to a test today by using it to brush my teeth after having oatmeal in the morning. And then I went to see my dentist. My dentist said\\&quot; wow your teeth are really clean\\&quot;, it won&#x27;t be much for her to do today since I was there for a cleaning! ^^</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare electric brushes for a number of years. Most recently I purchased a new model from Amazon. This brush has three speeds, including a massage speed. The handle is less bulky than others making it very comfortable to hold. Amazon shipped very promptly and the price was right!    Duane Ulkins</li>
            <li> Had the older model before this one.  The brushes attach to the handle much easier now.  They have fewer places for crud to collect, and the UV sanitizer light is keeping bacteria growth away.  There are a few different brushing programs now.  I like the Go Clean with four 15 second intervals in the AM and the regular 2 minutes in the PM.</li>
            <li> The product is great, Sonicare as a company sucks.  I had a $[...] rebate coupon that they never honored.  Gave them everything required (sales receipt, UPC code, form, etc) but they claimed it wasnt good for that product.  Will never buy another Sonicare item because of it, just out of principal.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sonicare as a replacement to a Braun product which has seen better years.  I must say initially the Sonicare was more powerful than realized and it took a few times before being able to use it at the normal speed.  Currently I am very satisfied with the system and feel my teeth and gums get a great workout each use and are nice and clean.  Good investment.  I gave a 4 star rating due to the price.</li>
            <li> My all family asked for one as the most desired present and they all love it!!!Perfect for the busy people who take time to clean their teeth and forget to clean their toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> Was so wanting this brush.   The Flexcare looked so great,   all was fine during the slower break in time,   but as soon as it was over, and it began going faster,  Now each time I use it, while brushing the brushhead keeps falling off ,  over and over again.   I put it back on and continue to brush and it falls off again, I have not heard of others with this problem ??  But not fun. Thank you</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I had a standard toothbrush before this and my mouth would start to feel unclean about halfway through the day. Now my teeth feel smooth and clean all day long. It&#x27;s like after you go to the dentist, only Every Day! This toothbrush comes with two different heads (standard and compact). I prefer the compact ([[ASIN:B0013TVEYS Philips Sonicare ProResults Compact Brush Heads, 3pk]]) as I feel I get into hard to reach places better. The battery life is fine. It lasted about two weeks on a full charge with both my wife and I using it twice a day (usually on the max care cycle). That&#x27;s about 56 brushes. The UV sanitizer is a nice addition as well. The toothbrush is a little loud but it is no where near as loud as some of the other reviews make it seem. I highly recommend this toothbrush. Your mouth will thank you for it.  _________________________________________________________________________________________    UPDATE: Changed rating from 5 stars to 2.    I have owned 2 of these brushes now and both of them have broken after about 1 year of use. The break occurred inside the base both times just below the brush head connection rendering the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; aspect of this brush useless.    I am now back to using a regular old manual brush. This product was great while it worked, but for as much as this product costs, it should last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best Sonicare toothbrush yet.  It has 3 settings.  The default is like last years model in that it brushes for 2 minutes, broken up into 15 second intervals for top front, back, and bottom front and back.  However this model has a max clean that adds 15 seconds to each interval with a more intense vibration.  It also has a 1 minute cycle that uses the intense vibration for a quick brush.  The bristles seem to be more stiff and really gives you the \\&quot;just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist\\&quot; feeling every time you brush.  The UV clean kills any residue germs that might be left on the bristles.  Overall a real professional toothbrush that makes your mouth feel extremely clean just like you came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I first received this item last year before Xmas and I enjoyed it very much. During the time I&#x27;ve used it, I felt that it was giving me everything my dentist wanted. I like the UV Sanitizer and this is great for travel. The down fall of this product is really up in the air. Before I had this item for a year, it broke. I do a lot of traveling, and the item being damaged could be blamed on the careless acts of the TSA. Who knows, but when I arrived home that night I went to brush my teeth and noticed that the power on the toothbrush was very low. Being tired and not thinking, I figured that it was maybe because the battery was not charged. The next morning I still noticed that it was very weak. I let it charge again and that night I saw that it was fully charged. I ended up taking the toothbrush apart and noticed that the motor had been damaged. This could be just a flaw in this particular toothbrush, or it could be the TSA for smashing my bag and damaging the motor. Who knows at this point. I have a new toothbrush, same model, and I still love it. Give me that clean mouth feeling. I would recommend this item to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare products for years, and this toothbrush is their best yet.  My dentist loves the results!  It&#x27;s as if I get professional cleanings every day.  I particularly feel good about the sanitizer feature, as I can only imagine what types and quantities of germs normally cultivate on the head of a used toothbrush.  What I also like better about this model is the simplicity of the actual head design--no more nooks and areas for gunk and residue build up as a result of brushing.  Very clean and neat.  Great price at Amazion!</li>
            <li> Being a dentist I have used just about every toothbrush out there for free or next to free.  I have gone through everything from the old manual ones to the so called best electric ones from Oral B and Sonicare.  After using both the Oral B and sonicare I must say that sonicare has to  be the best toothbrush out there hands down.  It takes some time to get used to, about a week or so, but after that you will love it.  I clean teeth all the time with professional dental instruments consumers can not buy and this toothbrush is the only thing that comes close to the thoroughness of  specialized equipment.  The timer function is nice because it forces you to break up your mouth into 4 quadrants and brush every area for a full 2 min which is what is recommended.  I believe that there are areas in ones mouth you can&#x27;t possibly clean with a manual brush to get the majority of plaque off.  This brush picks up the shortcomings of your hand motion with its oscillation almost doing all the work for you.  I also believe that the UV sanitizes is a big marketing scam, its nothing more than a fancy brush head holder that can give you a blue light show when you push the button.  In my opinion UV light is not sufficient to kill as many microorganisms as they seem to claim.  Just rinse/soak the heads in Listerine if you are that much of a germ a phobe.  The little traveling case is fantastic, I can go on trips for days and it fits snugly in my bag and does not need a charge for days.  In short I highly recommend this brush to all my patients, especially those with many fillings and crowns/bridges.  Combined with good flossing and mouth wash I feel this is the best you can do at home until you come in for a dental visit.  It may not be cheap but its a sound investment in your mouth and is alot cheaper than what you will pay for dental work due to decay.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. His periodontist recommended it and sold him the single brush w/out the sanitizer for nearly as much money (I paid close to $100 at Christmas) so he took that one back when he found out I got him one. Since then we have a new dentist and he is selling it for $77 - with the Sanitizer! He sells it for his cost - no profit. My husband likes the toothbrush - says his mouth feels like a dentist cleaning - and the features and timing and all is great. Just shop around for it. There may be a dentist near you with the same attitude!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I love this toothbrush! After using only 6 weeks our teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel great everytime you brush. It took a few days to get used to the feeling but the brush breaks you in slowly - its that smart! We clean the handle after every use and love the UV cleaner. If you spend all the money take care of it and it&#x27;ll take care of you.</li>
            <li> Positive:   (1.) Newer head design eliminates having to clean inside the head like in the older designs.  (2.) Smaller sizing makes handling in the mouth easier.   Negative:  (1.) Speed changing button is in the wrong location such that when holding the handle while brushing one is frequently hitting the button thus changing the speed far too often.   (2.) There is no back stop or guide to help in placing the handle back onto the charger making it difficult to locate the precise spot that the handle fits into.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one, my teeth are cleaner, dentist visits shorter, and I have had this one for over 2 years and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working just as well a year and a half after purchase. Replacement heads are easy to get. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used to own an electric toothbrush model that was 5 years old or so. As the batteries began to die, and I was going to go on an international trip requiring international compatibility (my old ones didn&#x27;t..) I decided to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about the Toothbrush is that not only does it come with a &#x27;home&#x27; base station, it also conveniently includes a travel station as well, something many companies do not include, but it extremely useful for constant travelers who want to minimize their baggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself cleans amazingly well. The pulse vibrations feel extremely different compared to my last toothbrush, the hold was ergonomically improved (though for a while I kept accidentally shutting off the toothbrush, as it&#x27;s very sensitive). My teeth felt much more clean with this newer one. The battery life is also excellent, I have only charged it three times in the last three months, brushing twice daily for the regular advised time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One odd thing though, the white plastic tends to stain easily. I had marker on my hands which I did not notice, now the rubber grip is slightly stained with red marker, and will not come out without a fight. I&#x27;m sure time will wear it away, but it was slightly disappointing. However it does not affect the cleaning power obviously, which is the most important part of the toothbrush. It was well worth the money, and I&#x27;m glad I finally upgraded to newer cleaning tech! My teeth are much more joyous with this.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because the product is excellent. I would recommend this product to everyone my dentist even gives his endorsement</li>
            <li> Like leaving the hygienist&#x27;s office morning and night. My teeth feel so clean. I recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve purchased and I have not been disappointed. Very easy to use and after each brushing session my teeth feel very clean. Dental checkups have been shorter too as the toothbrush does a great job of removing any buildup before it can become plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my third sonicare product.  My dentist recommended for me to get an electric toothbrush and stated that Sonicare was the best.  I honestly haven&#x27;t had a cavity since....which is amazing.  Just one of those things i guess.  I love the toothbrush but found out a couple of things along the way.  Don&#x27;t recharge the toothbrush until it is completely dead.  I know this because my wife and I bought a kit with two from Costco.  She charged hers daily and I only charged mine when it died since I travel quite frequently.  Hers lasted 8 months and mine lasted 3 years.  We purchased this version from Costco again because you could get two.  This one the head on one of them (mine) broke.  Something inside didn&#x27;t allow it to vibrate any longer. I called Sonicare and they stated that since it was beyond the time period that they could offer me $25 off from their website.  Not good considering it was only 13 months old.  I just bought this one and really like it...hoping it lasts....</li>
            <li> This is my third brush in about 7 years. It&#x27;s a sonicare, not much more to say than that. Great brush, brushes my teeth good, massages my gums.</li>
            <li> Been about a year since I&#x27;ve purchased this unit, and I can say I will not be going back to any manual or AA battery toothbrushes. Powerful motor leaves the teeth feeling polished and super clean, and the UV light is nice peace of mind for anyone with mysophobia.</li>
            <li> buy the over the counter oral b or whatever is available, that costs less.  works just as well, or better, with less guilt for having paid too much</li>
            <li> Good product that all should be using.  My daughter in law is a DDS and speaks highly of these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other electronic toothbrushes,  but compared to manual brushing I really love my sonicare.  My teeth just feel cleaner and my biannual cleanings seem to go more smoothly (my hygienist seems to have way less scraping to do). The toothbrush really holds a charge as with daily use I am only charging it every other month</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long to make the switch from the manual youth brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Flexcare rechargable sonic toothbrush and sanitizer is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have had several Sonicare toothbrushes and they were all difficult to keep clean and sometimes more trouble to take apart and clean than worth the time. I would recommed this product over any other electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s well worth the money and the best price online was at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This was the best purchase ever! My dental hygienist has been promoting the great benefits of using a Sonicare toothbrush regularly for at least 4 years. I was apprehensive because of the small size of the toothbrush head, not believing the \\&quot;hype\\&quot; and, not to mention, the steep price for a mere toothbrush. I finally gave in after a very painful dental procedure to fix the erosion of my gum line which was caused by aggressive brushing. After using the Sonicare toothbrush twice daily (okay! on some days...but daily nonetheless) for over 6 months, I am now a true believer! My mouth is fresher longer and flossing is not as disgusting. :) Now I&#x27;m purchasing one for my nephew and parents. Also want to mention that I&#x27;m a true bargain shopper...Amazon was, by far, the best deal out there.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one about 13 years ago (maybe more) after having a gum infection and surgery. The surgeon is the one who recommended the Sonicare unit. This is my third Sonicare and I don&#x27;t forsee changing to a different brand. Although a little expensive, they last for years. All that is necessary is that you replace the head every 6 months or less if needed. My dentist said she never thought I would still have all my teeth due to past problems. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s because of the Sonicare, but I&#x27;m sure it helped. My teeth never felt as clean when I brushed manually or with other electrics. Expensive but WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> We are on our second flex sonicare electric toothbrush.I was very impressed with their prompt service.I called philips and they replaced the toothbrush in two days plus they included an extra brush with my order.It was free at no cost to me because it played out before the two year warranty had expired.I realize that there still are some companies that honour their word and have integrity.Thank you Philips for a job well done.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing!!! I have used electric toothbrushes for about 5 years now. I used to have Phillips Sonicare and it was horrible. After about 10 uses it became nasty and dirty and just disgusting. It was very hard to clean, but this toothbrush is amazing! It does need occasional cleaning, but it works perfectly! Also, it holds charge for a long time and has a sanitizer. You will not regret your buy!</li>
            <li> This was recomended to me by my dentist.  You price was far less and included the sanitizer.  My teeth and gums have never looked or felt this good.  Thanks for selling such great items at such great prices.  This was my first but not last Amazon purchase.  Thanks,Suzanne</li>
            <li> have never used the uv thing, should have saved my money and bought only the brush and not the uv.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It works great, the settings are perfect... and I love that it comes with a travel charger. I actually only use the travel charger. Originally I bought it because it had the UV light... but I found I never use it... so if you are like me and you buy gadgets because they are neat.. but then find yourself not using them...You can probably get a less expensive version of this without the UV light.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  When dealing with oral hygiene, I wanted the best and all the research pointed towards the Philips Sonicare for all the features it offers.  The base has many different options to use for cleaning and maintaining your teeth and gums.  Bought one for my teenage kids as well and they also like it very much.  Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a good, worhwhile electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product &amp; the manufacturer.... where to start:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded from an electric Oral-B toothbrush to this one and notice a major difference.  My teeth are whiter, my gums are healthier and my whole mouth just feels cleaner.  Random people comment on my &amp;#34;white teeth&amp;#34; and believe me... my teeth are not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Even my dentist and hygienist asked me what I am doing differently or if I am &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; my teeth - and I do not.&lt;br /&gt;Because of my rave reviews of this product both my sister and mother have purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally when I travel overseas for several weeks at a time and do not take it with me (even though it comes with a travel case and charger) I miss using it and actually look forward to coming home and having that &amp;#34;clean mouth&amp;#34; feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this toothbrush for almost 4 years now.  The warranty has run out and just yesterday it started making funny noises and seems like it&#x27;s not working properly anymore.  I talked it over with my husband and we immediately agreed we would buy a new one, because we like this one so much.  Today I decided to call Philips to see if it would be possible to buy just a new wand (since the UV sanitizer and charging station still works fine) and they are sending us a NEW ONE FOR FREE!!  Plus the customer service rep was so friendly and helpful. I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say this and mean it all the time:  This is the best money I have ever spent on any household product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have wanted one for 10 years but never knew how important it was till I read the reviews of others that had bought one and are now getting good checkups. I had a warning from my hygienist a while ago that I had pockets starting and gum disease was starting, but he never recommended anything to help me. After reading how others are now reversing their dental problems with this toothbrush I pulled out the credit card. I have had my Flexcare+ for three days now and my teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned and I have already noted they are a shade whiter already then when I started. I then bought a Waterpik to help my flossing too. The toothbrush is easy to use and I like the UV sanitizer unit. A lot of people complain about the refill price, but if this toothbrush is going to help me keep my teeth and reverse the gum disease started I will pay the price. I recommend this product for anyone interested in getting good checkups and saving your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  6 months later I got the best checkup I have had in years!!  This really does work!</li>
            <li> Works great for a couple of years.  But then in the middle of the night our toothbrush turned on.  It was loud.  We could not turn it off, but it went off eventually on its own, only to go back on.  It continued to turn on and off, in no determinable pattern, until I broke it apart and removed the battery.  This has happened to us with 2 different Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing negative I have to say about this toothbrush. Instead of buying $30 toothbrush heads, I boil my toothbrush heads, and rotate them out. The toothbrush comes with two heads. It cleans my teeth much better than a regular toothbrush, based on research I did on the effects of brushing with a 31,000 movements per minute toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush in the hope that it would reduce the frequency of painful cancer sores.  I am unfortunately prone to getting these annoying and very painful sores for no other reason than bad luck. :(  The good news is that I think this brush is helping! :) I think the UV light that sanitizes the brush head is the key.  Also the 3-minute brushing routine helps make sure each session of brushing is as effective as possible and I appreciate knowing that once the brush stops moving I have done enough brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush to everyone, especially if you have oral ailments.  This brush really does leave my mouth with a cleaner feeling than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; p.s. for my cancer sore sufferers don&#x27;t use toothpastes that contain sodium laurel sulphate and try to avoid foaming toothpastes they can irritate your gums.  My mouthwash suggestion is Biotene. it is expensive, but it really does the best job without hurting your gums.  Also, your dentist can prescribe you a rinse with chlorhexidine that will really help to reduce frequency and/or length of irritation by the cancer sores*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m not a doctor - these suggestions come from personal experience and things I&#x27;ve read online</li>
            <li> My teeth have been cleaner by using this magical device for a year.  At first, I was unsure how much better it could be than the normal frayed sassafras branch I had been using, but now that I own it I can say its pretty awesome.  It&#x27;s like a carwash for your mouth and you don&#x27;t have to go to the back yard to get a new branch every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more serious note- my UV light went out.  Not a big deal, I never contacted sonicare or anything, but for the money I had hoped this would last a little longer.  Brush still works great though so I say 5 stars to ye!</li>
            <li> Too bad they can&#x27;t last forever, but I understand...got this for a replacement of my first one that lasted about 12 years...true and faithful to the end...and I&#x27;ve been getting perfect check-ups from the dentist within months of using it so long ago! I really like the options of cleaning times on this new one - but have to confess, I don&#x27;t use the sonic toothbrush cleaner at all!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I love how it has a place to store the heads when not in use. Keeps them clean from the germs of the bathroom. I had a problem with my toothbrush after a few months; it broke when I pulled the head off of it. I called Philips and they sent me a new one a few days later. No problems at all!! I am so glad I bought it and I would never buy another brand of electric toothbrush again. I know Philips will cover me no matter what happens.</li>
            <li> You honestly cant beat a Sonicare! I don&#x27;t have the best brushing habits or the cleaniest teeth, but my dentist was amazed at how clean my teeth where after using this for 3 months! &amp;#34;Your teeth or extremely clean! You still need to do bi annual cleanings with us, but I&#x27;m impressed at how much they have improved!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for two years now and I havnt had a single cavity or issue with my teeth or the tooth brush. I travel often for work and even after owning the tooth brush for two years I still can grab it and use it every day for 3 weeks without it dieing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The sonicare was delievered as ordered and works great.  I fyou are planning on buying an electric toothbrush you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I like the way it cleans. However, I don&#x27;t know if I really need this much teeth cleaning power. I am very thorough when it comes to cleaning my teeth and I think I would have been fine with a cheaper model like the Healthy White. It makes a big mess and I end up drooling and getting toothpaste spatter all over the bathroom lol.</li>
            <li> work great for the first month. Then the inside breaks along with the timer - well, that happened to me, then I googled the problem and found it happen to many folks who purchase this toothbrush. It is good while it works, but it&#x27;s very expensive and should last longer.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, really leaves our teeth clean and the dentist has noticed a significant difference as well. Has helped with gum health as well.</li>
            <li> Summary of my dealings for Phillips  Customer Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After having 2 toothbrushes replaced my current one will no longer accept a charge, I am totally fed up with this toothbrush. I would like you replace the toothbrush or even better refund my purchase (crediting my Amazon.com account). I have searched The Internet and this is not a rare occurrence. It was quite an expensive item and I was confident that The Phillips name would assure quality. I am really bummed out. I look forward to your timely reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank: The issue appears to be with the toothbrush handle.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Your unit comes! with 2 years of manufacturer warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Shalom: OK&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Shalom, the warranty on the replacement handle is based on your original product&#x27;s date of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: I&#x27;ve checked the entitlement and the unit is not within warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Please note that the Sonicare toothbrushes are non-repairable&lt;br /&gt;Frank: In this situation, my best suggestion would be to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush and I can offer you a coupon code for 15% off and free shipping on purchase of the unit through our Philips online store. The coupon will be applicable to our US consumer only.&lt;br /&gt;Frank: Should I provide the information about discount coupon?&lt;br /&gt;Shalom: So I basically wasted $150 on a toothbrush that was replaced twice and never really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Junk (original toothbrush), junk (first replacement), junk (second replacement), junked.</li>
            <li> After 4 yrs the flex part of flex are broke.  The brush is no longer securely locked to handle.  Dental check-ups have been much better over 4 yrs without need for scraping with the hook.  Just disappointed for ~$145 the brush broke before the battery wore out.  Will see if cheaper Oral-B, Crest, etc have equivalent performance before buying replacement.</li>
            <li> but it breaks about once a year, so i get a new one under warranty and send the old one in. A nuisance but love the toothbrush otherwise.</li>
            <li> Wore out after 3 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very reliable toothbrush and I like the UV cleaning and settings on the toothbrush, my only complaint is that the rubber bottom can get gross pretty fast if you are not diligent to keep it dry.&lt;br /&gt;And once a mold smell gets in that rubber, look out. It&#x27;s not coming out and it will transfer to other things, like your clothes in a suitcase, etc.&lt;br /&gt;We bought this new one because our old one just got funky. We are clean people, I swear! We just didn&#x27;t even realize that water had been sitting under it. It only takes a few days of being wet to cause a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had this most recent one now over 6 months and we&#x27;ve been good about keeping it dry and we&#x27;ve had no problem since.</li>
            <li> I received one of these Sonicare toothbrushes as a gift.  The original one worked for a while, then it would just make noise (sounded like it was working), but the toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t vibrate.  I got a replacement under warranty, and that one only lasted 4 months before it started doing the same thing.  Lots of noise, but no vibration at the toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive for a product that doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Back to manual toothbrushes for me.</li>
            <li> Philips is no doubt the Best on the Market,we have 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, this is my first electric toothbrush that cost over 20$. I was going to buy an Oral B Pro 5000, but these were on sale for much cheaper. The flexcare is the comparable model to the Pro 5000, so I went with it for that, and also because I try my hardest to avoid P&amp;G products because of their tendency to test on animals. Granted, I know they&#x27;re not testing their toothbrushes on animals (though, that may help with lab animal dental care!) it just seemed like a worthy plus for Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived, the packaging was surprisingly easy to break through, and I set about to charging it for 18 hours... just kidding, that&#x27;s what the package says but I ended up charging mine for about 6 hours before using it for the first time. What? I just couldn&#x27;t wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased two of these (one with the sanitizer) because I was unaware how easy it was to change brush heads. It&#x27;s literally just one placement. No screwing, you just place the head with the brushes facing the \\&quot;panel\\&quot;. Now I realize I definitely could have just gotten one toothbrush for my spouse and me to share. Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t feel like a good person returning a toothbrush for no other reason than my own disbelief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My GOODNESS! This thing is powerful. The first time I used it, I actually wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to be able to handle it. I only used it for about a minute, gingerly pressing it to my teeth before pulling it back, and this was on the sensitive setting. What power! It&#x27;s now been a week, and now I can make the full three minutes of the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; setting and I look forward to an extra thirty seconds or so on the massage setting, which I just run over my gums where they meet my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what the settings are from what I can tell.. max care is three minutes of alternating toothbrushing gloriousness. It alternates regular speed with the massage. The massage is formulated for your gums, so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any benefit to this being in your toothbrushing routine. Go care is a minute of the standard speed, which apparently is for those of you who can&#x27;t spare an extra minute to brush your teeth. If you neglect to choose go care or max care, you apparently get 2 minutes of \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; setting with little breaks in which it&#x27;s suggesting you move to another quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially thought the little breaks were because I was pressing too hard and it was automatically stopping for that reason, but no.. perhaps I should have read my manual instead of just assuming. I wasn&#x27;t pressing, really. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading my manual, I also learned that my first time wasn&#x27;t even as powerful as it could have been! Apparently for the first 15 uses it doesn&#x27;t vibrate at full power in an attempt to get you used to the toothbrush. If you read your manual, you can find how to turn that option off. I also learned it doesn&#x27;t even have a setting to alert you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard. I thought that was kind of standard for expensive toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow- this item has made my teeth so happy. They&#x27;re dentist clean on a daily basis, and I had to use a regular toothbrush as I forgot to pack mine for an outing and was appalled at how \\&quot;unclean\\&quot; my teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gets teeth wonderfully clean&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Aesthetically pleasing&lt;br /&gt;-Simple operation, made even more simple by reading the manual&lt;br /&gt;-Nice options and settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing to alert you of if you are pressing too hard&lt;br /&gt;-Price point could be considered high&lt;br /&gt;-Very STRONG and something to get used to at first&lt;br /&gt;-Creates a lot of saliva, which your husband WILL fling at your just-washed bathroom mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it is the MOST WONDERFUL ITEM I&#x27;VE PURCHASED. Well. This week at least. Again, keep in mind that I have no electric toothbrush to compare this to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... as for the Sanitizer?  I have no clue!  I bought it considering the sanitizer is 20 bucks when you buy it alone, and only an extra 10 bucks when you buy it as part of the set (and it comes with 2 heads instead of just 1).  So there, I got a sanitizer and an extra brush head for 10 dollars.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually sanitizing the two brush heads, or if I&#x27;m even putting them on right, since they always seem to rest precariously on the pin.  I just toss them in, and turn it on.  Since I lived a toothbrush sanitizer free life before, I can only assume my lot has improved.ust 1).

            <li> Lasted 4 years before it died on me.  Definitely one of my smarter purchases over the years.  My teeth feel so clean after using the Sonicare...and my dentist agrees.  I just replaced my FlexCare with a new DiamondCare.  I&#x27;d recommend using an electric toothbrush over a manual brush any day.  Suck up the price and know that you&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of it.  Healthy/clean teeth are worth it.</li>
            <li> Have had sonicares for 12 years.  Had the flexcare for 3 years and had to replace it annually because it simply died (wasn&#x27;t dropped and was maintained correctly).  This time around, Philips is giving up on me leaving me no choice but to give up on them.  Previous models lasted minimum 4 to 5 years.  While the flexcare cleaned well enough, I don&#x27;t feel like dealing with a replacement every year.  That&#x27;s not much better than what we are supposed to do with regular toothbrushes - replace every 6 months.  For the $150, I&#x27;ll pass.  Wife has had an oral b for 4 years, her teeth are white, I&#x27;ll go with that.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, and she loves it. She especially likes the UV sanitizer, since she is a medical doctor and knows all about those germs. It also has a nice compact charger and a light to let you know when it is almost time to recharge it. Overall, she thinks it is great and of good quality. Our entire family uses Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrushes and love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new sonic toothbrush a few weeks and love it.  I also like the idea of the timer so that you are getting a thorough cleaning..........almost as good as going to the dentist.....and cheaper.  Took a little bit to get used to the vibration.......and it sometimes tickles my tongue ;-) I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas and in 4months the toothbrush dies and I called the customer service and they wont do anything for me because I don&#x27;t have the receipt IT WAS A GIFT! The lady on the phone at Philips hung up on me, I got no help and I am not satisfied with the toothbrush or the customer service. STAY AWAY FROM PHILIPS PRODUCTS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself vibrated too much it felt funny in the mouth took a bit to get used to and the 2 min timer did not work from the beginning. Its too expensive for the short amount of time they last. I would recommend an ORAL B tooth brush. they last forever.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this tooth brush. I&#x27;ve been using this tooth brush for about 3 years and love it as much today as I did 3 years ago. Prior to being a proud Sonicare owner, I used the Oral-B electric tooth brush. I went looking for a new brush for two reasons: one, the Oral-B brush heads always accumulated a gross slime inside of them, that really grossed me out. Who wants to put slime in their mouth when they are trying to CLEAN their teeth? Not I. The second reason I went looking for a new toothbrush, is that I really wanted a UV sanitizer for the toothbrush heads. Again, going back to not wanting to put something gross and loaded with germs in my mouth with the intention of cleaning. I solved both of these issues with this Sonicare, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, there is no gross slime getting stuck in these heads, and the UV sanitizer is amazing. I have read some other reviews that mentioned that daily use of the UV sanitizer can be cumbersome. I don&#x27;t find this to be an issue at all. It does take a full 10 minutes to complete a full sanitization session, but I just turn on the sanitation while I am showering and/or flossing- my regular morning routine, and by the time I am ready to brush, my heads are nice and sanitized &#x3D;).  Other reviewers have also mentioned that the brush heads need to be perfectly aligned in the sanitizer for the door to close, but I have never had an issue of them not being \\&quot;aligned\\&quot; correctly. I just plop um on the peg, facing any direction and they fit perfectly! The brush heads come in 2 sizes, small and large, and one of each is included in the package, and I use the large ones and have still never had any issue with them fitting in the sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successfully meeting my 2 requirements for being happy with my new tooth brush, the Sonicare went above and beyond when it comes to the actual brushing. It truly is a revolutionary sort of \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibration. The Oral-B brush I used before just vibrated, this tooth brush seems to be a much more precise and advanced movement that vibrates with purpose. Its nearly impossible to explain the sensation of the Sonicare, but it truly cannot compare it to my old Oral-B. After using the this Sonicare for awhile, I went on vacation and grabbed my old Oral-B. When it came time to use it, I felt like the Oral-B didn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all! If felt clunky inside my mouth, and the vibrating felt almost useless. The Sonicare really leaves my teeth CLEAN; like just after a dental cleaning clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the different brushing mode options. &#x27;Refresh&#x27; is the 1 minute option, perfect for when I am in a rush. &#x27;Clean&#x27; is the 2 minute option, that I use most often. &#x27;GumCare&#x27; takes 3 minutes, the first 2 minutes of this mode are just like clean, and the last minute is more of the &#x27;massage&#x27; feature, which is a bit softer and is meant to use for brushing your gums. I use the &#x27;GumCare&#x27; option at night when I have the time. Then there is the just &#x27;massage&#x27; feature. All of these options have an amazing slight pause every 30 seconds, that you use to make sure you are spending equal time in each quadrant of your mouth. I know other reviewers have mentioned that the programming  of the brush modes can be annoying, but honestly it is just pushing one button next to the name of the program you wish to use at that time. I know some people might want to set it for the one they like and have it always use that option, but me personally, I like to use different modes at different times, so it would annoy me more if it was set to one and I couldn&#x27;t change it as easily as I can now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another really cool thing about this brush is that it comes with 2 different chargers! One has the sanitizer attached to it, and the other one it for travel and does not come with a sanitizer. This toothbrush also comes with a travel case, and brush head covers, which is really cool. Also, the heads have a little plastic circle on it that comes in a few different colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush- each with a different color head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery. The newer models have the Li-ion which is supposed to mean that the brush will run longer on a single charge, and won&#x27;t develop a memory by leaving it on the charging stand. However, I had the older model first and noticed that the newer one doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long. However, I had to purchase this newer one because my other battery eventually died, so hopefully this one will have a longer shelf-life, even if that means more charges in-between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this toothbrush VERY much, and strongly recommend it to everyone. One more thing I have to mention, ever since I began using this brush, my dentist tells me at every cleaning that I am plaque and tarter free! I really believe that I have this tooth brush to thank for that. &#x3D;)ifferent colors, which is great for couples who share the toothbrush- each with a different color head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit confused about the difference between the NiCad battery and the Li-ion battery.

            <li> I was very pleased with the product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it cleans my teeth like no other toothbrush has been able to before.  My dentist will be so happy with the results.  I purchased a Philips Sonicare Advanced cleaning  which has 3 Modes and 2 routines for custom cleaning.  I purchased the one that has a rechargeable sonic toothbrush and comes with two brushes.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and it&#x27;s so easy!  I find that Amazon had the best price but it&#x27;s always good to check in other areas too.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results of the toothbrush.  I have had a problem with the units failing due to the handle vibration becoming decoupled from the brush head. I have noted other reviewers comment on this as well.  Sonicare replaced the first toothbrush, but will not replace the second.  The continued failures of the base unit make this an expensive proposition.</li>
            <li> I went back to the essence because the brush head would not stay on the brush. After having more than one come off while brushing and causing toothpaste to splash out and down my shirt.  it&#x27;s gone. Went back with the essence style brush. It&#x27;s more secure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tooth brush what else can I say.&lt;br /&gt;Woks like it was designed.</li>
            <li> mine has stopped working.  Loved it while it worked</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the replacement brush heads are so expensive.  $25 for only three - really?!  I guess that&#x27;s where they really make their money...what can you do.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush;they sell them for $170. I was impressed by the look of the product as well as her explanation of how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the much lower price on Amazon, I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using the brush for almost 2 months and I&#x27;m very pleased. I especially like the idea of having the UV sanitizer included since I always wondered about bacteria lurking on brushes as they dry. Another plus is the compact travel charger and brush with its flexible case. Previously, I avoided taking up space traveling with an electric toothbrush and took only a manual brush. This will fit in my luggage nicely and the weight is negligible. The vibration and ease of using the brush is a little better than my previous brush, the Oral B, and it has different power and brushing options. I prefer this to my Oral B. I have already recommended this toothbrush to friends.</li>
            <li> I replaced my Oral B toothbrush with this one after many years.  I really liked the Oral B but my hygienist recommended the Sonicare so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the switch.  It seems to clean the teeth better and the multiple brushing modes are great!  The GO mode is great for when you just need to freshen up after a meal.  I purchased the small heads &amp; they fit well behind the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchase the Soniccare about a month ago,It really does feel like you just had your teeth cleaned by a dentist,Keep in mind it will take about a week to really feel the diffence,But for the parents out there&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy this for your kid&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;over another video game&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is about $100 buck&#x27;s, But it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for many years. In fact, this purchase is my third purchase of a Sonicare Toothbrush...my other ones were no longer able to be charged. I like the New Flexcare one the best of my previous purchases because it is slimmer, has more brushing options and has a disinfecting process. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I think they should last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before the warranty ran out, the first unit&#x27;s drive mechanism became very sloppy and loud and the brush became unusable.&lt;br /&gt;Just a few more days, and I would have been out a lot of money paid for this thing....but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A live chat with Phillips Care, after remote diagnosing by the representative, resulted in a brand new replacement unit being shipped to me along with a postage paid return package for the old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement unit&#x27;s operation was noticeably different from the original.  The original was always louder and had more vibration than this replacement but the replacement cleans just as good as the other ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything man made can have trouble.&lt;br /&gt;What really impressed me was the fair and efficient way Phillips handled this.&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t do me a &amp;#34;favor&amp;#34;, though....I paid a lot of money for this brush and I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because Phillips took the &amp;#34;high road&amp;#34; and actually did something very rare now a days and treated the customer fairly, I would definitely buy this same brush again and will recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have passed over more than a few purchases, when a brief search revealed a lousy customer service reputation of a company, so this experience was refreshing.</li>
            <li> Liked using it but didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been suggesting this type of toothbrush for ever, but being a diehard I stayed with old faith-ful. Them I caved in and purchased the Philips, been using it for 6 - 8 months now it&#x27;s doing a good job, and I like it.  My last visit to the dentist they didn&#x27;t ask what kind of tooth brush I was using, and wasn&#x27;t offered a tooth brush after the visit.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd phillips sonicare i have had and have loved this product.  The last one lasted about 10 years, hope this one does too.  It works fine, and I am very pleased. Thanks, Karen</li>
            <li> Our periodontist suggested that we purchase the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush.  He said that an ordinary toothbrush could not possibly perform as well as this one.  When a person brushes manually, he does most of the work, but when operating a sonic toothbrush, the user must be careful to apply only apply light pressure, angle the brush so that it touches both the tooth and the gum, and move the brush slowly from tooth to tooth.  There will be a period of adjustment for the average person who is used to putting extra effort into cleaning his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare FlexCare has a clear and thorough instruction booklet explaining each feature.  The handle is comfortable, the on/off button is conveniently located, and there is a travel charger if you want to take the brush with you on the road.  A fully charged brush will work for two weeks, but you may leave the brush in the charger 24/7 without causing any damage.  For those who are nervous about germs, there is even a UV sanitizer to zap any bacteria that may have settled on the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to experiment with different brushing modes, there is a standard \\&quot;clean mode,\\&quot; a \\&quot;sensitive mode\\&quot; for a more gentle feel, and a \\&quot;massage mode\\&quot; for extra gum stimulation.  There are also short and longer brushing cycles and a \\&quot;Smartimer\\&quot; that automatically turns off the toothbrush at the end of a brushing cycle. Having used the toothbrush for a while now, I find it refreshing, stimulating, and easy to operate.  If you want to put your money where your mouth is, this high tech item would be a sensible purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Since Optiva created Sonicare, I have bought their toothbrushes.  Nothing comes close in competition.  My complaint with the original Sonicare was that the brush head was too cumbersome, and viola! Sonicare Elite does away with that complaint.  Then, I found that garbage tends to collect in the toothbrush heads and handle base, which bothered me a lot.  I was also actively trying to buy a UV sanitizer for my toothbrush after hearing that toothbrush heads collect particles from human feces (which makes sense).  So I bought the Ultreo ~ the same people who founded Optiva.  Well, as soon as I got to use the Sonicare Flexcare, I immediately purchased it and returned the Ultreo.      Wow!  This toothbrush delivers 2 items on my oral healthcare wishlist in one fell swoop.  Bravo! Philips!  I am impressed that a corporation the size of Philips actually listened to its customers.  I am thoroghly impressed.  No more gunk collecting inside my toothbrush and I can rest easy now that my brush heads are UV sanitized!  I would spend $300 for this gadget.  Also, it is fantastic that this has some useful programs ~ unlike its predecessors, which left you with like gentle and hard brushing (totally useless, in my humble opinion).  Really great improvement over previous models.  I suppose the next revision of the Sonicare toothbrush will be an ultra-sonic model?!?  I can&#x27;t imagine anything more for a toothbrush ... the next step would have to be a toothbrush that flosses and scraps your tongue for you, along with brushing.      Anyway, pay for this gadget!  This is awesome!  Thanks Philips!</li>
            <li> DEVICE INSTALL/SETUP&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush required no complicated setup, simply removing the items from the packaging and plugging it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANUALS/DOCUMENTATION&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to find that not only does this product come with very informative, concise written instructions, but the manuals can also be easily downloaded from the Philips&#x27; website in PDF format.  This is very handy for those of us who don&#x27;t always keep up as easily with the printed manuals, or who prefer to be able to text search the manual for the information we need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUNCTIONALITY&lt;br /&gt;I have never used an electric toothbrush of any kind before, and although I&#x27;ve been intrigued by the idea for some time, I was a little nervous to use this one at first.  Turning the toothbrush on for the first time didn&#x27;t alleviate my nervousness much, as the device certainly SOUNDS powerful.  To my relief, actually using the toothbrush was painless, although the first few times it tickled a bit.  I have been using the toothbrush daily since September 21, 2007 and am happy to report that this product performs as advertised.  In fact, my teeth feel and look as good as if I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I&#x27;m brushing in half the time I did manually, and the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush is doing twice as good a job as I ever did with a standard toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is packaged with a number of items, including a travel case and a travel charger which packs in a toiletry bag much easier than the countertop charger with the built in sanitizer.  Also included is two toothbrush heads, a compact size and a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the sanitizer faithfully each time I brush my teeth, but to be perfectly honest, I don&#x27;t know how to judge whether the sanitizer is really making any difference or not.  I love the idea of it, and I hope that it is truly keeping my toothbrush germ-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly love the massaging function on the toothbrush, designed to prevent gingivitis by massaging the gums.  With just over two weeks of regular use, I can already tell a difference here.  Using the massager stimulates the gums, making them stronger and healthier.  The cleaning routine I prefer, the &#x60;MaxCare&#x27;, includes massage in the routine for each tooth quadrant, making it easy to incorporate into your daily brush habit without extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the cleaning routines, there are two:  MaxCare, and GoCare.  I&#x27;ve tested the one-minute GoCare routine and found it acceptable for a rush job, but I much prefer to perform the full MaxCare routine, which runs through a 4-quadrant brush and massage cycle in three minutes.  There aren&#x27;t many times I can&#x27;t spare my teeth that extra two minutes, and my dental health is important.  After running through the brush and massage cycle for each of the four quadrants (upper front, upper back, lower front, and lower back), the toothbrush automatically shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASE OF USE&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of buttons on both the base charger/sanitizer and the cordless toothbrush, but they are simple to learn and easy to use.  After checking the manual once on how to activate the cleaning routines, I&#x27;ve not needed to consult it again for this information.  The sanitizer activates with a simple push of the button on top of the unit and shuts off automatically when it completes the sanitizing cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY/DURABILITY&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#x27;ll be better able to report on this area in a year, but the product seems sturdy and built for long-term use, unlike some hardware which feels more like it is made for disposability.  The product inspires confidence in me that Philips truly means this unit to last the consumer for many years, only needed to replace consumable parts such as the toothbrush heads periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VALUE&lt;br /&gt;This area is the real kicker.  I love the toothbrush, and find myself extremely satisfied with all of its parts and features, as well as the results of brushing with it diligently for almost three weeks.  Is it worth the initial investment?  I think that is a question better answered by looking at your own budget and how important your dental health is to you.  The general person will not likely spend this much on a toothbrush, sonic or not.  In fact, it is the pricing on these units that made me waffle over the decision to invest in one for the last year.  Having used it, I am now confident that it is worth the price, and am looking forward to fewer dental visits, other than the general check-ups necessary.  Again, only time will tell here if that is wishful thinking on my part or a true benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is no doubt a luxury item for most, more likely to end up under the Christmas tree for those who are interested in a sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUICK RECAP - PROS &amp; CONS&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use - I adapted easily to the button functions on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Durable - the parts feel sturdy and built to last.&lt;br /&gt;Pricing a little high for most - more likely a luxury expense or gift item.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement parts - Brush heads are easily ordered through [...], but I am uncertain if they can be purchased in local stores.

            <li> I have to admit that I was quite a bit skeptical about the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used electronic toothbrushes (all battery operated) in the past, and never saw a compelling difference between using them versus the traditional &#x27;manual&#x27; toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, trepiditiously, I tried the Sonicare....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself was easy to install (you&#x27;ll have to wait two hours after initially charging the unit before you can use it). The toothbrush comes with a handy gauge that indicates its charge.  Using the Sonicare was extremely easy - there&#x27;s a button on the back of the toothbrush unit that you have to press in order to activate the brush. One thing I quickly learned is to not turn the toothbrush &#x27;on&#x27; with toothpaste before putting it in your mouth - doing so will result in your toothpaste lining the base of your sink instead of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit isn&#x27;t overly noisy, at least to me. Brushing was easy, unobtrusive, and fairly comfortable overall. The smaller toothbrush head makes it easy to clean those hard-to-reach places - leaving my teeth and gums shiny and my breath fresh. One thing I like in particular with the Sonicare is that you do not have to apply any force while brushing. (The common cause for gums to recede is usually due to over-brushing). You simply move the toothbrush around, and the brush vibrations take care of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 5 brushing modes you can choose from, including one for sensitive teeth. The package also includes a travel charger and a UV sanitizer, which kills any germs which may live on your toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most people, this unit is overkill - but it is well thought out and works well for its intended function. I personally enjoy using mine and would recommend it without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my Philips Sonicare died last week. I called Customer Service up. They sent a new one out in 3 days (with no cost to me) and provided return shipping to send the old unit back. Excellent customer service!ellent customer service!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare FlexCare has a mind / programing of it&#x27;s own which for me is a good thing.  Sometimes I&#x27;m in a rush to head out the door and don&#x27;t realize how little I did actually brush my teeth.  With this toothbrush not anymore!  It has timed programs and beeps to let you know to move onto the next section of teeth!  I started with the sensitive program which found out later by reading more of the manual it actually increases the level of sensitivity over the course of 14 brushings!  I love that it&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth which I consider to be sensitive (It wasn&#x27;t until the age of 31 that I had my first filling).  It says it leaves you with a Dentist office clean which I agree whole heartedly and in my case without any of the pain that I would typically be in from keeping my mouth open and having them clean my sensitive teeth!    I like how the toothbrush head and handle is small, actually smaller then the manual toothbrush I had been using! I have a small mouth so it&#x27;s great!  I feel better knowing it has the UV Sanitizing feature which kills 99% of germs on the brush head!      Overall I&#x27;m extremely surprised and happy with this product and believe I&#x27;ll be looking forward to a shorter cleaning time at the Dentist Office!</li>
            <li> UPDATE - Two Years Later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been more than two years with the Sonicare Flexcare for me and more than 10 years using Sonicare toothbrushes exclusively, save for trips where I took a non-electric standard toothbrush with me.  I can say that it&#x27;s time for me to move on and move back to the world of non-electric toothbrushes, and hence lower my original score of a 4 to a 3.  Let&#x27;s see why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: this is an issue that bothers me because the handle with the soft rubber began peeling/coming off after just a year of normal use.  When I received the Flexcare I wondered about durability of the soft handle since I knew from using previous Sonicare models that the hard plastic handles were very durable, and only yellowed over time.  A $150 toothbrush should not look like this with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other issues: another issue I have is that the timer is only for two minutes, though this is the case with nearly every electric toothbrush, two minutes is just not enough time for me.  Another issue is cleaning the Flexcare which is as much a chore as it was with previous models.  Finally, the quality of the brusheads appear to have changed when they went to the brushead indicator rather than the sticker expiration date system.  Finally, the brushead is just too small for me, though it is nice that I get to feel when I brush each individual tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High points: Customer service is top notch.  I had two minor issues and they were ironed out very quickly.  Unlike many reviewers, aside from the cosmetic durability, I had no problem with the toothbrush.  I also had no problem with the battery life and I think this is key - I NEVER KEPT THE BASE PLUGGED IN.  No matter what others say, it seems that keeping the Flexcare on the stand will diminish battery life.  Finally, the toothbrush works and I believe that sanitation system also works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I&#x27;m moving back to a regular toothbrush: that said, the cost of the brusheads is just too much, cosmetically the toothbrush is done, and I&#x27;ve come to the point where I feel that this toothbrush offers nothing over standard toothbrushes.  A few times over the years I used a Swissco brand toothbrush and recently began using a Radius Original toothbrush three times a day.  The size of the head is huge and the bristles much softer than the Sonicare.  After using it for a few months, my dentist noticed that my teeth were as good as when I was using the Sonicare - plus the Radius lasts me 9 months, 3 times longer than each Sonicare brushead.  I&#x27;m not sure what the verdict will be in the longrun, but I feel that if I continue to brush for at least two minutes, there won&#x27;t be a difference.  While I enjoyed my time using Sonicare, I feel at this point it is a luxury and doesn&#x27;t offer me anything more than a standard, albeit special kind, of toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I had two Sonicare Advances that lasted me eight or so years, then I took a three year break and used a manual toothbrush.  Last month I bought the Flexcare and the improvements over the Advance are drastic.  The brush is contoured, the unit is easy to grip and light, and there is no moldy gunk buildup anymore because the brush head snaps onto the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking a star off because the unit is a little loud when I&#x27;m brushing, but there is almost no vibration, so I guess that is the tradeoff.  Also, I could have done without the UV Sanitizer, but I do use it at least once a week, especially when I have a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, customer service is really excellent.  The little Phillips logo on the travel case arrived broken, and when I contacted Sonicare, they said they would ship me a new one out for free without me having to send my broken one back.  The customer service representative even called me back when my phone lost reception.  Overall a great brush and company, Sonicare makes brushing fun!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist had recommended that I get a Sonicare several times. When I finally followed through, I was very pleased with the results. Yes, it&#x27;s an investment, but worth it. It takes some getting used to, but after several weeks, I love it. Gets my teeth sparkling clean every day. Now I don&#x27;t have to wait months to achieve that super clean feeling that comes from a dentist visit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years with very good results as asserted by my dental hygienist.  I&#x27;ve just purchased this new model, and &#x27;wow&#x27; it&#x27;s even better!! The cleanness of your teeth and the massage in your gums are much superior.  I love to brush my teeth with this new model.  Believe me, it is worth to pay more for this model than the Elite.   I rarely use the infrared receptacle (sanitizer). So, I&#x27;m buying another one for travel without it. You may consider doing that to save you some bucks.  Suggestions for Philips/Sonicare:   - I would love if Philips would launch a simplified model. I just use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, and sometimes I accidentally touch the button and change to other modes (boy, even to brush my teeth I need so many options?? Can&#x27;t life be easier first thing in the morning??).   - I would love a battery (double AA) operated model since I travel a lot, and it&#x27;s great not to have to worry about voltage and outlet compatibility (and not carrying a charger).  - This model is so superior to the other Sonicare toothbrushes, that I would suggest Philips stopping making them, and reduce the price of this one.</li>
            <li> I read the previous customers review of this product, and it does not do this product justice. My teeth have lightened dramatically, and are dramatically cleaner. I will never use a regular toothbrush again (except to clean the toilet).</li>
            <li> Hello,     Today, my dental hygienist, Jennifer, told me that I was a new person since I started caring for my teeth using the Sonicare sonic toothbrush 6 months ago. She told me that the difference is not comparable. Therefore, I knew it was time to post a review for this product. I bought this product for my birthday present and I really do not regret it:-)    I do recommend seeing your dentist after you have bought such a toothbrush; especially, if you have always used a manual toothbrush, as this is a big change and you have to transition to a new routine.     Best Regards,  Charles D.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an older model (Elite) Sonicare toothbrush since 2003.  I upgraded to this new model because the battery in my old one is wearing out.  But that&#x27;s o.k., considering these toothbrushes have only 2 year warranties -- they work very well for longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model has some improvements.  The handle is slightly shorter, thinner and lighter.  It also has a softer cover for better grip.  The new handle design is much easier to clean than my old brush.  It also doesn&#x27;t collect any hard water stains and goo, like my old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small gripes:&lt;br /&gt;  - this model is a bit noisier than the old one&lt;br /&gt;  - it&#x27;s easy to accidentally press the power button while brushing&lt;br /&gt;  I noticed the same thing when I started using the old model, so it&lt;br /&gt;  might not happen after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;  - the brush heads are slightly smaller for this model (fewer bristles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go and buy one of these toothbrushes.  You&#x27;ll probably like using one.</li>
            <li> It is great. Works fine, brand new. I like how you can change the time of brushing. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for about 10 years, and just purchased the FlexCare.  It is absolutely fantastic!  Never go back to a manual toothbrush again.  And the sanitizer is great!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, probably could do without the sanitizer part. I needed to call the company to set up the brush but customer service was pleasant and helpful. Really cleans your teeth as well as if not better than a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product right on time for vacation, little did we know it would be great ,since it was portable. It had a case that the toothbrush could be put in and add it to your other toilet articles. We used the sanitizer for both toothbrushes prior to leaving for the Carribean, using the portable toothbrushes while on vacation, which was great, and then sanitized the brushes when we got home. Having the portable brushes made it easy for us and kept us in a good dental hygiene situation.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist and I am glad they did. It is a much more vigorous action than my rotating head brush. By chance I found it has a feature that gradually builds up to full power while you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare Flex 9500 for about 18 months.  I love this toothbrush.  Automatic timing and a reminder to \\&quot;switch\\&quot; locations is great.  The ability to customize the way you brush without compromising the quality of the cleaning is very helpful.  This toothbrush keeps my teeth cleaner than they have ever been.  Even my dentist has noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recomended this brush for our 9 year old that was building up plaque fast. He loves this brush! It claims that you will see a whiter smile in one week but we saw the difference in ONE day. It comes with a small head that he uses and a large head that I use. The cleaner has a spot for two heads so we don&#x27;t share germs. The only time that I have seen my teeth this clean is the day for my cleanning appt every six months. The price is big but it was worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this product.  One feature she touted was that the brush will stop if you push too hard, which is good for me and my brushing style.  I have used it now for about three weeks and couldn&#x27;t imaging going back to a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an Advance 4000-series, for three reasons: battery was dying, gunk in head was awful, the base was getting calcified and difficult to clean even with CLR.    The FlexCare has so many positives. Everyone has listed them here, and I can&#x27;t add anything new. The design is wonderful, the gunk is 95% reduced, the charger base is nice and small.    However, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the Advance. The nice large brush area on the Advance just BLASTED my teeth clean. For four years my dentist was amazed at how clean my teeth were (and I barely flossed).     On the other hand, the Flexcare&#x27;s much smaller (and spikier) head just doesn&#x27;t clean as well. I have a quadrant in my mouth that the brush just won&#x27;t clean, and as a result I have significant plaque buildup in that quadrant. I&#x27;ve tried different angles, sequences of brushing, different gels...     And the other quadrants collect food much faster than before. All my teeth remain smooth only until the next meal. With the Advance, they&#x27;d be smooth and shiny all day. I&#x27;m also flossing nightly now, because the brush doesn&#x27;t get between teeth the way the Advance did. (I have also used Listerine twice a day sine 2002)    Overall, the brush just seems wimpy. I like the reduction in noise but I miss the invigorating blast of the Advance.     My dentist noticed immediately after only a few months of the new brush. All quadrants needed to be scraped, compared to zero with the Advance.     I wanted to hard to give a 5 star review, but the brush is simply not working. I&#x27;ve taken to scraping my own teeth every couple of weeks.     What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;m stuck with this expensive brush.</li>
            <li> This was Sonicare&#x27;s last chance to earn and keep my business...and they blew it.  This particular model was in some ways a big improvement over their previous design...more streamlined and not prone to gunking up.    Very simply it worked great in all respects right up until it stopped working.  The first symptom after just 45 days of use was the the brush head would no longer seat properly...causing the brush head to vibrate off.  Next after about 60 days the brush stopped moving.  It did&#x27;t appear to be a battery issue as I could hear the internal motor humming...it was just not engaging/driving the brush head anymore.    This device is WAY to expensive to have these kinds of issues in the first year...let alone in the first 90 days.      I don&#x27;t have time to chase down warrenties and mail this back to get fixed.  I simply ordered an Oral B and won&#x27;t go back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bought this tooth brush after my first powerbrush broke down. It was an OralB product and I was quite satisfied with it as long as it worked. When its rechargeable battery died I almost ordered the same thing again but then decided to check out what else is out there in amazon.     After some research I picked the Sonicare and so far I like it. There is more functionality and the battery life after each charge is longer. I have not used the sanitizer function yet as I feel it is a rather superfluous feature though.</li>
            <li> got this for christmas and so far seems to work great. very powerful and cleans good, hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this toothbrush about one month ago here on Amazon and absolutely love it.  Saw it displayed at my dentist&#x27;s office and talked to my hygienist about it.  She demonstrated one on my hand and I knew I had to get it.  Have been using it for about a month now and love the results.  Really gets to the back teeth very comfortably and the pulsation of the brush head against the teeth is just like the one you feel at your dentists.  I also like the fact that it has a sanitizing unit attached to the base and it has indicators on the brush handle showing the charge.  It seems to hold it&#x27;s charge very well.  Also included was portable (travel) charging station for the brush head with a travel case.  A little bit pricey, but you can find the best deals here on Amazon and Phillips will extend the warranty for two and one-half years.  All in all I would strongly recommend this Phillips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush if you want really clean, professional results every time you brush!!!</li>
            <li> Not only do me and my wife love this product our Dentist loves it and the fact we are using it as well. All the information I found on  Philips Sonicare was good and I agree with it all</li>
            <li> Using this toothbrush has made such a huge difference in my oral hygiene. The built in programs help me make sure I brush long enough, while allowing me to brush for less time when I&#x27;m in a hurry or softer when my gums are sore. The charger also has a UV cleaner which is great for making the replicable heads last longer.</li>
            <li> Another gift for my son and he really likes this product.  Seems to be keeping his teeth very healthy and gums.  Does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> exactly what they wanted</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare Electric toothbrush upon the recommendation of my Dentist.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to work well as advertised.  There is quite a bit of high pitched vibration&lt;br /&gt;when its on, so you only have to exert very light pressure when using it against the&lt;br /&gt;teeth.  This model has a break in feature that operates at reduced power for the&lt;br /&gt;first few brushings until you get used to the power.  I found you need to use&lt;br /&gt;very little toothpaste as it will foam quite a bit in your mouth.  This Model has&lt;br /&gt;an infra-red heating chamber to stearilize the brushes on a 10 minute cycle.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are color coded rings for each brush so more than one family&lt;br /&gt;member can use it.  It also has a audible buzzing timer that lets you know&lt;br /&gt;when to move the brush from outside to inside the teeth, plus variable timed&lt;br /&gt;cycles.  This brush will Destroy plaque!  I already got a good checkup from&lt;br /&gt;my dentist after using it a few weeks.  One minor disappointment:  Fluid got&lt;br /&gt;underneath the plastic guard around  the switches and discolored the edge&lt;br /&gt;of the lettering.  Make sure to  hold the brush straight out or slightly up&lt;br /&gt;so there are no leaks on the brush.  Also, after each use, wipe it down&lt;br /&gt;with a clean cloth.  All in All, a very nice product that will vastly improve&lt;br /&gt;your Dental health.  Way recommended.</li>
            <li> great product. replacement heads can be a bit expensive!!!</li>
            <li> The number of options available with this toothbrush is wonderful.  Also the cleaning apparatus is a great addition.  I would have liked to receive a docking station that would hold 2 brush heads, as my husband and I both use one Sonicare and switch out the brush heads.</li>
            <li> First, let me preface this review by stating that since the early 2000&#x27;s I have been a user of the Sonicare line of toothbrushes.  Their cleaning capabilities is second to none and they are an excellent choice for teeth and gum health.  So then, why the 1 star review?  So that Phillips will pay attention to a glaring design quality issue in their FlexCare models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the reliability of the Sonicare toothbrushes has dramatically declined since the release of the FlexCare series.  I personally have gone through two toothbrushes in four years.  That is unacceptable when considering the cost of the units (~180 per unit), and when considering the lifespan of my previous and my wife&#x27;s current \\&quot;e-Series\\&quot; Sonicare toothbrushes (at 5+ and 6+ years respectively).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare FlexCare line of toothbrushes, out since 2008/2009, uses a significantly different design to attach the brush heads to the handle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  In the older e-Series units, the connection was performed via a screw top connection to the handle.  The vibration was generated internally in the handle and transmitted to the brush head by means of metal feet in the brush head, resting on the top of the interior of the brush handle.  This made for a robust, and reliable connection.&lt;br /&gt;*  The newer FlexCare series has the vibration carried externally to a metal pole, which then slides inside of the brush head.  This new design has several internal attachment pieces that hold the metal rod in place.  This system of internally mounting the metal vibration pole is much more fragile than the previous system and is the weak link in terms of reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, each of my purchased FlexCare model Sonicare toothbrushes has had its internal mounts snap, causing a significant loss of vibration and cleaning power, with a simultaneous increase in noise.  It took 2 years in the previous unit, and 1 year in the most recently purchased unit.  This lack of reliability makes the value of the purchase decrease dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all of the above, if you can, please steer clear of the FlexCare units and purchase the older e Series units instead.  They provide the same level of cleaning power, but with the added benefit of much more reliability over multiple years of use.e value of the purchase decrease dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all of the above, if you can, please steer clear of the FlexCare units and purchase the older e Series units instead.  They provide the same level of cleaning power, but with the added benefit of much more reliability over multiple years of use.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush was great initially but then started turning itself on and off throughout the day without provocation. And believe me, when it&#x27;s 4am and your toothbrush starts buzzing like crazy from the other room, it is REALLY ANNOYING. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand. Sonicare does NOT stand for quality.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d been using an OralB toothbrush for 5 years or so when we decided to change out.  The OralB spinning head always gave me confidence that it was spinning the plaque away.  When I went to the dentist for my last visit, we spoke about electric tooth brushes and he recommended the Sonicare over the OralB.  [...] for the sake of our teeth.  Being skeptical, I didn&#x27;t use it for more than a  week, trying to decide if I should take it back.  Ultimately, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my teeth well, and gives me a giggle from tickling my inner lips at times too.  The sanitizer will give me peace of mind there are no cooties housed in my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one &#x27;complaint&#x27; and that&#x27;s that the second toothbrush can&#x27;t get power from the main toothbrush base.  So, I have to use two outlets to charge both toothbrushes.  Other than that, I have nothing but praise for this toothbrush and recommend it over the OralB.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price at Amazon.  This is a much neater and easier toothbrush to keep clean compared to the plain Sonicare sets.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and especially use the massage mode of brushing often. Sanitizer is an awesome feature also, so happy I gave this a try. Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicares for almost a decade now.  The last one that I had was the Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 and I liked that even more that the first one that I had.  Unfortunately I lost that on a business trip so I was in the market for a new toothbrush.    I got the Flexcare a few months ago and I like it even more than my previous Sonicares.  It&#x27;s great, thoroughly cleans your teeth and there are a couple of additions that make it just that much better.  The UV sanitizer is a nice feature.  The other thing is the new brush head design.  Instead of screwing the brush head down onto the base this Sonicare has a brush head that clicks onto a metal fitting that sticks up out of the base.  As a result it&#x27;s much easier to clean that previous models, which would be my only gripe about them.  If you are looking to replace your old one or want to get an powered toothbrush I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He said it took some getting use to but it really does do a great job in getting his teeth clean. I don&#x27;t care for it myself but I guess that doesn&#x27;t matter since it&#x27;s his. I really don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive. I think if i had to do it again, I would opt for one of the less expensive models.</li>
            <li> I use the brush twice daily, in the morning and before the bedtime on full 2 minute cycle.  I charge it once a week, otherwise it lays on my vanity counter top with the brush covered.  In the last 2 month I feel my teeth clean and gums healthy.  I registered the brush with manufacturer and so far there were no problems, except when I press brush too hard to the gums, and it slips, then I relax the pressure and it resumes operating.  Some people comment on price, but if you consider one visit for cleaning at the average of $95.00 per visit, it is really OK. Use it religiously and rinse daily and forget about dentist.</li>
            <li> I have been using the FlexCare for a little less than 2 years.  It has done a superb job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.  I am so pleased with its performance in those areas.    Its mechanical durability has been another issue for me, however.  I am about to return my second FlexCare toothbrush.  My first one lasted only several months before it broke down.  The second one lasted about 16 months.  When the first one broke down, it just started making a strident noise and then failed.  I returned it and received a replacement.  Now, the second one failed in the same manner.    I understand that this type of failure can be an issue with the FlexCare -- particularly if the user switches from one mode to another while the brush is running, e.g, from \\&quot;clean\\&quot; to \\&quot;massage\\&quot;.      Unfortunately, Phillips will not replace my broken Sonicare with the cheaper Essence or even the earlier Elite, although I would prefer one of those products.  So, I will receive another FlexCare -- my 3rd in less than 2 years!  (Customer Service has been very good about replacing the failed toothbrushes!)</li>
            <li> This appliance works exactly as they state.  My teeth and gums feel and look great. It took me a couple of days to not move the brush and to let it do the work.  Thought at first I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand the \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; on the roof of my mouth but quickly got used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. The timer helps make sure you take enough time in all quadrants. Another nice thing is that you use very little toothpaste and will save money on that purchase. The battery lasts a long time so I don&#x27;t keep mine plugged in.  I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for around 5 years.  I thought that was steps above using a regular toothbrush, but I was in for a surprise with the Phillips brand electric toothbrushes.  My teeth feel extremely clean after use and I like that you can choose your style of brushing.  Very easy to use - like that everything can stay clean with the toothbrush covers and the UV sanitizer.  Some people have complained about the noise, but really - you are brushing your teeth - does it really matter?  Love, love, love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd toothbrush Philips Sonicare Flex Care. The first one stoped working after 6 months, and I thongh that my son broke it. I bougth a new one becouse I love it. but it only worked for 3 months. I couldnt even use the brush replacement. I was taking care of it more carefully than my car. so this cost me about U$5 per day for use.</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning this toothbrush provided when it worked. The problem with this style brush is that it vibrates itself apart. There is a small metal shaft that the brush head is mounted on that provides the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; vibration when you brush your teeth. The problem is that it eventually vibrates itself out of the mount down int the brush and once that happens you have to throw the brush away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calling CS for Sonic Care I found out this brush is non repairable. After finding that out I decided to dissect the brush and that&#x27;s when I found the problem. The metal shaft has a ridged end that gets pressed into the socket that makes it move. It eventually wiggles itself back out of the socket and can not be pressed back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first brush lasted 9 months, the second about the same. I almost gave up on this manufacturer even though I found it superior to the Oral brand brush. I decided to give it one more try but with a different model, the one that has the large bottom to the brush head that you screw on. Well its been a year and no problems so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering buying this brush, save yourself some money and buy the cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was one of the better, yet slightly cheaper electric tootbrushes on the market.  I tend to get cavities often (soft enamel maybe?) and my dentist said that an electric toothbrush would help (along with more regular flossing and rinsing).  I did like this product, the brush heads were a good size and the battery kept a charge for several weeks.  But, the two year warranty ended 3 months ago and all of a sudden the battery died.  Since it&#x27;s a recharchable lithiom ion battery I expected better longevity, especially for an investment of over $100.  It&#x27;s obvious that this product was made to last only until the warranty expires, then you have to shell out another $100.  Wooo capitalism.....</li>
            <li> My dentist likes the condition of my teeth &amp; gums, so it works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The switch on the UV sanitizer failed on my old one after 7 or 8 years, so I bought another.  New motor is a bit quieter than the old one.</li>
            <li> She used the teeth whitning and stated that is was terrific.  I do not own one, but perhaps it is time I got one as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in July, 2011. Within a year it started to vibrate slowly, and now it turns on and off automatically. It is very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worse part is that the 2-year warranty, advertised in the description, cannot be verified unless one keeps the receipt. The agent said: \\&quot;Since, you do not have the reciept I will suggest you to purchase a new unit.\\&quot; I asked why serial number does not suffice, and the agent replied, \\&quot;we only need the reciept to validate the warranty\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously?  Am I expected to pile up receipts from every single purchase that I make?</li>
            <li> not extremely happy about the cost of the refills, that never seem to be on sale. what is up with that?</li>
            <li> Died on me after 3 years of use.....Worked well when it worked but I had on older Sonicare that lasted 8 years. When you pay $125 for a toothbrush you expect to get more than just 2-3 years out of it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Phillips Sonicare RS930. This product exceeds my expectations and really does a good job cleaning your teeth. I will purchase a third Sonicare when I&#x27;m ready to replace this Sonicare.</li>
            <li> really makes your mouth feel clean! Will never go back to regular toothbrushes again! Great dental checkups as well :)</li>
            <li> This one seems to be a good toothbrush, better than the Sonicare of 4 years ago.  My old one did not completely wear out, but it had started having less power.  The brushes for the new one do a beter job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush ever!  I love how clean your mouth feels after you use it!  The price was also fantastic compared to other sites.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I bought. It broke due to my own clumsiness. I dropped the rechargeable handle once on a carpeted bathroom floor and the metal prong to which you attach the toothbrush head was never the same afterward. I bought the same model as I had before, though I probably could have gotten a cheaper one. We wanted the ability to \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the brush heads in the little capsule but honestly, I have no idea if that makes much of a difference at all. All I know is, a pretty blue light comes on when you hit the button. For all we know, it&#x27;s a waste of money to spring for that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt this system has made a difference in our family&#x27;s dental checkups, but I want to warn you how delicate the unit is. Don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
            <li> My Sonicare FlexCare RS930 broke only after 1 year and 5 month use.  That is unacceptable for such an expensive product.  I was expecting to get at least 2-3 years of usage before replacing it.  The problem I experienced with this newer unit is the battery says full charge and it is running but the brush is not vibrating as did before.  My guess is an internal part broke that connects the motor to brush shaft.  Anyhow, it is a piece of crap!  Do not purchase this product if you want something to last more than 2 year or so.  Purchase the older model if you still want a Sonicare after reading our reviews.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and her mouth hasn&#x27;t gotten any cleaner. She still cusses like a sailor. It certainly operates as intended mechanically. I guess I just expected it to have her talking properly after a few sessions. I&#x27;ll give it a few more and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in February 2011 and it just died today. I primarily kept it in the shower mostly out of the water&#x27;s reach and it did fine up until now. It was an awesome product, just sucks I gotta blow another $100+ on another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Sonicare from my dentist, many years ago.  After sometime, it stopped working so I call Philips.  They sent me a new one and requested that I send my old unit back.  I did that.  The other night, the toothbrush started buzzing all by itself.  I carefully cleaned it and it was fine.  It turned itself on again today.  I called Philips.  It seems that since I did not register it, although I thought I did and that I don&#x27;t have a three year old receipt, they told me to buy another one at Target or Walmart. They will not back their product in spite of the fact that the issue of turning itself on is well founded on the Internet. I was told by the representative that my model is out of warrenty....it is an older model and it may have been damaged by sudden power surges one experiences in a storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I just purchased seven new brushes for this toothbrush and now have to either buy another one at Target, Walmart or Amazon or throw my money out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think long and hard about purchasing this toothbrush AND keep your receipt AND register it. Funny how Philips has no record of my previous exchange even thought it only happen about two years ago. So, even if one keeps the receipt and registers the producy I doubt Philips would back their product even if you have all the supporting evidence.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Sonicare brushes.  As I get older I find the superior dental care I get especially important.</li>
            <li> Purchased just over 3 years ago.  Used appropriately during that time...never dropped or abused.  All of a sudden, it turns on and off by itself...day or night...on or off the charger.  Spoke with Philips...nothing they can do, it&#x27;s out of warranty (2 year warranty).  Rep \\&quot;requested\\&quot; I purchase a new one.  However, I can&#x27;t dish out another $130 for a toothbrush that only lasted a short bit past the warranty period.  I am of the opinion, it should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I purchase this item February 2010.  I just noticed I never left a review.  I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!  I still have it, all works great!  Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s lasted 5 years without any issues!  I have only had to replace the toothbrush heads (of course). I get my teeth cleaned every six months and my dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are (this was after I started using this toothbrush)  For the past 4 years it&#x27;s had double the work.  My husband uses it as well.  There is a spot in the cleaner for two heads.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again!!</li>
            <li> I am on my second Sonicare Flexcare.  The first started running in the middle of the night, within a couple of months.  Since it was under warranty, they replaced.  Now, my second one has started doing the same thing.  I love this brush, but at this cost, I expect a longer life.</li>
            <li> great brushes fit my handle well and are in perfect order.  I prefer Phillips Sonicare toothbrush as it cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush on July 8th, 2012. It worked amazingly for about two years on the dot, then mysteriously started acting crazy. The battery level icon stopped working, so I had no idea when the toothbrush needed to be recharged. No big deal, though. I could just charge it once a week and it would be fine. I guess the toothbrush had other ideas, though, because now it won&#x27;t even turn on when I press the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button. Or sometimes it does turn on, but then it won&#x27;t turn off. It&#x27;s pretty much gone insane, even though I took great care of the handle for the two years I owned it. For nearly $200, I was expecting this toothbrush to last longer than 24 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read some other reviews, you&#x27;ll notice that these toothbrushes quitting after two years is a common occurrence. It&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;re programed to break down after a couple years. Weird...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure where to turn to now. I guess I&#x27;ll have to use a conventional toothbrush like some sort of savage until I figure out what electric toothbrush I should buy next. Hopefully my next one will make it past its toddler years.</li>
            <li> Great results from this toothbrush.  It was recommended by my hygienist.  Just remember to replace the toothbrush heads once every 3 months.</li>
            <li> All that it  was advertised to be and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> Used for a year and then it went out on me. Probably wouldn&#x60;t buy the same brand.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush did wonders for my teeth! I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I kept getting cavities with traditional tooth brushes when I was brushing at least 5 times a day! Starting using this one and not a bad check up since. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had to quit using my brush because the refills were too expensive for my tight budget :( That&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> My wife likes this very much. I still  use the old fashioned tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush less than a year now, and it just started turning off and on randomly by itself.  There&#x27;s no way to make it stop, because you can&#x27;t take the battery out, and pressing the on/off button does not work.  I contacted Philips customer service and they are sending a replacement handle, so at least there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I never cared for the buttons being where they are on the front.  You tend to press them while you&#x27;re using the brush and accidentally change the settings.</li>
            <li> No issues with this particular product per se but I did order another Philips product that broke in about a month and I felt ripped off by Philips.  Not Amazon&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters.  One had plaque buildup under the gum line and a bit of inflammation.  She didn&#x27;t want the dentist to scrape out the plaque knowing it would hurt.  After using this for a few months, the dentist found a great improvement - no need to scrape!</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an old Sonicare I got from Costco, wanting to upgrade the type of brush head. This product is definitely an improvement. It&#x27;s easy to clean, compact and sleek, and very powerful. It took a week or so for my mouth to get used to it but now I can&#x27;t live without it. I love the UV sanitizer, and use it every few days or week. Even though I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s cleaning or protecting from bacteria, it definitely makes me feel that it&#x27;s sanitized. And it&#x27;s great that they have a 30 day guarantee, in case it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I love this. I hate going to the dentist and I hardly ever go, I don&#x27;t floss, I don&#x27;t use mouthwash, and to be honest, I&#x27;m not great about always brushing my teeth before bed. Bad oral hygiene, I know. I&#x27;m not proud of it. However, last time I went to the dentist, which was the first time in 3 years, I got a very clean bill of health, for this first time in my life! He didn&#x27;t believe that I hadn&#x27;t been to a dentist in 3 years. He guessed I had a cleaning 6 months prior, which I definitely did not! It&#x27;s all due to this toothbrush, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this now for a couple years and it&#x27;s been great, no problems, no complaints! The only thing is that you have to be sure to clean the thing every once in a while because it gets kind of gunky, and that gunk is nothing but bacteria. So I wipe it down with some vinegar, and that does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I share this toothbrush with my husband. We just use different heads, and we use the UV sanitizer to sanitize each head after use. The bristles become a little too soft after a while, and then my mouth starts not feeling as clean, and then I know it&#x27;s time to switch it out for a new one. I buy new ones at Costco or on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Sonicare toothbrush and I&#x27;ll  never go back to a regular toothbrush.  I feel like I get a professional cleaning every day.  My 12 yr old daughter recently started using it and her teeth are so white!  I also love the fact that the brush heads stay inside the UV cleaner when not in use, which keeps them clean.  I highly recommend this model in particular and Sonicare in general.</li>
            <li> Teeth are worth the investment in these specialized tools.  I trusted my dentist when he recommended I get one (I didn&#x27;t buy it from him so he did not have much incentive to steer me to this unless it works), and I have seen my mild gingivitis begin to go away since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Terrible customer service and warranty support - brushes failed in under 2 years - but sonicare would not repair - even though i registered the product and gave all supporting documentation. Based on this and current reviews of Oral B being superior in almost every way, we will be switching.  Here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;IY9lC4VK5f0</li>
            <li> When you use it you think you were just at the dentist . Your teeth feel fresh and smooth., just great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sonicare electric toothbrush for more than 10 years. However, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality of this model. The toothbrush started to make lots of noise when turned on and eventually the brush head stopped vibrating.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Noticed my teeth were whiter after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> I recentyl changed over to Sonicare after years using a Braun electric toothbrush.  My dental hygienist recommended the change because she thought I would benefit from the different technology used by Sonicare.  I really like the extra clean feeling on my teeth after using it but it seems to spray a lot of toothpaste and saliva all over my faucet and mirror, even my clothes.  I never had this issue with my Braun and I think it&#x27;s because of the sonic action of the brush.  I also like the feature that santiizes your brush head after use.  Very nice feature and easy to use.  I don&#x27;t use the different settings usually, just stick to the basic settings and don&#x27;t really feel a difference between brushing and massage settings - they feel the same to me.  Overall, very please, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so messy to use.</li>
            <li> My wonderful dental hygienist suggested I get it and it has worked well.  However I am very sad that after 16 months it kinda fell apart.</li>
            <li> I got this in April 2012. Unlike my last Sonicare toothbrush, which lasted over 10 years, this one has been very disappointing.  The battery is not holding charge as it was when I first got it. Now, it turns on by itself like very five minutes.  I am using it as a manual toothbrush.  I am going to file a claim.</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush but gave had quality problems with the handle and they are $70.00 to replace</li>
            <li> Much improved gum health and teeth appearance with the help of this toothbrush. Leaves mouth feeling more clean and all but eliminates tartar build-up. UV sanitizer is nice. Very comfortable grip and long (1-2 weeks) battery life. Only annoyance is that the charging/UV station always makes a slight buzzing sound. I sometimes unplug it or disable that socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also finally got my $10 rebate on this bad boy! 8-12 weeks my a**, try 21 weeks. But hey, better late than never. Just icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  I like it so much that when my first one suddenly stopped working after about 2 years, I had to get another one.  Conventional toothbrushes can&#x27;t come close to the job this thing does.  The only downside is that it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper Sonicare before this, the kind that use the twist on brush heads.  I had liked that significantly more than my old Crest Sprinbrush.  My got old and started leaking, it was gross.  So I got this for Christmas as a replacement.  I love it.  It&#x27;s so much smaller and lighter than my previous brush, which makes it much better to use.  There are tons of different settings (though I only use the standard one) and I always feel fresh and clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love sonic, have owned several of them. I am disappointed with this model because the UV thing stopped working after a month. Not acceptable for how expensive it was. The toothbrush itself is great. Don&#x27;t know if we just got a lemon, or if it&#x27;s a bad design. I have a separate UV disinfectant unit that came with my sonic are toothbrush. It&#x27;s quite a bit larger and bulkier but its going strong after 2 or 3 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last July and love the toothbrush, however, I&#x27;ve had issues with the sanitizer not working.  It worked at first and then stopped.  Called customer care and after making me take the bulb out (not that easy!) and replace it, it didn&#x27;t solve the problem so they sent me a replacement bulb.  After receiving a new replacement bulb from Philips, the sanitizer worked for a period of time and then stopped again.  Called customer care again and they sent a new base.  That worked for a period and then again...stopped!  They are now sending me a new base - again!  Customer care recommended that I not use the sanitizer daily this time.  Couldn&#x27;t believe it.  They asked if I had been going through brush heads \\&quot;like crazy\\&quot;.  My answer was \\&quot;no\\&quot; that I replace them every 3 months as recommended on their packaging for the replacement brushes!!!  We&#x27;ll see this 3rd go around, but seems like a manufacturing defect to me.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had Sonicare toothbrushes for years - but I really love this one.  It cleans the toothbrushes as well, keeping everything sanitary.  Just wish it came with an extra head, which we had to buy separately.  Otherwise, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  I have no problem spending money on this unit every 3 years. You can&#x27;t put a price on oral hygiene!</li>
            <li> Almost half a decade and still going strong!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has greatly improved my oral care and has made a big difference in my gum health.  This is my second sonicare and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
