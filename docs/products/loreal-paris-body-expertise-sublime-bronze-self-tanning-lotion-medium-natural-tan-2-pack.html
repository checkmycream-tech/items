            <li>Be sure to use moisturizer on your hands &amp; feet and around cuticles if you want to eliminate darker, unnatural areas.  </li>
            <li>I love this self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>I do wish more stores would carry this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Loreal!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair</li>
            <li>It is incredibly greasy and did not give me color at all like my other self tanners.  </li>
            <li>I am just careful not to get any buildup in or around my eyebrows and it works great.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice looking natural tan without being too tan.</li>
            <li>very good product, is just the smell of the cream is not very nice.</li>
            <li>The lotion smoothes on quick.  </li>
            <li>but it does work quickly, even for someone with</li>
            <li>Even so, it is extremely rare for me to notice any kind of self tanner \\&quot;bloopers\\&quot; such as streaks or distinct lines.</li>
            <li>The FRESH SCENT makes you smell like laundry soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, I am often in a hurry after my shower and put this stuff on in a rush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years mostly as a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I specifically asked for the version with SPF 15 or higher.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and have used for years.</li>
            <li>I apply a light cost for just a bit of natural looking color.</li>
            <li>I had previously used the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze self-tanning gel, which came in a tube and left your skin feeling rather sticky all day, not to mention the sparkles which turned you into Edward Cullen in bright light.  </li>
            <li>Let it dry and be sure and not get too much on the ankle bone.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion, but it was two - FIVE OUNCE bottles - not 6.7 ounces like the original bottles I have gotten in the past.  </li>
            <li>not so much.  </li>
            <li>Use it to tan my legs, easy to apply as long a directions followed.  </li>
            <li>I know it is not advertised for use on the face and they have other \\&quot;special\\&quot; products advertised for that specific use, but I just put this right on my face and it is fine!</li>
            <li>Paris Body expertise Sublime Bronze really provides a natural tan!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
            <li>The color can be a little orange-ish, but I have yet to find a better self-tanner than this one.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well but after a few days turns orange.</li>

            <li> I love this self tanner and I have tried many. First of all, I am often in a hurry after my shower and put this stuff on in a rush. Even so, it is extremely rare for me to notice any kind of self tanner \\&quot;bloopers\\&quot; such as streaks or distinct lines. The color is somewhat subtle for a single application, but if you use it a few days in a row, the color will deepen. I love, love, love the fact that this self tanner has SPF 15. The color helps reduce the temptation to ruin my skin in the sun and the spf it contains seals the deal! I put it on before a day in the sun and I am done! I know it is not advertised for use on the face and they have other \\&quot;special\\&quot; products advertised for that specific use, but I just put this right on my face and it is fine! I rub it in evenly all over my face just like I would moisturizer. I am just careful not to get any buildup in or around my eyebrows and it works great. As I said it is pretty subtle color. I will warn you that the color does rub off a bit on white undergarments or sports socks, but the color comes off in the wash for me. I like the fragrance and it is a good moisturizer as well. There you have it; a value priced self tanner that also replaces your sunblock and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great service and a real good price. The product gives you a tan and does not have the make believe appearance.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find a tanner that doesn&#x27;t make you orange but this was nice. price was better than dept stores. don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands!</li>
            <li> Takes a while to dry, color is on the orange side. Careful wearing white, sweating or getting busy with your partner.</li>
            <li> Actually I look like a golden-baked ham....or maybe a Butterball turkey. Hahahahahhaha.....hey this stufff works and it works quick!!!! Anyone need a race change?????? Thanks Loreal!!!! I&#x27;m ready for the beach!!!...and the pools, the modeling contests, the best tan contests, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years mostly as a sunscreen.  This year I started using it about 2weeks before a vacation in the sun.  I had color that looked natural first day in the sun, did not sunburn at all and continued to deepen my base as my week in the sun went on.  Love this product.  Be sure to use moisturizer on your hands &amp; feet and around cuticles if you want to eliminate darker, unnatural areas.  You&#x27;ll never use a tanning bed again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I am happy to be able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable priced and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well but after a few days turns orange.</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner.  It combines sunscreen with self-tanner, so you can put it on before you go in the sun for an even tan.  The color can be a little orange-ish, but I have yet to find a better self-tanner than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair so I try and stay out of the sun as much as possible. I mix this with a little baby oil and put it on my legs. Let it dry and be sure and not get too much on the ankle bone. It gives me a nice looking natural tan without being too tan. I re-apply it a couple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the spray of this one doesn&#x27;t work too well and runs quite a bit. I&#x27;m not sure if this has been discontinued because I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer. So, I end up buying it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very good product, is just the smell of the cream is not very nice. Despite this, I also would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that will actually give my skin some color.  I only apply it to my neck every few days in the winter.  It does not streak.  I can not find this product in my small town.  I do wish more stores would carry this product.</li>
            <li> Although this product is one of the best. I specifically asked for the version with SPF 15 or higher. The item showed as being ordered was &amp;#34;with SPF 15&amp;#34; however when it arrived, it was the version with no SPF protection. I will use it but now I have to use another sunscreen with this product. not a savings after the additional purchase of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and have used for years.Gives slight color and sunsreen for daily use in the So. Fla. sun.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze self-tanning gel, which came in a tube and left your skin feeling rather sticky all day, not to mention the sparkles which turned you into Edward Cullen in bright light.  But this lotion is different.  Out of all the self-tanning products I&#x27;ve ever used, this one smells the best.  I would never have applied some of the other stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past before work, but this lotion&#x27;s scent is not noticeable. The lotion smoothes on quick.  It is not a bronzer that makes you look tan the instant you put it on, but it does work quickly, even for someone with pasty, splotchly skin like myself.  The downside is that it does take awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> Use it to tan my legs, easy to apply as long a directions followed.  Never was scented that I know of till this year.  The FRESH SCENT makes you smell like laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second attempt to buy this from Amazon and both times I received something different than I ordered.  No where in product information does it say its now scented.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, but it was two - FIVE OUNCE bottles - not 6.7 ounces like the original bottles I have gotten in the past.  They got me!! They could&#x27;ve been more clear about the size of the bottles.  :(</li>
            <li> Great experience, great product!&lt;br /&gt;Loreal Paris Body expertise Sublime Bronze really provides a natural tan!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it! It gives you a shiny appearance!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Loreal Paris self tanner for years and the price was terrific on Amazon, so I purchased two !  Very happy with the product.  If applied correctly, you cannot tell it is self tanner.  I apply a light cost for just a bit of natural looking color.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to LOVE this product.  I don&#x27;t tan anymore and thought &amp;#34;how perfect, sunscreen AND self tanner&amp;#34;... not so much.  It is incredibly greasy and did not give me color at all like my other self tanners.  Very Sad:(</li>
            <li> Just bought 2 of these for $18 total at local drugstore chain, reg $11.99 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, with the instant color and ability for the color to build day by day. It goes on very easily and does not streak.</li>
