            <li>The shampoo smells pleasant and sweet, sort of reminding me of when I was a kid and not at all overpowering like all the fruity shampoos out there!  </li>
            <li>Excellent natural shampoo.</li>

            <li>So far so great!  </li>

            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky, healthy, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sometimes i don&#x27;t even have to condition, because it leaves my scalp feeling healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li>LOVE...</li>
            <li>LOVE...</li>
            <li>LOVE...</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, shinier, and looks more healthy.</li>
            <li>I needed a good clarifying treatment to strip my hair of all the oil and grime for a fresh slate to work with.</li>
            <li>I can not say much more about this stuff that has not already been said.</li>
            <li>It smells great and really nourishes my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, and I buy it all the time.  </li>
            <li>Favorite hair products</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I like the organic root stimulator line of products and I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo, but I tried same brand of conditioner and didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>However, because they are both so cheap, really consider both of them - they are such such suchhhh a great investment! :D</li>
            <li>Love how my hair feels after shampooing with this product, shiny and full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt better and i&#x27;m not insecure about my hair anymore!   </li>
            <li>Its such a great buy.</li>
            <li>i combined this with the conditioner and every wash is as great as the last</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even good on natural hair.</li>
            <li>this shampoo smells really good and left my scalp feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>it is so moisturizing has a real nice slip from any other shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li>she loved that this left her hair feeling moisturized and her ends smelling great HOWEVER, by no means is this a clarifying or deep cleaning shampoo.</li>
            <li>And the first time I went to have my hair cut after I started using this, my hair dresser commented on how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li>Great for the dry hair.  </li>
            <li>nice scent not heavy working well for us !</li>
            <li>and now I got a true organic (non sulfate) shampoo and night and day difference compared to this \\&quot;Organic Olive Oil\\&quot; stuff.</li>
            <li>So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>being said, this is nice shampoo at a modest price.</li>
            <li>My relaxed hair has improved tremendously because of it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve found Organic Olive Oil products to give the best results for my coarse, dry and hard to manage hair because the proof is &amp;#34;in the pudding&amp;#34; - clean, healthy and shining easily managed hair that looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>This shampoo unfortunately is not Organic in that sense, It&#x27;s primary ingredient is still sulfate.  </li>
            <li>It certainly added softness and \\&quot;life\\&quot; to me freshly relaxed hair, so when I discovered it was available to buy solo, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>but I can live with that a lot better than with having my hair falling out in clumps.</li>
            <li>I love it and it makes my curls feel really really soft.</li>
            <li>It lost a star because, although it makes my hair soft, I feel like - for something labeled \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; - it could moisturizer a bit better.</li>
            <li>It has such a great smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a softer shampoo for my sensitive scalp and this was not it (better but still not it).      </li>
            <li>It really does improve the condition of your hair and leaves hair feeling nice and soft andhealthy.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful more research will become available to enable informed decisions on purchasing such products.</li>
            <li>It works up an extremely rich lather and has a really clean \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; smell (baby shampoo is the only thing I can think of comparing it to), so I actually enjoy the process of using it on my hair and the hair of others.</li>
            <li>my hair is straighter, more moisturized, there&#x27;s a light pleasant scent instead of a chemical smell and the results last longer (I won&#x27;t name the products because different people get different results).</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair feeling moist and slightly oily (from the olive oil), which is perfect for me, because my hair is super dry!</li>
            <li>I have used a few 2 in one&#x27;s that also helped (about as good as this shampoo) but even staying very hydrated and in good climates here in the NW (not like the dry desert air or anything)</li>
            <li>My hair feel soft, it is easy to manage, curl, straighten -</li>
            <li>I have a wonderful, curly, natural &#x27;do that doesn&#x27;t frizz or poof with every subtle climate change.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to use Head and Shoulders to prevent my scalp from breaking out and every once in a while I try something else to see if it will work.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, not frizzy, but CURLY hair (like locks).  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and bouncy and smooth.</li>
            <li>This thing stripped my hair so much, I couldn&#x27;t wait to put conditioner in my hair!</li>
            <li>I first tried this shampoo as a neutralizer in the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>About two months ago I started using Organic Olive Oil products - starting with the perm which works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before -</li>
            <li>and for me it resulted in noticeable hair growth (I wasn&#x27;t exactly looking for it</li>
            <li>I was really pleased to see it on line at or about the same price I&#x27;d pay in the hair product stores.</li>
            <li>and I need to keep my ends and roots as healthy as possible in between.  </li>
            <li>I will not be supporting them in their trickery.</li>
            <li>but it does leave my hair clean and silky soft.</li>
            <li>There was a noticeable positive result to her hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not expensive and you may be able to find it locally if you live in an ethnically-diverse area.</li>
            <li>I can wash my hair more often without having to worry about it feeling dry and breaking off because of damange.</li>
            <li>These products are pure gold</li>
            <li>If the store has it, you will find it in the &#x27;ethnic hair products&#x27; section of any reasonably large drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started gradually buying other Organic Olive Oil products - with the shampoo my hair is soft, clean and definitely more flake-free than anything else I&#x27;ve used before - ditto for the conditioner that makes</li>
            <li>Not very silky but seemed to leave my hair with more body after drying.  </li>
            <li>There were so so many knots and the texture was rough.    </li>
            <li>Really helps an itchy scalp problem.  </li>
            <li>it has lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate,and a whole slue of additive I can not pronounce.</li>
            <li>I have light brown European hair</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It looks fine, if a bit flat</li>
            <li>this is an old favourite of mine, it leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean, I will definitely recommend ORS products to anyone!</li>
            <li>but I still like this shampoo more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me originally by a lady I met at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I follow up this lather with a basic clean shampoo or my hair</li>
            <li>Helps hair from becoming very dry from chemo</li>
            <li>I would say as a guy it smelled much better than the other normal shampoo and was much easier than the 99c stuff that almost burns as you use it.  </li>
            <li>dry, scaling scalp is your problem, this (+ the conditioner -- really important to use BOTH) is the answer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I used to put it on and dry my hair, but the affect is not as amazing if you put it on, comb it out and let your hair dry by itself!</li>
            <li>I had to use my deva condtioner then shampoo it twice and use the conditioner again with about 5x as much as I normally would just to get the tangles out</li>
            <li>I love it  my hair&#x27;s soft and shiny with minimal conditioner use!!</li>
            <li>In order to really get your scalp clean you have to use quite a bit of product (mom washes hair every other day, not an oily scalp)</li>
            <li>I am 27, male and live in the NW, no i am not a dirty hippy on the organic kick.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my mother who has more course (grey hair) and dry hair</li>
            <li>I have never had so many compliments on my hair before in my life (and I usually get a lot of compliments for my braids).  </li>
            <li>I use a hot oil treatment once per month for deep repair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff -- AND the condition -- stop the fall out instantly, on the first shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy (but not in the good way) and was dry, frizzy, and damaged from bleaching last year to go RED and daily straightening.</li>
            <li>i can feel it clean and not using all the chemicals like other products.</li>
            <li>how soft and manageable my hair was after.  </li>
            <li>In the process, it might not feel soft, however, once you get there..</li>
            <li>It came up when I searched for natural and organic shampoos</li>
            <li>hair is soft, manageable, and noticeably smoother.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy texture that leaves my hair soft and manageable after every wash.</li>
            <li>but I never seem to find one that made my hair feel soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>shampoo and its matching conditioner are the ONLY products I have found that really truly keep my hair on my head and not in my comb, brush, or bathroom drain.</li>
            <li>i love this shampoo my hair has grow thick and its getting longer</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and I used the deep conditioner right after.</li>
            <li>By the time I was 15 years old, I learned to braid my hair myself (to save money) and either wore braids or shaved my hair super short, because those were the only ways I could quickly manage my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li>One drawback though is that it does tend to leave the hair a bit dry, which can be fixed by using a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li>This came highly recommended on transitioning sites, as I&#x27;m trying to transition from relaxed to natural african american hair.</li>
            <li>The total situation is this: I have had a really sensitive scalp since forever.  </li>
            <li>Normally they tend to dry out my hair</li>
            <li>I am typically not a product line user, but this would make the 3rd product I&#x27;ve used by ORS</li>
            <li>Due to lack of regulation on organic or green commercial products, it&#x27;s quite easy for manufacturers to greenwash their products and mislead consumers.</li>
            <li>and I work it into my ends before either letting it dry naturally or blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of perming products as well as a variety of shampoos and conditioners - in fact at this very moment I have five or six different shampoos and probably even more conditioner brands that I used interchangeably - which is a bad idea because using that many different products is only making things worse.</li>
            <li>Very potent--a little lathers a lot.</li>
            <li>Her hair is straight and sometimes a little wavy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love how my hair feels after shampooing with this product, shiny and full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt better and i&#x27;m not insecure about my hair anymore!   </li>
            <li> Its such a great buy.</li>
            <li> i combined this with the conditioner and every wash is as great as the last</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even good on natural hair.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells really good and left my scalp feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> it is so moisturizing has a real nice slip from any other shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li> she loved that this left her hair feeling moisturized and her ends smelling great HOWEVER, by no means is this a clarifying or deep cleaning shampoo.</li>
            <li> And the first time I went to have my hair cut after I started using this, my hair dresser commented on how healthy my hair was.</li>
            <li> Great for the dry hair.  </li>
            <li> nice scent not heavy working well for us !</li>
            <li> and now I got a true organic (non sulfate) shampoo and night and day difference compared to this \\&quot;Organic Olive Oil\\&quot; stuff.</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> being said, this is nice shampoo at a modest price.</li>
            <li> My relaxed hair has improved tremendously because of it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve found Organic Olive Oil products to give the best results for my coarse, dry and hard to manage hair because the proof is &amp;#34;in the pudding&amp;#34; - clean, healthy and shining easily managed hair that looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> This shampoo unfortunately is not Organic in that sense, It&#x27;s primary ingredient is still sulfate.  </li>
            <li> It certainly added softness and \\&quot;life\\&quot; to me freshly relaxed hair, so when I discovered it was available to buy solo, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> but I can live with that a lot better than with having my hair falling out in clumps.</li>
            <li> I love it and it makes my curls feel really really soft.</li>
            <li> It lost a star because, although it makes my hair soft, I feel like - for something labeled \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; - it could moisturizer a bit better.</li>
            <li> It has such a great smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a softer shampoo for my sensitive scalp and this was not it (better but still not it).      </li>
            <li> It really does improve the condition of your hair and leaves hair feeling nice and soft andhealthy.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful more research will become available to enable informed decisions on purchasing such products.</li>
            <li> It works up an extremely rich lather and has a really clean \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; smell (baby shampoo is the only thing I can think of comparing it to), so I actually enjoy the process of using it on my hair and the hair of others.</li>
            <li> my hair is straighter, more moisturized, there&#x27;s a light pleasant scent instead of a chemical smell and the results last longer (I won&#x27;t name the products because different people get different results).</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair feeling moist and slightly oily (from the olive oil), which is perfect for me, because my hair is super dry!</li>
            <li> I have used a few 2 in one&#x27;s that also helped (about as good as this shampoo) but even staying very hydrated and in good climates here in the NW (not like the dry desert air or anything)</li>
            <li> My hair feel soft, it is easy to manage, curl, straighten -</li>
            <li> I have a wonderful, curly, natural &#x27;do that doesn&#x27;t frizz or poof with every subtle climate change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use Head and Shoulders to prevent my scalp from breaking out and every once in a while I try something else to see if it will work.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, not frizzy, but CURLY hair (like locks).  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and bouncy and smooth.</li>
            <li> This thing stripped my hair so much, I couldn&#x27;t wait to put conditioner in my hair!</li>
            <li> I first tried this shampoo as a neutralizer in the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> About two months ago I started using Organic Olive Oil products - starting with the perm which works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before -</li>
            <li> and for me it resulted in noticeable hair growth (I wasn&#x27;t exactly looking for it</li>
            <li> I was really pleased to see it on line at or about the same price I&#x27;d pay in the hair product stores.</li>
            <li> and I need to keep my ends and roots as healthy as possible in between.  </li>
            <li> I will not be supporting them in their trickery.</li>
            <li> but it does leave my hair clean and silky soft.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable positive result to her hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not expensive and you may be able to find it locally if you live in an ethnically-diverse area.</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair more often without having to worry about it feeling dry and breaking off because of damange.</li>
            <li> These products are pure gold</li>
            <li> If the store has it, you will find it in the &#x27;ethnic hair products&#x27; section of any reasonably large drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started gradually buying other Organic Olive Oil products - with the shampoo my hair is soft, clean and definitely more flake-free than anything else I&#x27;ve used before - ditto for the conditioner that makes</li>
            <li> Not very silky but seemed to leave my hair with more body after drying.  </li>
            <li> There were so so many knots and the texture was rough.    </li>
            <li> Really helps an itchy scalp problem.  </li>
            <li> it has lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate,and a whole slue of additive I can not pronounce.</li>
            <li> I have light brown European hair</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It looks fine, if a bit flat</li>
            <li> this is an old favourite of mine, it leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean, I will definitely recommend ORS products to anyone!</li>
            <li> but I still like this shampoo more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me originally by a lady I met at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I follow up this lather with a basic clean shampoo or my hair</li>
            <li> Helps hair from becoming very dry from chemo</li>
            <li> I would say as a guy it smelled much better than the other normal shampoo and was much easier than the 99c stuff that almost burns as you use it.  </li>
            <li> dry, scaling scalp is your problem, this (+ the conditioner -- really important to use BOTH) is the answer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to put it on and dry my hair, but the affect is not as amazing if you put it on, comb it out and let your hair dry by itself!</li>
            <li> I had to use my deva condtioner then shampoo it twice and use the conditioner again with about 5x as much as I normally would just to get the tangles out</li>
            <li> I love it  my hair&#x27;s soft and shiny with minimal conditioner use!!</li>
            <li> In order to really get your scalp clean you have to use quite a bit of product (mom washes hair every other day, not an oily scalp)</li>
            <li> I am 27, male and live in the NW, no i am not a dirty hippy on the organic kick.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother who has more course (grey hair) and dry hair</li>
            <li> I have never had so many compliments on my hair before in my life (and I usually get a lot of compliments for my braids).  </li>
            <li> I use a hot oil treatment once per month for deep repair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff -- AND the condition -- stop the fall out instantly, on the first shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy (but not in the good way) and was dry, frizzy, and damaged from bleaching last year to go RED and daily straightening.</li>
            <li> i can feel it clean and not using all the chemicals like other products.</li>
            <li> how soft and manageable my hair was after.  </li>
            <li> In the process, it might not feel soft, however, once you get there..</li>
            <li> It came up when I searched for natural and organic shampoos</li>
            <li> hair is soft, manageable, and noticeably smoother.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy texture that leaves my hair soft and manageable after every wash.</li>
            <li> but I never seem to find one that made my hair feel soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> shampoo and its matching conditioner are the ONLY products I have found that really truly keep my hair on my head and not in my comb, brush, or bathroom drain.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo my hair has grow thick and its getting longer</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and I used the deep conditioner right after.</li>
            <li> By the time I was 15 years old, I learned to braid my hair myself (to save money) and either wore braids or shaved my hair super short, because those were the only ways I could quickly manage my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> One drawback though is that it does tend to leave the hair a bit dry, which can be fixed by using a decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended on transitioning sites, as I&#x27;m trying to transition from relaxed to natural african american hair.</li>
            <li> The total situation is this: I have had a really sensitive scalp since forever.  </li>
            <li> Normally they tend to dry out my hair</li>
            <li> I am typically not a product line user, but this would make the 3rd product I&#x27;ve used by ORS</li>
            <li> Due to lack of regulation on organic or green commercial products, it&#x27;s quite easy for manufacturers to greenwash their products and mislead consumers.</li>
            <li> and I work it into my ends before either letting it dry naturally or blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of perming products as well as a variety of shampoos and conditioners - in fact at this very moment I have five or six different shampoos and probably even more conditioner brands that I used interchangeably - which is a bad idea because using that many different products is only making things worse.</li>
            <li> Very potent--a little lathers a lot.</li>
            <li> Her hair is straight and sometimes a little wavy.  </li>
            <li> Being a mixed girl (african american and white)I have always had a hard time finding the right shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural, black hair.</li>
            <li> Actually, I wish these folks made a bath product because all of me is dry and scaly, not just</li>
            <li> It totally works as long as the problem is dry scaly scalp and not something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, and this is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.  </li>
            <li> has always bought hair products for white people, but they leave my hair very dry and unmanagable.</li>
            <li> I have begun using the Olive Oil products trying to thicken my hair after major hair loss inthe last few years.  </li>
            <li> From sampling several types, it was suggested to go organic, the reason is the sulfates within normal shampoos commonly causes scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of experience with various dandruff shampoos, with minimal help.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this shampoo for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> frizzy, dry, split ends, overall rough feeling when touched.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve even read reviews from people of other ethnic backgrounds raving about the products, so DEFINITELY try them!  </li>
            <li> Had dry scalp before, now its all gone...</li>
            <li> Also the idea of washing your hair with a vegetable oil product makes sense; oil dissolves oil and takes away scalp build-up, but doesn&#x27;t strip you completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I sufffer from seriously dry scaly scalp.</li>
            <li> It also has an amazing lather, no matter how dirty your hair is!  </li>
            <li> I used this and afterward my hair was extremely tangled, actually matted, it left my hair a matted mess -</li>
            <li> This translates into 4,500 calories of olive oil or twice the average daily intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This left my hair a little rough feeling, even when it was being shampooed.  </li>
            <li> Other shampoos leave my hair dry and straw-like unless I follow it with loads of conditioner.</li>
            <li> shampoo has a pleasantly fresh \\&quot;green apple\\&quot; type of smell, and it&#x27;s also very thick and creamy, just as the name states.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t in the worst condition it has ever experienced</li>
            <li> Granted I have terrible frizz and had to use some additional product, but this shampoo gave me a great canvas to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it in the store a few years back and couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
            <li> and my hair still felt rough.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; state of my hair is coarse and dry - and perming for the past 25 years or so has made my hair drier and harder to manage.</li>
            <li> It was too thin and once my natural frizz started to come back, my hair was harder than ever!</li>
            <li> The other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried leave my hair frizzy or too oily.</li>
            <li> this shampoo i have always used i wouldnt want to use any other</li>
            <li> I am a white woman with thin, coarse hair (I know, an oxymoron).</li>
            <li> This stuff was great; it clarified my hair well without causing it to tangle horribly (washed in sections!), and my hair wasn&#x27;t as dried out as it could of been.</li>
            <li> I think the key thing is to stick with it for at least 3 months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I washed with it after taking a set of twists down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years will not wash my hair in any other shampoo.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> my hair softer, less tangled and easier to comb after shampooing - plus less tangles makes it easier to style</li>
            <li> and I lose less hair.  </li>
            <li> My little niece started using this on the recommendation of another aunt.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave one star is because the zero option is not available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the moisturing products a few months now too</li>
            <li> you have curly, dry, thick hair, then you need serious moisture.</li>
            <li> there are several versions but the base word is \\&quot;sulfate\\&quot; and if you are like me with a sensitive scalp and nothing seems to help this is not going to help you out at all.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks i saw the results!</li>
            <li> I usually follow it up with another fave [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My hair felt brittle and looked dull.</li>
            <li> I am skipping any trims or haircuts for at least 6 months at a time</li>
            <li> Lately I have become a fan of all products that incorporate olive oil.  </li>
            <li> &quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that the product is truly organic.</li>
            <li> The word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean that this product is organic.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff, I threw the new bottle away.</li>
            <li> so then I used the conditioner and it was worse -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is thick and almost impossible to damage, it just won&#x27;t curl, won&#x27;t straighten--</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my scalp didn&#x27;t do so well.</li>
            <li> Doing this made my hair really difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of expensive products.</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t like them (HIGHLY UNLIKELY), you will not have even lost $10; you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I do keep another shampoo for when I&#x27;ve had an especially hard workout, its been a couple days since I&#x27;ve washed my hair, etc and have a lot of oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> It has bad ingredients...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SHOCKED</li>
            <li> Terrible smell and bad feel on hair after rinse.</li>
            <li> The worst thing i did to my hair was relax it.  </li>
            <li> Dreadful nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> The worst shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have not used it yet since I wanted to finish the bottle of shampoo I was already using when I purchased this Olive oil one.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and in perfect condition.  Smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am an African American who has struggled with unmanagable hair all of my life.  Although my hair is thick and almost impossible to damage, it just won&#x27;t curl, won&#x27;t straighten--basically won&#x27;t do anything but poof and take years (and cost hundreds of dollars) to braid.  By the time I was 15 years old, I learned to braid my hair myself (to save money) and either wore braids or shaved my hair super short, because those were the only ways I could quickly manage my hair everyday.  I was given some of O.R.S.&#x27;s olive oil samples at a beauty supply store while buying extensions to braid my hair one day.  On a whim, I decided to wash, condition, and moisturize my hair with only the olive oil samples.  I was AMAZED at how soft and manageable my hair was after.  I decided to add a dab of curling mousse just to see what would happen, and I haven&#x27;t braided my hair sense.  I have a wonderful, curly, natural &#x27;do that doesn&#x27;t frizz or poof with every subtle climate change.  I have never had so many compliments on my hair before in my life (and I usually get a lot of compliments for my braids).  These products are pure gold AND they&#x27;re so reasonsably-priced!  I&#x27;m not realy one to suggest beauty products to my friends and family because I feel like everyone is different and different things work for different people, but I haven&#x27;t met a person yet who couldn&#x27;t use SOME organic root stimulator hair product. I&#x27;ve told all of my friends and family about them, and everyone who has tried the products have loved them.  They work on all kinds of African American hair--natural, relaxed, texturized, even curl-perms.  And I&#x27;ve even read reviews from people of other ethnic backgrounds raving about the products, so DEFINITELY try them!  And if you don&#x27;t like them (HIGHLY UNLIKELY), you will not have even lost $10; you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> i like this shampoo.  it is very good and keeps my hair from drying out</li>
            <li> This is great and healthy for my hair.  I love it and it makes my curls feel really really soft.</li>
            <li> This left my hair a little rough feeling, even when it was being shampooed.  Not very silky but seemed to leave my hair with more body after drying.  I would definitely do a good conditioner afterwards though to keep the hair healthy in case.</li>
            <li> I am typically not a product line user, but this would make the 3rd product I&#x27;ve used by ORS and I love it! I bought the pack though to ensure I would like it, but once the pack runs out I will invest in the actual bottle. I had a lot of product build up on my hair and it cleaned everything away! It left my hair feeling soft and I used the deep conditioner right after. My hair feels like silk!</li>
            <li> This was a great shampoo with the proper lather, wonderful smell and really moisturized my hair. It left my hair soft and healthy looking. Unfortunately my scalp didn&#x27;t do so well. I&#x27;ve only been able to use Head and Shoulders to prevent my scalp from breaking out and every once in a while I try something else to see if it will work. This didn&#x27;t do it, but if you don&#x27;t have that problem, this shampoo would be great. This came highly recommended on transitioning sites, as I&#x27;m trying to transition from relaxed to natural african american hair.</li>
            <li> Ever since i was born, my hair has been frizzy and kinda gross.  The worst thing i did to my hair was relax it.  Doing this made my hair really difficult to manage.  It was too thin and once my natural frizz started to come back, my hair was harder than ever! There were so so many knots and the texture was rough.    I took a chance at this aloe shampoo which i got from walgreens.  It is amazing! After a few weeks i saw the results! Soft, smooth, not frizzy, but CURLY hair (like locks).  It was great! I&#x27;ve never felt better and i&#x27;m not insecure about my hair anymore!   I think the key thing is to stick with it for at least 3 months.  Let your hair get used to this shampoo.  In the process, it might not feel soft, however, once you get there..youll feel great!   What i suggest is that you get the leave on conditioner as well! I used to put it on and dry my hair, but the affect is not as amazing if you put it on, comb it out and let your hair dry by itself! I haven&#x27;t used the shampoo without the leave on conditioner so i dont know if just the shampoo will do the trick! However, because they are both so cheap, really consider both of them - they are such such suchhhh a great investment! :D</li>
            <li> The name shouts the word \\&quot;organic\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that the product is truly organic. The shampoo contains paraben, which is carcinogenic, and SLS, which is a skin irritant and a probable carcinogen. Due to lack of regulation on organic or green commercial products, it&#x27;s quite easy for manufacturers to greenwash their products and mislead consumers. We&#x27;ll just have to watch out for ourselves!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I bought it in the store a few years back and couldn&#x27;t find it again. It leaves my hair soft and bouncy and smooth. The other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried leave my hair frizzy or too oily. The delivery was on time and the price lower than my local store had it.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave one star is because the zero option is not available. This thing stripped my hair so much, I couldn&#x27;t wait to put conditioner in my hair! I have natural, black hair.</li>
            <li> I first tried this shampoo as a neutralizer in the [[ASIN:B000EH4TLK Organic R/s Root Stimulator Olive Oil No-lye Relaxer Extra Strength Kit]]. It certainly added softness and \\&quot;life\\&quot; to me freshly relaxed hair, so when I discovered it was available to buy solo, I was excited.  It works wonders on my hair weeks post relaxer as well. It&#x27;s even good on natural hair. It works up an extremely rich lather and has a really clean \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; smell (baby shampoo is the only thing I can think of comparing it to), so I actually enjoy the process of using it on my hair and the hair of others. I feel like it makes my hair great and look healthy. My hair isn&#x27;t in the worst condition it has ever experienced but I still like this shampoo more than any other I&#x27;ve tried. I think it stabilizes my hairs health. It lost a star because, although it makes my hair soft, I feel like - for something labeled \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; - it could moisturizer a bit better. I usually follow it up with another fave [[ASIN:B000RBUMR8 Organic Root Stimulator Hair Lotion, Olive Oil Moisturizing, 8.5 oz.]] to combat dryness.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and this product actually softens my hair when i use it. Ive never used a shampoo that softens my hair. Normally they tend to dry out my hair but this one does the opposite. I love the smell of this shampoo and the color makes it look like candy lol. Anyway, i pair this up with the replenishing conditioner and it works wonders for me. Its such a great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It has such a great smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny. I will keep this shampoo around. :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the price is awesome for the quality of the product. I didn&#x27;t have any problem. Thank you seller.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo it leaves my hair nice and smooth i can feel it clean and not using all the chemicals like other products.</li>
            <li> This is NOT organic.  Polyglycol (made by the DOW company) is not organic.  There are a load of synthetic chemicals in this shampoo.  I just bought 4 bottles of this because they do NOT have the synthetic chemical  ingredients listed in the ingredients list on the web page.  Will NEVER buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I just plane didn&#x27;t like the shampoo.  It did clean well, and it smelled good.  I would say as a guy it smelled much better than the other normal shampoo and was much easier than the 99c stuff that almost burns as you use it.  I was looking for a softer shampoo for my sensitive scalp and this was not it (better but still not it).      The total situation is this: I have had a really sensitive scalp since forever.  I am 27, male and live in the NW, no i am not a dirty hippy on the organic kick.  I have lots of experience with various dandruff shampoos, with minimal help.  I have used a few 2 in one&#x27;s that also helped (about as good as this shampoo) but even staying very hydrated and in good climates here in the NW (not like the dry desert air or anything) My scalp gets irritated and becomes a nuisance with both dandruff and itchiness.    From sampling several types, it was suggested to go organic, the reason is the sulfates within normal shampoos commonly causes scalp issues.  This shampoo unfortunately is not Organic in that sense, It&#x27;s primary ingredient is still sulfate.  The solution is to double check ingredients there are several versions but the base word is \\&quot;sulfate\\&quot; and if you are like me with a sensitive scalp and nothing seems to help this is not going to help you out at all.  I used it for 2 weeks and now I got a true organic (non sulfate) shampoo and night and day difference compared to this \\&quot;Organic Olive Oil\\&quot; stuff.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. Other shampoos leave my hair dry and straw-like unless I follow it with loads of conditioner. This shampoo is moisturizing enough to be used with or without a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly, dry, thick hair, then you need serious moisture. This shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky, healthy, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a pleasantly fresh \\&quot;green apple\\&quot; type of smell, and it&#x27;s also very thick and creamy, just as the name states.</li>
            <li> i recommend this to people with dry/damaged hair only! it leaves my hair feeling moist and slightly oily (from the olive oil), which is perfect for me, because my hair is super dry! sometimes i don&#x27;t even have to condition, because it leaves my scalp feeling healthy and nourished. but i recommend the Organic Olive Oil Conditioner by the same seller as well.</li>
            <li> I now swear by the Organic Root Stimulator Line. My relaxed hair has improved tremendously because of it. I especially love this shampoo because it has a rich, creamy lather and leaves my hair great-smelling and healthy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had decided to try the olive oil perm kit 2 weeks ago for the first time and when I discovered this wonderful olive oil shampoo that comes in the kit, oh my god never knew this stuff was that good it is so moisturizing has a real nice slip from any other shampoo I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t offend my allergies. Very potent--a little lathers a lot.</li>
            <li> Really helps an itchy scalp problem.  Lather is luxurious.. Hair feels great.  I follow up this lather with a basic clean shampoo or my hair is too oily.  I like this combination.</li>
            <li> I tried it and found it to be good for lessening entanglement of my hair. I brought only one bottle of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo my hair has grow thick and its getting longer so i had to cut it yesterday</li>
            <li> The word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean that this product is organic. It came up when I searched for natural and organic shampoos so I purchased. It contains paraben, which is carcinogenic, and SLS, which is a skin irritant and a probable carcinogen. I promptly returned it as I definitely won&#x27;t be using this on my children.</li>
            <li> LOVE...LOVE...LOVE...this shampoo really works great!!! Had dry scalp before, now its all gone...i will recommend this product to all of my friends with the same problem...</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; state of my hair is coarse and dry - and perming for the past 25 years or so has made my hair drier and harder to manage. I&#x27;ve used a variety of perming products as well as a variety of shampoos and conditioners - in fact at this very moment I have five or six different shampoos and probably even more conditioner brands that I used interchangeably - which is a bad idea because using that many different products is only making things worse. About two months ago I started using Organic Olive Oil products - starting with the perm which works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before - my hair is straighter, more moisturized, there&#x27;s a light pleasant scent instead of a chemical smell and the results last longer (I won&#x27;t name the products because different people get different results). I started gradually buying other Organic Olive Oil products - with the shampoo my hair is soft, clean and definitely more flake-free than anything else I&#x27;ve used before - ditto for the conditioner that makes my hair softer, less tangled and easier to comb after shampooing - plus less tangles makes it easier to style and I lose less hair.  I&#x27;ve used the moisturing products a few months now too and for me it resulted in noticeable hair growth (I wasn&#x27;t exactly looking for it but I&#x27;ll take it lol).  Overall, I&#x27;ve found Organic Olive Oil products to give the best results for my coarse, dry and hard to manage hair because the proof is &amp;#34;in the pudding&amp;#34; - clean, healthy and shining easily managed hair that looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> no need to use alot, my hair feels amazing. i combined this with the conditioner and every wash is as great as the last</li>
            <li> nice scent not heavy working well for us !</li>
            <li> I am a white woman with thin, coarse hair (I know, an oxymoron). No shampoo/conditioner combo has ever done squat for my hair issues: frizzy, dry, split ends, overall rough feeling when touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was staying with a friend for the weekend and forgot my shampoo, and this was what she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH. MY. GOSH. AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, manageable, and noticeably smoother. Granted I have terrible frizz and had to use some additional product, but this shampoo gave me a great canvas to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to shampoo now. I do keep another shampoo for when I&#x27;ve had an especially hard workout, its been a couple days since I&#x27;ve washed my hair, etc and have a lot of oil in my hair. However, for day to day washing this is what I use.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my hair nicely!</li>
            <li> all i need in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a lie it is not organic it has lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate,and a whole slue of additive I can not pronounce. Don&#x27;t buy, false advertisement. Same on you ORS.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother who has more course (grey hair) and dry hair she loved that this left her hair feeling moisturized and her ends smelling great HOWEVER, by no means is this a clarifying or deep cleaning shampoo. In order to really get your scalp clean you have to use quite a bit of product (mom washes hair every other day, not an oily scalp) so buy at your own discretion.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shampoos and always adds good volume to my hair after using it. Considering I have hair loss and need something good to cover it up, I&#x27;m glad to have found this product! One drawback though is that it does tend to leave the hair a bit dry, which can be fixed by using a decent conditioner. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was staying with a friend who let me use her shampoo....org olive oil, and I fell in love with it, thus ordered my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years will not wash my hair in any other shampoo.&lt;br /&gt; I was really pleased to see it on line at or about the same price I&#x27;d pay in the hair product stores.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Dreadful nasty stuff. I used once and threw the remainder in the trash. Terrible smell and bad feel on hair after rinse.</li>
            <li> Olive oil is a great moisturiser and Aloe stimulates your roots.  Also the idea of washing your hair with a vegetable oil product makes sense; oil dissolves oil and takes away scalp build-up, but doesn&#x27;t strip you completely dry.  I have light brown European hair and I am growing my hair out.  I am skipping any trims or haircuts for at least 6 months at a time and I need to keep my ends and roots as healthy as possible in between.  I use a hot oil treatment once per month for deep repair.  Besides this, I wanted to find a shampoo that would help my hair grow and the ends to stay un-frizzed.  I use this shampoo, alone, without conditioner and when I get out of the shower I use a product called, \\&quot;Roman Oil\\&quot; (but you could use any moisturising after wash treatment - just a pea sized drop and I work it into my ends before either letting it dry naturally or blow-drying.  So far so great!  My hair feels thicker and softer.  The shampoo smells pleasant and sweet, sort of reminding me of when I was a kid and not at all overpowering like all the fruity shampoos out there!  It also has an amazing lather, no matter how dirty your hair is!  I recommend this shampoo to anyone with long-term-long-length hair growing goals!  Keep that hair moisturised and that scalp stimulated!    Facts I&#x27;ve found...    About Aloe for hair:  [...]    About Olive Oil for hair:  [...]    The \\&quot;Roman Oil\\&quot; I was talking about is from \\&quot;UMBERTO Beverly HIlls\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love it  my hair&#x27;s soft and shiny with minimal conditioner use!!</li>
            <li> The worst shampoo ever. I used this and afterward my hair was extremely tangled, actually matted, it left my hair a matted mess - so then I used the conditioner and it was worse - my hair felt hard,dry and the tangles were beyond tangled I had to use my deva condtioner then shampoo it twice and use the conditioner again with about 5x as much as I normally would just to get the tangles out and my hair still felt rough. I put in extra leave in conditioner. I hate this stuff, I threw the new bottle away.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells really good and left my scalp feeling very clean.  for a neutralizing/clarifying shampoo, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair stripped. i will only use this product once a month to remove build up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 yo Caucasian female. My hair is naturally wavy (but not in the good way) and was dry, frizzy, and damaged from bleaching last year to go RED and daily straightening. My hair felt brittle and looked dull. I recived a sample pack of this in the mail and decided to give it a try, even though it is marketed to ethnic hair types. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results after just one use. My hair is softer, shinier, and looks more healthy. It didn&#x27;t leave any oily feeling or residue. I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hair.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this shampoo for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed with it after taking a set of twists down. I needed a good clarifying treatment to strip my hair of all the oil and grime for a fresh slate to work with. This stuff was great; it clarified my hair well without causing it to tangle horribly (washed in sections!), and my hair wasn&#x27;t as dried out as it could of been. The hair definitely needed a deep conditioning afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great for the dry hair.  It is like getting a conditioner in with the shampoo.  Leaves hair shiny and smooth.  A good product.</li>
            <li> I can not say much more about this stuff that has not already been said. It stinks. It has bad ingredients... This company seeks to trick people by using the name \\&quot;organic\\&quot; instead of actually being organic. I will not be supporting them in their trickery. \\&quot;Off to the trash\\&quot;</li>
            <li> this shampoo i have always used i wouldnt want to use any other</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! The lather is pretty good and leaves your hair smelling nice.</li>
            <li> So worth the purchase, it makes your hair so shiny and smooth. It is not heavy and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got course, curly hair and this stuff is wonderful! It smells great and really nourishes my hair. It&#x27;s the only shampoo I&#x27;ve every used that made me consider not using conditioner with it every time. And the first time I went to have my hair cut after I started using this, my hair dresser commented on how healthy my hair was. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo, but I tried same brand of conditioner and didn&#x27;t like it (but didn&#x27;t keep it on my head for 1 hr as was recommended. I would recommend this shampoo to a friend.</li>
            <li> I used this to neutralize my hair and my kids hair. My teenage daughter uses a lot of gel and was developing dandruff because of product buildup. But this shampoo &amp;#34;scraped&amp;#34; away all that gunk .</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, and I buy it all the time.  It has a creamy texture that leaves my hair soft and manageable after every wash. I have very dry hair, and this is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.  I was happy I found it on Amazon where it is way cheaper than buying it at my Sally&#x27;s store.  I will continue to order it here.</li>
            <li> My little niece started using this on the recommendation of another aunt.  Her hair is straight and sometimes a little wavy.  I loved the way her hair looked after she used it along with the shampoo.  There was a noticeable positive result to her hair.  I would recommend this shampoo; as I have been using it about a year with great results.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair products</li>
            <li> great price and great deal</li>
            <li> a very good product  I love it</li>
            <li> I like the organic root stimulator line of products and I love this shampoo. It really does improve the condition of your hair and leaves hair feeling nice and soft andhealthy. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is an old favourite of mine, it leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean, I will definitely recommend ORS products to anyone!</li>
            <li> Being a mixed girl (african american and white)I have always had a hard time finding the right shampoo for my hair. My mom being white- has always bought hair products for white people, but they leave my hair very dry and unmanagable. I have even tried to buy shampoo&#x27;s for afrian hair but I never seem to find one that made my hair feel soft and luscious. My friend offered this product for me to try. She said it would help with my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;  With this product it leaves my hair feeling different than it has ever felt before. My hair feel soft, it is easy to manage, curl, straighten - how ever I want to wear it for the day. I can wash my hair more often without having to worry about it feeling dry and breaking off because of damange. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I sufffer from seriously dry scaly scalp. Big time. Actually, I wish these folks made a bath product because all of me is dry and scaly, not just the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and its matching conditioner are the ONLY products I have found that really truly keep my hair on my head and not in my comb, brush, or bathroom drain. It was recommended to me originally by a lady I met at a local pharmacy. She said her mother swears by it. Now, so do it. It totally works as long as the problem is dry scaly scalp and not something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT talking about regular dandruff. The condition I&#x27;m talking about doesn&#x27;tusually leave flakes on your shoulders. That&#x27;s the problem. The scales stay on your head and block the hair follicles. The result is hair loss. This stuff stops the carnage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does (when used with the matching conditioner) leave your hair a bit lank and feeling over conditioned. It looks fine, if a bit flat but I can live with that a lot better than with having my hair falling out in clumps. This stuff -- AND the condition -- stop the fall out instantly, on the first shampoo and condition. To keep it from recurring, I need to wash and condition my hair about every third day. If I wait longer, my scalp dries out and starts to fall out again. This stuff is not expensive and you may be able to find it locally if you live in an ethnically-diverse area. If the store has it, you will find it in the &#x27;ethnic hair products&#x27; section of any reasonably large drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If dry, scaling scalp is your problem, this (+ the conditioner -- really important to use BOTH) is the answer. I have tried all kinds of expensive products. This one works.</li>
            <li> this shampoo may not be truly organic but it does leave my hair clean and silky soft. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOOKED GOOD FOR THE PRICE THEN READING THROUGH INGREDIENTS I&#x27;M SHOCKED THEY CAN PUT THE WORD \\&quot;ORGANIC\\&quot; ON THE LABEL! G;AD I READ INGREDIENT LIST HERE. HOPE NO ONE GETS FOOLED.</li>
            <li> Helps hair from becoming very dry from chemo</li>
            <li> I have begun using the Olive Oil products trying to thicken my hair after major hair loss inthe last few years.  This product along with the conditioner and lotion has worked miracles.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awful. It left my hair so tangled and matted it took my hair out just to get the knots out.</li>
            <li> Lately I have become a fan of all products that incorporate olive oil.  Recent research suggests a compound in olive oil, oleocanthal, is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase(COX), which would give oleocanthal anti-inflammatory properties. The downside is that you would have to ingest 500 grams of olive oil to get the same effect as one Advil. This translates into 4,500 calories of olive oil or twice the average daily intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is nice shampoo at a modest price. It would be a suitable choice even without concerns about inflammation. I am hopeful more research will become available to enable informed decisions on purchasing such products.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels after shampooing with this product, shiny and full. Perfect suds and my hasir looks and feels so healthy</li>
