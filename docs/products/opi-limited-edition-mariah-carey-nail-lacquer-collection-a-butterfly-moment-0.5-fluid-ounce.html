            <li>I love the color, it&#x27;s almost perfect.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find a nail laquer that is nice and neutral and not too pricey.</li>
            <li>Shimmer is nice</li>
            <li>this is perfect nude pinky bronze color, great for everyday , you can always coat it with some glitter</li>
            <li>The color is very accurate, as show, on the models hand.</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>This is another favorite OPI shade, of mine.</li>
            <li>but I love it by itself</li>
            <li>kind of a golden peachy/pinky beige.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and is long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy more colors when needed.</li>
            <li>As usual, the OPI quality is better than any drug store brand out there, and I&#x27;m really happy to have this shade to play with this summer.</li>
            <li>As usual opi is a great polish.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be pretty, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>Color change under natural light.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller!</li>
            <li>Love this color, soft pink with a goldish hue.</li>
            <li>But the consistency is globby, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly or even out the way my other OPI colors do.</li>
            <li>Most young polish wearers prefer darker shades today, so i had trouble giving it away.  </li>
            <li>This is such a pretty color.</li>
            <li>This wore without peeling, chippping, or wearing, for nearly two weeks.</li>
            <li>A nice, subtle shade, just not for anyone with red skin undertones.</li>
            <li>I do like the color, it&#x27;s a little more sheer than I usually like, but it seemed like it took forever to be shipped.</li>

            <li> Just be careful not to put it on too thick because then it doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> To light looks like my skin tone :/ not good if ur supper pale like me</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> This pink/peach combo has a slight gilt underlay.  </li>
            <li> The color, Buttefly Moment is a neutral color witha little kick.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find this color at my local stores.  </li>
