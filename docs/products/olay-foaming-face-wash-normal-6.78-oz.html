            <li>Love the subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li>so I ordered 6 more bottles.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my face very clean feeling either.</li>
            <li>great deal, but the product is ok, not as good as other brands.  </li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy that I can use this every day, its gentle and smells great, and cleans my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this, good value that works well- a new beauty favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this lightly scented face wash and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>So far this one has been great for me.</li>
            <li>The pump is easy to use and dispense what you need.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feel after using it.</li>
            <li>This arrived well packaged and very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy with the pump.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it with a Buf Puf facial sponge and it works great.</li>
            <li>I assumed that this product was fragrant free.  </li>
            <li>If the label stated not fragrant free, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and hope it is always available.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy washing my face with this product, and it removes make up well.</li>
            <li>It also has a light baby powder scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice cleanser , I have tried better though , only downside is that it needs more product than I am used to , to get my face fully clean .</li>
            <li>The scent was nice but very strong and initially my skin took the change well.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel like my skin is clean.  </li>
            <li>As I wrote above, I have used various \\&quot;top end\\&quot; cleansers, and this is as good or better than most.</li>
            <li>Face feels silky and clean after use.</li>
            <li>Even though this particular formula is &#x27;normal&#x27;, it&#x27;s perfect for my rather sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is not that great like the other olay products..</li>
            <li>Even though it is mild, it still bothered me; and I cannot use it.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with my initial purchase</li>
            <li>powerful yet gentle cleanser helps your skin retain its own natural moisture with oil-free conditioners...</li>
            <li>Now I am waiting for the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System which is a rotating face brush that does more of a deep wash.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so clean, soft and smooth; my husband loves to touch my face.  </li>
            <li>Gently cleans your face leaving it feeling clean with a gentle clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>Feels very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on sking.</li>
            <li>but it might fit other peoples&#x27; skin better than mine.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future!!</li>
            <li>Actually, like most people, I have a combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>My go-to face wash and the price is better than anyplace local.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my face feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I definitely still need to use a makeup remover first, but this provides a good clean feel without being harsh.</li>
            <li>It cleans quickly, but is not harsh and I can see and feel the difference after using it.</li>
            <li>, little goes a long way, and I think it&#x27;s more effective than my trusty cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>Since the bottle is not water-proof after being opened, leaking might also be a problem if the bottle fell over, but that&#x27;s never happened to me and is purely conjecture on my part.</li>
            <li>Smooth over your entire face and rinse very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>This product washes away makeup and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing on my face.</li>
            <li>and I really llike the job that it does without drying out the skin.</li>
            <li>This face wash is gentle and cleanses thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I also encouraged my daughter to start using it, because it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>I hoped for a better result with an Olay product, but it does clean and I use a Clarisonic after I get the initial makeup off, but there seems to always be a dry soapy feel to my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li>It is very economical to use because only one or two pumps would create a lot bubbles.  </li>
            <li>After reading positive reviews about Olay Normal Foaming Face Wash, I decided to try it</li>
            <li>This product goes on gritty and did not leave my face refreshed or clean.  </li>
            <li>As long as I&#x27;m careful not to use this in the drier areas, I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clean but without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, and I use it at night in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>This one on the other hand makes my face feel clean and ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched from fancy moisturizers to Olay moisturizing lotions after the lady at Sephora told me a no frills basic would do the job just fine at my age.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>This is my first facial wash from olay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Wanted the sensitive which was sold out so opted for normal.  </li>
            <li>This is my third purchase of this brand of facial wash, it cleans well without over drying, it leaves my face with a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This item is used by all the women in this family and we have a clear complection because of this product.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I have an oily face and this leaves my face feeling oily compared to a previous face wash (Clean and Clear).</li>
            <li>After figuring this out, I moved the bottle to a shower rack where water doesn&#x27;t directly hit it, and now I don&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li>I use it with a silicone brush soft cleansing pad (they are like $2 on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It thoroughly removes all makeup, especially non-waterproof mascara, and leaves my face feeling clean, not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, it is a bit heavy and feels oily on my skin but might be the right thing for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>recently tried \\&quot;Olay Foaming Face Wash for Normal Skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have combination skin though, and the non-oily parts can sometimes dry out a bit too much with the face wash.</li>
            <li>But this product did not have much foam as expected.</li>
            <li>so I got the Olay Active Hydrating Beauty fluid 2 pack also works very well!</li>
            <li>Small bottle, but at least it gets your face clean if you care to use more than the average dose.</li>
            <li>It works so well, takes the dirt of my face, but is still very gentle and leaves skin feeling moist, smooth, and not the least bit dry or tight.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry skin and on the sensitive side</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a while, its not harsh on the face and doesn&#x27;t leave dry especially during winter.</li>

            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It thoroughly removes all makeup, especially non-waterproof mascara, and leaves my face feeling clean, not tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special, it is a bit heavy and feels oily on my skin but might be the right thing for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> recently tried \\&quot;Olay Foaming Face Wash for Normal Skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have combination skin though, and the non-oily parts can sometimes dry out a bit too much with the face wash.</li>
            <li> But this product did not have much foam as expected.</li>
            <li> so I got the Olay Active Hydrating Beauty fluid 2 pack also works very well!</li>
            <li> Small bottle, but at least it gets your face clean if you care to use more than the average dose.</li>
            <li> It works so well, takes the dirt of my face, but is still very gentle and leaves skin feeling moist, smooth, and not the least bit dry or tight.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and on the sensitive side</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while, its not harsh on the face and doesn&#x27;t leave dry especially during winter.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of suntan lotion at the beach, which I&#x27;m not too big of a fan of, but overall, not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I expected the soap itself to have a bubble-like consistency as it states in the name (or even a foaming dispenser instead of a regular one)</li>
            <li> not really like it personally.</li>
            <li> Doesnt dry out my face&lt;</li>
            <li> It cleans my face, doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> and it is neither oily nor dry, but this product seems to make it feel drier.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not at all drying or irritating, might stick with normal in future.  </li>
            <li> Even after multiple rinses my face feels slick and soapy.</li>
            <li> I have begun to explore the Olay skin care products as the moisturizers and facial cleansers I usually use</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful about the products I use on my face because I have Rosacea, and because I follow the Guaifenesin Protocol for Fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> However, I was sorely disappointed in the primary fact that it did not foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but I clearly read the instructions and wet both my hands and my face before dispensing it.</li>
            <li> use this product everyday for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (Green Tea), Allantoin (Comfrey Root), Cetyl Ricinoleate, Bis PEG/PPG 14/14 Dimethicone, PEG 10 Dimethicone, PEG 100 Stearate, PEG 10 Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylparaben,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years</li>
            <li> However, after a few days, my face began to itch and skin by my nose and cheeks seemed puffier than usual.</li>
            <li> Switched back to Purity Made Simple :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this product, its not suitable for the face.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have mildly hard water.  </li>
            <li> it is too soapy and does a poor job of taking off the make up.</li>
            <li> Irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is simply not a very good face wash.</li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I had always been buying expensive washes at the spa places and didn&#x27;t know what know how these Olay products</li>
            <li> they do just what the expensive stuff does</li>
            <li> Sadly, 1.5 packs went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> have become way too expensive, and friends have literally raved about Olay skin care</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> &amp;#34;Rich foamy lather&amp;#34; is misleading...or I have a defective product.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get it to lather period.&lt;br /&gt;Just slime.</li>
            <li> 1. Doesnt dry out my face&lt;br /&gt;2. doesnt irriate my exzema&lt;br /&gt;3. Cheap&lt;br /&gt;4. Came in a pack of two</li>
            <li> This product washes away makeup and is gentle on my skin. I sometimes use it with a Buf Puf facial sponge and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is my first facial wash from olay and I like it. It definitely works as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I do like it - thought it might work with just hand washing my face - but realized I have to use a wash cloth as well to get all off.  It is very soothing on my face.</li>
            <li> This product goes on gritty and did not leave my face refreshed or clean.  Sorry I can&#x27;t recommend but it might fit other peoples&#x27; skin better than mine.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser as it has a pleasant, light fragrance and rinses easily.  Does a nice job of taking off make-up, but I do finish up with a warm washcloth.  One of these bottles lasts me several months.  Cheaper than soap and much better for your complexion.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning in my beauty regime, at 71, I need all the help I can get!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched from fancy moisturizers to Olay moisturizing lotions after the lady at Sephora told me a no frills basic would do the job just fine at my age. I decided to try a matching facial wash but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me. The scent was nice but very strong and initially my skin took the change well. However, after a few days, my face began to itch and skin by my nose and cheeks seemed puffier than usual. Switched back to Purity Made Simple :(</li>
            <li> This item is used by all the women in this family and we have a clear complection because of this product. It&#x27;s scent is refreshing too !!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleanser.  Removes make-up, oil and dirt.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  I have tried the &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; brands, and agree with one review that one &amp;#34;smells like bug spray.&amp;#34;  I will continue to purchase the Olay.</li>
            <li> This may be TMI but I feel like I have an oily face and this leaves my face feeling oily compared to a previous face wash (Clean and Clear).</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I assumed that this product was fragrant free.  I am very sensitive to fragrances. Even though it is mild, it still bothered me; and I cannot use it. If the label stated not fragrant free, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while, its not harsh on the face and doesn&#x27;t leave dry especially during winter. I stock them whenever there is a sale in amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It keeps my skin clean but without feeling dry. The pump is easy to use and dispense what you need. The soap doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a  scent, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  Have been using for several years and I really llike the job that it does without drying out the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feel after using it. It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past. I definitely will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This face wash does a great job at doing what it says it is going to do - wash the face.  I use a separate moisturizer and dislike face washes that have a moisturizer in them.  I just don&#x27;t feel like my skin is clean.  This one on the other hand makes my face feel clean and ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this product alright but I was looking for a foam product and this is not it is a liquid face wash.</li>
            <li> it is too soapy and does a poor job of taking off the make up. Also, one of the two bottles came leaking.</li>
            <li> I wear heavy makeup and works very well to remove</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle of this stuff in the shower and use it daily. It works great for cleaning oil from my face. I have combination skin though, and the non-oily parts can sometimes dry out a bit too much with the face wash. As long as I&#x27;m careful not to use this in the drier areas, I&#x27;m good. The bottle is also not water-proof. If you keep it in the shower in an area where the water sprays, water will get in through the top. After figuring this out, I moved the bottle to a shower rack where water doesn&#x27;t directly hit it, and now I don&#x27;t have any problems. Since the bottle is not water-proof after being opened, leaking might also be a problem if the bottle fell over, but that&#x27;s never happened to me and is purely conjecture on my part.</li>
            <li> This is a exellent product!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Good Price.thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product everyday for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash...I had always been buying expensive washes at the spa places and didn&#x27;t know what know how these Olay products where. Well, I absolutely love them...they do just what the expensive stuff does and it&#x27;s way cheaper! I have really dry skin and on the sensitive side and they did not break me out or cause redness of any sort. Of course after you wash you must moisturize so I got the Olay Active Hydrating Beauty fluid 2 pack also works very well! Now I am waiting for the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System which is a rotating face brush that does more of a deep wash. I am definitely hooked on these products now.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this face wash, I decided to take a chance and purchase it when my regularly bought face wash ran out. However, I was sorely disappointed in the primary fact that it did not foam. I expected the soap itself to have a bubble-like consistency as it states in the name (or even a foaming dispenser instead of a regular one) but I found myself pumping more product out just to scrub my face. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but I clearly read the instructions and wet both my hands and my face before dispensing it. The smell reminds me of suntan lotion at the beach, which I&#x27;m not too big of a fan of, but overall, not worth the money for me. Small bottle, but at least it gets your face clean if you care to use more than the average dose.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I can tell when I&#x27;ve gone a night or two without using it.  I have normal skin, and I use it at night in the bathtub.  I definitely still need to use a makeup remover first, but this provides a good clean feel without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I have mildly hard water.  This product doesn&#x27;t rinse off your skin.  Even after multiple rinses my face feels slick and soapy. This was a 2 pack. Sadly, 1.5 packs went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.  It leaves you feeling silky and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a foaming face wash. It is not that great like the other olay products..</li>
            <li> Smells delightful and cleans without drying your skin!! I will be buying more in the future!!</li>
            <li> Good price, very gentle, pleasant, but light fragrance. This arrived well packaged and very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have begun to explore the Olay skin care products as the moisturizers and facial cleansers I usually use have become way too expensive, and friends have literally raved about Olay skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried \\&quot;Olay Foaming Face Wash for Normal Skin.\\&quot; Actually, like most people, I have a combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foaming face wash deep cleans facial skin, thoroughly removing dirt, oil and make-up without over-drying. It doesn&#x27;t cause the oily areas on my face, my nose and forehead, to break out or to become oilier. I do use\\&quot;Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream\\&quot; after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powerful yet gentle cleanser helps your skin retain its own natural moisture with oil-free conditioners...yes, it is totally oil-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 pump is enough to wash my entire face. I love how foamy it gets. Feels very gentle on my skin. As I wrote above, I have used various \\&quot;top end\\&quot; cleansers, and this is as good or better than most. Use once or twice daily. Smooth over your entire face and rinse very thoroughly. Use alone or before applying moisturizer or foundation makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want a list of ingredients, this wash contains:  Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Glycerin, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide 3 (Amino Peptide), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E) (Vitamin E), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (Green Tea), Allantoin (Comfrey Root), Cetyl Ricinoleate, Bis PEG/PPG 14/14 Dimethicone, PEG 10 Dimethicone, PEG 100 Stearate, PEG 10 Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Benzyl Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
            <li> burns my eyes each time I use it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my face very clean feeling either.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very gentle on sking. Only problem I had was that one bottle had leaked out a bit in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Nice face wash, I&#x27;ve used for many years</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful about the products I use on my face because I have Rosacea, and because I follow the Guaifenesin Protocol for Fibromyalgia. This face wash is gentle and cleanses thoroughly. I have been using it for years and hope it is always available.</li>
            <li> I use it as hand soap, facial soap, shaving cream and shampoo for my buzz cut head.</li>
            <li> Irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it with a silicone brush soft cleansing pad (they are like $2 on Amazon).  Tons of foam.  Cleans thoroughly.  Affordable  I love this.</li>
            <li> Olay has tried to maintain its expectations. Quality has been maintained and effect has been overall satisfactory.. . . .</li>
            <li> boutgh them when it is on sale.  great deal, but the product is ok, not as good as other brands.  1st time try olay.</li>
            <li> I have always bought this product for the gentleness on the facial skin. I also encouraged my daughter to start using it, because it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy that I can use this every day, its gentle and smells great, and cleans my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> If you like creamy and sudzy this is it.  Face feels silky and clean after use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleanser , I have tried better though , only downside is that it needs more product than I am used to , to get my face fully clean . The smell is neutral and it causes no irritation and doea take all makeup off.</li>
            <li> This face wash is just OK...not really like it personally. Despite the low price, I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, will buy again !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this product, its not suitable for the face. As soon as I started using this product its create dots on my faces</li>
            <li> I love this lightly scented face wash and have used it for years. Even though this particular formula is &#x27;normal&#x27;, it&#x27;s perfect for my rather sensitive skin.  It thoroughly removes all makeup, especially non-waterproof mascara, and leaves my face feeling clean, not tight and dry.  A wonderful classic Olay product at a bargain price!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face and neck having found this product.  It cleans quickly, but is not harsh and I can see and feel the difference after using it.</li>
            <li> Really smells good and feels great to lather up. Easy to wash off and makes my skin feel good all day.</li>
            <li> I love this facewash.  It is easy with the pump. It makes my face feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> i luv this product. everytime i wash my face the blackheads disappear in days. i love it. as soon as i c it on sale at target or drugstore i rack up!!!:)</li>
            <li> Nothing special, it is a bit heavy and feels oily on my skin but might be the right thing for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my face feeling so soft and clean. The fragrance is pleasant as well. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the pump, love the soap.  It is a good cleanser without leaving my skin dried-out.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so you just have to test until you find what works for you. So far this one has been great for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for a few years and I make sure I never run out of it.  Best Face Wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face, doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  Wife likes that it&#x27;s awesome at removing make up too. What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I get these as a anytime gift for my Mom.She loves this stuff but&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t buy it for herself...I got the subscribe and save set-up and&lt;br /&gt;save money and shipping and I never do not have a gift.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and its a great product. My skin feels so smooth after use. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this brand of facial wash, it cleans well without over drying, it leaves my face with a clean feeling.  It does not feel greasy.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Gently cleans your face leaving it feeling clean with a gentle clean fragrance. I really enjoy washing my face with this product, and it removes make up well. I really like it!</li>
            <li> This is simply not a very good face wash.</li>
            <li> My go-to face wash and the price is better than anyplace local. Love the subscribe and save option.</li>
            <li> I hoped for a better result with an Olay product, but it does clean and I use a Clarisonic after I get the initial makeup off, but there seems to always be a dry soapy feel to my skin after using it.  I had been using an olive oil product and I think I prefer that and will probably go back to it.  I do not have sensitive skin and it is neither oily nor dry, but this product seems to make it feel drier.  Probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> My Ladies goto evening facial wash.</li>
            <li> Olay has some of the best products on the market and this one is no exception. We have been using this product for quite a while and love it! Moisturizes the skin well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I&#x27;ve been using Olay Age Defying facial wash, but recently it&#x27;s always been out of stock in my local grocery.  After reading positive reviews about Olay Normal Foaming Face Wash, I decided to try it and I am not disappointed!  It is very economical to use because only one or two pumps would create a lot bubbles.  One bottle would last for about 6-8 weeks.  It leaves my skin feeling so clean, soft and smooth; my husband loves to touch my face.  It also has a light baby powder scent.  I was very satisfied with my initial purchase so I ordered 6 more bottles.</li>
            <li> Never tried this before, bought two and so glad I did!  It works so well, takes the dirt of my face, but is still very gentle and leaves skin feeling moist, smooth, and not the least bit dry or tight.  Smells great, little goes a long way, and I think it&#x27;s more effective than my trusty cetaphil.  Wanted the sensitive which was sold out so opted for normal.  Since it&#x27;s not at all drying or irritating, might stick with normal in future.  So glad I tried this, good value that works well- a new beauty favorite.</li>
            <li> I like cleansers with lots of foam. But this product did not have much foam as expected. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
