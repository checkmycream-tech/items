            <li>the most is...</li>
            <li>I have about 3 years using this product and I will keep using it :)</li>
            <li>I love all the Mary Kay products.  </li>

            <li>Glad to have found this can be purchased on line.</li>
            <li>(one pea-sized drop more than does the job).</li>
            <li>Hands down the best moisturizer out there.</li>
            <li>Perfect - just like the $21 version, but for a lot less.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face smooth without making it oily.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m not terribly concerned about looking too old but even for the best of us</li>
            <li>my skin always feels refreshed and light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years &amp; it still works great.</li>
            <li>I have an oly skin but at the same time very sencitive, this product is excellent</li>
            <li>If you purchase from a consultant you are ensured of getting a fresh quality product and you get your money back no questions asked if you aren&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>I know you will enjoy this product as much as I do :)))</li>
            <li>Mary Kay was founded on the golden rule and this is no way to make a quick buck preying on woman!</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first, as this was my first purchase online from a stranger, but after the prompt and safe arrival of my product, my mind is at ease.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too long to absorb into my skin, smells good, and my makeup goes on evenly over it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and acne-prone - as in even the thought of using most brands of moisturizer could cause a breakout (including Cetaphil).</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, it&#x27;s as simple as that!</li>
            <li>Not only did i receive the moisturizer in perfect condition, but i also had the pleasure of being able to try several other samples as well.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments about how young I look for my age, and how my facial skin looks healthy, and it is because the products are doing the job very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>In pictures and in person I also notice my skin looks more youthful than my friends of the same age.</li>
            <li>And finally, what makes me love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I really like this because it doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy after one application.</li>
            <li>The NuBrilliance system really and truly have improved the appears of my skin tone, texture and elasticity.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer works really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been an outdoor gal and had never paid much attention to skin care.  </li>
            <li>and i have very oily/ance skin</li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on very well and does not leave a oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Put more on, in about half an hour</li>
            <li>The only way to do that is to purchase it through a reputable consultant who is active.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a local dealer.</li>
            <li>How do you know how long the product has been in a hot car in the sun getting damaged?</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is my ultimate favorite!</li>
            <li>Mary Kay foundation glides over the moisturizer very smoothly, and you can even use less foundation because it doesn&#x27;t soak into your dry skin.</li>
            <li>this is great for those weeks when you just look a little tired in general.</li>
            <li>Do not like this new moisturizer; much preferred the one in the white bottle with pink lid.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am usually sceptical when purchasing products online for combination skin but I am satisfied with this oil free moisturizer and it wears flawlessly under my makeu p</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use products that test on animals and especially products who lie about it. I use murad now. Try it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now along with the cleanser.  I like the way it soaks into your skin without making your skin feel oily/greasy.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Much cheaper than a local dealer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Moisturizer for years and it works great on my face since i have oily skin and my skin usually tends to break out often than usual i just love this product. My face is not breaking out as much and it leaves my skin flawless and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would think twice to ten times before buying cosmetics from a person online that is NOT an Independent Consultant. The quality assurance of the product is not backed by the company if you purchase it in this way! How do you know how long the product has been in a hot car in the sun getting damaged? What if the mascara was used and you get an infection? The day codes on the products are traced and if you complain to the company they can tell if that product was sold to a registered Independent Beauty Consultantant! If the product is damaged or harms you in anyway you are SCREWED unless you buy it with the 100% satisfaction guarentee in place. The only way to do that is to purchase it through a reputable consultant who is active. Mary Kay was founded on the golden rule and this is no way to make a quick buck preying on woman! If you cannot find a consultant just go to the website! There are thousands on there. If you purchase from a consultant you are ensured of getting a fresh quality product and you get your money back no questions asked if you aren&#x27;t happy. Oh and by the way what these sellers are doing IS ILLEGAL!</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first, as this was my first purchase online from a stranger, but after the prompt and safe arrival of my product, my mind is at ease. I would definitely order this product from this person again when it runs out. Not only did i receive the moisturizer in perfect condition, but i also had the pleasure of being able to try several other samples as well.</li>
            <li> Always have been a fan of Mary Kay, always will be. It keeps my face smooth without making it oily. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve seen on the market yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this because it doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy after one application.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer!  I&#x27;ve tried various Mary Kay products and they&#x27;ve all been excellent.  This moisturizer is no exception.  Overall I&#x27;m not terribly concerned about looking too old but even for the best of us this is great for those weeks when you just look a little tired in general.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best moisturizer out there. I love this stuff. I can use it 10 times a day or just once. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it always feel perfect when I apply it. My kids who are 12 and 14 also use this as their daily moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used ALL the expensive moisturizers from La Mer to Arbonne. Seriously, this is my ultimate favorite! Will NEVER be without this.</li>
            <li> This is my self indulgence...it is my only extravagance for myself and I love it; as do others I come close too.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to order, price was great and arrived on time and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> excellent, fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It makes my skin feel refreshed after washing but never oily. It doesn&#x27;t take too long to absorb into my skin, smells good, and my makeup goes on evenly over it.</li>
            <li> Love my Mary Kay moisturizer! Its one of the very few brands that do not break me out!</li>
            <li> MaryKay  TimeWise Miracle Set - Combination/Oily skin and MaryKay  TimeWise Age - fighting Moisturizer (Combination/oily skin) are absolutely two excellent products. I have gotten so many compliments about how young I look for my age, and how my facial skin looks healthy, and it is because the products are doing the job very well.  In addition to MaryKay products, I would like to add that I have been using the NuBrilliance&#x27;s skin care system together with  MaryKay. The combination is just like getting a face lift to rejuvenate and restore facial skin. The NuBrilliance system really and truly have improved the appears of my skin tone, texture and elasticity. I recommend this product as well to all women who love to stay looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all I would like to thank Amazon for their great services, and I shall continue doing business with the company in the market place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin and I love using this face cream. I have used it faithfully for the last 5 years. It is not oily and can be used or combined with other products like sunscreen, peptides lotions and cream foundation. I will continue using this cream forever.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer works really well.  I like it.  It&#x27;s just as I thought it would be. It works well with other Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it&#x27;s as simple as that! I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 5 years now, and I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using anything else. I have oily skin, and I struggled to find a product that would moisturize my face without leaving it greasy feeling or dry (most the time products for oily skin just feel like diluted versions for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin). But this stuff is the perfect combination- my skin always feels refreshed and light. In pictures and in person I also notice my skin looks more youthful than my friends of the same age. And finally, what makes me love this moisturizer the most is... (drum roll please)... Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, every time I&#x27;ve had my makeup professionally done they gush about how healthy and nice looking my skin is!! I feel like that&#x27;s such a compliment given they work with skin/faces all day long. I know you will enjoy this product as much as I do :)))</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I had resigned myself to the wrinkles and poor skin quality that years of neglect and abuse produce.  I&#x27;ve always been an outdoor gal and had never paid much attention to skin care.  Today, I even have scars that have faded and I am no longer ashamed when I look in the mirror.  I wish I had taken a before picture, what a difference this has made.</li>
            <li> It took a while but it has improved my skin. I have an oily completion at my age.</li>
            <li> I have an oly skin but at the same time very sencitive, this product is excellent it help me to contol my acne problem. I have about 3 years using this product and I will keep using it :)</li>
            <li> Combination skin still needs moisturizers. This provides a great balance of moisturizers without leaving any oily residue. Mary Kay foundation glides over the moisturizer very smoothly, and you can even use less foundation because it doesn&#x27;t soak into your dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used this twice, then switched to MK&#x27;s ClearProof moisturizer - I have combination / oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 and AA and I started to break out after using this. Great product, I&#x27;m sure, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love all the Mary Kay products.  I love the timewise line because it is my fountain of youth.  I have used it for over 15 years and noone guesses my age.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this can be purchased on line.</li>
            <li> i received the wrong product ordered combination to oily got normal/dry skin formula instead.</li>
            <li> i have been using this moisturizer for years and has never irritated, it does not break me out and i have very oily/ance skin , item came in before expected date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years &amp; it still works great.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and acne-prone - as in even the thought of using most brands of moisturizer could cause a breakout (including Cetaphil). Ever since I started using MK Timewise (face wash and moisturizer, no makeup or sunscreen), my skin has cleared up 99%...which made it even worse when my MK rep stopped selling, but now I can get it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a little pricey - but I can make a bottle last 4-6 months and I use it twice per day (one pea-sized drop more than does the job).</li>
            <li> All the skin are not the same... this lotion was a gift for my sister and it works perfect on her.</li>
            <li> Perfect - just like the $21 version, but for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products but this on favorite!! This moisturizer goes on very well and does not leave a oily feeling. It was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Do not like this new moisturizer; much preferred the one in the white bottle with pink lid.  When I use this moisturizer, ten minutes later my face feels dry and tight.  Put more on, in about half an hour my face feels dry and tight, etc.  Cannot keep apply the stuff all day long.  Will not order again.</li>
