            <li>A great choice for a bold lip color.</li>
            <li>This color is really quite beautiful.</li>
            <li>My favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li>I thought it would look more plum</li>
            <li>The color is not as shown(purple), its more of a burgundy looking color</li>
            <li>I think for the most part, the color is dependent on the lighting.</li>
            <li>Love nyx matte collection.</li>
            <li>Thought this was more of a purple shade because it looks like it online</li>
            <li>Love the price, color and the matte finish.</li>
            <li>love the color</li>
            <li>Love this unique color!</li>
            <li>I wear it when I&#x27;m going for more of a bold look since it&#x27;s on the darker side.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Looks great and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Best if you later it on a little bit at a time to get the color and texture you want.</li>
            <li>but when I did finally receive it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Wish I read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty color but appears to be purple on line but is ore a burgundy or wine color.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve only been able to find it online.</li>
            <li>Got here so fast!</li>
            <li>I liked it but its too dark for me.</li>
            <li>but it is really brownish</li>
            <li>I still really like the color -</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very pigmented too.</li>
            <li>I feel really vampy in it.</li>
            <li>The picture here looks more like the NYX matter lipstick color &amp;#34;Aria&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;Siren.&amp;#34; For all reviews referring to the color not being as expected, this might be the explanation.</li>
            <li>The detailed color thumbnails on the NYX website look very similar, however the lipstick graphics show a little more color variance.</li>
            <li>Despite it being matte (which it really is) it goes on smoothly and my lips do not feel dry.</li>
            <li>Nice dark berry color!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first foray into NYX, but I&#x27;ll definitely be back!</li>
            <li>it was more of a dark red then a purple like I was hoping.</li>
            <li>Love the lipstick but its a little dark</li>
            <li>Spreads well but has a little bit of a problem if your lips are cracked, so hydrate them first.</li>
            <li>A little drying, but it stays in place very well.</li>

            <li> Color lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is actually a dark-red color, and goes on thicker (clumpier) than my other Nyx colors.</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick in the color Siren, and while I expected a purple</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a really dark dark red almost black .</li>
            <li> A little dryer than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my lips, but this stuff went on unevenly, and started clumping and flaking off within minutes</li>
            <li> Confused.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this lipstick</li>

            <li> The color was not as describe.</li>
            <li> Excellent received very quickly</li>
            <li> My favorite lipstick. It fades out after a while though, best used with primer. Nice color</li>
            <li> I thought it would look more plum but it is really brownish</li>
            <li> lovelyh only needs reapplication if you eat something that contains oil l</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! @Styledbymo90</li>
            <li> Love this unique color!</li>
            <li> I didnt receive the lipstick on time like it said in the email but when I did finally receive it, I fell in love. The color is not as shown(purple), its more of a burgundy looking color BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE !!! GREAT MATTE COLOR :)</li>
            <li> The color was not as describe. I wanted a purple color, but comes a wine color one.</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick in the color Siren, and while I expected a purple I still really like the color - but the preview picture is a purple while Siren is a deep red with some purple undertones. I think for the most part, the color is dependent on the lighting. While I was slightly disappointed at first because I expected a purple color, I do love this shade. It was packaged perfectly and goes on well - it&#x27;s very pigmented too. The swatches in my photos were done in one go.</li>
            <li> I liked it but its too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color!  I feel really vampy in it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my lips, but this stuff went on unevenly, and started clumping and flaking off within minutes</li>
            <li> not quite the purple on the picture but I still love the color and wear it a lot!!</li>
            <li> Deep purple color.  A little dryer than I would like.  Color lasts a long time.  Would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Have not purchased! Wondering why one tube of nyx is selling for $18???? Confused.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this item, so this is not a review of the product itself nor the seller. The picture here looks more like the NYX matter lipstick color &amp;#34;Aria&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;Siren.&amp;#34; For all reviews referring to the color not being as expected, this might be the explanation. The detailed color thumbnails on the NYX website look very similar, however the lipstick graphics show a little more color variance. Just FYI!</li>
            <li> I wanted the purple that is pictured but that isn&#x27;t the case at all. The lipstick is a deep red, like a wine color. Wish I read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I was thinking I&#x27;d be it was more of a dark red then a purple like I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Nice dark berry color!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! Looks great and lasts long.</li>
            <li> i just buy for my freind</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying purple lipstick. I should&#x27;ve read the reviews. This is actually a dark-red color, and goes on thicker (clumpier) than my other Nyx colors.</li>
            <li> Love nyx matte collection. Thought this was more of a purple shade because it looks like it online , it&#x27;s a really dark dark red almost black .</li>
            <li> Really great color. Best if you later it on a little bit at a time to get the color and texture you want. Last a very long time before reapplying.</li>
            <li> Love the lipstick but its a little dark</li>
            <li> This lipstick is perfect. I wear it when I&#x27;m going for more of a bold look since it&#x27;s on the darker side. Spreads well but has a little bit of a problem if your lips are cracked, so hydrate them first. I would reccomend and I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Its a pretty color but appears to be purple on line but is ore a burgundy or wine color. I wanted the purple pictured here</li>
            <li> This color is really quite beautiful. A plum red wine color that gets darker and bolder with each coat. It goes on smoothly. Despite it being matte (which it really is) it goes on smoothly and my lips do not feel dry. It lasts for a while, too! I attached a pic of how it looks- after drinking coffee and eating a peanut butter toast. Still looks good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase and wish I could find it at stores, but I&#x27;ve only been able to find it online. A great choice for a bold lip color.</li>
            <li> Love the price, color and the matte finish. A little drying, but it stays in place very well. This is my first foray into NYX, but I&#x27;ll definitely be back!</li>
            <li> Was nothing like the picture.  Not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> Got here so fast! Thank You! love the color</li>
            <li> Does not look like the picture online. Very unhappy with this lipstick</li>
            <li> LIKE matte-like the colour.  RECOMMEND TO HAIR DRESSER I GO TO BECAUSE SHE LIKE  THHE MATTE ALSO. THANK TO NYX AND I DO HAVE ANOTHER OF THEIR PRODUCTS.</li>
