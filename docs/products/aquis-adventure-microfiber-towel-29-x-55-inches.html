            <li>Very nice towel.  </li>

            <li>I have always loved these towels for camping and then came along children</li>
            <li>Good product</li>

            <li>Love this towel!  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>A nice light/thin absorbant towel to wrap my hair in while it dries.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the towels get softer and softer the more you wash</li>
            <li>Great at absorbing water.</li>
            <li>Packing was ok.</li>
            <li>It is really compact once it&#x27;s folded up, yet it&#x27;s the perfect size for drying your whole body.</li>
            <li>This way, the towel is attached to my bag but can easily be detached for some purpose.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly also!  </li>
            <li>and they are great to take to the beach, especially when you are hiking there and want to lighten your load.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed all all.</li>
            <li>It dries me better and quicker than many regular towels I&#x27;ve used but instead of rubbing this works better by &amp;#34;patting&amp;#34; yourself instead.</li>
            <li>This would be perfect for traveling, working out, yoga, messy kids, you name it!</li>
            <li>Its durable, fast drying, and sure to snag the moisture off surfaces.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, light and convenient!</li>
            <li>These towels soak up a tremendous amount of water.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, wicks away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really absorbent and washes easily.</li>
            <li>I swim daily at the gym-tab is a nice feature-</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the right thing for me.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, right size for using on the road also (gym/pool).  </li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too happy about was the zipper on the pouch which broke the second time I tried to close it, but that doesn&#x27;t reflect on the towel....</li>
            <li>water super fast and even after he has come home from his trip ...</li>
            <li>For an international trip, I needed a quick-drying towel to be able to throw in my bag pretty soon after showering.  </li>
            <li>It does absorb more water than a regular terry towel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still the towel he always wants!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also easy to pack for general travel or backpacking.</li>
            <li>so I bought the large and figured it would be perfect for me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and weight 100#), but because the towel is so thin compared to normal bath towels, it almost felt like I was using a hand towel.</li>
            <li>I got this towel because it is the right size to take to the gym, but the main feature is the snap on loop.</li>
            <li>The towel is super absorbent and dries quickly, but I wish I had purchased the larger size.</li>
            <li>I would say they are great to dry off with but certainly not to wrap up in.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes it really</li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>Hair dries much faster.</li>
            <li>Also, the loop at its end looks long, but the snaps are kinda close together not leaving a lot of room to comfortably snap around things.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this towel to anyone going on trip where they will be showering.</li>
            <li>I had heard an idea of how to dry your hair quickly after a shower using a microfiber towel and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think enough about how much a 19&amp;#34; towel really covers.  </li>
            <li>my experience, the Aquis towel has never dried within 2 hours, and only rarely inside of 4 hours--what I consider to be \\&quot;fast.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>If you like to wrap yourself with your towel, go for the extra large size.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and just sucks the moisture right off the skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>It would be a bit short for someone who wants to completely cover up in the locker room, but wrapped around the waist</li>
            <li>I was concerned with how long it would take to dry, but after a few hours it was good to go.  </li>
            <li>The length is fine but the width is a little to short.</li>
            <li>It worked quite well and dried quickly as promised.</li>
            <li>The Aquis Adventure towel was definitely better than an ordinary towel, but it needed to be left hanging for quite a while to dry completely.  </li>
            <li>but once you are used to how much pressure or how little to use in drying yourself</li>

            <li> I bought the large and it is WAY too small.</li>
            <li> The towel is soft, but it is a little pricey for a medium size hair towel.  </li>
            <li> After a shower, wrap your hair, and by the time you are dressed, your hair is almost completely dry - without using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I started buying items I can hang dry instead of cotton items I would need to place in a dryer (along with fabric softener).  </li>
            <li> I can loop/snap it around car headrest support, and have a dry towel by the end of a day&#x27;s work</li>

            <li> I use the pouch they come in to organize small gym items, such as headbands, gum, chapstick, and my access key.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just not satisfying enough as a daily use towel.</li>
            <li> Not particularly impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The down side was that it was not large enough to cover all the necessaries for a petite woman, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s simply not as absorbent as a regular towel, leaving me a bit damp and uncomfortable in the tropics where I live.</li>
            <li> My husband took this on a vacation where packing had to be kept minimal.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it packs much smaller than a regular sized bath towel, about the size of a thick kerchief.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s not exactly a full-size towel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small to wrap around my waist but let&#x27;s face it, when I&#x27;m out camping that doesn&#x27;t actually matter to me.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little dry on the skin</li>
            <li> towel is definitely tough, but that&#x27;s because the weave is rougher than your standard microfiber.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> then my shoulder hair and have some trouble wrapping all my hair with it after a shower.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use this towel to wrap my hair rather than one of my thick heavy cotton towels.</li>
            <li> However, my children ages 2 and 6, complain these are too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly phasing out my &#x27;fluffy&#x27; towels for microfiber towels</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, but for a twenty something dollar towel it could have been at least less thick, I guess.</li>
            <li> this towel is too small!</li>
            <li> The Aquis packs very small</li>

            <li> I brought one of these towels for use in travel because of its compact size for packing and its efficiency in drying. I am not disappointed all all. The texture is a little dry on the skin but once you are used to how much pressure or how little to use in drying yourself it is very comfortable and works great.</li>
            <li> A nice light/thin absorbant towel to wrap my hair in while it dries. I prefer to use this towel to wrap my hair rather than one of my thick heavy cotton towels.</li>
            <li> I got this towel because it is the right size to take to the gym, but the main feature is the snap on loop. That&#x27;s what makes it really the right thing for me. I was losing a couple of towels a month because I&#x27;d drop them. This way, the towel is attached to my bag but can easily be detached for some purpose. The microfiber is also a good fabric for this situation as well. I bought 3. I use the pouch they come in to organize small gym items, such as headbands, gum, chapstick, and my access key. A twofer...</li>
            <li> I had heard an idea of how to dry your hair quickly after a shower using a microfiber towel and thought I would try it. This lightweight towel is the perfect size to wrap your hair. After a shower, wrap your hair, and by the time you are dressed, your hair is almost completely dry - without using a blow dryer. Amazing.</li>
            <li> The Aquis packs very small but it&#x27;s simply not as absorbent as a regular towel, leaving me a bit damp and uncomfortable in the tropics where I live. I&#x27;m using it as my backup travel towel in case my host doesn&#x27;t have one or I need a shower at the airport but it&#x27;s just not satisfying enough as a daily use towel.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and just sucks the moisture right off the skin after a shower.  I highly recommend this towel to anyone going on trip where they will be showering.</li>
            <li> The towel is super absorbent and dries quickly, but I wish I had purchased the larger size. I&#x27;m going abroad for two months so I bought the large and figured it would be perfect for me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and weight 100#), but because the towel is so thin compared to normal bath towels, it almost felt like I was using a hand towel. I would DEFINITELY buy this product again, just in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, right size for using on the road also (gym/pool).  I started buying items I can hang dry instead of cotton items I would need to place in a dryer (along with fabric softener).  It soaks up water well, especially considering that it is not bulky like a cotton towel.  It dries quickly also!  If you like to wrap yourself with your towel, go for the extra large size.</li>
            <li> This towel is perfect for traveling or packing to go the gym. It is really compact once it&#x27;s folded up, yet it&#x27;s the perfect size for drying your whole body. It would be a bit short for someone who wants to completely cover up in the locker room, but wrapped around the waist it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s also really absorbent and washes easily. Love this towel!</li>
            <li> The length is fine but the width is a little to short. I have just longer then my shoulder hair and have some trouble wrapping all my hair with it after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have always loved these towels for camping and then came along children and they are great to take to the beach, especially when you are hiking there and want to lighten your load. However, my children ages 2 and 6, complain these are too small. I would say they are great to dry off with but certainly not to wrap up in. I would go ahead and buy the x-lrg size for all your family members.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Very nice towel.  Great for for my son who does competitive swimming.</li>
            <li> Very practical. Good product</li>
            <li> For an international trip, I needed a quick-drying towel to be able to throw in my bag pretty soon after showering.  The Aquis Adventure towel was definitely better than an ordinary towel, but it needed to be left hanging for quite a while to dry completely.  When I&#x27;d leave it hanging up for an hour after showering, it would still be damp when I needed to pack up.  Not particularly impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t think enough about how much a 19&amp;#34; towel really covers.  As other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s not exactly a full-size towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly phasing out my &#x27;fluffy&#x27; towels for microfiber towels and I always come back to aquis.&lt;br /&gt;It does take some getting used to when it comes to drying. you can&#x27;t rub briskly like you would with a regular towel. I just pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the towels get softer and softer the more you wash them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love.</li>
            <li> Great at absorbing water. Hair dries much faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this towel and the Rick Steves branded ones.&lt;br /&gt;This towel is definitely tough, but that&#x27;s because the weave is rougher than your standard microfiber.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, the Aquis towel has never dried within 2 hours, and only rarely inside of 4 hours--what I consider to be \\&quot;fast.\\&quot;  Also, the loop at its end looks long, but the snaps are kinda close together not leaving a lot of room to comfortably snap around things. The size (19x39) is just big enough to get things done and no bigger.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this as I&#x27;ve never used one before. I like the fact that it packs much smaller than a regular sized bath towel, about the size of a thick kerchief. It&#x27;s too small to wrap around my waist but let&#x27;s face it, when I&#x27;m out camping that doesn&#x27;t actually matter to me. It dries me better and quicker than many regular towels I&#x27;ve used but instead of rubbing this works better by &amp;#34;patting&amp;#34; yourself instead. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too happy about was the zipper on the pouch which broke the second time I tried to close it, but that doesn&#x27;t reflect on the towel....it&#x27;s just a pouch that would likely get lost anyway.</li>
            <li> I used this all summer as we traveled through Europe... this towel is too small! I bought the large and it is WAY too small.</li>
            <li> I took this abroad for a month-long stay in hostels. It worked quite well and dried quickly as promised. The down side was that it was not large enough to cover all the necessaries for a petite woman, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> The towel is soft, but it is a little pricey for a medium size hair towel.  It does absorb more water than a regular terry towel.</li>
            <li> These towels soak up a tremendous amount of water. They&#x27;re also easy to pack for general travel or backpacking.</li>
            <li> My husband took this on a vacation where packing had to be kept minimal. It dries quickly, wicks away water super fast and even after he has come home from his trip ... it&#x27;s still the towel he always wants!</li>
            <li> I swim daily at the gym-tab is a nice feature- I can loop/snap it around car headrest support, and have a dry towel by the end of a day&#x27;s work</li>
            <li> Its durable, fast drying, and sure to snag the moisture off surfaces. Just have to wash it every now and then</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Dries fast, light and convenient!</li>
            <li> Love this towel!  Wicked away moisture like a boss!!  I was concerned with how long it would take to dry, but after a few hours it was good to go.  The size is very compact and will slide into the small little front pocket in your carry on.  This would be perfect for traveling, working out, yoga, messy kids, you name it!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, but for a twenty something dollar towel it could have been at least less thick, I guess. Packing was ok. Just like a t-shirt.</li>
