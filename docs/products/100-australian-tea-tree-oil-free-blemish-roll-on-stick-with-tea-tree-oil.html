            <li>i just use safe and natural oils to clean ,it cleans mildew to everything and the smell is great ,the shipping was very fast and the blemish oil stick worked great my son loved it</li>
            <li>But make sure you do it with knuckles or the pads of your fingers (no nail).</li>
            <li>I mostly love the the blemish stick.</li>
            <li>I went to see a dermatologist and the stuff she told me to get works much better than this.</li>
            <li>and my children have so many allergies to alot of things</li>
            <li>,i will be buying more again ...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Many uses.</li>
            <li>Cysts, cysts, and more cysts all over my chin, and on my hairline.</li>
            <li>I broke out even more when using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used these before and am always pleased with both products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks quite a bit healthier and more balanced.  </li>
            <li>I hope my appearance will get better.</li>
            <li>I love the blemish roll on stick.</li>
            <li>I love both of these products.  </li>
            <li>So many people rave about Tea Tree Oil and it very well might be great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I am using this mostly for acne.</li>
            <li>I will rate the product again when I am done using it :)</li>
            <li>like I have, I would try this product and see if you like it more than I did.</li>
            <li>Makes my acnetic skin look better.</li>
            <li>Great product, strong smell&lt;br /&gt;but works very well.</li>
            <li>Due to stress, my wonderful face decided to break out in ways I have never seen before..</li>
            <li>The roll on is SO convenient &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to apply rather than getting a cotton ball and the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an astringent and is really strong.  </li>
            <li>All in all, while the smell is kinda strong, I like it.</li>
            <li>It smells really strong.</li>
            <li>The bonus stick is nice, but the tea tree oil is what really works.</li>
            <li>I hope and pray that in the morning, my skin will look even better than it does right now.</li>
            <li>The Roll on Stick works very well for acne, need to dilute the tee tree oil with water, the smell is very strong, makes me dizzy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I added this to my first aid kit</li>
            <li>I find it very good, especially compared to Now 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>The blemish stick has a strong smell but slightly more pleasant than the larger bottle and it works really, really well.</li>
            <li>However, it kills the bacteria and removes the oil from the affected area, so it helps keep the area clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did because it really works.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really figure out how to make it better.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t dilute it, but I applied it right after using oil free acne wash by neutrogena.</li>
            <li>The seller responds to emails quickly, and is quick to resolve any issues.</li>
            <li>These items arrived quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>and when I get a blemish this has worked to knock it out quickly.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m getting married in a week!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for me, although it smells better than the pure tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>I did use the free blemish stick as well, which I think is a much safer bet.  </li>
            <li>I might just buy the sticks on their own next time.</li>
            <li>it works safe and natural</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for adult acne, this works almost overnight.</li>
            <li>I got it to use on my skin and face to keep it looking clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product because, using twice a day, it&#x27;s all natural and clears my skin up without over drying it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash it off afterwards, it dries or is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Everyone is right.</li>
            <li>While the price is great for some high quality tea tree oil, it makes you place another order before your done with the first bottle of the actual pure oil because the blemish stick runs out much faster.</li>
            <li>I first used it at night</li>
            <li>My first time using tea tree oil</li>
            <li>Today is my first day using this product.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t exactly the herbal remedy I was looking for, but I don&#x27;t regret trying it atleast for the price I bought it for.</li>
            <li>Things started off with me wanting to get rid of some early 30&#x27;s acne (yikes!!!!)  </li>
            <li>if I get a breakout, I can clean it and roll this on and the antibacterial properties of the tea tree oil clear it up in a day or two.</li>
            <li>ProActiv, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, NoXzema, St Ives, etc, and even prescription strength gels.  </li>
            <li>where ,i use this oil cuz its all natural and its safe for my children and it has no harsh chemicals in it</li>
            <li>I  am a first time user of Tea Tree Oil and I highly doubt I will be a repeat user!  </li>
            <li>AND THE PRODUCT CAME PRETTY FAST</li>
            <li>Once it empties out, you can easily refill it for future use.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of my pimples quickly and naturally.</li>
            <li>The smell of tea tree oil is strong, no matter what the source is, so the same goes here.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend and will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree really works and works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and makes blemishes disappear faster than just washing would do.</li>
            <li>this product works very well...</li>
            <li>it is convenient, well priced, and works very well for me.</li>
            <li>My advice, order this great quality oil, and don&#x27;t get addicted to using the blemish stick</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>It keeps it clear and fresh.</li>
            <li>Now the instructions do say it might need to be diluted which I didn&#x27;t do because I used very sparingly ONCE a day.  </li>
            <li>would give this product five starts except that I don&#x27;t really like the blemish stick much.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really do to much to help my problem.</li>
            <li>and it really seems to help.</li>
            <li>free blemish stick is terrific though!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WORKS FAST</li>
            <li>This really works well with my skin</li>
            <li>But this with consistent use did work, but it was a little overwhelming with the smell.</li>
            <li>hour later and quickly glanced at the mirror.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne ever since I graduated high school and started college.  </li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is great for acne, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>Normally I use Proactiv</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely a burning that happens, which I&#x27;m not sure is good, but my skin does feel invigorated.</li>
            <li>I will probably be using the same bottle of the oil for a long time anyway, that stuff is potent.</li>
            <li>have combination dry and oily skin and its very sensitive and prone to redness, with most of my acne located on my lower cheeks, jawline, and chin, and some along my hairline and occasionally on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing it right, but I mix some with water and and apply directly to my clean face.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a while back, and it didn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li>The redness toned down TREMENDOUSLY!</li>
            <li>When I was done washing my face, I did notice my face was very soft.</li>
            <li>Like musty old plants degenerating! &#x27;</li>
            <li>The product came in very quickly, however stores like vitamin world have it a few dollars cheaper, if you have one near you.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the ingredients are pure and simple.</li>
            <li>while my skin is not 100% clear, it has improved since I&#x27;ve been using the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Those with sensitive skin need to dilute it with water.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I had acne all my life and this is by far my number one product.</li>
            <li>So far it is working.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Although I will say, it hasn&#x27;t really done much for my regular topical acne</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the smell, but I&#x27;d rather use something 100% natural and not fully enjoy the smell than put chemicals on my skin!</li>
            <li>This anti-acne treatment doesn&#x27;t leave my skin flaky like others do, and as long as you avoid your eyes, it doesn&#x27;t burn much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Tree Tree Oil, but I have read about the benefits of regular use.</li>
            <li>Like other reviers I have sensitive, oily, and very &amp;#34;hormonal&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>probably get another one in the near future</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of herbal treatments like lemon juice, green tea bags, cinnamon, home-made face masks, but most things either worsened by condition or had little effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Allows me to put the tea tree oil exactly where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be that harsh Tea Tree smell</li>
            <li>only so I would not dry out my skin, and then I applied it twice a day to problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I get pretty decent-sized, big red pimples, and a few times a week</li>

            <li> Normally I use Proactiv</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely a burning that happens, which I&#x27;m not sure is good, but my skin does feel invigorated.</li>
            <li> I will probably be using the same bottle of the oil for a long time anyway, that stuff is potent.</li>
            <li> have combination dry and oily skin and its very sensitive and prone to redness, with most of my acne located on my lower cheeks, jawline, and chin, and some along my hairline and occasionally on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing it right, but I mix some with water and and apply directly to my clean face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while back, and it didn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li> The redness toned down TREMENDOUSLY!</li>
            <li> When I was done washing my face, I did notice my face was very soft.</li>
            <li> Like musty old plants degenerating! &#x27;</li>
            <li> The product came in very quickly, however stores like vitamin world have it a few dollars cheaper, if you have one near you.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the ingredients are pure and simple.</li>
            <li> while my skin is not 100% clear, it has improved since I&#x27;ve been using the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Those with sensitive skin need to dilute it with water.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I had acne all my life and this is by far my number one product.</li>
            <li> So far it is working.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Although I will say, it hasn&#x27;t really done much for my regular topical acne</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell, but I&#x27;d rather use something 100% natural and not fully enjoy the smell than put chemicals on my skin!</li>
            <li> This anti-acne treatment doesn&#x27;t leave my skin flaky like others do, and as long as you avoid your eyes, it doesn&#x27;t burn much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Tree Tree Oil, but I have read about the benefits of regular use.</li>
            <li> Like other reviers I have sensitive, oily, and very &amp;#34;hormonal&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> probably get another one in the near future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of herbal treatments like lemon juice, green tea bags, cinnamon, home-made face masks, but most things either worsened by condition or had little effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Allows me to put the tea tree oil exactly where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be that harsh Tea Tree smell</li>
            <li> only so I would not dry out my skin, and then I applied it twice a day to problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I get pretty decent-sized, big red pimples, and a few times a week</li>
            <li> Before I got it, my hopes had been somewhat dashed when the two or three other natural items I had gotten on here hadn&#x27;t been miracles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one single deep pimple or cyst since I started using the tea tree oil, which is a big relief for me.  </li>
            <li> it made my face red and dry the blemish roll on  </li>
            <li> I like the product for minor breakouts but with acne like mine</li>
            <li> When I do get pimples (which I still do, nothing is a miracle), they&#x27;re smaller, less red, and they heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In order to apply it, I put a couple of drops in my Witch Hazel Toner and, in order to get the dramatic results on my cysts, I applied it by dunking a Q-tip into first the tea tree oil, then the witch hazel.</li>
            <li> As a teenager I had a few pimples here and there, but it&#x27;s been worse as a young adult.  </li>
            <li> Also, I absolutely HATE how the tea tree oil smells, and so does my boyfriend, so I can only use it at night, but I still highly recommend it for stubborn acne, especially adult acne.</li>
            <li> IT CLEARS THE DARK MARKS ON YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> I have used on blemish on face and has shrunk down to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> we tried it for a few weeks and just stopped, not worth the time</li>
            <li> It burns a little bit, but I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s what it does when it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> When I out on blemishes and pimples overnight, the next day my pimple looked worse.  </li>
            <li> and I am a firm believer now.</li>
            <li> Other medications beg rid of the pain and slowly flatten the bump</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was WOW, that is a TERRIBLE smell.</li>
            <li> I get a big, deep, painful cysts that don&#x27;t come to the surface and can&#x27;t be popped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now trying to heal acne and a chemical burn, which is no fun!!  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I can still feel a small bump under the skin.  </li>
            <li> If you get a facial from a dermatologist or at a spa they squeeze out the puss (don&#x27;t listen to magazines that information is erroneous).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what the hoohlah is about this product.  </li>
            <li> I did however use it on a small cut I had on my toe</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly not that bad as long as you don&#x27;t try to take a giant whif of it.</li>
            <li> SO painful that I can barely sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased the product because I get bad breakouts</li>
            <li> I get red painful acne pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using tea tree oil, the number of my pimples has decreased a lot.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product for that reason.</li>
            <li> I wish I could tell you that this stuff  works, but the oil smells so bad that I just have a hard time using it.</li>
            <li> sorry to tell this did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Sorry but will not order this again .</li>
            <li> Just give it a shot if you&#x27;re desperate like me.</li>
            <li> Smells bad, didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> And the burning isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Omg, smells so awful .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this because my face started breaking out again.  I get red painful acne pimples. Normally I use Proactiv but I think my skin adapted to it.  I have combination oil skin so I was hesitant to buy anything with oil in the name.  I read the reviews and took a chance.  I&#x27;m so glad I did because it really works.  Other medications beg rid of the pain and slowly flatten the bump but no puss comes out and in turns into a red mark and sometimes I can still feel a small bump under the skin.  This does not take away the pain but it dramatically reduces the diameter, turns it into a smaller pimple and brings it to a head so I can squeeze out the puss.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s an astringent and is really strong.  Those with sensitive skin need to dilute it with water.&lt;br /&gt;2. It pungent and some might not like the smell, but it goes away after about 15 or 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3. I first used it at night only so I would not dry out my skin, and then I applied it twice a day to problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;4. Put it on the pimple after you have squeeze. You can squeeze your pimples.  If you get a facial from a dermatologist or at a spa they squeeze out the puss (don&#x27;t listen to magazines that information is erroneous).  But make sure you do it with knuckles or the pads of your fingers (no nail). Only squeeze the puss, do not continue and try to get our blood or fluid. After I did this I applied the oil and pimple was almost gone within an hour.</li>
            <li> eventually see the results, after a while it becomes an article of daily use and would buy this item again, it smells like eucalyptus</li>
            <li> I had acne all my life and this is by far my number one product. Tea Tree really works and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Tree Tree Oil, but I have read about the benefits of regular use. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing it right, but I mix some with water and and apply directly to my clean face. There&#x27;s definitely a burning that happens, which I&#x27;m not sure is good, but my skin does feel invigorated. I mostly love the the blemish stick. It&#x27;s very soothing and makes blemishes disappear faster than just washing would do. I might just buy the sticks on their own next time. I will probably be using the same bottle of the oil for a long time anyway, that stuff is potent.</li>
            <li> Smells bad, didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. I bought this product a while back, and it didn&#x27;t really help much. I went to see a dermatologist and the stuff she told me to get works much better than this.</li>
            <li> this product works very well...if I get a breakout, I can clean it and roll this on and the antibacterial properties of the tea tree oil clear it up in a day or two. it is convenient, well priced, and works very well for me.</li>
            <li> So far it is working. I have almost eliminated some of the problems I had on my feet. It just takes time as not overnight product. I have used on blemish on face and has shrunk down to almost nothing. am most happy.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is great for acne, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But the pitch here is they sell you the blemish stick with the oil which you can use up to 6 times a day. While the price is great for some high quality tea tree oil, it makes you place another order before your done with the first bottle of the actual pure oil because the blemish stick runs out much faster. My advice, order this great quality oil, and don&#x27;t get addicted to using the blemish stick and it&#x27;s ease of use.</li>
            <li> good product! it works perfectly! I have had spots and it has dissapeared in only a week. I recommended for</li>
            <li> The roll on is SO convenient &amp; easy to use. Allows me to put the tea tree oil exactly where I need it.&lt;br /&gt;Smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be that harsh Tea Tree smell either.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product</li>
            <li> The Roll on Stick works very well for acne, need to dilute the tee tree oil with water, the smell is very strong, makes me dizzy.</li>
            <li> Great product i use this oil for cleaning in my house ,my bathroom,my kitchen,just every where ,i use this oil cuz its all natural and its safe for my children and it has no harsh chemicals in it and my children have so many allergies to alot of things i don&#x27;t take chances i just use safe and natural oils to clean ,it cleans mildew to everything and the smell is great ,the shipping was very fast and the blemish oil stick worked great my son loved it it works safe and natural ,i will be buying more again ...</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the hoohlah is about this product.  When I out on blemishes and pimples overnight, the next day my pimple looked worse.  I tried on separate occasions.  this product is just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for adult acne, this works almost overnight. It worked GREAT for me. Will use when ever needed.</li>
            <li> sorry to tell this did not work at all. we tried it for a few weeks and just stopped, not worth the time</li>
            <li> This is a good product and the roll on blemish stick was a great addition. Once it empties out, you can easily refill it for future use. The product came in very quickly, however stores like vitamin world have it a few dollars cheaper, if you have one near you. The seller responds to emails quickly, and is quick to resolve any issues. I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Many uses. I put it in my shampoo.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is great for my skin. It keeps it clear and fresh. My only complaint is the smell, but I&#x27;d rather use something 100% natural and not fully enjoy the smell than put chemicals on my skin!</li>
            <li> I  am a first time user of Tea Tree Oil and I highly doubt I will be a repeat user!  Things started off with me wanting to get rid of some early 30&#x27;s acne (yikes!!!!)  Soooo, I bought this product hoping to get rid of it, only to give myself a chemical burn (double yikes!!!)  Now the instructions do say it might need to be diluted which I didn&#x27;t do because I used very sparingly ONCE a day.  I did use the free blemish stick as well, which I think is a much safer bet.  I am now trying to heal acne and a chemical burn, which is no fun!!  Take caution with this oil.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m getting married in a week! Due to stress, my wonderful face decided to break out in ways I have never seen before.. I would get the occasional massive cystic acne every now and then, but this time, oh lord. Cysts, cysts, and more cysts all over my chin, and on my hairline. SO painful that I can barely sleep at night. Did I mention how embarrassing it is to be seen like this at work? Make up doesn&#x27;t do justice. I just started using this product today. Everyone is right. The smell is HORRIBLE. I didn&#x27;t dilute it, but I applied it right after using oil free acne wash by neutrogena. WOW. I left the bathroom, came back and hour later and quickly glanced at the mirror. The redness toned down TREMENDOUSLY! It also shrunk some of the cysts on my chin. It burns a little bit, but I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s what it does when it&#x27;s working. And the burning isn&#x27;t bad at all. I hope and pray that in the morning, my skin will look even better than it does right now. Try it guys. Especially if you have acne. Just give it a shot if you&#x27;re desperate like me.</li>
            <li> I have oily and acne prone skin. I broke out even more when using this product. Unfortunately, tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully, it just takes a while to get used to the strong smell.  I&#x27;m glad I added this to my first aid kit</li>
            <li> Omg, smells so awful . Leaked through package when I got it. Sorry but will not order this again .</li>
            <li> Great quality and the roll-on stick is a fantastic bonus.  I have used these before and am always pleased with both products. Packaging and shipping were both excellent.</li>
            <li> The product works great! I got it to use on my skin and face to keep it looking clear and healthy. while my skin is not 100% clear, it has improved since I&#x27;ve been using the tea tree oil. The bonus stick is nice, but the tea tree oil is what really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne ever since I graduated high school and started college.  As a teenager I had a few pimples here and there, but it&#x27;s been worse as a young adult.  I couldn&#x27;t really figure out how to make it better.  I&#x27;ve tried every name-brand and tons of off-brand anti-acne products out there: ProActiv, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, NoXzema, St Ives, etc, and even prescription strength gels.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of herbal treatments like lemon juice, green tea bags, cinnamon, home-made face masks, but most things either worsened by condition or had little effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination dry and oily skin and its very sensitive and prone to redness, with most of my acne located on my lower cheeks, jawline, and chin, and some along my hairline and occasionally on my forehead.  I get pretty decent-sized, big red pimples, and a few times a week I get a big, deep, painful cysts that don&#x27;t come to the surface and can&#x27;t be popped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using tea tree oil, the number of my pimples has decreased a lot.  I took before pictures and I&#x27;ll post them soon with my after pictures.  My skin looks quite a bit healthier and more balanced.  This anti-acne treatment doesn&#x27;t leave my skin flaky like others do, and as long as you avoid your eyes, it doesn&#x27;t burn much.  I haven&#x27;t had one single deep pimple or cyst since I started using the tea tree oil, which is a big relief for me.  When I do get pimples (which I still do, nothing is a miracle), they&#x27;re smaller, less red, and they heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product five starts except that I don&#x27;t really like the blemish stick much.  Doesn&#x27;t do much for me, although it smells better than the pure tea tree oil.  Also, I absolutely HATE how the tea tree oil smells, and so does my boyfriend, so I can only use it at night, but I still highly recommend it for stubborn acne, especially adult acne.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil, I use it as a disinfectant on insect bites, cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> So after a lot of reading reviews on acne.com as well as here on Amazon, I came upon this tea tree oil. Before I got it, my hopes had been somewhat dashed when the two or three other natural items I had gotten on here hadn&#x27;t been miracles. Now this one wasn&#x27;t either, but after three days, the size of a nickel sized cyst on my cheek has both diminished in size and inflammation! It does give results, but in order to get the perfect results, I would say I have to wait a while. In order to apply it, I put a couple of drops in my Witch Hazel Toner and, in order to get the dramatic results on my cysts, I applied it by dunking a Q-tip into first the tea tree oil, then the witch hazel. All in all, while the smell is kinda strong, I like it. It&#x27;s honestly not that bad as long as you don&#x27;t try to take a giant whif of it. Although I will say, it hasn&#x27;t really done much for my regular topical acne, that I would point you to the Aztec Facial Mask, which would possibly work well with this.</li>
            <li> Nobodys fault but I read this item would remove skin tags and it did not do the job. I am not happy with this product for that reason.</li>
            <li> I wish I could tell you that this stuff  works, but the oil smells so bad that I just have a hard time using it. Tried putting the oil on the skin tags around my neck, but wearing that stinky oil at work just does not go too well with any perfume. Lol</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and my breakouts are linked to my monthlies. I love this product because, using twice a day, it&#x27;s all natural and clears my skin up without over drying it. This even helped my blackheads, which I have a lot of. The blemish stick works too, but you have to put it on 5-6 times a day, which can be a pain.  However, it kills the bacteria and removes the oil from the affected area, so it helps keep the area clean throughout the day. I just put the oil on a cotton ball and wipe my face with it. I don&#x27;t wash it off afterwards, it dries or is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Had breakouts on my chin regularly and this product has cleared my skin.  I do combine it with a tea tree oil face wash I purchased from Amazon.  Could not be happier with the product. Would recommend and will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this for some acne problems. Did not work for me it made my face red and dry the blemish roll on  didn&#x27;t really do to much to help my problem. I did however use it on a small cut I had on my toe and it really seems to help.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks on occasionally, because I also use the Proactive product. I hope my appearance will get better.</li>
            <li> My first time using tea tree oil and I am a firm believer now. Gets rid of my pimples quickly and naturally. I love the blemish roll on stick. I wish it was bigger since I am almost out of it. It makes it so easy to apply rather than getting a cotton ball and the bottle. My mom uses it now too and loves it!</li>
            <li> I love both of these products.  The smell of tea tree oil is strong, no matter what the source is, so the same goes here.  The blemish stick has a strong smell but slightly more pleasant than the larger bottle and it works really, really well.</li>
            <li> I got rash and feel itchy after using it. But it might works for a lot of people jst not me</li>
            <li> Great product, strong smell&lt;br /&gt;but works very well. use almost throughout the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;will probably get another one in the near future</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! The blemish stick is really wonderful. I model part-time and after 40 I started getting hormonal blemishes on my chin. Tried everything and nothing worked even with a great skin cleansing routine. I purchased this after some research and have not had one blemish since! Great product!</li>
            <li> It smells really strong. Use at home.</li>
            <li> These items arrived quickly and packaged well.  I like the fact that the ingredients are pure and simple. I would purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product some time ago. I find it very good, especially compared to Now 100% pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> only one of two items that finally worked on my wife, the zinc pills didnt work, nor did the sulfur cream. But this with consistent use did work, but it was a little overwhelming with the smell. So we finally found a cream that worked, though had to order all the way from india.</li>
            <li> So many people rave about Tea Tree Oil and it very well might be great. But, I cannot bear the stink!! Like musty old plants degenerating! &#x27;Orrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The free blemish stick is terrific though!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS FAST I LOVE IT IT CLEARS THE DARK MARKS ON YOUR SKIN AND THE PRODUCT CAME PRETTY FAST</li>
            <li> Today is my first day using this product. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was WOW, that is a TERRIBLE smell. I had to hold my breath while using this on my face. I am using this mostly for acne. However, I can&#x27;t rate the product yet on how it works. When I was done washing my face, I did notice my face was very soft. I will rate the product again when I am done using it :)</li>
            <li> Like other reviers I have sensitive, oily, and very &amp;#34;hormonal&amp;#34; skin. This really works well with my skin and when I get a blemish this has worked to knock it out quickly. Yes, it does &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s fleeting.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the blemish roll-on that came with. I initially purchased the product because I get bad breakouts and I wanted to try to see if this would work because I have read about it on several sites or blogs. I like the product for minor breakouts but with acne like mine it wasn&#x27;t exactly the herbal remedy I was looking for, but I don&#x27;t regret trying it atleast for the price I bought it for. If you have tried a lot of stuff like I have, I would try this product and see if you like it more than I did.</li>
            <li> Makes my acnetic skin look better. But, the product makes my skin burn, but, once i mixed it with lotion i haven&#x27;t had that problem since.</li>
