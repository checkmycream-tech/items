    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect combination with CND Solar Oil makes it seem like shampoo and conditioner for your nails!</li>
            <li>However, I do think it has to be used in conjunction with the solar oil for  the best results.</li>
            <li>and this is the best product I have found to treat them.</li>
            <li>Works great!!</li>
            <li>It has the perfect &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use too!!!</li>
            <li>am quite happy with this product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, and it smells great too.  </li>
            <li>A good hand moisturizer takes care of the rest of my hand, but my nails look so much better by including the CND Cuticle Eraser.  </li>
            <li>This product is like a magic eraser for your cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>No amount of moisturizer will help my fingers and cuticles look better.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Guess I was hoping that my cuticles would miraculously disintegrate in a safe way, of course.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>Cuticle moisturizing is always of value, and if I always moisturized mine twice a day, and always protected my hands from rough work, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be wishing for a product to magically erase hardened cuticles with AHA&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li>My cuticles look great when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to be used routinely, to get the full effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the kind of cuticle eraser that eats away your cuticles, like that professional gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Right now, I would recommend that others buy this product.</li>
            <li>The texture is very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and it certainly helps the cuticles and nails.  </li>
            <li>This product is like a moisturizer and it does that very well.</li>
            <li>Its a much smaller bottle than i expected (somehow i missed the .5 oz size) but it does effectively remove your excess cuticle in a much gentler way than clipping would.</li>
            <li>I can say it&#x27;s fragrance and other irritant-free; but I can&#x27;t say what the concentration of glycolic, lactic and malic acids are, and whether the pH is actually correct for them to be able to exfoliate skin.</li>
            <li>I keep the large size in my manicure kit and have also purchased the smaller sizes for my purse and desk.</li>
            <li>This cuticle remover not only softens and preps the cuticle, but also helps the whole nail.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates away dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>It is a cream and absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t messy at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to do better with my cuticle care regimen, and if I had even a few weeks of twice a day use, I could give you a comparison to cuticle oil or ordinary cream.</li>

            <li> This performs as expected, breaking down dead cuticle skin to easily push back.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from my hair salon but found it here much cheaper</li>

            <li> I have very dry cuticles and thin, brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> As a result, my hands, cuticles, and fingers get very dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible cuticles from the products I have to use for hand washing at my job</li>

            <li> I use CND Cuticle Eraser on all of my nail clients as well as myself. It gently exfoliates away dry cuticles. Perfect combination with CND Solar Oil makes it seem like shampoo and conditioner for your nails!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from my hair salon but found it here much cheaper and it works well on my very dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it certainly helps the cuticles and nails.  I have very dry cuticles and thin, brittle nails.  Helps them stay around longer!</li>
            <li> Cuticle moisturizing is always of value, and if I always moisturized mine twice a day, and always protected my hands from rough work, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be wishing for a product to magically erase hardened cuticles with AHA&#x27;s!!! CND Cuticle Eraser doesn&#x27;t do that, despite its luxury price, but it&#x27;s not meant to be a cuticle remover! It&#x27;s meant to be used routinely, to get the full effects. I&#x27;ve been as occasional with using this product as with other cuticle moisturizers. I can say it&#x27;s fragrance and other irritant-free; but I can&#x27;t say what the concentration of glycolic, lactic and malic acids are, and whether the pH is actually correct for them to be able to exfoliate skin. Right now, I would recommend that others buy this product. I&#x27;m going to try to do better with my cuticle care regimen, and if I had even a few weeks of twice a day use, I could give you a comparison to cuticle oil or ordinary cream.</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended this product.  It is a cream and absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t messy at all.  My cuticles look great when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> This product is like a magic eraser for your cuticles.  I keep the large size in my manicure kit and have also purchased the smaller sizes for my purse and desk.</li>
            <li> The product arrived about a week before the expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it, along with the CND solar oil, daily for about 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;My cuticles were wrecked from gardening. I was too embarrassed to show my hands.&lt;br /&gt;These 2 products have made my cuticles look healthier and not so dry. I have naturally long nails that are starting to look pink again.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with this product&#x27;s performance. However, I do think it has to be used in conjunction with the solar oil for  the best results.</li>
            <li> It works. under sress I have the habit of eating or picking on my cuticles. With this product, I get daily manicure that I don&#x27;t have to pick on my cuticles!</li>
            <li> Works quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, and it smells great too.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I suffer with the problems of hypothyroidism.  My nails are always showing the dryness that comes with it.  This cuticle remover not only softens and preps the cuticle, but also helps the whole nail.</li>
            <li> Its a much smaller bottle than i expected (somehow i missed the .5 oz size) but it does effectively remove your excess cuticle in a much gentler way than clipping would. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have terrible cuticles from the products I have to use for hand washing at my job and this is the best product I have found to treat them.</li>
            <li> Works great!! I love it and will buy it again. It&#x27;s so easy to use too!!! I told everyone about it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s not the kind of cuticle eraser that eats away your cuticles, like that professional gel. Instead, it&#x27;s an alpha hydroxy cream(like anti-wrinkle cream) that gently dissolves dead skin.   Just use it once a day, smoothing it into the cuticle area.  If you use this religiously, you won&#x27;t have to scrape at your nails nearly so much, especially if you use acrylics.  Oh, and I recommend CND&#x27;s SolarOil twice a day, too.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this CND Cuticle Eraser from Amazon.  I am a ranchers wife and wash my hands over and over all day after working with livestock.  As a result, my hands, cuticles, and fingers get very dried out.  No amount of moisturizer will help my fingers and cuticles look better.  When I use this cuticle eraser, though, my fingers and cuticles look like I&#x27;ve just had a manicure.  A good hand moisturizer takes care of the rest of my hand, but my nails look so much better by including the CND Cuticle Eraser.  It has a weird scent, but it&#x27;s light enough that your moisturizer will cover it up.  Yay!  No more embarrassingly dry finger tips and cuticles!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. The texture is very soft and smooth. It has the perfect &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li> This performs as expected, breaking down dead cuticle skin to easily push back.  Has a slightly fruity smell.  Does not sting or irritate skin.</li>
            <li> Guess I was hoping that my cuticles would miraculously disintegrate in a safe way, of course. This product is like a moisturizer and it does that very well.</li>
