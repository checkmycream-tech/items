            <li>Being quite bald on top with plenty of hair on the sides, a comb is a tricky instrument.</li>
            <li>Kents come in many styles and shapes</li>
            <li>Many styles&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>A good length for a man, useful in the bath; not a pocket comb.</li>
            <li>When I first received this I wondered why it got great reviews as it did not seem much better than my cheap Ace.  </li>

            <li>great products, terrific seller to workmwith</li>
            <li>The resulting comb has a quality feel, pulls smoothly through your hair/beard, and the teeth feel comfortable rubbing against your scalp.</li>
            <li>How can you get excited about a comb?</li>
            <li>I like the width of the Ace better, but after two weeks this comb felt more natural and I now like it.  </li>

            <li>It does hold water perfectly, unlike the poor Ace.</li>
            <li>It glides right through my hair.</li>
            <li>Reluctantly I bought my first Kent comb over a year ago.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I was convinced.</li>
            <li>The teeth are not sharp and comfortable for me to use.  </li>
            <li>Heck it was 7 or 8 times as much money as the plastic combs</li>
            <li>The manufacturing process begins with a blank piece of high grade plastic from which craftsmen hand cut each comb with a saw, which is then polished to a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>This one was a little smaller than I expected, but works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced that these are better than your average comb.  </li>
            <li>In love the length of this Kent F3T comb (165mm/6.5inches) in comparison to the smaller Kent pocket combs sold on Amazon.com at about the same price.</li>
            <li>When I owned a high end drugstore we always carried The Kent Combs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This one is terrific, and well worth the money, as it never scratches.</li>
            <li>The teeth have to be at least a third to half an inch longer for this comb to be rated excellent.</li>
            <li>This comb is longer and made much the same way.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a cheap plastic comb that came with a set of clippers I bought years ago and it never occurred to me that I was missing out.</li>
            <li>The teeth are too short and the comb barely fits in my hand.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and sensitive scalp - lucky me.</li>

            <li> My second Kent comb.  I&#x27;m convinced that these are better than your average comb.  This one was a little smaller than I expected, but works great!</li>
            <li> Being quite bald on top with plenty of hair on the sides, a comb is a tricky instrument. This one is terrific, and well worth the money, as it never scratches.</li>
            <li> Reluctantly I bought my first Kent comb over a year ago. Heck it was 7 or 8 times as much money as the plastic combs I was getting from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I was convinced. No pulling or scratching like a cheap comb. It even felt good against the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience of this wonderful product was so intense that I have replaced every comb in the house with a Kent. I bought spares to put in my suitcase and car, one for the office. I even bought several for my mother as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plastic comb I am still using is my pocket comb. I tend to lose 4 or 5 of those every year so I will suffer with the drug store cheepy.</li>
            <li> A quality product. Enough said.</li>
            <li> When I first received this I wondered why it got great reviews as it did not seem much better than my cheap Ace.  I like the width of the Ace better, but after two weeks this comb felt more natural and I now like it.  It does hold water perfectly, unlike the poor Ace.</li>
            <li> Kent is well known for their top quality, smooth, well-finished combs. This one is no exception. Kents come in many styles and shapes so look around if you are not familiar with them or not sure which model you want..</li>
            <li> Great product and well made</li>
            <li> Great comb, completely awesome. It&#x27;s very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I owned a high end drugstore we always carried The Kent Combs. There is no comparison with any other brand. Many styles&lt;br /&gt;and sizes. You just can not imagine the difference. So buy them!</li>
            <li> The teeth are too short and the comb barely fits in my hand. The teeth have to be at least a third to half an inch longer for this comb to be rated excellent.</li>
            <li> This comb runs smoothly through my course beard without pulling on the hairs. I huge improvement over its nylon counterparts. The only thing that I would have preferred is a slightly closer bristle pattern.</li>
            <li> This is one nice comb.  It is the perfect comb for the bathroom countertop.  Nice size, well made, and works better than other combs.</li>
            <li> How can you get excited about a comb? Try using a good one after years of cheap ones. No comparison.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and sensitive scalp - lucky me. Most combs scratch and are uncomfortable to use. I bought this comb to replace one I lost but worked perfectly for me.  This comb is longer and made much the same way.  The teeth are not sharp and comfortable for me to use.  The reason I didn&#x27;t rate this comb higher is because the teeth are a little short and the length makes it a little awkward for me to use.  However, the quality of the comb is wonderful.  It in no way feels like a cheep, plastic comb.&lt;br /&gt;If you would like a good quality comb and would like shorter teeth, then this could be the comb for you!</li>
            <li> I bought a Kent comb for myself and now have started buying them for family members.  Once I got these I ditched all my cheap combs.  These feel great in your hand and on your head. Well crafted items.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great combs.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great comb - never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Who knew a comb could make such a difference? I love this thing. It glides right through my hair. I had been using a cheap plastic comb that came with a set of clippers I bought years ago and it never occurred to me that I was missing out.</li>
            <li> great products, terrific seller to workmwith</li>
            <li> A wonderful, old-fashioned comb with uniformly spaced and sized teeth. A good length for a man, useful in the bath; not a pocket comb. Rinsing regularly maintains both its shape and sanitation. This is the third Kent comb I&#x27;ve purchased. I would heartily recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Unlike virtually all other combs, which are molded from plastic, Kent combs are handmade. The manufacturing process begins with a blank piece of high grade plastic from which craftsmen hand cut each comb with a saw, which is then polished to a smooth finish. The resulting comb has a quality feel, pulls smoothly through your hair/beard, and the teeth feel comfortable rubbing against your scalp. In love the length of this Kent F3T comb (165mm/6.5inches) in comparison to the smaller Kent pocket combs sold on Amazon.com at about the same price. The company (G B Kent &amp; Sons Ltd) has been manufacturers of brushes since the eighteenth century and is one of the oldest established companies in Great Britain. It has royal warrants as &amp;#34;Best British Brushes&amp;#34; from every British monarch going back to George III. Considering its quality and heritage, this comb is an exceptional value. Treat yourself to the best!</li>
            <li> It is very well made and does a marvelous job. Makes an extremely neat part. Goes easy on my thinning locks.</li>
